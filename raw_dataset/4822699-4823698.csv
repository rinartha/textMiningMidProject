https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822705,'Godfather of Taiwan independence' Koo Kwang-ming dies at 96,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Koo Kwang-min (辜寬敏) was born into a powerful business family and worked tirelessly on the cause that would become his life’s passion, Taiwan independence.He passed away at 8:55 a.m. on Monday (Feb. 27), a day before Taiwan commemorates the 228 Massacre, a historical event where Taiwanese rose up and challenged the authoritarian Kuomintang (KMT) regime. Fearing reprisal for his involvement in the protest, Koo would later spend two decades of his life living in exile in Japan.While living abroad, Koo never wavered in his support of self-determination and sovereignty for Taiwan. His views often put him at odds with the government, as he was finally allowed to return to Taiwan in 1975, after receiving assurances from the government that his political actions would not lead to punishment.One of the first politicians to comment on Koo's passing was Taiwan Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德), who took to his Facebook page to express his condolences. Lai said Koo was a passionate supporter of Taiwan throughout his life, and also a dedicated humanitarian.Lai noted that Koo had set up an emergency relief account in his hometown of Lukang to promote various social causes and provide assistance to the poor. Koo would also return annually to visit the economically disadvantaged and the infirm, giving them comfort during difficult times.Lai said Koo even donated a parcel of land in Lukang to Taipower last year to support renewable energy. This showed that his love for Taiwan was always rooted in his hometown, though his philanthropic efforts would often lead him much further afield.Praising Koo's dedication to Taiwan, Lai said the former statesman should serve as a model and an inspiration for the younger generation of Taiwanese seeking to enter politics. Concluding his Facebook post, Lai said: ""Please rest in peace, Mr. Koo. Taiwan will be in good hands as we continue to protect Taiwan's democracy, peace, and prosperity.""Koo’s US$1 million (NT$28.5 million) donation to Ukrainian refugees in March 2022 drew praise from the public and local media. In an FTV interview Koo said,“whether it’s a donation of NT$1,000 or my donation of US$1 million to Ukraine, it all comes from the same place in the heart.“Koo went on to explain in the interview: “When Japan entered World War II, I was a student in Taiwan, and I was recruited as a soldier. So, the sadness and cruelty of war is something I have experienced firsthand.”Born in 1926, Koo was the youngest son of Koo Hsien-rong (辜顯榮), a powerful businessman during the Japanese colonial era. His father kept five wives, and his elder half-brother, Koo Chen-fu (辜振甫), would also become an influential politician, though occasionally they would find themselves on different sides of Taiwan’s political divide.As news of Koo's passing was reported in the media today, there was an outpouring of affection for the elderly statesman and pioneer of Taiwan's independence movement, as few will forget his lasting legacy.",2023/02/27,1949,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822715,"New Zealand wins Los Angeles 7s title, extends series lead","CARSON, California (AP) — Brady Rush scored with seconds remaining to seal New Zealand’s 22-12 victory over Argentina in the Los Angeles Sevens final on Sunday, avenging an upset loss on home soil a month ago. 

            The New Zealanders led 17-0 at halftime after a pair of tries from Leroy Carter following the long-range opener from Moses Leo, who sprinted almost the length of the field down the left wing.

            But Argentina hit back with tries to Tobias Wade and Agustin Fraga to narrow the margin to five points and again threatened a comeback win. 











            The New Zealanders had squandered a 12-point lead to lose the final to Argentina at Hamilton last month but held firm this time to close it out and complete back-to-back titles on the World Sevens Series circuit after winning in Sydney last month.

            The Kiwis have 107 points after six of 11 tournaments. Argentina moved into second spot on 86, equal with South Africa, while Olympic champion Fiji moved into fourth spot on 84 points with a 21-19 bronze-medal win over Australia.

            All Blacks Sevens captain Sam Dickson said he hoped his team had given the people at home a little boost after Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand earlier this month, killing 11 people and causing billions of dollars in damage to homes and infrastructure.

            “A shout out to the people back home doing it tough. We’re thinking of you,” he said. “Hopefully you enjoyed that and it put a smile on your dial for a little bit.”

            It was an unusual final in Los Angeles, featuring two teams which had lost in the group stage. Argentina lost the tournament-opening game 7-5 to Britain and the New Zealanders lost 14-7 to Samoa to finish second in their group.

            But New Zealand rebounded strongly in the knockout stages, beating Britain 24-12 in the quarterfinals and Australia 33-17 in the semifinals, while Argentina had a 19-12 win over Samoa in the quarterfinals before edging Fiji 20-17 to reach the deciding match.

            The first half of the final was lopsided, with Leo scoring from deep in his own quarter in the 4th minute and Carter outpacing the cover defense with a simple move from a scrum in the 6th minute. Carter crossed again on the right side two minutes later to finish off a counterattack that started from inside New Zealand's own in-goal area with Argentina pressing for a try just before halftime.

            At 17-12 and about a minute remaining, the New Zealanders opted for a midfield scrum after Argentina's kick restart didn't go the required distance, and maintained possession as they steadily worked up field, spreading the ball from one edge to the other. Rush picked up a loose pass, threw a dummy inside ball before rounding the defense in a 30-meter run to clinch the win.

            The series moves to Vancouver next weekend with men's and women's tournaments.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822750,"Thompson, Warriors' supporting cast hold off Timberwolves","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — So close to a playoff spot in the clogged-up Western Conference standings, this win meant so much for coach Steve Kerr’s undermanned Golden State Warriors — for many reasons.

            The defending NBA champions were down three starters once again, and old stand-by Klay Thompson and newcomer Donte DiVincenzo delivered on both ends when it mattered most.

            Thompson scored 32 points, including a key 3-pointer with 2:05 to play, and the Warriors held off the Minnesota Timberwolves 109-104 on Sunday in a matchup of teams fighting neck-and-neck for postseason positioning.











            “This is a huge win not only for the standings but for the confidence of the guys,” Kerr said. “That was a team win. Everybody came in there and competed and played well.""

            DiVincenzo put Golden State ahead for good on a 3 with 3:02 left and finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists. He also won a jump ball in the final minute.

            Naz Reid scored a career-high 30 points and added nine rebounds for Minnesota, but the Timberwolves have lost three straight and four of five.

            Kevon Looney grabbed 17 rebounds and has 13 or more in six consecutive games. He finished with 12 points, and his career-best sixth game in a row with double-digit boards was much-needed for a depleted Warriors team. 

            “I think it has a huge impact,"" Looney said. ""I think last year that was one of our biggest strengths, especially in the playoffs, our rebounding.”

            Nickeil Alexander-Walker's 3-pointer just before the third-quarter buzzer put Minnesota ahead 87-78 going into the final 12 minutes before the Warriors rallied behind Thompson. He overcame a slow start to shine late, following up his 42-point gem Friday night in which he matched a season high with 12 3-pointers. 

            Thompson missed five of his first six from deep Sunday. But with injured Splash Brother Stephen Curry cheering from the bench, Thompson's 3 with 6:11 left got Golden State within 96-92 and then he followed it with a baseline jumper under pressure.

            The Warriors were missing Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins again.

            DiVincenzo said the team found “heart"" down the stretch.

            “It's huge for your confidence,” DiVincenzo said. “So when those big dogs come back we're clicking in the second unit.”

            Green had a setback with his troublesome right knee and is scheduled for additional tests.

            “It flared up today, so he will be more thoroughly checked out today by our medical staff,"" Kerr said before the game. ""So it was sort of unexpected the way he came through treatment yesterday and everything was looking good, and he had to step back today."" 

            Golden State has won 12 straight in the series at home but shot 9 for 24 in the first quarter, 1 of 6 by Jordan Poole. The Warriors were 6 of 20 from deep in the first half but grabbed a 59-57 advantage at the break.

            BIG HITTERS 

            Retired baseball sluggers Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez — a T-Wolves owner — sat together courtside opposite Minnesota's bench.

            LOONEY ON THE GLASS

            Looney has 24 games with double-digit rebounds, most for Golden State since Green had 37 in 2015-16. The last Warriors player with 13 or more rebounds in six straight games was Andris Biedrins from Dec. 28, 2008, to Jan. 7, 2009.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — So close to a playoff spot in the clogged-up Western Conference standings, this win meant so much for coach Steve Kerr’s undermanned Golden State Warriors — for many reasons.The defending NBA champions were down three starters once again, and old stand-by Klay Thompson and newcomer Donte DiVincenzo delivered on both ends when it mattered most.Thompson scored 32 points, including a key 3-pointer with 2:05 to play, and the Warriors held off the Minnesota Timberwolves 109-104 on Sunday in a matchup of teams fighting neck-and-neck for postseason positioning.“This is a huge win not only for the standings but for the confidence of the guys,” Kerr said. “That was a team win. Everybody came in there and competed and played well.""DiVincenzo put Golden State ahead for good on a 3 with 3:02 left and finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists. He also won a jump ball in the final minute.Naz Reid scored a career-high 30 points and added nine rebounds for Minnesota, but the Timberwolves have lost three straight and four of five.Kevon Looney grabbed 17 rebounds and has 13 or more in six consecutive games. He finished with 12 points, and his career-best sixth game in a row with double-digit boards was much-needed for a depleted Warriors team.“I think it has a huge impact,"" Looney said. ""I think last year that was one of our biggest strengths, especially in the playoffs, our rebounding.”Nickeil Alexander-Walker's 3-pointer just before the third-quarter buzzer put Minnesota ahead 87-78 going into the final 12 minutes before the Warriors rallied behind Thompson. He overcame a slow start to shine late, following up his 42-point gem Friday night in which he matched a season high with 12 3-pointers.Thompson missed five of his first six from deep Sunday. But with injured Splash Brother Stephen Curry cheering from the bench, Thompson's 3 with 6:11 left got Golden State within 96-92 and then he followed it with a baseline jumper under pressure.The Warriors were missing Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins again.DiVincenzo said the team found “heart"" down the stretch.“It's huge for your confidence,” DiVincenzo said. “So when those big dogs come back we're clicking in the second unit.”Green had a setback with his troublesome right knee and is scheduled for additional tests.“It flared up today, so he will be more thoroughly checked out today by our medical staff,"" Kerr said before the game. ""So it was sort of unexpected the way he came through treatment yesterday and everything was looking good, and he had to step back today.""Golden State has won 12 straight in the series at home but shot 9 for 24 in the first quarter, 1 of 6 by Jordan Poole. The Warriors were 6 of 20 from deep in the first half but grabbed a 59-57 advantage at the break.BIG HITTERSRetired baseball sluggers Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez — a T-Wolves owner — sat together courtside opposite Minnesota's bench.LOONEY ON THE GLASSLooney has 24 games with double-digit rebounds, most for Golden State since Green had 37 in 2015-16. The last Warriors player with 13 or more rebounds in six straight games was Andris Biedrins from Dec. 28, 2008, to Jan. 7, 2009.“We’ve just come to expect it now.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822751,Jordan Morris scores twice as Sounders topple Rapids 4-0,"SEATTLE (AP) — The disappointment of a quick exit from the FIFA Club World Cup didn't linger into the start of the MLS season for the Seattle Sounders. 

            Jordan Morris scored a pair of goals via header, Cristian Roldan also scored on a header and the Sounders overwhelmed the Colorado Rapids in a dominating 4-0 win Sunday night in the season opener for both teams. 

            “You guys saw tonight what the team is capable of,” Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer said. “I thought it was great. I thought it was awesome. I thought the guys were sharp and that they were mentally into the game. Starting at 3:30 p.m. when they walked in the locker room, everybody was real focused. And so they answered my questions.” 











            Roldan scored in the 25th minute by finishing off a chance that started with a cross by Morris. In the final moments of the first half, Morris got his first of the season with a diving header after an initial pass by Nicolás Lodeiro was bundled in front of goal. 

            New striker Héber scored in his Seattle debut early in the second half, and Morris scored his second in the 83rd minute after a corner kick pinballed around the penalty area. 

            It was the first multi-goal game for Morris since Aug. 30, 2020, against LAFC. 

            “I think we had to get fit quicker than some of the other teams with obviously the Club World Cup, so I think that helped us,” Morris said. “But we’ve been working on things that we showed on the field today for a long time, and to see it in action and to see it work like that was just a testament to all the hard work that everyone’s put in during the during the preseason.”

            Seattle’s convincing opening victory was a strong statement after the Sounders missed the MLS playoffs for the first time in franchise history last season. The Sounders finished 11th in the Western Conference last year, one spot behind the equally disappointing Rapids, who tumbled to 10th after winning the Western Conference regular-season title in 2021. 

            Seattle’s MLS debut for 2023 came less than a month after the Sounders had a disappointingly brief appearance at the Club World Cup. The first team from MLS to participate in the event, the Sounders lost to Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly 1-0 in the quarterfinal round and ended up playing only one match in Morocco. 

            But the time preparing for the Club World Cup appeared to pay off as Seattle was significantly sharper and more dangerous around goal against the Rapids. 

            “We didn’t like what happened last year. We didn’t like what happened in Morocco,"" Schmetzer said. “And we are now motivated to try and replicate this type of performance and replicate it a bunch of times throughout the early part of the season to see if we can’t make a strong run and get the season really started on a good note.”

            Colorado’s best scoring chances came from promising 18-year-old striker Darren Yapi making his MLS debut. Yapi hit the crossbar from 18 yards out in the second minute and had another good chance at goal saved by Seattle’s Stefan Frei midway through the second half. But Colorado’s overhauled defense remained leaky. The Rapids gave up 57 goals last season and Seattle could have started the season with a few more if not for some key saves by goalkeeper William Yarbrough. 

            The opener also saw the MLS return for Seattle midfielder Joao Paulo after missing most of last season with a torn ACL in his right knee. Paulo played 80 minutes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822753,OnePlus Announces a Technical Partnership with Perfect World Games about Ray Tracing on Mobile,"Ray tracing enabled Tower of Fantasy can be experienced on the OnePlus 11 5G at MWC 2023

BARCELONA, SPAIN -  Media OutReach - 27 February 2023 - Global leading technology company OnePlus today announces a technical partnership with Perfect World Games on ray tracing technology. Both parties work closely to bring the ray tracing technology to Tower of Fantasy in-game play on the OnePlus 11 5G.            ""We're extremely thrilled to cooperate with Perfect World Games to showcase this industry-leading technology that shapes the future of mobile gaming experience on the OnePlus 11 5G"", said Kinder Liu, OnePlus COO and Head of R&D. ""OnePlus is dedicated to providing the most immersive game experience to our users and today we take this experience to a new level"".   ""We're excited to cooperate with OnePlus to apply this advanced technology that previously only be seen on PCs in mobile phone,"" said Dan Xu at Perfect World Games. ""As a leading game developer, our mission is to bring the best experience to gamers, and ray tracing technology will dramatically transform the in-game experience"".   Ray Tracing on Mobile Gaming   Ray tracing is a technology that enables dynamic in-game lighting, reflections, cross-physics illuminations and shadows, allowing for extreme environmental realism when gaming. The newly launched OnePlus 11 5G is equipped with Snapdragon® 8 Gen 2 mobile platform that supports hardware accelerated ray tracing technology, which provides the opportunity for OnePlus to work with Perfect World Games to fully explore the potential of ray tracing on mobile.   Ray Tracing in Open World MMORPG on Mobile   Compared to traditional MMORPG games, incorporating ray tracing in open-world games has significant technical challenges, especially on mobile platform. Perfect World Games developed techniques such as a distance-based dynamic object frame-updating mechanism and range-based ray tracing culling based on light source perspective, which enables players to experience real-time stable frames while enjoying ray tracing effects. Additionally, for the open-world scenes in Tower of Fantasy, the ray tracing acceleration structures are further optimized through employing small object culling and view frustum culling based on camera frustum solid angle. By accurately simulating the propagation and interaction of light rays, players can immerse themselves in the Vera desert and experience the more realistic effect of flames from the surroundings and the hot sand underfoot.   Normally, open world MMORPG game experience is more immersive than traditional MMORPG game due to more realism detailed objects, and this experience is further elevated by ray tracing technology. Occlusion and shadows in open world scenes are accurately calculated to precisely illuminate and shade the objects of all sizes and scales in Tower of Fantasy. This is totally different with traditional rendering methods which often miss intricate details in scenes, leading to inaccurate or missing occlusion and shadows. For instance, by calculating the occlusion effect of the scene under a uniform intensity of light, ray tracing on Tower of Fantasy enhances and improves the contrast between light and dark in the visuals, achieving more realistic shadows and ultimately adding a stronger sense of spatial depth and realism to the game's environments.   The introduction of mobile ray tracing technology also enables more accurate capturing of shadows and occlusion effects of objects in the distance and behind other objects, resulting in better visual performance compared to traditional rendering techniques.   Moreover, with mobile ray tracing enabled, the game improves the effect of simulating the absorption of physically accurate light as it passes through and reflects off water surfaces. Difficulty here is that light is comprised of various wavelengths of light waves, and when these light waves enter the water, they are absorbed differently.   Ray Tracing on the OnePlus 11 5G   The objective for this partnership is to improve the visual and performance experience on mobile device. To improve the graphics quality, engineers from OnePlus and Perfect World Games co-developed the Real-time Inline Ray Tracing Pipeline and a novel Fast Temporal Convergence Algorithm for Ambient Occlusion, specifically tailored to meet the demands of ""Tower of Fantasy"" by utilizing a forward rendering pipeline.   To cope with the demanding graphics computing power brought by ray tracing technology, the Spatiotemporal Oversampling is employed. Thanks to its over-the-top hardware specs including 16GB LPDDR5X RAM, 256GB ROM with UFS 4.0, and the new Cryo-velocity VC Cooling System, the OnePlus 11 5G can support the real-time rendering of mobile ray tracing on the graphics of Tower of Fantasy.   From February 27th to March 2nd, OnePlus will showcase ray tracing enabled Tower of Fantasy at Hall 3, 3M10 at MWC 2023.   Hashtag: #OnePlus

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822769,Archaeologist kidnapped in PNG to return to Australia,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — After spending a week held hostage by an armed group demanding a ransom in Papua New Guinea’s remote Highlands region, an archaeologist is expected to return to Australia soon.

            On Monday, police and soldiers were hunting the group of around 20 gunmen who on Sunday released New Zealand citizen Bryce Barker, a professor at Australia’s University of Southern Queensland, and Papua New Guinea nationals Jemina Haro and Teppsy Beni.

            The three were taken captive Feb. 19 while conducting fieldwork at Mount Bosavi in the wilds of the South Pacific island nation. A fourth hostage had already been released.











            Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong tweeted Sunday that the former hostages “will soon be reunited with their families.”

            The three were flown to Papua New Guinea’s capital Port Moresby where they were welcomed by the nation’s Prime Minister James Marape.

            “It was a random, opportunistic crime that took place, but something that I condemned in the various strongest terms possible,” Marape told reporters.

            He said the three hostages were secured “through covert operations” without paying the 3.5 million Papua New Guinea kina ($993,000) ransom. However, media reports say a significantly smaller ransom had been paid. 

            Kidnap for ransom is an uncommon crime in Papua New Guinea, a tribal society of 9 million people who are mostly subsistence farmers.

            Marape said police remained determined to catch the perpetrators.

            “Let me tell all the criminals: Police firepower is always higher than criminal firepower. I will not tolerate this sort of nonsense anymore,” Marape told reporters, adding that police and soldiers remained at the crime scene.

            USQ Vice-Chancellor Geraldine Mackenzie said Sunday the university was relieved to hear their much-loved colleague and his research team had been released.

            “Bryce is a highly regarded archaeologist and a valued colleague at the University of Southern Queensland and in the wider archaeological community. He has many years experience in undertaking research in PNG,” Mackenzie said. “Our deepest thanks go to the governments of Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand, and the many people who worked tirelessly during this extremely difficult and sensitive time to secure their release.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822770,Nemechek wins delayed NASCAR Xfinity race at Fontana,"FONTANA, Calif. (AP) — John Hunter Nemechek held off Sam Mayer and earned his third career Xfinity Series victory in a rare Sunday night race on the final NASCAR weekend at Auto Club Speedway's famed two-mile track.

            Nemechek reclaimed the lead shortly after a restart with 12 laps to go and held on in his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota despite overheating on the final lap. The son of veteran racer Joe Nemechek won on the Xfinity circuit for the first time since Texas in late 2021.

            Nemechek is off to an outstanding start in his new full-time Xfinity seat for JGR, finishing second last week at Daytona.











            “I feel like this is one of the best opportunities that I’ve had in my lifetime,” Nemechek said. “Everything is going according to plan. ... I’m proud to be a part of this Joe Gibbs organization. Second and then first. Let’s keep it going.”

            Nemechek led 49 of the 150 laps and finished strong in a Fontana race delayed for more than 24 hours after persistent rains and snow flurries during an unusual Southern California storm forced it out of its regular Saturday start time. The race began about 45 minutes after Kyle Busch claimed his fifth career victory at Fontana in the Cup Series event.

            Because of the Xfinity delay, Nemechek has the technical distinction of being the final driver to win a stock car race on the two-mile track at Auto Club Speedway. NASCAR plans to tear up the beloved asphalt east of Los Angeles soon, with vague plans to build a short-track course on the site in the next two years — although NASCAR reportedly has also sold most of the land around the facility.

            “It’s cool to be the final winner here,” Nemechek said. “It means a lot. Maybe when they tear this place up, they’ll send me a piece of asphalt, just for the memory.""

            Justin Allgaier came in third behind Mayer, who flipped over onto his roof last week at Daytona after attempting a bold move to win in overtime with a pass on Allgaier. The 19-year-old Mayer finished 0.761 seconds behind Nemechek in his JR Motorsports Chevrolet at Fontana.

            “We threw the kitchen sink at it, and we ended up second,” Mayer said. “All things considered, I’m really happy and proud.”

            Nemechek couldn't celebrate with a burnout, both because of the water spewing from his overheating engine and because the Xfinity teams must use the same engines and cars at Las Vegas next weekend.

            “We had trash on the grill there for a while,” Nemechek said. “Hopefully it didn’t hurt the motor too bad. But the car is in one piece, and it’s fast.”

            Nemechek will need all the car he can get next week — and all the truck, too. He'll race in both the Xfinity Series and the Truck Series against Busch, his boss and mentor for the previous two Truck seasons.

            “What’s cool is he drove for my dad when he was about my age back in the day,” Nemechek said. “I don’t know if there’s a rivalry there or not, but I definitely want to go and try to win both races next week, and I know he’s in both races. I think it comes down to team, truck and execution.”

            Cole Custer won the first two stages in his Stewart-Haas Racing Ford while bidding for two straight wins at Fontana and three in his career on his hometown track, but he went into the wall with a right front flat early in the final stage. Custer, who finished 27th, grew up in Ladera Ranch, an upscale planned community in Orange County roughly 50 miles south of Auto Club Speedway.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822779,5 die in SW China mine as hope fades for 47 trapped in north,"BEIJING (AP) — At least five workers were killed in a roof collapse at a mine in southwestern China, as hope appeared to be fading for 47 miners trapped under tons of rubble after a mining disaster last week in northern China.

            Deadly mine disasters occur regularly in China, although authorities have reduced their toll greatly by emphasizing safety and closing smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment.

            In the mine in Sichuan province, 25 miners were underground when part of the roof collapsed Sunday morning. Five were killed, three were badly injured and the others escaped, the provincial Department of Emergency Management said. Reports said the mine did not produce coal, but gave no details.











            Meanwhile, rescue efforts were continuing at the open-pit mine in the Inner Mongolian region’s Alxa League. The death toll remains six with six others pulled from the rubble alive. The cause for the collapse of a mine wall six days ago is under investigation and an unknown number of people have been detained. 

            Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for an “all-out” search-and-rescue effort and local authorities have ordered inspections and safety improvements at other mines in Inner Mongolia that produce much of the coal, metals and rare earths the Chinese economy depends on. 

            Calls to the Ministry of Emergency Management rang unanswered on Monday. The last official report on the rescue effort Saturday said two corridors had been cleared to bring in more equipment and ground-penetrating radar had also been deployed.

            Previously, more than 1,000 rescuers were sent to the scene, using heavy machinery, along with life-detection equipment and rescue dogs.

            Hours after the initial cave-in, another landslide halted rescue efforts for several hours during the crucial period for rescuing survivors. Since then, crews were carefully excavating by layers to avoid causing more landslides.BEIJING (AP) — At least five workers were killed in a roof collapse at a mine in southwestern China, as hope appeared to be fading for 47 miners trapped under tons of rubble after a mining disaster last week in northern China.Deadly mine disasters occur regularly in China, although authorities have reduced their toll greatly by emphasizing safety and closing smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment.In the mine in Sichuan province, 25 miners were underground when part of the roof collapsed Sunday morning.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822780,"Blazers' Lillard has 71 pts and 13 3s, then gets drug tested","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — The celebration surrounding Damian Lillard’s record-breaking performance was short-lived. 

            Lillard set franchise and career marks with 71 points — tied for the most in the NBA this season — and 13 3-pointers in the Portland Trail Blazers' 131 -114 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night. 

            “I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” Lillard said, “when I’m in attack mode.” 











            But soon after the streamers fell to the court and the crowd headed for the exits, Lillard was summoned for a drug test. Turns out, the seven-time All-Star who's unafraid of taking a 3-pointer from half court is afraid of needles. 

            “I know I’ve got a lot of tattoos, but when you’re doing a blood draw, it’s different from tattoos. It brought me down from here to the floor,” Lillard said gesturing with his hand raised then dropping it. 

            And Lillard got tested on the night he tied Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell for the most points in a game this season after Mitchell also scored 71 in a win over Chicago on Jan. 2. His 13 3-pointers were also one shy of the NBA record set by Golden State’s Klay Thompson in 2018. Thompson’s Warriors teammate Stephen Curry (2016) and Chicago’s Zach LaVine (2019) also made 13 3s. 

            Lillard broke his own franchise mark of 61 points, which he’d done twice, on a 3-pointer with 4:42 left that also topped his previous career record for 3s, which was 11.

            Known for his humility, Lillard was unsure how to mark the occasion. 

            “I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,” Lillard said. ""But it's the stuff afterward that I struggle with, like when I walked off the court, was I supposed to be overly excited, or what?” 

            In the final minutes of the game, the crowd at the Moda Center was on its feet, phones recording the moment, while chanting “MVP! MVP!"" 

            “It really, really was a masterful performance,” Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

            Even Mitchell took notice. 

            “My mom calls me and says @Dame_Lillard tied your record … you gotta get 72 now,” Mitchell posted on Twitter with some laughing emojis.

            Lillard left the game with 44 seconds left, tied with Mitchell, Elgin Baylor (1960) and David Robinson (1994) for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history. Wilt Chamberlain owns the league record with 100 for Philadelphia against New York on March 2, 1962, at Hershey, Pennsylvania.

            Lillard had 41 points and eight 3-pointers by halftime. It was a career high in a half for Lillard and the most points in a half for any player in the league this season. He had 50 by the start of the fourth quarter. 

            In the end, he made 22 of 38 shots from the floor and he hit on 13 of his 22 3-point attempts. He was also 14 of 14 from the foul line. 

            Jerami Grant added 13 points for the Blazers, who led by as many as 23. Portland is part of a cluster of eight Western Conference just four wins apart that are vying for playoff spots. 

            Alperen Sengun had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Rockets, sitting in last place in the Western Conference with just 13 overall wins and nine straight losses. 

            “It's not like we didn't give effort, he made some really tough shots,” said Rockets coach Stephen Silas, who sat Sengun midway through the third quarter for the rest of the game. “But we need everyone to give effort on the defensive end.”

            Houston trailed 102-88 heading into the final quarter, but scored the first six points of the period to close the gap to 102-94. Grant’s 3-pointer for Portland extended the margin to 108-98. 

            Lillard’s 3, his 11th of the night to tie his career high, made it 113-103 with 6:43 left. He added a driving layup and a free throw. Houston could not catch up. 

            Lillard started after resting for Thursday night’s 133-116 loss to Sacramento. He participated in the NBA All-Star Game and won the 3-point contest the previous weekend.

            The Blazers led 73-58 at the break with Lillard the 10th player since the 1996-97 season with 40-plus points in a half. He has 15 games with 50 or more points, sixth-most in NBA history.

            Guards Jalen Green and Kevin Porter Jr. did not play, although Silas said both should be available for the team’s short upcoming homestand. Green missed his second game with a strained left groin. Porter has been out 19 games because of a left foot contusion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822781,Lightning add grit in acquiring Jeannot from Predators,"The slumping Tampa Bay Lightning added an element of grit into their lineup to punch up their late-season playoff push by acquiring forward Tanner Jeannot in a trade with the Nashville Predators on Sunday night.

            And the Lightning paid a high price in doing so by trading away third-year defenseman Cal Foote, as well as five draft picks, including a 2025 first-round selection that is top-10 protected. Tampa Bay also traded its second-round pick in the 2024 draft, as well as its third- fourth- and fifth-round selections this year.

            The trade was completed shortly after the Lightning fell to 2-2-2 in their past six following a 7-3 loss at Pittsburgh, and comes less than a week before the NHL’s trade deadline on Friday.











            Listed at 6-foot-2 and 208 pounds, Jeannot is completing the third and final year of his rookie contract and eligible to become a restricted free agent this summer. After scoring 24 goals and 41 points in 81 games last season, Jeannot’s production has dropped this season. He’s been limited to five goals and 14 points in 56 games.

            Signed by Nashville as an undrafted free agent, the 25-year-old is better known for his hard-hitting style and defensive play. He leads the Predators with 213 hits and the team’s forwards with 51 blocked shots this season.

            Overall, he has 34 goals and 62 points with 217 penalty minutes in 152 career games.

            The Lightning maintain a strong hold on third place in the Atlantic Division, and are likely to open the playoffs facing Toronto in a rematch of last year’s first-round playoff series, which Tampa Bay won in seven games. The Lightning, who have reached the Stanley Cup Final in each of the past three seasons and won in both 2020 and '21, trail Toronto by four points in the race to determine which team will have home-ice advantage to start the postseason.

            The Predators continue their sell-off of talent with the trade coming a day after dealing forward Nino Niederreiter to Winnipeg in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2024 draft. 

            Nashville is retooling for the future while still in the fringes of the Western Conference race — sitting in 10th place, and six points out of a playoff spot. The Predators traded Jeannot after improving to 4-1 in their past five following a 6-2 win at Arizona. 

            The trade also comes with a looming change in management set for June, with Barry Trotz rejoining the franchise to succeed general manager David Poile, who has held the job since the team was founded in 1998.

            In a separate move, Nashville gave up future considerations to acquire minor-league forward Isaac Ratcliffe in a trade with the Philadelphia Flyers. A second-round pick in the 2017 draft, Ratcliffe has a goal and three assists in 10 career games with the Flyers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822796,Jones hires ex-NRL star Hodgson as Australia's defense coach,"SYDNEY (AP) — Eddie Jones has appointed ex-NRL star Brett Hodgson as defense coach on a two-year deal as he starts building Australia’s management structure ahead of the Rugby World Cup.

            Rugby Australia announced the appointment Monday, the first since Jones returned as Wallabies head coach last month at the expense of Dave Rennie.

            Hodgson worked briefly as defense coach in England last year before Jones was fired as head coach. He played more than 350 games at the highest level of rugby league in Australia and England, including winning an NRL premiership with Wests Tigers in 2005 and representing New South Wales in the annual State of Origin series against Queensland.











            He moved into coaching in England and worked in both rugby codes before linking up with Jones.

            “I’m really excited to be back in Australia and working with the Wallabies, especially in a World Cup year.” Hodgson said. “There’s plenty of hard work ahead and I’m looking forward to hitting the ground running and making a positive contribution to the team.”

            Jones is still yet to announce his forwards and attack coaches.

            “Brett’s a hard-working and detailed young coach who will be a great asset to the Wallabies and the coaching staff,” Jones said. ""He’s worked under some great coaching mentors in his time as a player and a coach, so he’s well-schooled and I know he’ll give his best to the job of producing the best defense in the world.”

            The 63-year-old Jones coached the Wallabies to the 2003 World Cup final, which they lost to England, before being fired in 2005.

            He became England's head coach in the wake of the country's group-stage exit in the World Cup it hosted in 2015. He won the Six Nations three times with England and racked up 18 straight wins through his mostly successful tenure, which included multiple victories over the Wallabies and a run to the World Cup final in 2019.

            But he was fired in December after a poor recent run in England — six losses, one draw and five wins in 12 tests in 2022 — and moved back to Australia last month to replace Rennie, who led the Wallabies to wins in just five of 14 test matches last year.

            Jones will have only five test matches in charge before the Rugby World Cup kicks off in France in September.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822797,"Unknown in 2022, Alcaraz returns to Rio Open as a superstar","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — When Carlos Alcaraz arrived at the Rio Open tournament compound last year, no screaming fans were waiting, his rivals did not see him as one of the favorites, his Instagram profile was followed overwhelmingly by Spaniards and he was still troubled by typical teenage spots on his face. He was the No.29 in the rankings in a socially distanced world due to COVID-19.

            Fast-forward one year since he won his springboard title in Brazil. 

            The still baby-faced 19-year-old already knows what it is like to spend hours signing autographs and taking pictures, become the youngest men’s number one in history, count millions of social media followers, and lift the U.S Open trophy — his first major title. 











            Alcaraz lost Sunday's Rio final to Cameron Norrie in a match that turned in the Briton's favor when the Spaniard felt a right leg injury in the middle of the second set. Still, local fans continued on his side even as he received his runner-up trophy, chanting “Car-li-tos! Car-li-tos!”

            As dozens of excited girls and children loudly suggest wherever Alcaraz went in Rio, the life of the current No.2 changed dramatically since he won the title here in 2022 — the first ATP 500 trophy of his career, and a confidence booster towards another five tournament victories since.

            “I didn’t come here to watch tennis, to be honest. I came because of Carlitos,” said Cristiana Souza, a 17-year-old who goes with her family every year to Rio’s Jockey Club to watch the tournament. “I am just thrilled that someone my age can be this successful, humble. He spends time with his fans. I cheer more for him than any Brazilian player. And, obviously, he is so cute.”

            The Spanish player from countryside city of El Palmar, outside Murcia, has earned global acclaim in only one year, and that has come with some perks, according to tournament organizers.

            Alcaraz and his party of eight in Rio, including his father and brother, have a private van with security guards taking them around; a personal stretcher in his hotel room for massage; and full attention from organizers if any request arrives, though he hasn’t made many. None of that was within his reach when he arrived last year. 

            “Whenever he wants something, his team says he would like this or that. It is very gentle,” Rio Open director Luiz Carvalho told The Associated Press in his office. “It is nothing completely out of standard of other events. Some things he never asked for, but these are things we like to do because he has earned that treatment.”

            Alcaraz had one last-minute special request in Rio; go for a helicopter ride to see the Sugar Loaf mountain on Monday on arrival from his title-winning Argentina Open campaign. One year ago, he managed to visit the Christ Redeemer statue with little media attention. This time, Brazil’s main nightly news program, among others, was there to cover and hear from him.

            “Whenever I have a free day, I try to visit a place of the city,” Alcaraz told TV Globo’s Jornal Nacional. “It is so different from Spain. Seeing Rio from up here is wonderful. Rio will always be special for me.”

            The first time that Alcaraz played in Rio he was a little-known and skinny 16-year-old with a wild card and a promising ranking of 493, a shy teenager who shared his hotel room with older brother Alvaro. His first professional victory, which he also achieved in Brazil’s postcard city, came in the early hours of a rainy Tuesday, with no fans on the stands as he beat compatriot Albert Ramos-Vinolas.

            “I feel very thankful to this tournament for inviting me in 2020. The moments I had here helped me grow more quickly,” Alcaraz said in a press conference after Sunday's final. 

            Alcaraz’s arrival in Rio came through Albert Molina, the agent of fellow Spanish player David Ferrer. At the time, he still used his surname Garfia in posters.

            “I remember he used to walk around, watch other matches. He was skinny, arms like sticks,” said Maria Santos, who has worked at the tournament’s catering in recent years and seen many players close to her food stall, including Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem. 

            “Now Carlos rides in that cart, leaves the club fast. He comes out smelling this great. I think (he uses) an expensive cologne. He looks like a nice family kid. He is stronger, cares about his looks, but he remains somewhat accessible. I cheer for him 100 percent; will always do that.”

            Fandom grew for Alcaraz worldwide after he won the 2022 Rio Open against Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman with nearly 100 percent support of the local crowd. During that final, he already managed to display some of his deep-baseline forehands — some of the same he used months later to top Alexander Zverev, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic to win the Madrid Open.

            As some of tennis’ all-time greats retire or near their exit, Alcaraz says he is not thinking about becoming the sport’s next hero for now.

            “I don’t know whether I am ready or not (to become a star). I go to the tournaments to give people a nice vibe,” the Spaniard said in a press conference on Saturday after his semifinal win against Chile’s Nicolas Jarry. “People want to see joy, amazing shots. I don’t think about being the player that people want to see after the big three, I just want to be who I am and show my joy in the court.”

            Every player beaten by Alcaraz this year has praised him as the next big thing in tennis. Merely making Sunday’s final in Rio after a right leg injury had troubled him for four months also hinted at the Spaniard's resilience and strength of character.

            It's likely his efforts there will attract still more fans to a player who has in excess of 2 million followers on Instagram — 1.7 million more than before he won the 2022 edition of the tournament.

            “At age 16 he was still a junior looking for space. Now he owns the player’s lounge,” Rio Open’s director Carvalho said. “All players look at him differently (from last year). Now he belongs here.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822798,DeSantis moves toward GOP presidential bid on his own terms,"NEW YORK (AP) — Republican presidential contenders typically fight for prime speaking slots at the Conservative Political Action Conference. But as conservative activists gather in suburban Washington this week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will be courting donors more than a thousand miles away in Texas and California.

            The apparent CPAC snub is nothing new for DeSantis, who has emerged in the early phase of the 2024 presidential election as a leading contender for the GOP nomination even as he ignores many conventions of modern politics.

            DeSantis is a frequent voice in conservative cultural fights on cable television, but he often avoids gatherings of fellow Republican governors and party leaders, who are quick to complain in private about his go-it-alone approach. He is the only top-tier presidential prospect yet to court voters in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, the states hosting the GOP's opening presidential primary contests. And he is often at odds with the press, refusing even to notify local media of last week's rare three-state tour with law enforcement.











            Indeed, as DeSantis moves toward a White House run, it is becoming increasingly clear that the 44-year-old Republican governor will manage his presidential aspirations in his own way, on his own timeline, with or without allies in national GOP leadership or relationships with the press. 

            “DeSantis has, in his style and the actions he’s taken as governor, shown a willingness to fight the traditional powers that be, the establishment,” said David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, an influential conservative group based in Washington. McIntosh described DeSantis’ style as “refreshing"" and suggested the GOP is ready to move on from former President Donald Trump. 

            For now, DeSantis is perhaps the most potent threat to Trump's effort to win the GOP nomination for the third time. The Club for Growth will host DeSantis among a half-dozen presidential prospects at a closed-door retreat in Florida next weekend with top donors. Trump is not invited.

            Meanwhile, DeSantis has quietly begun to expand his political coalition on his terms just as he releases a book, “The Courage to be Free,” which comes out Tuesday.

            He spent the weekend huddled behind closed doors at a south Florida luxury hotel for a “Freedom Blueprint” retreat with more than 100 donors, elected officials and conservative influencers. The attendees included former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Texas-based donor Roy Bailey, a former member of Trump's national finance committee.

            Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee were also in attendance, along with Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Texas Rep. Chip Roy and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.

            Fox News host Laura Ingraham hosted a fireside chat with DeSantis on Sunday before he joined a “fighting back against woke” discussion with Chaya Raichik, who runs the “Libs of TikTok” social media account.

            Details from the gathering were disclosed by participants who requested anonymity to discuss the the private event.

            Trump was largely ignored throughout the weekend retreat, although conservative commentator Ann Coulter seized on his failure to build a wall spanning the entire U.S.-Mexico border during a Saturday panel discussion with DeSantis on border security, according to one person in the room. She accused the former president of never actually wanting to build it in the first place. 

            In the coming days and weeks, DeSantis will use the release of his book to introduce himself to voters beyond Florida, having established his political dominance there last fall by winning reelection by more than 19 percentage points.

            He is expected to make his first appearances in key states on the primary calendar such as Iowa and New Hampshire in the coming weeks in addition to general election battlegrounds like Georgia and Pennsylvania. Last week, he made surprise stops in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago to court law enforcement leaders, although the events were private and he did not notify local media.

            The Florida governor is already scheduled to headline two Republican fundraisers in Texas on Saturday. The next day he’ll speak at a $500-a-head reception for the GOP of Orange County, California. He’ll serve as the keynote speaker for the Alabama GOP the following week. 

            While he has begun to expand his profile, DeSantis has done far less than most of the early 2024 class to connect with primary voters and would-be allies in key states. 

            He has long avoided gatherings of Republican governors or top GOP officials, who privately condemn his approach as arrogant. He's never set foot in Iowa.

            Former New Hampshire GOP chair Jennifer Horn noted that Republican primary voters often embrace anti-establishment candidates “who are willing to create their own lane or take their own path.”

            “But when you’re running for president, and in this environment, I think he has to be careful not to be a victim of his own arrogance,” she said. “He has this belief that he knows better than everyone about everything, and that’s never a good thing.” 

            Meanwhile, DeSantis' team feels no urgency to enter the 2024 contest, which already features three Republican candidates. Trump announced three months ago. 

            He's also shown no interest in responding to Trump's increasingly personal attacks, which include recent social media posts suggesting that DeSantis behaved inappropriately with underage girls when he briefly taught high school in his early 20s.

            Trump refers to the Florida governor as Ron DeSanctimonious"" and “Meatball Ron.” 

            By contrast, DeSantis in his new book actually credits Trump for helping him win the Florida governorship in 2018.

            “I knew that a Trump endorsement would provide me with the exposure to GOP primary voters across the State of Florida, and I was confident that many would see me as a good candidate once they learned about my record,” DeSantis writes, according to an early copy obtained by the Guardian.

            Trump's increasing focus on DeSantis may unintentionally help the Florida governor by defining him as the strongest Republican Trump alternative, according to Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide turned critic.

            “Look, Donald is worried, and if I was working for him, I’d say he needs to update the playbook,” Nunberg said. 

            In the meantime, DeSantis is focused on expanding his conservative agenda in Florida's looming state legislative session, which runs from March through May. 

            Already, he has pushed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs from Florida’s public universities and colleges. Among his other priorities: allowing people to carry guns in public without a permit; weakening laws protecting journalists from lawsuits; and cracking down on illegal immigration, including a plan to eliminate in-state tuition for college students in the country illegally.

            In a nod to his political strength, DeSantis is under attack from a growing group of Republican rivals. 

            New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu publicly condemned DeSantis' decision to use the levers of government to punish private businesses like Disney that push back against his policy priorities. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's team has criticized DeSantis' record on abortion as insufficiently conservative. 

            DeSantis did himself no favors inside the Republican National Committee last month when he publicly sided with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel's challenger during her bitter reelection fight. McDaniel easily won reelection to her post.

            “We are going to move forward. And that’s what I’m focused on,” McDaniel said Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union"" when asked about her relationship with DeSantis. “The one thing Republicans can do to make sure we don’t win is fight each other all the time.”

            This story has been corrected to show Noem is governor of South Dakota, not North Dakota.NEW YORK (AP) — Republican presidential contenders typically fight for prime speaking slots at the Conservative Political Action Conference. But as conservative activists gather in suburban Washington this week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will be courting donors more than a thousand miles away in Texas and California.The apparent CPAC snub is nothing new for DeSantis, who has emerged in the early phase of the 2024 presidential election as a leading contender for the GOP nomination even as he ignores many conventions of modern politics.DeSantis is a frequent voice in conservative cultural fights on cable television, but he often avoids gatherings of fellow Republican governors and party leaders, who are quick to complain in private about his go-it-alone approach. He is the only top-tier presidential prospect yet to court voters in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, the states hosting the GOP's opening presidential primary contests. And he is often at odds with the press, refusing even to notify local media of last week's rare three-state tour with law enforcement.Indeed, as DeSantis moves toward a White House run, it is becoming increasingly clear that the 44-year-old Republican governor will manage his presidential aspirations in his own way, on his own timeline, with or without allies in national GOP leadership or relationships with the press.“DeSantis has, in his style and the actions he’s taken as governor, shown a willingness to fight the traditional powers that be, the establishment,” said David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, an influential conservative group based in Washington. McIntosh described DeSantis’ style as “refreshing"" and suggested the GOP is ready to move on from former President Donald Trump.For now, DeSantis is perhaps the most potent threat to Trump's effort to win the GOP nomination for the third time. The Club for Growth will host DeSantis among a half-dozen presidential prospects at a closed-door retreat in Florida next weekend with top donors. Trump is not invited.Meanwhile, DeSantis has quietly begun to expand his political coalition on his terms just as he releases a book, “The Courage to be Free,” which comes out Tuesday.He spent the weekend huddled behind closed doors at a south Florida luxury hotel for a “Freedom Blueprint” retreat with more than 100 donors, elected officials and conservative influencers. The attendees included former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Texas-based donor Roy Bailey, a former member of Trump's national finance committee.Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee were also in attendance, along with Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Texas Rep. Chip Roy and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.Fox News host Laura Ingraham hosted a fireside chat with DeSantis on Sunday before he joined a “fighting back against woke” discussion with Chaya Raichik, who runs the “Libs of TikTok” social media account.Details from the gathering were disclosed by participants who requested anonymity to discuss the the private event.Trump was largely ignored throughout the weekend retreat, although conservative commentator Ann Coulter seized on his failure to build a wall spanning the entire U.S.-Mexico border during a Saturday panel discussion with DeSantis on border security, according to one person in the room. She accused the former president of never actually wanting to build it in the first place.In the coming days and weeks, DeSantis will use the release of his book to introduce himself to voters beyond Florida, having established his political dominance there last fall by winning reelection by more than 19 percentage points.He is expected to make his first appearances in key states on the primary calendar such as Iowa and New Hampshire in the coming weeks in addition to general election battlegrounds like Georgia and Pennsylvania. Last week, he made surprise stops in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago to court law enforcement leaders, although the events were private and he did not notify local media.The Florida governor is already scheduled to headline two Republican fundraisers in Texas on Saturday. The next day he’ll speak at a $500-a-head reception for the GOP of Orange County, California. He’ll serve as the keynote speaker for the Alabama GOP the following week.While he has begun to expand his profile, DeSantis has done far less than most of the early 2024 class to connect with primary voters and would-be allies in key states.He has long avoided gatherings of Republican governors or top GOP officials, who privately condemn his approach as arrogant. He's never set foot in Iowa.Former New Hampshire GOP chair Jennifer Horn noted that Republican primary voters often embrace anti-establishment candidates “who are willing to create their own lane or take their own path.”“But when you’re running for president, and in this environment, I think he has to be careful not to be a victim of his own arrogance,” she said. “He has this belief that he knows better than everyone about everything, and that’s never a good thing.”Meanwhile, DeSantis' team feels no urgency to enter the 2024 contest, which already features three Republican candidates. Trump announced three months ago.He's also shown no interest in responding to Trump's increasingly personal attacks, which include recent social media posts suggesting that DeSantis behaved inappropriately with underage girls when he briefly taught high school in his early 20s.Trump refers to the Florida governor as Ron DeSanctimonious"" and “Meatball Ron.”By contrast, DeSantis in his new book actually credits Trump for helping him win the Florida governorship in 2018.“I knew that a Trump endorsement would provide me with the exposure to GOP primary voters across the State of Florida, and I was confident that many would see me as a good candidate once they learned about my record,” DeSantis writes, according to an early copy obtained by the Guardian.Trump's increasing focus on DeSantis may unintentionally help the Florida governor by defining him as the strongest Republican Trump alternative, according to Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide turned critic.“Look, Donald is worried, and if I was working for him, I’d say he needs to update the playbook,” Nunberg said.In the meantime, DeSantis is focused on expanding his conservative agenda in Florida's looming state legislative session, which runs from March through May.Already, he has pushed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs from Florida’s public universities and colleges. Among his other priorities: allowing people to carry guns in public without a permit; weakening laws protecting journalists from lawsuits; and cracking down on illegal immigration, including a plan to eliminate in-state tuition for college students in the country illegally.In a nod to his political strength, DeSantis is under attack from a growing group of Republican rivals.New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu publicly condemned DeSantis' decision to use the levers of government to punish private businesses like Disney that push back against his policy priorities. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's team has criticized DeSantis' record on abortion as insufficiently conservative.DeSantis did himself no favors inside the Republican National Committee last month when he publicly sided with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel's challenger during her bitter reelection fight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822799,Macao eases COVID mask mandate as virus situation stabilizes,"HONG KONG (AP) — Macao, the world’s biggest gambling hub, has eased its requirements for people to wear masks after mandating them for most of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

            Starting Monday, people no longer have to wear masks when outdoors, the statement by authorities in the Chinese territory said. They’ll still be required in places like elderly care homes and hospitals and on public transit, but indoor venues such as casinos have the discretion to decide themselves whether to require masks. 

            The statement said the policy was eased because the virus situation in Macao “has continuously remained stable for the past two months.”











            In neighboring Hong Kong, authorities last week extended its mandate until March 8 to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses in cold weather, although they have signaled they may ease the requirements soon.

            Both territories had followed China’s “zero-COVID” strategy using travel restrictions and quarantines to try to stamp out the virus for much of the pandemic. The strategy was abandoned late last year as more virulent viral strains spread.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822800,‘A time bomb’: India’s sinking holy town faces grim future,"JOSHIMATH, India (AP) — Inside a shrine overlooking snow-capped mountains, Hindu priests heaped spoonfuls of puffed rice and ghee into a crackling fire. They closed their eyes and chanted in Sanskrit, hoping their prayers would somehow turn back time and save their holy — and sinking — town.

            For months, the roughly 20,000 residents in Joshimath, burrowed in the Himalayas and revered by Hindu and Sikh pilgrims, have watched the earth slowly swallow their community. They pleaded for help that never arrived, and in January their desperate plight made it into the international spotlight. 

            But by then, Joshimath was already a disaster zone. Multistoried hotels slumped to one side; cracked roads gaped open. More than 860 homes were uninhabitable, splayed by deep fissures that snaked through ceilings, floors and walls. And instead of saviors they got bulldozers that razed whole lopsided swaths of the town.











            The holy town was built on piles of debris left behind by years of landslides and earthquakes. Scientists have warned for decades, including in a 1976 report, that Joshimath could not withstand the level of heavy construction that has recently been taking place.

            “Cracks are widening every day and people are in fear. We have been saying for years this is not just a disaster, but a disaster in the making… it’s a time bomb,” said Atul Sati, an activist with the Save Joshimath Committee.

            Joshimath's future is at risk, experts and activists say, due in part to a push backed by the prime minister’s political party to grow religious tourism in Uttarakhand, the holy town's home state. On top of climate change, extensive new construction to accommodate more tourists and accelerate hydropower projects in the region is exacerbating subsidence — the sinking of land. 

            Located 1,890 meters (6,200 feet) above sea level, Joshimath is said to have special spiritual powers and believed to be where Hindu guru Adi Shankaracharya found enlightenment in the 8th century before going on to establish four monasteries across India, including one in Joshimath. 

            Visitors pass through the town on their way to the famous Sikh shrine, Hemkund Sahib, and the Hindu temple, Badrinath.

            “It must be protected,” said Brahmachari Mukundanand, a local priest who called Joshimath the “brain of North India” and explained that “Our body can still function if some limbs are cut off. But if anything happens to our brain, we can’t function. … Its survival is extremely important.”

            The town’s loose topsoil and soft rocks can only support so much and that limit, according to environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, may have already been breached.

            “You can’t just construct anything anywhere just because it is allowed,” he said. “In the short term, you might think it’s development. But in the long term, it is actually devastation.”

            At least 240 families have been forced to relocate without knowing if they would be able to return.

            Prabha Sati, who fled Joshimath in a panic last month when her home began to crack and tilt, came back to grab the television, idols of Hindu gods and some shoes before state officials demolished her home. 

            “We built this house with so much difficulty. Now I will have to leave everything behind. Every small piece of it will be destroyed,” she said, blinking back tears. 

            Authorities, ignoring expert warnings, have continued to move forward with costly projects in the region, including a slew of hydropower stations and a lengthy highway. The latter is aimed at further boosting religious tourism, a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. 

            In 2021, Modi promised a prosperous decade ahead for Uttarakhand. It is dotted with several holy shrines and improving the state’s infrastructure has already led to a steady rise in pilgrims over the decades. Nearly 500,000 passed through Joshimath in 2019, state data shows. 

            “In the next 10 years, the state will receive more tourists than it did in the last 100 years,” Modi said.

            A big Uttarakhand tourism draw is the Char Dham pilgrimage, one of the toughest in India. 

            The route takes people to four, high-altitude Hindu temples. Pilgrims traverse challenging terrain, dropping oxygen levels and harsh weather between Badrinath, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Yamunotri temples. In 2022, over 200 out of the 250,000 pilgrims died while making the journey. Authorities said the rise in visitors was straining existing infrastructure.

            Already underway, the Char Dham infrastructure project, aims to make the journey more accessible via a 10-meter (32-foot) wide and 889-kilometer (552 miles) long all-weather highway as well as a 327-kilometer (203-mile) railway line that would crisscross through the mountains.

            It is a controversial project with some experts saying it will exacerbate the fragile situation in the upper Himalayas where several towns are built atop landslide debris.

            Veteran environmentalist Ravi Chopra called the project a desecration when he resigned from a court-ordered committee studying its impact. To create such wide roads, engineers would need to smash boulders, cut trees and strip shrubbery, which he said will weaken slopes and make them “more susceptible to natural disasters.” 

            Urban planning expert Kiran Shinde suggested a pedestrian corridor instead, noting these places were never meant for cars nor crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands. 

            “The highway is the most disastrous thing to happen to the Char Dham,” said Shinde, a professor at Australia’s La Trobe University who has written on religious tourism. “Let people walk.” 

            Cracks continue to form. Located near a rail line construction site, Sangeeta Krishali’s home in Lachmoli, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Joshimath, has them. She fears for her safety: “It happened there, it can happen here, too.""

            In Joshimath’s foothills, construction was paused on a road for the Char Dham project that would ferry tourists faster to the Badrinath temple after cracks emerged in people’s homes.

            Locals feared it was too late. A long, jagged crack running across one of the front walls in the famed Adi Shankaracharya monastery had deepened worryingly in recent weeks, said Vishnu Priyanand, one of the priests. 

            “Let places of worship remain as places of worship. Don’t make them tourist spots,” he pleaded. 

            It’s not just the highways. For the past 17 years, Atul Sati, the Save Joshimath Committee member, has been convinced that a hydropower station located near his town could one day ruin it. He isn’t alone. In late January, hundreds of residents protested against the National Thermal Power Corporation’s Tapovan project. Posters reading ‘Go back NTPC’ are plastered across the town’s main market. 

            “Our town is on the verge of destruction because of this project,” Sati said. 

            Locals say construction blasts for a 12-kilometer (7-mile) tunnel for the station are causing their homes to crumble. Work has been suspended but NTPC officials deny any link to Joshimath’s subsidence. An expert committee is still investigating the cause, but state officials earlier blamed faulty drainage systems.

            The state government announced interim relief packages, including compensation worth 150,000 rupees ($1,813) to each affected family, said Himanshu Khurana, the officer in charge of Chamoli district where Joshimath is located. Various government agencies were conducting surveys to determine what caused the damage, he added.

            The crisis in Joshimath has reignited questions over whether India’s quest for more hydropower in the mountains to cut its reliance on coal can be achieved sustainably. Uttarakhand, home to more than 30 rivers and surrounded by melting glaciers, has around 100 hydropower projects in varying stages. 

            In 2021, 200 people died after the Tapovan plant near Joshimath was submerged by severe floods caused in part by fast shrinking glaciers, and over 6,000 were killed in the state after a devastating cloudburst in 2013. 

            The heavy construction required for hydropower, like blasting boulders, diverting river flows and cutting through forests, in a region already vulnerable to climate change, could do irreparable damage, experts warn. 

            It could also displace entire villages, as residents of a hamlet near Joshimath found out. 

            Haat, a village along the Alaknanda River, was once a sacred hamlet that traced its origins to the guru Adi Shankaracharya, who is said to have established another temple here in the 8th Century. 

            Today, it is a dumping site for waste and a storage pit for construction materials after the village was acquired in 2009 by an energy enterprise to build a hydropower project. 

            The Laxmi Narayan temple, encircled by grey stacks of cement, is the only part of the village still standing. All of its residents left over the years as authorities began razing down their homes, said Rajendra Hatwal, once the village chief who now lives in another town nearby. 

            The project, he fumed, had killed Haat. 

            “What sort of development requires destroying these priceless places? We don’t want any part of it.”

            A court last year directed authorities to stop dumping waste near the historic temple, which was once the last rest stop for devotees on their pilgrimage to Badrinath. 

            Hatwal and a few others still check in on the temple often. A caretaker, who refused to leave, lives in a makeshift room next to it. He sweeps the grounds, cleans the idols and prepares tea for the odd guest who comes through. 

            They feared its days, like their homes, were also numbered. 

            “We are fighting to protect the temple. We want to preserve our ancient culture to pass on to a new generation,” said Hatwal. “They have not only destroyed a village - they have finished a 1,200 year old culture.”

The e-celeb was reportedly selling generic fiber tablets online, while promoting the products as an effective weight-loss tool, reported LTN.Lin is now under investigation and if found guilty may be fined between NT$40,000 (US$1,300) and NT$4 million (US$130,000) for false advertising.Lin and her agent were reportedly selling the fiber tablets on the Shopee platform at prices between NT$740 (US$25) and NT$1,480 (US$50) per box. After receiving the supplements, several customers noticed that the pills were not properly labeled as a health food supplement.Food products that are sold as health food supplements in Taiwan are packaged with a green label, known as the “Little Green Man,” which identifies them as certified health food products.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822825,Stocks rally on Wall Street following last week’s rout,"NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are rallying Monday, clawing back some of their losses from Wall Street’s worst week since early December.

            The S&P 500 was 1% higher in morning trading and on pace for just its second gain in the last seven days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 320 points, or 1%, at 33,137, as of 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.2% higher.

            Stocks have struggled in February after a strong start to the year as reports have shown inflation and much of the overall economy are staying more resilient than expected. While the strong economic data calms fears that a recession may be imminent, it also has forced Wall Street to raise its forecasts for how high the Federal Reserve will take interest rates and how long it will keep them there.











            High rates can drive down inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession in the future because they slow the economy. They also hurt prices for stocks and other investments. 

            The heightened expectations for higher rates have been most evident in the bond market, where yields have shot higher in recent weeks. On Monday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury slunk back a bit, which eased some of the pressure on stocks.

            The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 3.92% from 3.95% late Friday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans. 

            The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, ticked up to 4.82% from 4.81%. It’s near its highest level since 2007. 

            Yields eased after a report showed that orders for machinery, aircraft and other long-lasting manufactured goods fell by more than economists expected in January. 

            Economists have been expecting more softness in the economy after the Fed jacked up rates last year at the fastest pace in decades. The Fed’s key overnight rate is now in a range of 4.50% to 4.75%, up from virtually zero at the start of last year. 

            But reports on everything from the job market to retail sales to inflation itself have been coming in firmer than expected over the last few weeks. The fear is that if the economy stays on strong footing, it could feed into more upward pressure on inflation. That’s why expectations on Wall Street have swung so hard, from earlier thinking the Fed could soon take it easier on interest rates to now believing it could raise them above 5.25%. 

            Even Monday’s weaker-than-expected report on durable goods had some underlying strength. After ignoring transportation-related equipment, orders jumped last month to the biggest gain since March. It was much stronger than the drop that economists expected to see.

            On Wall Street, shares of Union Pacific jumped 10.7% for one of the market's biggest gains after the railroad announced plans to replace its CEO later this year. The company has been under pressure from a hedge fund with a big ownership stake in it.

            Tech stocks were also helping to lead the way. They tend to be some of the biggest beneficiaries of easier interest rates, which help goose in particular stocks of high-growth companies. 

            Apple, Tesla and Microsoft were the three biggest forces pushing up the S&P 500. All rose at least 1.1%. 

            Energy company AES climbed 3.6% after reporting better earnings and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

            Most companies have already reported their results for the last three months of 2022, but a couple dozen companies in the S&P 500 are still scheduled to report this week.

            Many may offer a window into how well U.S. households are holding up amid higher interest rates and still-high inflation. Advance Auto Parts, Best Buy, Costco Wholesale, Kroger and Target are some of the companies on the schedule for this upcoming week. 

            Overall, this earnings reporting season has been lackluster. Companies in the S&P 500 are on track to report their first drop in earnings per share from a year earlier since the summer of 2020, when the pandemic was choking the economy. 

            Fewer companies than usual are also beating analysts’ expectations for profits, according to FactSet. 

            The worry is that an “earnings recession” may be coming, where profits for companies are set to drop from year-earlier levels for at least two straight quarters. Higher rates and other costs have been eating at companies’ profit margins, meaning they aren’t making as much profit off each $1 in sales as before.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822826,‘A time bomb’: India’s sinking holy town faces grim future,"JOSHIMATH, India (AP) — Inside a shrine overlooking snow-capped mountains, Hindu priests heaped spoonfuls of puffed rice and ghee into a crackling fire. They closed their eyes and chanted, hoping their prayers would somehow turn back time and save their holy — and sinking — town.

            For months, the roughly 20,000 residents in Joshimath, burrowed in the Himalayas and revered by Hindu and Sikh pilgrims, have watched the earth slowly swallow their community. They pleaded for help that never arrived, and in January their desperate plight made it into the international spotlight. 

            But by then, Joshimath was already a disaster zone. Multistoried hotels slumped to one side; cracked roads gaped open. More than 860 homes were uninhabitable, splayed by deep fissures. And instead of saviors they got bulldozers that razed swaths of the town.











            The holy town was built on piles of debris left behind by landslides and earthquakes. Scientists have warned for decades that Joshimath could not withstand the level of heavy construction that has recently been taking place.

            “Cracks are widening every day and people are in fear. … It’s a time bomb,” said Atul Sati, an activist with the Save Joshimath Committee.

            Joshimath’s future is at risk, experts and activists say, due in part to a push backed by the prime minister’s political party to grow religious tourism in Uttarakhand, the holy town's home state. On top of climate change, extensive new construction to accommodate more tourists and accelerate hydropower projects in the region is exacerbating subsidence — the sinking of land. 

            Joshimath is said to have special spiritual powers and believed to be where Hindu guru Adi Shankaracharya found enlightenment in the 8th century before going on to establish four monasteries across India, including one in Joshimath. 

            Visitors pass through the town on their way to the famous Sikh shrine, Hemkund Sahib, and the Hindu temple, Badrinath.

            “It must be protected,” said Brahmachari Mukundanand, a local priest who called Joshimath the “brain of North India” and explained that ""our body can still function if some limbs are cut off. But if anything happens to our brain, we can’t function. … Its survival is extremely important.""

            The town’s loose topsoil and soft rocks can only support so much and that limit, according to environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, may have already been breached.

            “In the short term, you might think it’s development. But in the long term, it is actually devastation,” he said. 

            At least 240 families have been forced to relocate without knowing if they would be able to return.

            Prabha Sati, who fled Joshimath last month when her home began to crack and tilt, came back to grab her belongings before state officials demolished her home. 

            “Now I will have to leave everything behind. Every small piece of it will be destroyed,” she said, blinking back tears. 

            Authorities, ignoring expert warnings, have continued to develop costly projects in the region, including a slew of hydropower stations and a lengthy highway. The latter is aimed at further boosting religious tourism, a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. 

            Uttarakhand, dotted with several holy shrines, would see a surge in tourists in the next decade thanks to improved infrastructure, Modi said in 2021. Nearly 500,000 passed through Joshimath in 2019, state data shows. 

            A big draw is the Char Dham pilgrimage where pilgrims traverse challenging terrain and harsh weather to reach four, high-altitude temples. In 2022, 200 out of the 250,000 pilgrims died while making the journey. Authorities said the rise in visitors was straining existing infrastructure.

            Already underway, the Char Dham infrastructure project, aims to make the journey more accessible via a long and wide all-weather highway and railway line that would crisscross through the mountains.

            Some experts fear the project will exacerbate the fragile situation in the Himalayas where several towns are built atop debris. 

            To create such wide roads, engineers would need to smash boulders, cut trees and strip shrubbery, which would weaken slopes and make them “more susceptible to natural disasters,” said veteran environmentalist Ravi Chopra. 

            While construction for the project near Joshimath was paused last month, locals feared it was too late. A long crack running across one of the front walls in the famed Adi Shankaracharya monastery had deepened worryingly in recent weeks, said Vishnu Priyanand, one of the priests. 

            “Let places of worship remain as places of worship. Don’t make them tourist spots,” he pleaded. 

            It’s not just the highways. 

            In late January, hundreds of residents protested against the National Thermal Power Corporation’s Tapovan hydropower station located near Joshimath. 

            “Our town is on the verge of destruction because of this project,” said Atul Sati, the Save Joshimath Committee member. 

            Locals say construction blasts for a 12-kilometer (7-mile) tunnel for the station are causing homes to crumble. Work has been suspended but NTPC officials deny any link to Joshimath’s subsidence. Various government agencies were conducting surveys to determine what caused the damage, said Himanshu Khurana, the officer in charge of Chamoli district where Joshimath is located. 

            The crisis has reignited questions over whether India’s quest for more hydropower in the mountains to cut its reliance on coal can be achieved sustainably. Uttarakhand has around 100 hydropower projects in varying stages. 

            The heavy construction required for hydropower could do irreparable damage in a region already vulnerable to climate change, experts warn. 

            It could also displace entire villages, as residents of a one near Joshimath found out. 

            Haat, along the Alaknanda River, was once a sacred hamlet where the guru Adi Shankaracharya is said to have established another temple in the 8th Century. 

            Today, it is a dumping site for waste and a storage pit for construction materials after the village was acquired in 2009 by an energy enterprise to build a hydropower project. 

            The Laxmi Narayan temple is the only part of the village still standing. All of its residents were relocated, said Rajendra Hatwal, once the village chief who now lives in another town. 

            Hatwal and a few others still check in on the temple. A caretaker, who refused to leave, lives in a makeshift room next to it. He sweeps the grounds, cleans the idols and prepares tea for the odd guest who comes through. 

            They feared its days were numbered. 

            “We are fighting to protect the temple. We want to preserve our ancient culture to pass on to a new generation,” said Hatwal. “They have not only destroyed a village - they have finished a 1,200 year old culture.”

Uttarakhand has around 100 hydropower projects in varying stages.The heavy construction required for hydropower could do irreparable damage in a region already vulnerable to climate change, experts warn.It could also displace entire villages, as residents of a one near Joshimath found out.Haat, along the Alaknanda River, was once a sacred hamlet where the guru Adi Shankaracharya is said to have established another temple in the 8th Century.Today, it is a dumping site for waste and a storage pit for construction materials after the village was acquired in 2009 by an energy enterprise to build a hydropower project.The Laxmi Narayan temple is the only part of the village still standing. All of its residents were relocated, said Rajendra Hatwal, once the village chief who now lives in another town.Hatwal and a few others still check in on the temple. A caretaker, who refused to leave, lives in a makeshift room next to it. He sweeps the grounds, cleans the idols and prepares tea for the odd guest who comes through.They feared its days were numbered.“We are fighting to protect the temple. We want to preserve our ancient culture to pass on to a new generation,” said Hatwal. “They have not only destroyed a village - they have finished a 1,200 year old culture.”___AP photojournalist Rajesh Kumar Singh contributed to this report.——Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822838,Helicopter rescues injured climber in Taiwan's Taitung County,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A climber in Taitung’s Haiduan Township suffered a knee injury requiring a two-day rescue effort, ultimately involving helicopter transport to a nearby hospital on Monday (Feb. 27).Taitung County Fire Department said it received a call from a climber in distress on Friday (Feb. 24), indicating a right knee rupture of a ligament associated with a fall in Haiduan Township, according to CNA. Additionally, the climber’s right thigh near the knee was injured and swollen, rendering the climber unable to walk or otherwise descend from the mountain.The fire department put together a four-member search and rescue team. The terrain in the area was very steep, and the climbing path was mostly steep and rocky.Rescue mounted for injured climber. (CNA photo)After two days of climbing, they found the injured hiker at 11 a.m. on Sunday (Feb. 26). First aid was provided. Also, a search for a suitable location for helicopter rescue was undertaken at the same time.A helicopter from the National Airborne Service Corps flew to the scene at 8:32 a.m. on Monday morning (Feb. 27), but the ridge was covered by clouds and visibility was not good. It took the helicopter crew around 30 minutes to get the climber up before he was transported to Mackay Memorial Hospital Taitung Branch for treatment.While the prognosis for the climber is promising, Taitung Fire Department has appealed to the public to hike with a companion and assess their physical condition before venturing into the mountains. Also, relevant supplies should be brought, such as water, food, mobile power supply, headlights, raincoats, and proper clothing.Additionally, detailed climbing and mountaineering plans should be left behind with friends and relatives. Having this information handy can be quickly integrated into an emergency search and rescue operation.",2023/02/27,557,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822860,Exploring the Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Art: An Analysis of AI Art and its Implications,"Art has been a part of human history for as long as we can trace it back. From ancient cave paintings to modern-day installations, art has evolved and adapted to reflect the times and the technology of the era. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), art is once again on the verge of a transformation. AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and appreciate art. In this article, we will explore the intersection of AI and art, and analyze the implications of AI art.AI Art: Definition and ExamplesAI art is a form of art created with the assistance of artificial intelligence. AI algorithms are used to create and manipulate images, sounds, and other media to produce art. AI algorithms can be programmed to generate art on their own or to assist human artists in the creation process.One example of AI art is “The Next Rembrandt,” a project that used machine learning algorithms to analyze Rembrandt’s work and create a new painting in his style. The resulting painting was so convincing that it was exhibited in a museum alongside Rembrandt’s original paintings. Another example is “AICAN,” an AI system that creates original paintings without any human intervention. AICAN was trained on a dataset of over 80,000 paintings from various periods and styles, and it uses this knowledge to create new and original pieces of art.Implications of AI ArtAI art has the potential to revolutionize the art world in many ways. Here are a few implications of AI art:ConclusionAI art is still in its infancy, but it has already shown great potential to change the art world in significant ways. As AI algorithms become more advanced, it is likely that we will see even more impressive and innovative works of AI art. However, it is important to recognize that AI art is not a replacement for human-created art. Rather, it is a new tool that can be used by artists to create new and exciting works of art. As we continue to explore the intersection of AI and art, we must also address the ethical concerns surrounding this technology. By doing so, we can ensure that AI art is used to enrich our artistic culture in a responsible and sustainable way.",2023/02/27,,

It is commonly used in baking and brewing applications as a leavening agent. Yeast is a single-celled microorganism that ferments carbohydrates, producing carbon dioxide gas that causes bread dough to rise and beer or wine to ferment. Dried yeast is typically produced by growing yeast cells in a nutrient-rich environment, and then dehydrating the cells using heat or other methods. This process helps to extend the shelf life of the yeast, making it easier to store and transport.Lessaffre Group

(AP) — Members of the American Indian Movement took over the town of Wounded Knee on Feb. 27, 1973, starting a 71-day occupation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The standoff with the U.S. government — which grew out of turmoil within the Oglala Sioux Tribe as well as a protest of the federal government’s treatment of Native Americans — became violent at times, and two Native American men were killed. The siege sowed divisions on the reservation, and also left a lasting impact on members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the future of Native American activism. On the 50th anniversary of the start of that occupation, The Associated Press is republishing a 1973 story by reporter Terry Devine.

            Please note the language used to describe members of the American Indian Movement. AP Style is to no longer use the term “Indian” as shorthand for Native American.

            WOUNDED KNEE

            By Terry Devine

            WOUNDED KNEE, S.D., FEB. 28 (AP) — Militant Indians who took over this small town continued to hold 11 hostages Wednesday after one exchange of gunfire and unsuccessful attempts at negotiations, authorities said.

            Gunshots were exchanged between the Indians and federal marshals earlier in the day, according to a Bureau of Indian Affairs official, but there were no reports of injuries. 

            An FBI spokesman said there were 11 hostages, ranging in age from 12 to 82. 

            John McCardy, an FBI agent at the scene, said attempts had been made to reach agreement on release of the hostages. However, he said, “At this time, there have been no meaningful negotiations.” 

            The Indians, who were demanding to see two U.S. senators concerning a list of demands, repeated earlier assurances that the hostages would not be harmed. 

            Spokesmen for the Indians also said a cease-fire had been arranged with the FBI. 

            Dick Wilson, president of the Oglala Sioux tribe that lives on the reservation, issued a statement accusing American Indian Movement members of “mob rule” and trying to “overthrow the tribal government.” 

            Wilson, 38, said the takeover of the historic community should be regarded as a criminal act and the demonstrating Indians should be “held responsible and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” 

            The brief flurry of shots had come when a car carrying several Indians from Wounded Knee stopped about half a mile from a roadblock set up by the marshals, the FBI spokesman said. 

            He said the Indians, whose leaders said they were well-armed, emerged from the car firing rifles at the officers, and the marshals returned fire. 

            Indian leaders said there was other gunfire when Indians warned off cards that came too close to the village. Federal officers at the scene refused to discuss the shots and say whether they were returned. Another FBI official said only the Indians fired. 

            Marshals had personnel vehicles equipped with machine guns transported to Pine Ridge, 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Wounded Knee, Wednesday, but the marshals declined to say if the vehicles would be taken to the site of the demonstration. 

            Spokesmen for the Indians said the occupying force had grown from 200 when the trouble started to 400 by Wednesday.

            The takeover of the community, site of a bloody battle between the U.S. Cavalry and Sioux in 1890, began at about 10 p.m. EST on Tuesday. By the middle of the afternoon Wednesday, an FBI spokesman in Washington said, “The Indians are in charge of the town, hostages are there, roadblocks are up, the demands are the same.” 

            Clyde Bellecourt, of Minneapolis, a leader of the American Indian Movement, said the exchange of gunfire occurred when Indians fired warning shots over cars that came within a quarter of a mile of the village of about 100. He said federal marshals returned the fire. 

            Carter Camp, of Ponca City, Oklahoma, a national coordinator of AIM, said warning shots were fired by Indians at a low-flying airplane, but claimed it was not hit. Camp said the cease-fire was agreed upon before 2 p.m. EST. 

            Camp said the hostages would not be hurt unless authorities — who had surrounded the village — came too close. 

            The Indians — including members of AIM and of the Oglala Sioux tribe — held nine members of one family and a Roman Catholic priest. They demanded that Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, of Massachusetts, and J.W. Fulbright, of Arkansas, both Democrats, come to the 2,500-square mile (6,475-square kilometers) Pine Ridge reservation to discuss the Indians' grievances. 

            The trouble allegedly started when the Indians broke into a trading post in the town 140 miles (225 kilometers) southeast of Rapid City and armed themselves with weapons and supplies. Their demands included an investigation of the dealings of the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs with the Oglala Sioux. They also sought an ouster of the current leaders, including Richard Wilson, tribal chairman, who has feuded with AIM members in the past. 

            Bellecourt and Russell Means, another AIM leader, said the Indians were well armed. “We have high-powered rifles, shotguns, explosives and 14 hand grenades,” Means said. 

            “The government has two choices: either they attack and wipe us out like they did in 1890, or they negotiate our reasonable demands.” 

            Wounded Knee, which is about 140 miles (225 kilometers) southeast of Rapid City, was the site of the last major confrontation between Indians and whites in the campaign to settle the West. More than 200 Indian women, children and old men were massacred on Dec. 29, 1890, by troops of the 7th Cavalry. That was the division led by Gen. George Custer that was annihilated four years before at the battle of the Little Big Horn in Montana. 

            Feb. 28, 1973WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. (AP) — Members of the American Indian Movement took over the town of Wounded Knee on Feb. 27, 1973, starting a 71-day occupation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The standoff with the U.S. government — which grew out of turmoil within the Oglala Sioux Tribe as well as a protest of the federal government’s treatment of Native Americans — became violent at times, and two Native American men were killed. The siege sowed divisions on the reservation, and also left a lasting impact on members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the future of Native American activism. On the 50th anniversary of the start of that occupation, The Associated Press is republishing a 1973 story by reporter Terry Devine.Please note the language used to describe members of the American Indian Movement. AP Style is to no longer use the term “Indian” as shorthand for Native American.____WOUNDED KNEEBy Terry DevineWOUNDED KNEE, S.D., FEB. 28 (AP) — Militant Indians who took over this small town continued to hold 11 hostages Wednesday after one exchange of gunfire and unsuccessful attempts at negotiations, authorities said.Gunshots were exchanged between the Indians and federal marshals earlier in the day, according to a Bureau of Indian Affairs official, but there were no reports of injuries.An FBI spokesman said there were 11 hostages, ranging in age from 12 to 82.John McCardy, an FBI agent at the scene, said attempts had been made to reach agreement on release of the hostages. However, he said, “At this time, there have been no meaningful negotiations.”The Indians, who were demanding to see two U.S. senators concerning a list of demands, repeated earlier assurances that the hostages would not be harmed.Spokesmen for the Indians also said a cease-fire had been arranged with the FBI.Dick Wilson, president of the Oglala Sioux tribe that lives on the reservation, issued a statement accusing American Indian Movement members of “mob rule” and trying to “overthrow the tribal government.”Wilson, 38, said the takeover of the historic community should be regarded as a criminal act and the demonstrating Indians should be “held responsible and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”The brief flurry of shots had come when a car carrying several Indians from Wounded Knee stopped about half a mile from a roadblock set up by the marshals, the FBI spokesman said.He said the Indians, whose leaders said they were well-armed, emerged from the car firing rifles at the officers, and the marshals returned fire.Indian leaders said there was other gunfire when Indians warned off cards that came too close to the village. Federal officers at the scene refused to discuss the shots and say whether they were returned. Another FBI official said only the Indians fired.Marshals had personnel vehicles equipped with machine guns transported to Pine Ridge, 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Wounded Knee, Wednesday, but the marshals declined to say if the vehicles would be taken to the site of the demonstration.Spokesmen for the Indians said the occupying force had grown from 200 when the trouble started to 400 by Wednesday.The takeover of the community, site of a bloody battle between the U.S. Cavalry and Sioux in 1890, began at about 10 p.m. EST on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822878,"Iraqi president says country now peaceful, life is returning","BAGHDAD (AP) — Nearly 20 years after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein by U.S.-led forces, Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid wants the world to know his country now is at peace, democratic and intent on rebuilding economic life while maintaining a government that serves the whole country and the region.

            Rashid told The Associated Press on Sunday that after overcoming the hardships of the past two decades, Iraq is ready to focus on improving everyday life for its people. Those hardships included years of resistance to foreign troops, violence between Sunnis and Shiites, and attacks by Islamic State group extremists who once controlled large areas, including Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul.

            “Peace and security is all over the country, and I would be very glad if you will report that and emphasize on that, instead of giving a picture of Iraq ... still (as) a war zone, which a lot of media still do,” Rashid said.











            While Iraq's major fighting has ended, there have been some recent outbreaks of violence — including on the day of Rashid's election, which came after a yearlong stalemate following the October 2021 election. Ahead of the vote, at least nine rockets targeted Iraq’s Parliament inside Baghdad's fortified Green Zone. 

            After Rashid's election, he nominated Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who formed a government with the backing of a coalition of Iran-backed parties and with promises of improving security and public services. 

            Despite its oil wealth, Iraq's infrastructure remains weak. Private generators fill in for the hours of daily state electricity cuts. Long-promised public transportation projects, including a Baghdad metro, have not come to fruition. 

            Rashid said this is due to damage as “a result of conflicts and as a result of terror, as a result of a number of years living at war.”

            Government critics say the sputtering electricity supply is also a result of endemic corruption, rooted in the country’s sectarian power-sharing system that allows political elites to use patronage networks to consolidate power.

            Rashid, who spoke at his presidential quarters in Saddam's former palace, also asserted that most Iraqis believe the 2003 invasion of Saddam-ruled Iraq by the United States and its allies was necessary because of the former dictator's brutality.

            He said he believes most Iraqis, “including all sections of the society, the Kurds, the Sunni, the Christian, the Shiites, they were all against"" Saddam and appreciate that the U.S. and its allies came to “save” Iraq.

            “Obviously certain things did not work out as we hoped. Nobody expected Daesh (the Islamic State group) and nobody expected car bombs,"" he said. ""It should have been controlled right from the beginning. It should have been studied and planned out right from the beginning. I think the myth was that once Saddam is removed, Iraq becomes heaven.”

            The reality proved more difficult, he said, but it hasn't weakened Iraq's commitment to democracy. 

             “Even if you have conflicts and if we have arguments, it’s much better to have a freedom and democracy rather than a dictatorship,” he said.

            However, mass anti-government demonstrations that kicked off in late 2019 were often put down by force. Hundreds of protesters were killed by security forces and state-backed armed groups.

            Rashid acknowledged there are still conflicts, but urged Iraqis, particularly the younger generation, to be patient and have faith in the future. “We don’t have much choice but to live together ... and let our democratic election take place to represent our values,"" said Rashid, a veteran Kurdish politician and former water minister after Saddam's ouster.

            Rashid assumed the presidency in October. Under Iraq's unofficial power-sharing arrangement, the country's president is always a Kurd, the prime minister a Shiite and the parliament speaker a Sunni. 

            Rashid's job entails helping to maintain a delicate balance among Iraq's various centers of political power and even-keel relations with both the U.S. and Iran, the government's two key — and often opposing — international backers.

            The balancing act is reflected in a monument near Baghdad airport. It extolls Iran’s Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani, who was targeted and killed in a 2020 U.S. airstrike. 

            Improving relations with neighbors including Iran, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Jordan is a source of strength for Iraq, Rashid said. Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia had for years kept a distance from Iraq, partly because of its ties to Iran. 

            He noted with pride that Iraq hosted a Mideast meeting of senior Arab lawmakers on Saturday and expressed the country's willingness to continue serving as a mediator in now-stalled talks between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. 

            Rashid also promised to take a hard line on corruption. 

            In October, reports emerged that over $2.5 billion in Iraqi government revenue was embezzled by a network of businesses and officials from the country’s tax authority. And in recent months, amid allegations of widespread money laundering used to smuggle dollars to U.S.-sanctioned Iran and Syria, the U.S. has taken measures to tighten Iraq's dollar supply, putting pressure on the currency.

             “I admit, we did have and we still have some problems with corruption, but the government is very serious (about fighting it),” Rashid said, adding that the government and the central bank are taking measures to regulate transfers out of the country to deter money laundering. 

            Economically, he said, Iraq is focusing on rebuilding industry and agriculture damaged by years of conflict, and developing its natural gas reserves so as not to be dependent on buying gas from neighboring countries — notably Iran. 

            Despite the currency's devaluation and inflation in recent months, Iraq's prospects are good, he said, buoyed by strong oil production and high global oil prices.

            “Iraq economically is in a sound position and probably is one of the countries in the world which (does not have) a deficit in our budget,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822879,Taliban raid kills 2 IS; embassy in Tehran changes control,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Taliban security forces killed two militants from the Islamic State group and detained a third in an overnight raid in the Afghan capital of Kabul, the spokesman for the Taliban government said Monday.

            The regional affiliate of the Islamic State group — known as the Islamic State in Khorasan Province — is a key rival of the Taliban. The militant group has increased its attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover of the country in August 2021. Targets have included Taliban patrols and members of Afghanistan’s Shiite minority.

            Separately, the Taliban gained control over the weekend of Afghanistan's Embassy in Iran, previously staffed with appointees of the U.S.-backed Afghan government, and on Monday appointed their own diplomats to the mission.











            According to Zabihullah Mujahid, the main Taliban government spokesman, the Kabul operation took place in a residential neighborhood, targeting IS militants who were planning to organize attacks in the Afghan capital. He said the Kher Khana neighborhood is an important IS hideout. 

            There was no immediate comment from the IS. 

            Mujahid said two IS members were killed and one was arrested, and ammunition and military equipment were seized in the raid. There were no casualties among the Taliban forces during in the operation, he added.

            In a separate operation this month, Taliban intelligence forces killed three IS militants and arrested one in an overnight operation in eastern part of Kabul, in Karti Naw neighborhood. The Taliban had claimed that IS was behind organized recent attacks in the capital.

            Overnight, posts on on social media reported several explosions and small-arms fire in the area of Kher Khana.

            The Taliban swept across the country in mid-August 2021, seizing power as U.S. and NATO forces were in the last weeks of their final withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years of war. The international community has not recognized the Taliban government, wary of the harsh measures they have imposed since their takeover, restricting rights and freedoms, especially for of women and minorities.

            Afghanistan’s economy has been sent into a tailspin since the takeover, with millions driven into poverty and hunger. Foreign aid stopped almost overnight. Sanctions on Taliban rulers, a halt on bank transfers and frozen billions in Afghanistan’s currency reserves abroad have already restricted access to global institutions and the outside money that supported the country’s aid-dependent economy before the U.S. and NATO pullout.

            In neighboring Iran on Sunday, authorities handed over control of Afghanistan’s Embassy in Tehran to envoys of the Taliban government. Previously, the embassy was staffed by the U.S.-backed Afghan government envoys. 

            The development was a win for the Taliban administration, which is expected to now fly the Taliban flag over the mission in the Iranian capital, not the Afghan flag.

            There was no official comment from Tehran on the transfer of authority and it was unclear if that constituted an official recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the Taliban call their administration.

            In Kabul, the Taliban Foreign Affairs Ministry in a statement said embassy “activities will continue in Tehran following the dispatching” of a new chargé d’affaires and diplomats from Afghanistan. The statement further stresses that changing mission diplomats abroad is the legitimate right of every country.

            “The new appointments,” it said, would ensure “transparency in the affairs of the embassy as well as expanded relations in various fields between the two Muslim and brotherly countries.”

            Zia Ahmad, Taliban-appointed deputy spokesman at the foreign ministry, said Monday that Fazel Mohammad Haqqani, was named the new chargé d’affaires in Iran. The spokesman described the new envoy — as an “experienced” diplomat.

            Ahmad said a seven-member team was sent to Tehran with Haqqani to provide services to Afghans in Iran.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822880,Memories of Wounded Knee reflect mixed legacy after 50 years,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Tensions that had been smoldering on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota flared up 50 years ago Monday, when activists from the American Indian Movement took over the town of Wounded Knee.

            In the view of the protesters, Oglala Sioux tribal chairman Dick Wilson was in cahoots with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other federal authorities, and used threats of violence to intimidate his critics. But the 71-day occupation quickly morphed into an outpouring of anger with the federal government over decades of broken treaties, the theft of ancestral lands, forced assimilation and other injustices dating back centuries.

            Two Native Americans died in the fighting, and a U.S. marshal was left paralyzed.











            Wounded Knee had already been seared into history as the site of an 1890 massacre by U.S. Army cavalry troops in one of the last major military operations against Native Americans on the northern plains. Accounts vary, but the massacre left around 300 Lakota dead — including children, women and older people. Congress apologized in 1990.

            Ahead of the 50th anniversary of the occupation, The Associated Press reached out to people who were at Wounded Knee or involved from a distance to hear their stories. 

            DWAIN CAMP

            Dwain Camp, a member of the Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma, was in California when his younger brother, Carter, called to say he and other leaders of the American Indian Movement took a group of activists into Wounded Knee.

            “He was telling me they were in a hell of a fight,” Camp, now 85, recalled. “I heard the gunfire and that was all I needed. I went up there and stayed for the duration of the standoff.”

            Their brother, Craig, a Vietnam veteran, also joined them. Camp said the rifles and shotguns the occupiers took from the trading post in town were no match for the weapons and armored vehicles the feds had.

            “We were going to make it very expensive should they go ahead and roll in,” Camp said. “It didn't come to that, thank goodness.”

            Camp remembers the occupation with pride as “a very vital time” that changed his life. He said he experienced “the freest feeling that I could ever imagine.” He met AIM leaders who became famous, including Dennis Banks,Clyde Bellecourt and Russell Means. It was also a spiritual awakening for many occupiers and visitors, he said, with sweat lodge ceremonies providing a chance for prayer and learning about their traditions.

            And it helped change the way Native Americans across the country saw themselves, Camp said.

            “The Native people of this land after Wounded Knee, they had like a surge of new pride in being Native people,” he said.

            Camp said the takeover was a catalyst for policy changes that had been “unimaginable"" before, including the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, the Indian Child Welfare Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, to name a few. And it provided a focus for his own activism.

            “After we left Wounded Knee, it became paramount that protecting Mother Earth was our foremost issue,"" he said. ""Since that period of time, we've learned that we've got to teach our kids our true history.”

            Camp sees the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline — which drew thousands of Indigenous people and supporters to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017 — as a continuation of the resurgence fueled by Wounded Knee. 

            “We're not the subjugated and disenfranchised people that we were,"" he said. ""Wounded Knee was an important beginning of that. And because we're a resilient people, it's something we take a lot of pride in.” 

            Camp said he wished he could return to Pine Ridge for the 50th anniversary observances, but traveling isn't easy at his age. Instead, he plans to get together with his surviving brother, Craig, who lives near him in Ponca. They'll burn some of the sacred sage that family members bring back every year from South Dakota.

            —-

            JIM HUGGINS

            FBI Special Agent Jim Huggins was on the other side of the roadblocks. He was one of several agents from the Denver FBI office who went to Wounded Knee to back up their colleagues.

            ""It was a dangerous situation,” recalled Huggins, 83, who's retired and lives in Frankfort, Kentucky. “The people that took over the town of Wounded Knee were a group of militants, mostly out of Minneapolis. ... They were dedicated members of the American Indian Movement and were very anti-FBI.”

            Huggins said there was often an exchange of gunfire between the two sides.

            “Every time you were out on the roadblocks, you could anticipate a shot coming your way,” he said. “You could hear them whizz by pretty close sometimes. ... It seemed like every night just after sunset a few shots would ring our in our direction.”

            Unlike Camp, Huggins doesn't think much good came out of the occupation.

            “I think it was totally unnecessary on their part,” he said. “I base that on interviewing several Native Americans who lived for years on the reservation. They were totally against the takeover.”

            And Huggins believes the ongoing tensions between AIM and authorities led to the killings of two FBI agents in a shootout on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation two years later, one of whom was a good friend of his. AIM activist Leonard Peltier maintains he was wrongly convicted in their deaths, but successive presidents have denied requests for clemency.

            PHIL HOGEN

            Phil Hogen was chief of staff to new U.S. Rep. James Abdnor, whose district included the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, when the occupation began just a few weeks after they moved to Washington.

            “We were sort of on the front page of the Washington Post for 71 days while this was going on,” Hogen recalled. He said Abdnor “did not look kindly on that disruption. He was all for resolving differences.” But he said they worked hard to try to find a resolution, consulting with the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs.

            Hogen, 77, who lives off the reservation in Black Hawk, South Dakota, now has mixed, but mostly negative, views on the occupation.

            “It was regrettable in many respects,” he said. “That is, the disruption of government, the confrontation, the loss of lives. I don’t know that all of those wounds have yet healed. But at the end of the day there was a greater awareness of American Indian/Native American concerns and injustices they had been exposed to.”

            As a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Hogen said he could identify with some of their concerns.

            “But it didn’t start out from my perspective as a national confrontation, rather a national confrontation looking for a place to happen,"" he said. Tribal leader Wilson “sometimes ruled with an iron hand, but sometimes on Pine Ridge that was necessary.”

            Hogen went on to serve as U.S. attorney for South Dakota under President Ronald Reagan.

            If any lasting good came out of the occupation of Wounded Knee, Hogen said, it was that it ""reminded the whole country about what a tragedy the original massacre was, and how those concerns or wounds were probably never appropriately addressed. It probably steered some resources toward solving some of those problems. ... But it left a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of people, so it cut both ways.""

            Hogen said it’s also unfortunate that relatively little has been done with the massacre site, which was mostly private land until last fall.

            “It’s the site of a national tragedy, and its regrettable that it isn’t better memorialized there than it is,” he said.

            JIM MONE

            Jim Mone had been a photographer with The Associated Press in Minneapolis for about 3 1/2 months when he was sent to cover the takeover. He packed a couple hundred pounds of equipment — including photo transmitters, a complete darkroom and a bulk pack of black-and-white film — and got on a flight to Rapid City, South Dakota.

            The closest available motel room was in the town of Martin, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Wounded Knee. He set up his darkroom in the bathroom and mixed his chemicals. His editor soon arrived and said, “Let's go to Wounded Knee.”

            But that wasn't easy. The FBI and AIM had erected roadblocks. So they took backroads to get as close as they could, ditching their car about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away, and started walking. Soon they came upon surprised AIM members who let them keep going.

            “They were courteous enough to tell us how much farther we had to go,” said Mone, 79, of of the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington.

            Entering Wounded Knee, they saw a ransacked church where activists and journalists had gathered — and men with rifles. But Mone said he developed good relations with AIM leaders in the seven weeks he was there.

            “They knew they needed the media, so I don't think any media people got hurt,"" he said. ""You could get inches away from them, and photograph them. They treated us quite well and respectfully.”

            The most worrying moments, he said, included firefights when he could see tracer bullets overhead, and a when a jet buzzed the town just a few hundred feet overhead.

            To get an edge on his competition, Mone said, he practically crawled into a packed tipi where AIM activists and federal authorities smoked a peace pipe to mark the deal to end the occupation. He developed his film using equipment in his trunk before driving back to his motel, where he used a bulky transmitter connected to his room phone to send in the key picture, which Mone said was used by The New York Times the next day.

            Mone said the atmosphere as the deal was signed was courteous, tense and businesslike all at once, and he believed that the fact the final negotiations were conducted in a tipi was ""a sign of respect to the Native Americans.”MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Tensions that had been smoldering on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota flared up 50 years ago Monday, when activists from the American Indian Movement took over the town of Wounded Knee.In the view of the protesters, Oglala Sioux tribal chairman Dick Wilson was in cahoots with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other federal authorities, and used threats of violence to intimidate his critics. But the 71-day occupation quickly morphed into an outpouring of anger with the federal government over decades of broken treaties, the theft of ancestral lands, forced assimilation and other injustices dating back centuries.Two Native Americans died in the fighting, and a U.S. marshal was left paralyzed.Wounded Knee had already been seared into history as the site of an 1890 massacre by U.S. Army cavalry troops in one of the last major military operations against Native Americans on the northern plains. Accounts vary, but the massacre left around 300 Lakota dead — including children, women and older people. Congress apologized in 1990.Ahead of the 50th anniversary of the occupation, The Associated Press reached out to people who were at Wounded Knee or involved from a distance to hear their stories.DWAIN CAMPDwain Camp, a member of the Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma, was in California when his younger brother, Carter, called to say he and other leaders of the American Indian Movement took a group of activists into Wounded Knee.“He was telling me they were in a hell of a fight,” Camp, now 85, recalled. “I heard the gunfire and that was all I needed. I went up there and stayed for the duration of the standoff.”Their brother, Craig, a Vietnam veteran, also joined them. Camp said the rifles and shotguns the occupiers took from the trading post in town were no match for the weapons and armored vehicles the feds had.“We were going to make it very expensive should they go ahead and roll in,” Camp said. “It didn't come to that, thank goodness.”Camp remembers the occupation with pride as “a very vital time” that changed his life. He said he experienced “the freest feeling that I could ever imagine.” He met AIM leaders who became famous, including Dennis Banks,Clyde Bellecourt and Russell Means. It was also a spiritual awakening for many occupiers and visitors, he said, with sweat lodge ceremonies providing a chance for prayer and learning about their traditions.And it helped change the way Native Americans across the country saw themselves, Camp said.“The Native people of this land after Wounded Knee, they had like a surge of new pride in being Native people,” he said.Camp said the takeover was a catalyst for policy changes that had been “unimaginable"" before, including the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, the Indian Child Welfare Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, to name a few. And it provided a focus for his own activism.“After we left Wounded Knee, it became paramount that protecting Mother Earth was our foremost issue,"" he said. ""Since that period of time, we've learned that we've got to teach our kids our true history.”Camp sees the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline — which drew thousands of Indigenous people and supporters to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017 — as a continuation of the resurgence fueled by Wounded Knee.“We're not the subjugated and disenfranchised people that we were,"" he said. ""Wounded Knee was an important beginning of that. And because we're a resilient people, it's something we take a lot of pride in.”Camp said he wished he could return to Pine Ridge for the 50th anniversary observances, but traveling isn't easy at his age. Instead, he plans to get together with his surviving brother, Craig, who lives near him in Ponca. They'll burn some of the sacred sage that family members bring back every year from South Dakota.—-JIM HUGGINSFBI Special Agent Jim Huggins was on the other side of the roadblocks. He was one of several agents from the Denver FBI office who went to Wounded Knee to back up their colleagues.""It was a dangerous situation,” recalled Huggins, 83, who's retired and lives in Frankfort, Kentucky. “The people that took over the town of Wounded Knee were a group of militants, mostly out of Minneapolis. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822881,Legacy of Wounded Knee occupation lives on 50 years later,"WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. (AP) — Madonna Thunder Hawk remembers the firefights.

            As a medic during the occupation of Wounded Knee in early 1973, Thunder Hawk was stationed nightly in a frontline bunker in the combat zone between Native American activists and U.S. government agents in South Dakota.

            “I would crawl out there every night, and we’d just be out there in case anybody got hit,” said Thunder Hawk, of the Oohenumpa band of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, one of four women assigned to the bunkers.











            Memories of the Wounded Knee occupation — one in a string of protests from 1969 to 1973 that pushed the American Indian Movement to the forefront of Native activism — still run deep within people like Thunder Hawk who were there.

            Thunder Hawk, now 83, is careful about what she says today about AIM and the occupation, but she can’t forget that tribal elders in 1973 had been raised by grandparents who still remembered the 1890 slaughter of hundreds of Lakota people at Wounded Knee by U.S. soldiers.

            “That’s how close we are to our history,” she told ICT recently. “So anything that goes on, anything we do, even today with the land-back issue, all of that is just a continuation. It’s nothing new.”

            Other feelings linger, too, over the tensions that emerged in Lakota communities after Wounded Knee and the virtual destruction of the small community. Many still don’t want to talk about it.

            But the legacy of activism lives on among those who have followed in their footsteps, including the new generations of Native people who turned out at Standing Rock beginning in 2016 for the pipeline protests.

            “For me, it’s important to acknowledge the generation before us — to acknowledge their risk,” said Nick Tilsen, founder of NDN Collective and a leader in the Standing Rock protests, whose parents were AIM activists. “It’s important for us to honor them. It’s important for us to thank them.”

            Akim D. Reinhardt, who wrote the book, “Ruling Pine Ridge: Oglala Lakota Politics from the IRA to Wounded Knee,” said the AIM protests had powerful social and cultural impacts.

            “Collectively, they helped establish a sense of the permanence of Red Power in much the way that Black Power had for African Americans, a permanent legacy,” said Reinhardt, a history professor at Towson University in Towson, Maryland.

            “It was the cultural legacy that racism isn’t OK and people don’t need to be quiet and accept it anymore,"" he said. ""That it’s OK to be proud of who you are.”

            A series of events in South Dakota in recent days recognized the 50th anniversary of the occupation, including powwows, a documentary film showing and a special honor for the women of Wounded Knee.

            ‘'THUNDERBOLT' OF PROTEST

            The occupation began on the night of Feb. 27, 1973, when a group of warriors led by Oklahoma AIM leader Carter Camp, who was Ponca, moved into the small town of Wounded Knee. The group took over the trading post and established a base of operations along with AIM leaders Russell Means, of the Oglala Sioux Tribe; Dennis Banks, who was Ojibwe; and Clyde Bellecourt, of the White Earth Nation.

            Within days, hundreds of activists had joined them for what became a 71-day standoff with the U.S. government and other law enforcement.

            It was the fourth protest in as many years for AIM. The organization formed in the late 1960s and drew international attention with the occupation of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay from 1969-1971. In 1972, the Trail of Broken Treaties brought a cross-country caravan of hundreds of Indigenous activists to Washington, D.C., where they occupied the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters for six days.

            Then, on Feb. 6, 1973, AIM members and others gathered at the courthouse in Custer County, South Dakota, to protest the killing of Wesley Bad Heart Bull, who was Oglala Lakota, and the lenient sentences given to some perpetrators of violence against Native Americans. When they were denied access into the courthouse, the protest turned violent, with the burning of the local chamber of commerce and other buildings.

            Three weeks later, AIM leaders took over Wounded Knee.

            “It had been waiting to happen for generations,” said Kevin McKiernan, who covered the Wounded Knee occupation as a journalist in his late 20s and who later directed the 2019 documentary film, “From Wounded Knee to Standing Rock.”

            “If you look at it as a storm, the storm had been building through abuse, land theft, genocide, religious intoleration, for generations and generations,” he said. “The storm built up, and built up and built up. The American Indian Movement was simply the thunderbolt.” 

            The takeover at Wounded Knee grew out of a dispute with Oglala Sioux tribal leader Richard Wilson but also put a spotlight on demands that the U.S. government uphold its treaty obligations to the Lakota people.

            By March 8, the occupation leaders had declared the Wounded Knee territory to be the Independent Oglala Nation, granting citizenship papers to those who wanted them and demanding recognition as a sovereign nation.

            The standoff was often violent, and supplies became scarce within the occupied territory as the U.S. government worked to cut off support for those behind the lines. Discussions were ongoing throughout much of the occupation, with several government officials working with AIM leaders to try and resolve the issues.

            The siege finally ended on May 8 with an agreement to disarm and to further discuss the treaty obligations. By then, at least three people had been killed and more than a dozen wounded, according to reports.

            Two Native men died. Frank Clearwater, identified as Cherokee and Apache, was shot on April 17, 1973, and died eight days later. Lawrence “Buddy” Lamont, who was Oglala Lakota, was shot and killed on April 26, 1973.

            Another man, Black activist Ray Robinson, who had been working with the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization, went missing during the siege. The FBI confirmed in 2014 that he had died at Wounded Knee, but his body was never recovered. A U.S. marshal who was shot and paralyzed died many years later. 

            Camp was later convicted of abducting and beating four postal inspectors during the occupation and served three years in federal prison. Banks and Means were indicted on charges related to the events, but their cases were dismissed by a federal court for prosecutorial misconduct.

            Today, the Wounded Knee National Historic Landmark identifies the site of the 1890 massacre, most of which is now under joint ownership of the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes.

            The tribes agreed in 2022 to purchase 40 acres that included the area where most of the carnage took place in 1890, the ravine where victims fled and the area where the trading post was located.

            The purchase, from a descendant of the original owners of the trading post, included a covenant requiring the land to be preserved as a sacred site and memorial without commercial development.

            And though internal tensions emerged in the AIM organization in the years after the Wounded Knee occupation, AIM continues to operate throughout the U.S. in tribal communities and urban areas.

            In recent years, members participated in the Standing Rock protests and have persisted in pushing for the release from prison of former AIM leader Leonard Peltier, who was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder despite inconsistencies in the evidence in the deaths of two FBI agents during a shootout in 1975 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

            A NEW GENERATION

            Tilsen, now president and chief executive of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led organization centered around building Indigenous power, traces the roots of his activism to Wounded Knee.

            His parents, JoAnn Tall and Mark Tilsen, met at Wounded Knee, and he praises the women of the movement who sustained the traditional matriarchal system during the occupation. 

            “I grew up in the American Indian Movement,” said Tilsen, a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation. “It wasn’t a question about what you were fighting for. You were raised up in it. In fact, if you didn’t fight, you weren’t going to live.”

            Tilsen credits AIM and others for most of the rights Native Americans have today, including the ability to operate casinos and tribal colleges, enter into contracts with the federal government to oversee schools and other services, and religious freedom. 

            He said the movement showed the world that tribes were sovereign nations and their treaties were being violated. And when AIM and spiritual leaders such as Henry Crow Dog, Leonard Crow Dog and Matthew King joined the fight, it became intergenerational. 

            “It became a spiritual revolution,” he said. “It also became a fight that was about human rights. It became a fight that was about where Indigenous people aren’t just within the political system of America, but within the broader context of the system; of the world.” 

            Tilsen appreciates that his parents were willing to participate in an armed revolution to achieve one of their dreams of establishing KILI radio station, known as the “Voice of the Lakota Nation,” which began operating in 1983 as the first Indigenous-owned radio station in the United States. 

            The Dakota Access Pipeline protest in 2016 became a defining moment for him and his brother. They had wondered, he said, what would be their Wounded Knee?

            “What made it so powerful and what made it different was that you actually had grassroots organizers and revolutionaries and official tribal governments coming together, too,” Tilsen said. “I think that Standing Rock in particular actually reached way further than Wounded Knee because of how the issue was framed around ‘water is life.’”

            Alex Fire Thunder, deputy director of the Lakota Language Consortium, said the occupation of Wounded Knee and other activism helped revitalize Indigenous languages and cultures. His mother was too young to have participated in the occupation but he said she remembered visits from AIM members in the community.

            “The whole point of AIM, the American Indian Movement, was to bring back a sense of pride in our culture,” Fire Thunder, Oglala Lakota, told ICT.

            ___

            FUTURE GENERATIONS

            For Thunder Hawk, the issues became her lifelong work rather than momentary activism.

            She joined AIM in 1968 and participated in the occupation at Alcatraz, the BIA headquarters, the Custer County Courthouse and Wounded Knee, as well as the Standing Rock pipeline protest in 2016.

            She said work being done today by a new generation is a continuation of the work her ancestors did.

            “That’s why we were successful in Indian Country, because we were a movement of families,” she said. “It wasn’t just an age group, a bunch of young people carrying on.”

            She hopes her legacy will live on, that her great-great-grandchildren will see not just a photo of her but know what she sounded like and the person she seemed to be.

            It’s something that she can’t have when she looks at a photo of her paternal great-grandparents. 

            “Hopefully that’s what my descendants will see, you know?” she said. “And with the technology nowadays, they can press a button, maybe, and it’ll come up.”

            Frank Star Comes Out, the current president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, also believes it’s time for the previous generation’s work to be recognized.

            Some of his family members strongly supported AIM, including his mother and father. He said it's important to fight for his people, who survived genocide.

            “That’s why I support AIM, not only on a family level,” he said. “I have a lot of pride in who I am as a Lakota. … Times (have) changed. Now I’m using my leadership to help our people rise, to give them a voice. And I believe that’s important for Indian Country.”

The American Indian Movement was simply the thunderbolt.”The takeover at Wounded Knee grew out of a dispute with Oglala Sioux tribal leader Richard Wilson but also put a spotlight on demands that the U.S. government uphold its treaty obligations to the Lakota people.By March 8, the occupation leaders had declared the Wounded Knee territory to be the Independent Oglala Nation, granting citizenship papers to those who wanted them and demanding recognition as a sovereign nation.The standoff was often violent, and supplies became scarce within the occupied territory as the U.S. government worked to cut off support for those behind the lines. Discussions were ongoing throughout much of the occupation, with several government officials working with AIM leaders to try and resolve the issues.The siege finally ended on May 8 with an agreement to disarm and to further discuss the treaty obligations. By then, at least three people had been killed and more than a dozen wounded, according to reports.Two Native men died. Frank Clearwater, identified as Cherokee and Apache, was shot on April 17, 1973, and died eight days later. Lawrence “Buddy” Lamont, who was Oglala Lakota, was shot and killed on April 26, 1973.Another man, Black activist Ray Robinson, who had been working with the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization, went missing during the siege. The FBI confirmed in 2014 that he had died at Wounded Knee, but his body was never recovered. A U.S. marshal who was shot and paralyzed died many years later.Camp was later convicted of abducting and beating four postal inspectors during the occupation and served three years in federal prison. Banks and Means were indicted on charges related to the events, but their cases were dismissed by a federal court for prosecutorial misconduct.Today, the Wounded Knee National Historic Landmark identifies the site of the 1890 massacre, most of which is now under joint ownership of the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes.The tribes agreed in 2022 to purchase 40 acres that included the area where most of the carnage took place in 1890, the ravine where victims fled and the area where the trading post was located.The purchase, from a descendant of the original owners of the trading post, included a covenant requiring the land to be preserved as a sacred site and memorial without commercial development.And though internal tensions emerged in the AIM organization in the years after the Wounded Knee occupation, AIM continues to operate throughout the U.S. in tribal communities and urban areas.In recent years, members participated in the Standing Rock protests and have persisted in pushing for the release from prison of former AIM leader Leonard Peltier, who was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder despite inconsistencies in the evidence in the deaths of two FBI agents during a shootout in 1975 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.___A NEW GENERATIONTilsen, now president and chief executive of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led organization centered around building Indigenous power, traces the roots of his activism to Wounded Knee.His parents, JoAnn Tall and Mark Tilsen, met at Wounded Knee, and he praises the women of the movement who sustained the traditional matriarchal system during the occupation.“I grew up in the American Indian Movement,” said Tilsen, a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation. “It wasn’t a question about what you were fighting for. You were raised up in it. In fact, if you didn’t fight, you weren’t going to live.”Tilsen credits AIM and others for most of the rights Native Americans have today, including the ability to operate casinos and tribal colleges, enter into contracts with the federal government to oversee schools and other services, and religious freedom.He said the movement showed the world that tribes were sovereign nations and their treaties were being violated. And when AIM and spiritual leaders such as Henry Crow Dog, Leonard Crow Dog and Matthew King joined the fight, it became intergenerational.“It became a spiritual revolution,” he said. “It also became a fight that was about human rights. It became a fight that was about where Indigenous people aren’t just within the political system of America, but within the broader context of the system; of the world.”Tilsen appreciates that his parents were willing to participate in an armed revolution to achieve one of their dreams of establishing KILI radio station, known as the “Voice of the Lakota Nation,” which began operating in 1983 as the first Indigenous-owned radio station in the United States.The Dakota Access Pipeline protest in 2016 became a defining moment for him and his brother. They had wondered, he said, what would be their Wounded Knee?“What made it so powerful and what made it different was that you actually had grassroots organizers and revolutionaries and official tribal governments coming together, too,” Tilsen said. “I think that Standing Rock in particular actually reached way further than Wounded Knee because of how the issue was framed around ‘water is life.’”Alex Fire Thunder, deputy director of the Lakota Language Consortium, said the occupation of Wounded Knee and other activism helped revitalize Indigenous languages and cultures. His mother was too young to have participated in the occupation but he said she remembered visits from AIM members in the community.“The whole point of AIM, the American Indian Movement, was to bring back a sense of pride in our culture,” Fire Thunder, Oglala Lakota, told ICT.___FUTURE GENERATIONSFor Thunder Hawk, the issues became her lifelong work rather than momentary activism.She joined AIM in 1968 and participated in the occupation at Alcatraz, the BIA headquarters, the Custer County Courthouse and Wounded Knee, as well as the Standing Rock pipeline protest in 2016.She said work being done today by a new generation is a continuation of the work her ancestors did.“That’s why we were successful in Indian Country, because we were a movement of families,” she said. “It wasn’t just an age group, a bunch of young people carrying on.”She hopes her legacy will live on, that her great-great-grandchildren will see not just a photo of her but know what she sounded like and the person she seemed to be.It’s something that she can’t have when she looks at a photo of her paternal great-grandparents.“Hopefully that’s what my descendants will see, you know?” she said. “And with the technology nowadays, they can press a button, maybe, and it’ll come up.”Frank Star Comes Out, the current president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, also believes it’s time for the previous generation’s work to be recognized.Some of his family members strongly supported AIM, including his mother and father. He said it's important to fight for his people, who survived genocide.“That’s why I support AIM, not only on a family level,” he said. “I have a lot of pride in who I am as a Lakota. … Times (have) changed. Now I’m using my leadership to help our people rise, to give them a voice. And I believe that’s important for Indian Country.”___ICT producer Stewart Huntington, based in Colorado, contributed to this report.",2023/02/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822893,Japan's Nissan accelerates shift to electric vehicles,"TOKYO (AP) — Nissan is speeding up its shift toward electric vehicles, especially in Europe where emissions regulations are most stringent, the company said Monday. 

            Nissan Motor Co. said in a statement that it will make practically all its offerings in Europe electric or series-hybrids by fiscal 2026, at 98%. That's up from the previous target of 75%. In Japan, the company aims to make 58% of its model offerings, up from an earlier target of 55%. 

            Hybrids have both a gasoline engine and electric motor, but a series hybrid uses the motor to power the vehicle’s wheels, or powertrain. The engine powers a generator for the motor. Parallel hybrids, like Toyota Motor Corp.’s Prius, switch back and forth between a gas engine and electric motor. 











            Nissan’s sales target in EVs and series hybrids remain unchanged for the U.S., at more than 40%. In China the target was cut to 35% from 40%. That includes only pure EVs, not hybrids. 

            Nissan's target numbers do not include expected vehicle sales of Nissan’s alliance partners, such as Renault SA of France or Mitsubishi Motors Corp., a smaller Japanese carmaker. 

            The company was an early leader in electric vehicles, with its Leaf, which went on sale in 2010. It has been overtaken since then by newcomers like Tesla and Chinese automaker BYD. 

            Nissan officials say the company, based in Yokohama, have a wealth of knowledge about EV technology, especially about how consumers use the products, and what kind of wear and tear develop on the battery and other knowledge critical for the proliferation of green cars. 

            Nissan plans to roll out 19 electric vehicle models by 2030, up from an earlier 15, it said. 

            Earlier this month, Nissan said it will invest in up to a 15% stake in Ampere, Renault’s electric vehicle and software entity in Europe. Nissan and Renault have been working together on EV technology, with Nissan taking the lead in developing a next-generation battery.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822894,"George's heave just late, Jokic and Nuggets top Clips in OT","DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic had 40 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists to lead the Denver Nuggets to a 134-124 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Clippers in a matchup of Western Conference contenders Sunday night.

            Paul George nearly won it for the Clippers with an incredible shot at the end of regulation, but his long heave from just in front of the 3-point line in the backcourt came just after the buzzer.

            It was the 23rd triple-double of the season for Jokic and his 14th in the past 19 games. Denver is undefeated this season when he has a triple-double.











            “If you’re looking for a super athlete to win MVP, he’s not your candidate,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “If you’re looking for a great player that impacts winning in every possible way, whose team is first place in the Western Conference, then he’s your man. Frankly, I don’t give a damn what people think. I know he’s the MVP and his teammates know that and all the fans here in Denver and back home in Serbia know that.”

            Michael Porter Jr. had 29 points and 11 rebounds for the Nuggets. Jamal Murray added 21 points and 12 assists.

            Kawhi Leonard had 33 points to pace the Clippers — two nights after scoring a season-high 44 in a double-overtime loss against Sacramento. George finished with 23 points.

            One night after scoring a season-low 94 points in an 18-point loss at Memphis, the Nuggets shot 51% overall — including 63.2% on 2-pointers. 

            “When we get embarrassed, I think we do a really good job of showing up the next game,” Malone said. “One thing we’re always talking about is good teams don’t lose two games in a row. That’s something you strive for. Tonight, we were able to pull it out.”

            Denver is 4-0 this season against the Clippers, with each victory coming by at least 10 points.

            Denver led by 18 in the first quarter and had a nine-point advantage entering the fourth, but George's three-point play gave the Clippers their first lead, 109-107, with 4:17 remaining. 

            With his team trailing 118-117, Porter drained a 3-pointer with 26.6 seconds left, but George sank two free throws on the ensuing possession and the game went to overtime tied at 120.

            “I think we’re right there,” George said. “We’re right where we want to be. We’ve just got to continue to keep working. These late-game losses, we’ll turn these around and we’ll figure out how to win these tough ones.”

            HOMECOMING FOR HYLAND

            Bones Hyland, a Nuggets first-round draft pick in 2021, played in Denver for the first time since being traded to the Clippers on Feb. 9. He was booed for much of the night and finished with 10 points in 15 minutes.

            “Just with how things were playing out, I probably knew a little bit,” Hyland said when asked if he was surprised to be traded. “I’ve got so much love for Denver. I thank them for taking a chance on a kid like me.”

            Hyland averaged 10.9 points in 111 career games with Denver, the fewest played by a Nuggets first-round selection between 2006-21.

            “Just because you got to play a lot last year because guys were injured doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s going to be a role for you to play a lot this year,” Nuggets general manager Calvin Booth said. “I think that was always going to be a point of friction for him and for the club.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822896,"Slain Hong Kong model’s in-laws, ex-husband detained","HONG KONG (AP) — The ex-husband and former in-laws of a slain Hong Kong model were detained Monday on charges in her killing after police found body parts in a refrigerator and a pot. The case has gripped many in a Chinese territory where any violent crime is rare.

            Ex-husband Alex Kwong, his father Kwong Kau and his brother Anthony Kwong were charged with murdering model Abby Choi a day earlier. Alex Kwong's mother, Jenny Li, faces one count of perverting the course of justice. None of the four was granted bail.

            Choi, a 28-year-old model with more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, disappeared Feb. 21, according to a report filed later with the Hong Kong Police. Her last post was Feb. 19, featuring a photo shoot she had done with fashion magazine L’Officiel Monaco.











            On Friday, police found her dismembered body in a refrigerator in a house rented by Kwong Kau in a suburban part of Hong Kong about a 30-minute drive from mainland China.

            Authorities later discovered a young woman’s skull believed to be Choi’s in a cooking pot seized from the house. Officials say there was a hole in the skull.

            The defendants have not yet entered their pleas, and it does not appear that their lawyers have commented on the case to the media. The case was adjourned until May.

            Choi had financial disputes involving tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars (millions of dollars) with her ex-husband and his family, police said earlier, adding that “some people” were unhappy with how Choi handled her finances.

            The gruesome killing has particularly transfixed many in Hong Kong and across the border in mainland China, since the the self-governed southern Chinese city has a very low level of violent crime. 

            Choi's friend Bernard Cheng said he initially thought she had been kidnapped.

            “I haven't imagined a person who's so good, so full of love, so innocent, a person who doesn't do anything bad will be killed like this,” he said. “My heart is still heavy. I can't sleep well.”

            Cheng said Choi had four children, aged between 3 and 10. Alex Kwong, 28, was the father of the older two, who are now being taken care of by Choi's mother. Choi had remarried, to Chris Tam, and he was the father of the younger children, who are staying with his family.

            Cheng said Choi had good relationships with her family, including her in-laws, and would travel with the families of her current and former husbands together.

            While violent crime is rare in Hong Kong, the case recalls a handful of other shocking killings. In 2013, a man killed his parents and their heads were later found in refrigerators. In another infamous 1999 case, a woman was kidnapped and tortured by three members of an organized crime group before her death. Her skull was later found stuffed in a Hello Kitty doll.HONG KONG (AP) — The ex-husband and former in-laws of a slain Hong Kong model were detained Monday on charges in her killing after police found body parts in a refrigerator and a pot.

None of the four was granted bail.Choi, a 28-year-old model with more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, disappeared Feb. 21, according to a report filed later with the Hong Kong Police. Her last post was Feb. 19, featuring a photo shoot she had done with fashion magazine L’Officiel Monaco.On Friday, police found her dismembered body in a refrigerator in a house rented by Kwong Kau in a suburban part of Hong Kong about a 30-minute drive from mainland China.Authorities later discovered a young woman’s skull believed to be Choi’s in a cooking pot seized from the house. Officials say there was a hole in the skull.The defendants have not yet entered their pleas, and it does not appear that their lawyers have commented on the case to the media. The case was adjourned until May.Choi had financial disputes involving tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars (millions of dollars) with her ex-husband and his family, police said earlier, adding that “some people” were unhappy with how Choi handled her finances.The gruesome killing has particularly transfixed many in Hong Kong and across the border in mainland China, since the the self-governed southern Chinese city has a very low level of violent crime.Choi's friend Bernard Cheng said he initially thought she had been kidnapped.“I haven't imagined a person who's so good, so full of love, so innocent, a person who doesn't do anything bad will be killed like this,” he said. “My heart is still heavy. I can't sleep well.”Cheng said Choi had four children, aged between 3 and 10. Alex Kwong, 28, was the father of the older two, who are now being taken care of by Choi's mother. Choi had remarried, to Chris Tam, and he was the father of the younger children, who are staying with his family.Cheng said Choi had good relationships with her family, including her in-laws, and would travel with the families of her current and former husbands together.While violent crime is rare in Hong Kong, the case recalls a handful of other shocking killings. In 2013, a man killed his parents and their heads were later found in refrigerators. In another infamous 1999 case, a woman was kidnapped and tortured by three members of an organized crime group before her death. Her skull was later found stuffed in a Hello Kitty doll.",2023/02/27,132,World

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 27 February 2023 - DBS continues to be studied as a transformation role model, with Harvard Business School (HBS) being the latest academic institution to capture the bank's successful digital transformation journey in a case study.   The DBS case is being taught in HBS' Master of Business Administration (MBA) programme and its executive education courses by Professor Ranjay Gulati, Paul R. Lawrence MBA Class of 1942 Professor of Business Administration. Gulati was ranked as one of the top ten most cited scholars in Economics and Business over a decade by ISI-Incite. He is also the author of six bestselling books on strategy, organisational effectiveness and leadership in organisations[1].   Gulati said, ""Businesses need to transform themselves in order to compete in today's fast-changing markets. I was interested in studying how DBS transformed itself successfully, and to find out what they did and how they executed it. Through my numerous conversations with the bank's executives, what came across very strongly were the digital and purpose-focused elements of the transformation and how these permeated every level of the organisation. The willingness from the leadership to resource the change enabled a building up of the workforce's innovation 'muscles' to create a startup culture – quite a feat for an organisation of 33,000 people.""   DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said ""Behaving like a startup meant shifting the bank's mindset from that of a mature multinational to one that is more nimble, more agile; one which is constantly learning, experimenting and innovating on the fly. To effect this change at scale, we had to teach our people how to use the tools of innovation and provide them with opportunities to apply these tools in an environment where it is safe to take risks. This effective culture shift created through a programme of 'culture by design' has been instrumental to our success so far, and will be key as we navigate the disruptions in our industry going ahead.""   The HBS case study was put together over a span of 15 months through a series of interviews between Gulati and DBS' leadership team. Learn more about the DBS case study at Harvard Business Publishing's repository  here.   Gupta was also interviewed on an episode of Gulati's newest podcast series ""Deep Purpose"" in December 2022. The conversation complements the case study and nicely sums up the development stages of the bank, digital transformation, building a technology company, being customer-centric and Gupta's leadership style. Both the recording and transcript are accessible  here.   In 2022, DBS was named ""World's Best Bank"" by US-based financial publication Global Finance. This makes it the seventh best bank in the world award it has won in the past five years. DBS was also the only Singapore-headquartered company to be recognised as one of the Top 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators by US-based Fast Company.   Other institutions which have written case studies on DBS include INSEAD, the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), IESE, Singapore Management University and Nanyang Technological University.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822902,US voters favor using navy and air force to defend Taiwan if China invades: Poll,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A majority of likely U.S. voters would support Washington using the U.S. Navy and Air Force to assist in the defense of Taiwan, according to a recent poll of likely voters.Between Feb. 13 and Feb. 15, the U.S. polling firm Rasmussen asked 900 likely U.S. voters four questions on their attitude toward the U.S. helping to defend Taiwan. Based on the results published Feb. 21, a clear majority would support tough economic sanctions on China, as well as the involvement of the U.S. Navy and Air Force in military operations to defend the country.

However, respondents did not express as much support when asked the fourth question of the poll, which was “If China were to invade Taiwan, would you support or oppose the United States sending ground troops to defend Taiwan?” On this question, only 42% of respondents expressed their support, while 46% of respondents were opposed to ground troop involvement in a potential military conflict.In contrast, responses to the first three questions indicate a strong willingness among likely U.S. voters to support the defense of Taiwan. Excluding involvement in ground operations, support for economic sanctions and the use of naval and air force assets showed strong bipartisan support.Question one was “If China were to invade Taiwan, would you support or oppose the United States imposing economic sanctions on China?” In response, 79% of those polled expressed support, while 12% were opposed, and 9% were unsure.For question two, which asked about using the navy to defend Taiwan, 64% of respondents said they would support U.S. involvement. In contrast, 23% said they would be opposed and 13% were uncertain.Similarly, for question three, which asked about using the Air Force to defend Taiwan, 63% of respondents said they would support U.S. involvement. In contrast, 24% said they would be opposed and 13% were uncertain.On question four, which asked about deploying ground troops, a similar number of those surveyed (12%) were uncertain.Among the respondents who support deploying ground troops, respondents who identified as Democrats expressed greater support with 51%. In comparison, 40% of Republicans surveyed and 38% of independents support the use of ground troops if China were to invade Taiwan, as per Newsmax.

Rasmussen reports that the margin of error for the poll is plus or minus 3%, and that there is a 95% confidence level in the results.",2023/02/27,3442,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822911,Huawei dominates MWC mobile tech fair despite US sanctions,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — A contingent of Chinese companies led by technology giant Huawei is turning the world’s biggest wireless trade fair into an opportunity to show their muscle in the face of Huawei’s blacklisting by Western nations concerned about cybersecurity and escalating tensions with the U.S. over TikTok, spy balloons and computer chips. 

            After three years of pandemic disruption, they are among tens of thousands in Barcelona for MWC, also known as Mobile World Congress, an annual tech industry expo starting Monday where mobile phone makers show off new devices and telecom industry executives peruse the latest networking gear and software. 

            Out of 2,000 exhibitors and sponsors, 150 are Chinese companies and Huawei Technologies Ltd. has the biggest presence. The smartphone and network equipment maker expanded its footprint by 50% from last year and is taking up almost an entire vast exhibition hall at Barcelona's Fira convention center, organizers said.











            That is striking considering that Huawei has been at the center of a geopolitical battle over global technology supremacy that's left parts of its business crippled by Western sanctions. 

            The U.S. three years ago successfully pushed European allies like Britain and Sweden to ban or restrict Huawei equipment in their phone networks over fears Beijing could use it for cybersnooping or sabotaging critical communications infrastructure — allegations Huawei has denied repeatedly. Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have taken similar action. 

            Brian Chamberlin, executive adviser at Huawei’s wireless carrier group, said “the sanctions have had a big impact” but the company is “not going to try to break any of those rules.""

            “But at the same time, that’s not going to slow us down from delivering innovation, innovative solutions,” he said at the expo. “We will continue to do business with companies and countries that want our support.”

            Huawei's supersized presence at the show is a sign of defiance, said John Strand, a Danish telecom industry consultant. 

            Huawei wants to “give Biden the finger,” Strand said of the U.S. president. The company’s message, he said, is: “Despite the American sanctions, we are alive and kicking and doing so well.” 

            U.S.-China tech tensions have only grown.

            A suspected Chinese spy balloon downed by a U.S. fighter jet sparked acrimony between Beijing and Washington in recent weeks. 

            U.S. authorities have banned TikTok from devices issued to government employees over fears the popular Chinese-owned video sharing app is a data privacy risk or could be used to push pro-China narratives. 

            The U.S. also is seeking to restrict China's access to equipment to make advanced semiconductors, signing up key allies Japan and the Netherlands.

            That followed the MWC expo four years ago becoming a battleground between the U.S. and China over Huawei and the security of next generation wireless networks. In a keynote speech, a top Huawei executive trolled the U.S. over its push to get allies to shun the company's gear. 

            Huawei hasn’t gone away, and the dispute continues to simmer. Washington widened sanctions last month with new curbs on exports to Huawei of less advanced tech components. 

            Still, the company has maintained its status as the world's No. 1 maker of network gear thanks to sales in China and other markets where Washington hasn't been so successful at persuading governments to boycott the company. 

            Strand, who has been attending MWC for 26 years, said Huawei wants to show the world it’s pivoting away from mainly making networking gear — the hidden plumbing such as base stations and antennas connecting the world's mobile devices — and becoming an all-round tech supplier. 

            The company is reinventing itself by supplying hardware and software for cargo ports, self-driving cars, factories and other industries it hopes are less vulnerable to Washington.

            “Since MWC is a global event, they (Huawei) will want to communicate on this and showcase that they are still a key player in the telecom and high-tech industry,” said Thomas Husson, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. 

            The company's presence is so big simply because of “pent-up demand,” said Chamberlin of Huawei.

            “We have been locked into China for the past three years due to the COVID restrictions. So this is really the first time we’ve been able to engage with our customers,” he said. 

            Huawei also makes smartphones but sales outside China cratered after Google was blocked from providing maps, YouTube and other services that usually come preloaded on Android devices. 

            “The Huawei consumer brand has collapsed in Europe,” Husson said. At MWC, “Huawei may well announce new consumer smartphones and new consumer devices, but the brand has lost momentum and these announcements are primarily for fast-growing markets outside the U.S. and Western Europe.”

            At Huawei’s pavilion, staff showed visitors the latest 5G antennas alongside equipment for older generations of cellular networks that still account for much of the company’s business. Optical networking switches and new flexible fiber cable for home networking were displayed inside a VIP area, while smartphones and other consumer devices like earbuds were laid out at the entrance.

            Huawei is just part of the larger Chinese delegation, whose turnout is getting a boost from China lifting all COVID-19 travel restrictions. ZTE, another Chinese tech company that had been sanctioned by the U.S., plans product launches at MWC. 

            Chinese mobile phone makers Honor, Oppo and Xiaomi will have a strong presence, said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. Honor was Huawei's budget brand but was sold off in 2020 in hopes of reviving sales by separating it from the sanctions on its corporate parent.

            “The removal of COVID restrictions in China has made it possible for these manufacturers to attend the show in force,"" Wood said. ""They are all keen to establish themselves as the ‘third alternative' to Apple and Samsung in European markets and see MWC as a pivotal event to do that.”BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — A contingent of Chinese companies led by technology giant Huawei is turning the world’s biggest wireless trade fair into an opportunity to show their muscle in the face of Huawei’s blacklisting by Western nations concerned about cybersecurity and escalating tensions with the U.S. over TikTok, spy balloons and computer chips.After three years of pandemic disruption, they are among tens of thousands in Barcelona for MWC, also known as Mobile World Congress, an annual tech industry expo starting Monday where mobile phone makers show off new devices and telecom industry executives peruse the latest networking gear and software.Out of 2,000 exhibitors and sponsors, 150 are Chinese companies and Huawei Technologies Ltd. has the biggest presence.

            The countdown was halted with just two minutes remaining until liftoff from Kennedy Space Center. With just a split second to blast off, there was no time to deal with the problem, which involved the engine ignition system.

            SpaceX delayed the launch until at least Thursday.











            Strapped into the capsule atop the Falcon rocket were two NASA astronauts, one Russian cosmonaut and one astronaut from the United Arab Emirates. They had to wait until all the fuel was drained from the rocket — an hourlong process — before getting out.

            “We'll be sitting here waiting,” commander Stephen Bowen assured everyone. “We're all feeling good.”

            Bowen and his crew — including the first astronaut from the United Arab Emirates assigned to a monthslong mission, Sultan al-Neyadi — will replace four space station residents who have been up there since October.

            Officials said the problem involved ground equipment used for loading the engine ignition fluid. The launch team could not be sure there was a full load. A SpaceX engineer likened this critical system to spark plugs for a car.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822913,Verstappen again the man to beat in F1 in 2023,"Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was so far ahead last season that catching the Formula One champion may feel like scaling a mountain.

            So that's exactly what Ferrari's Charles Leclerc did to get himself ready for the challenge, which starts next Sunday at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.

            The 25-year-old from Monaco headed up to the Italian Dolomites for some “extreme training"" that left him “fully recharged and ready for"" another crack at Verstappen, his former junior karting rival.











            Lewis Hamilton has long been a perfectionist when it comes to physical fitness. But this time the Mercedes veteran tried something new: a week in Antarctica whale-spotting.

            “Winter was great, amazing, (the) highlight was Antarctica seeing the whales,"" the 38-year-old said. ""Definitely, if anyone has an opportunity to go, pack warm. But otherwise (it’s) pretty spectacular.”

            Whether this makes any difference when it comes to stopping Verstappen remains to be seen, and if pre-season testing is anything to go by, it might not.

            Verstappen thinks his RB19 may be even better than last year.

            “Overall I think it’s definitely an improvement to last year,"" he said during testing. “Very positive days for me.""

            Ferrari will hope things improve under new leadership.

            Frenchman Frédéric Vasseur replaced team principal, Italian Mattia Binotto, whose relationship with Leclerc had become increasingly tense.

            Leclerc opened 2022 with two wins in three races and seemed poised to challenge Verstappen. But he finished nearly 150 points adrift, without a win since July and just finished second overall.

            “What to expect from Fred? It's very early days, but what I can say is that it was impressive how quickly he (blended) into the team,” said Leclerc, who worked with Vasseur at Sauber. “Straight away he felt quite at ease and understood a team like Ferrari.”

            Without criticizing Binotto, he alluded to the need for change.

            “He's really, really good at putting everybody in the right conditions in order to extract the best out of people,"" the 25-year-old Leclerc said. ""I think this is going to be a big plus.” 

            Binotto's management led to poor team orders, botched pit stops and odd strategy calls that cost Leclerc wins. It generated conflict within F1's most famed team and led to Binotto's departure.

            Hamilton's relationship with Mercedes remains strong as he negotiates a new contract and with team principal Toto Wolff pledging to give him a winning car.

            Hamilton is F1's record-holder with 103 wins, but didn't win a race last year and now must also beat teammate George Russell. 

            Russell surprised many observers in his first season with Mercedes by finishing ahead of Hamilton in the standings. Russell was fourth, compared to sixth for Hamilton, and won the team’s only race.

            “Every point of my career, I’ve always gone in believing,” Russell said.

            Asked about his rivals, Verstappen was very brief.

            “It's more important we focus on ourselves,” said Verstappen, who has won a record 15 races last year to take his career tally to 35.

            The 25-year-old Dutchman is already sixth all time for wins. The late F1 great Ayrton Senna is fifth with 41 wins and well within reach this season.

            Red Bull will start sleeker and lighter than last year and, Verstappen hopes, with no reliability problems.

            “The main issue we had last year was the car was massively overweight, so at the beginning the car was very lazy and wasn’t turning in,” Verstappen said. ""This year it’s just a continuation, but also things we found and put on the car that were clearly better.”

            Last year became plain-sailing for Verstappen until some tension crept in near the end. Teammate Sergio Perez was unhappy that Verstappen didn't let him through in Brazil when Perez was fighting with Leclerc for second place in the championship.

            SPEAKING UP

            Lewis Hamilton will keep speaking out on social justice and race, human rights and other issues close to his heart.

            Motorsport's governing body FIA in December updated its International Sporting Code to require prior written permission for drivers to make or display “political, religious and personal statements or comments” during race weekends.

            The crackdown on free speech was condemned by most drivers. It led to F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali saying drivers won't be gagged and prompted FIA to backtrack somewhat by saying drivers are free to express themselves outside of competition on their own platforms or in media interviews, and when directly asked questions in news conferences.

            But FIA insists the sport must remain neutral, and potential sanctions range from fines, a grid drop, time penalty or — worst-case scenario — suspension.

            Hamilton is confident Mercedes and F1 won't let him and other drivers down.

            ""I know the team is in constant communication with the FIA and it's been really positive to see Stefano (Domenicali) and Formula One stepping up and supporting us,” said Hamilton, the only Black driver in F1.

            NEW AND OLD

            Fernando Alonso is still confident in his ability to win a third world title even though he's 41 years old. He joined Aston Martin after an acrimonious split with Alpine and the Spaniard likes what he's seen so far.

            “At Aston Martin for sure there is this energy and trying to become a contender for the future,"" he said. ""New factory coming together will be ready, new wind tunnel, a lot of investment. They look pretty good.”

            NEW FACES

            The 21-year-old Australian Oscar Piastri (McLaren), 22-year-old American Logan Sargeant and Nyck De Vries (AlphaTauri) are the new faces.

            De Vries raced once last season and impressed with ninth place at the Italian Grand Prix when he stepped in for Alex Albon when he had appendicitis.

            “I'm getting the opportunity to live my dream,” the 28-year-old De Vries said.

            F2 champion Felipe Drugovich could replace Lance Stroll for Aston Martin in Bahrain if Stroll fails to recover from a wrist injury sustained in a bicycle accident.

            There's also a rumor that Aston Martin could recall Sebastian Vettel as a one-off. The four-time F1 champion retired last season.

            Alonso and Vettel — former title rivals in the same team — would add spice, even for only one race.

            AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsRed Bull driver Max Verstappen was so far ahead last season that catching the Formula One champion may feel like scaling a mountain.So that's exactly what Ferrari's Charles Leclerc did to get himself ready for the challenge, which starts next Sunday at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.The 25-year-old from Monaco headed up to the Italian Dolomites for some “extreme training"" that left him “fully recharged and ready for"" another crack at Verstappen, his former junior karting rival.Lewis Hamilton has long been a perfectionist when it comes to physical fitness. But this time the Mercedes veteran tried something new: a week in Antarctica whale-spotting.“Winter was great, amazing, (the) highlight was Antarctica seeing the whales,"" the 38-year-old said. ""Definitely, if anyone has an opportunity to go, pack warm. But otherwise (it’s) pretty spectacular.”Whether this makes any difference when it comes to stopping Verstappen remains to be seen, and if pre-season testing is anything to go by, it might not.Verstappen thinks his RB19 may be even better than last year.“Overall I think it’s definitely an improvement to last year,"" he said during testing. “Very positive days for me.""Ferrari will hope things improve under new leadership.Frenchman Frédéric Vasseur replaced team principal, Italian Mattia Binotto, whose relationship with Leclerc had become increasingly tense.Leclerc opened 2022 with two wins in three races and seemed poised to challenge Verstappen. But he finished nearly 150 points adrift, without a win since July and just finished second overall.“What to expect from Fred? It's very early days, but what I can say is that it was impressive how quickly he (blended) into the team,” said Leclerc, who worked with Vasseur at Sauber. “Straight away he felt quite at ease and understood a team like Ferrari.”Without criticizing Binotto, he alluded to the need for change.“He's really, really good at putting everybody in the right conditions in order to extract the best out of people,"" the 25-year-old Leclerc said. ""I think this is going to be a big plus.”Binotto's management led to poor team orders, botched pit stops and odd strategy calls that cost Leclerc wins. It generated conflict within F1's most famed team and led to Binotto's departure.Hamilton's relationship with Mercedes remains strong as he negotiates a new contract and with team principal Toto Wolff pledging to give him a winning car.Hamilton is F1's record-holder with 103 wins, but didn't win a race last year and now must also beat teammate George Russell.Russell surprised many observers in his first season with Mercedes by finishing ahead of Hamilton in the standings. Russell was fourth, compared to sixth for Hamilton, and won the team’s only race.“Every point of my career, I’ve always gone in believing,” Russell said.Asked about his rivals, Verstappen was very brief.“It's more important we focus on ourselves,” said Verstappen, who has won a record 15 races last year to take his career tally to 35.The 25-year-old Dutchman is already sixth all time for wins. The late F1 great Ayrton Senna is fifth with 41 wins and well within reach this season.Red Bull will start sleeker and lighter than last year and, Verstappen hopes, with no reliability problems.“The main issue we had last year was the car was massively overweight, so at the beginning the car was very lazy and wasn’t turning in,” Verstappen said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822916,'Love doesn't exist': Immigrants defy forced marriage abroad,"GUASTALLA, Italy (AP) — From the day of her birth in Pakistan, Iram Aslam was betrothed to a cousin 17 days older. But to the young woman, who emigrated as a teenager to this Italian farm town on the Po River plain, the cousin felt like a brother. So on a visit to her homeland, she played for time, telling her aunts she wasn't ready for marriage. 

            “They did everything possible to make me marry him,'' said Aslam, now 29. She said she told them: ""'I don’t want to marry him and please don't ask me anymore.'"" 

            Her family, in both Italy and Pakistan, kept scheming to have her wed a man of their choice — and their caste. Aslam dismissed around 30 potential husbands.











            “In the end, I made everyone angry, and no one talks to me anymore,” she said of her relatives in Pakistan.

            In two murder trials this month, Italian prosecutors are seeking justice for Pakistani immigrant women allegedly killed because they refused marriages imposed by their parents. The cases highlight differences, often misconstrued as religion-based, between centuries-old immigrants' cultural traditions and Western values prizing individualism. 

            “I liked another person, wanted another one,'' Aslam said of her own situation. ""But they didn't want it, because among us, love doesn't exist."" 

            Love is viewed “as a sin,” she added, her thick, wavy brown hair covered by a multicolored headscarf. She asked that her face not be fully shown for fear of further antagonizing Pakistani neighbors in Guastalla, a town of 15,000 where they are the dominant immigrant community. 

            To escape marriage-obsessed relatives, Aslam went for a time to live in Germany.

            But there was no escape for 18-year-old Saman Abbas. 

            Like Aslam, she emigrated as a teenager from Pakistan to an Italian farm town, Novellara, 11 kilometers (seven miles) from Guastalla. 

            In what appears to be an identity card photo taken shortly after her arrival, Abbas' face is framed by a black hijab, or headscarf. But the young woman quickly embraced Western ways, appearing in social media posts with her hair tumbling out from under a bright red headband. In one, she and her Pakistani boyfriend were shown kissing on a street in the regional capital, Bologna.

            According to Italian investigators, that kiss enraged Abbas' parents, who wanted their daughter to marry a cousin in Pakistan. 

            In November, her body was dug up in the ruins of a Novellara farmhouse. She had last been seen alive a few hundred yards away on April 30, 2021, in surveillance camera video as she walked with her parents on the watermelon farm where her father worked. A few days later, her parents caught a flight from Milan to Pakistan.

            Abbas had reportedly told her boyfriend she feared for her life, because she refused to be married to an older man in her homeland. 

            An autopsy revealed a broken neck bone, possibly caused by strangulation.

            An uncle and a cousin were extradited from France, and another cousin from Spain. They are now on trial in Reggio Emilia, the provincial capital with jurisdiction over Novellara, accused of Abbas' murder.

            Also indicted is her father, Shabbir Abbas, arrested in his village in eastern Punjab. The whereabouts of her mother, who is also charged, are unknown.

            A lawyer for her father, Akhtar Mahmood, told Italian state television that the young woman's family is innocent. He disputed prosecutors' allegations, contending that she had wanted to return with her family to Pakistan to flee Western ways.

            Asked about Italy's request for Shabbir Abbas' extradition, Pakistan's ambassador to Italy, Ali Javed, told The Associated Press that the Pakistani government would “not hesitate” to do so. However, Italy has no extradition treaty with Pakistan.

            Javed blamed “individual ignorance'' for forced marriage, which is illegal in Pakistan. 

            In 2019, Italy made coercing an Italian citizen or resident into marriage, even abroad, a crime covered under domestic violence laws. 

            Late this month, police in Spain detained the father of two sisters who were allegedly murdered while visiting family in Pakistan. The women had reportedly refused to have their husbands come to Spain after being forced to marry their cousins. 

            In the United Kingdom, home to Europe’s largest Pakistani community, the government’s Forced Marriage Unit cautioned that the problem of forced marriage isn’t “specific to one country, religion or culture” and said statistics don’t reflect “the full scale of the abuse” since forced marriage is a “hidden crime.”

            Under the Italian justice system, civil plaintiffs can attach lawsuits for damages to criminal trials, and two organizations representing Islamic communities in Italy are among those suing in the Abbas trial. 

            Other plaintiffs include women's advocacy organizations. 

            Tiziana Dal Pra, whose group, Trama delle Terre, promotes intercultural relations, said that while violence surrounding forced marriage “gets interpreted as religious,"" what's really at play is “patriarchal control” of women's bodies.

            In December, a court in the northern city of Brescia convicted and gave five-year prison sentences to three Pakistani immigrants — the parents and older brother of four girls — for beating them and keeping them out of school.

            According to court documents, the parents threatened their daughters that if they refused arranged marriages, they would end up like that “girl in Pakistan."" 

            The court said that threat referred to 25-year-old Sana Cheema, who was slain when she returned from Italy to Pakistan in 2018, allegedly at her parents' insistence.

            By her friends' accounts, Cheema, who had taken Italian citizenship, loved her life in Brescia, where she worked out at a gym, went out for coffee with girlfriends and danced with them at a disco. She was proud of her job teaching at a driving school in the northern city. 

            Brescia prosecutors are now trying Cheema's father and brother in absentia on a novel charge: murder in violation of the political right to marry one's own choice. 

            In 2019, a court in Pakistan acquitted the two on murder charges, citing insufficient evidence. But Italy's justice ministry ruled the Brescia trial could go forward since Pakistan and Italy have no agreement governing cases involving so-called judicial double jeopardy.

            Cheema's family initially told Pakistani authorities that she died of a heart attack the day before she was supposed to fly back to Italy. Two friends testified in Brescia this month that Cheema told them her parents wanted her to marry a cousin in Pakistan. 

            They also quoted from Facebook messages in which Cheema said her parents had confiscated her passport and phone in Pakistan. 

            With the Italian Embassy closely following the case, Cheema's body was exhumed. An autopsy indicated she was likely strangled. 

            Prosecuting the case in Italy sends the message that ""exercising the right of who you want to live with, above all, who you want to marry, is a political right” to be guaranteed “with utmost firmness,” Brescia Prosecutor General Guido Rispoli told the AP.

            At the edge of a field near the farmhouse where Saman Abbas' body was found, mourners have left a stuffed toy squirrel and bunches of flowers at an improvised shrine. 

            “It will continue to happen, I tell you, that's how it is,'' Aslam said of violence linked to forced marriage. 

            What progress has been made with trials like the ones in Reggio Emilia and Brescia isn't enough, she added: “It's like salt in flour.”

The AP is solely responsible for this content.GUASTALLA, Italy (AP) — From the day of her birth in Pakistan, Iram Aslam was betrothed to a cousin 17 days older. But to the young woman, who emigrated as a teenager to this Italian farm town on the Po River plain, the cousin felt like a brother. So on a visit to her homeland, she played for time, telling her aunts she wasn't ready for marriage.“They did everything possible to make me marry him,'' said Aslam, now 29. She said she told them: ""'I don’t want to marry him and please don't ask me anymore.'""Her family, in both Italy and Pakistan, kept scheming to have her wed a man of their choice — and their caste. Aslam dismissed around 30 potential husbands.“In the end, I made everyone angry, and no one talks to me anymore,” she said of her relatives in Pakistan.In two murder trials this month, Italian prosecutors are seeking justice for Pakistani immigrant women allegedly killed because they refused marriages imposed by their parents. The cases highlight differences, often misconstrued as religion-based, between centuries-old immigrants' cultural traditions and Western values prizing individualism.“I liked another person, wanted another one,'' Aslam said of her own situation. ""But they didn't want it, because among us, love doesn't exist.""Love is viewed “as a sin,” she added, her thick, wavy brown hair covered by a multicolored headscarf. She asked that her face not be fully shown for fear of further antagonizing Pakistani neighbors in Guastalla, a town of 15,000 where they are the dominant immigrant community.To escape marriage-obsessed relatives, Aslam went for a time to live in Germany.But there was no escape for 18-year-old Saman Abbas.Like Aslam, she emigrated as a teenager from Pakistan to an Italian farm town, Novellara, 11 kilometers (seven miles) from Guastalla.In what appears to be an identity card photo taken shortly after her arrival, Abbas' face is framed by a black hijab, or headscarf. But the young woman quickly embraced Western ways, appearing in social media posts with her hair tumbling out from under a bright red headband. In one, she and her Pakistani boyfriend were shown kissing on a street in the regional capital, Bologna.According to Italian investigators, that kiss enraged Abbas' parents, who wanted their daughter to marry a cousin in Pakistan.In November, her body was dug up in the ruins of a Novellara farmhouse. She had last been seen alive a few hundred yards away on April 30, 2021, in surveillance camera video as she walked with her parents on the watermelon farm where her father worked. A few days later, her parents caught a flight from Milan to Pakistan.Abbas had reportedly told her boyfriend she feared for her life, because she refused to be married to an older man in her homeland.An autopsy revealed a broken neck bone, possibly caused by strangulation.An uncle and a cousin were extradited from France, and another cousin from Spain. They are now on trial in Reggio Emilia, the provincial capital with jurisdiction over Novellara, accused of Abbas' murder.Also indicted is her father, Shabbir Abbas, arrested in his village in eastern Punjab. The whereabouts of her mother, who is also charged, are unknown.A lawyer for her father, Akhtar Mahmood, told Italian state television that the young woman's family is innocent. He disputed prosecutors' allegations, contending that she had wanted to return with her family to Pakistan to flee Western ways.Asked about Italy's request for Shabbir Abbas' extradition, Pakistan's ambassador to Italy, Ali Javed, told The Associated Press that the Pakistani government would “not hesitate” to do so. However, Italy has no extradition treaty with Pakistan.Javed blamed “individual ignorance'' for forced marriage, which is illegal in Pakistan.In 2019, Italy made coercing an Italian citizen or resident into marriage, even abroad, a crime covered under domestic violence laws.Late this month, police in Spain detained the father of two sisters who were allegedly murdered while visiting family in Pakistan. The women had reportedly refused to have their husbands come to Spain after being forced to marry their cousins.In the United Kingdom, home to Europe’s largest Pakistani community, the government’s Forced Marriage Unit cautioned that the problem of forced marriage isn’t “specific to one country, religion or culture” and said statistics don’t reflect “the full scale of the abuse” since forced marriage is a “hidden crime.”Under the Italian justice system, civil plaintiffs can attach lawsuits for damages to criminal trials, and two organizations representing Islamic communities in Italy are among those suing in the Abbas trial.Other plaintiffs include women's advocacy organizations.Tiziana Dal Pra, whose group, Trama delle Terre, promotes intercultural relations, said that while violence surrounding forced marriage “gets interpreted as religious,"" what's really at play is “patriarchal control” of women's bodies.In December, a court in the northern city of Brescia convicted and gave five-year prison sentences to three Pakistani immigrants — the parents and older brother of four girls — for beating them and keeping them out of school.According to court documents, the parents threatened their daughters that if they refused arranged marriages, they would end up like that “girl in Pakistan.""The court said that threat referred to 25-year-old Sana Cheema, who was slain when she returned from Italy to Pakistan in 2018, allegedly at her parents' insistence.By her friends' accounts, Cheema, who had taken Italian citizenship, loved her life in Brescia, where she worked out at a gym, went out for coffee with girlfriends and danced with them at a disco.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822917,Fashion + The Arts - Shanghai Tang Collaboration with Artist Long Di,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 27 February 2023 - With the brand spirit of ""Make Life a Party"", Shanghai Tang is a luxury brand that represents the international high-end lifestyle by adhering to the core of cultural pioneers and contemporary Eastern aesthetics. Shanghai Tang has always been committed to promoting contemporary Chinese art to enrich the meaning of modern fashion and bring a fresh approach to high fashion. In recent years, SHANGHAI TANG has collaborated with Xu Bing on special collections, with Zhou Yi Lun and Chen Wei on the first concept shop ""Ji Chun"", and with Long Di on the Year of the Tiger collection, among others. Extending the legend of its founder, Sir David Tang, to promote contemporary art in China, SHANGHAI TANG continues to create opportunities for art and fashion, striving to be a central force in the development of a more profound interpretation of Eastern aesthetics.            With Art Basel just around the corner, Shanghai Tang has collaborated with artist Long Di to launch a limited-edition art collection called ""Rui Rabbit Spring"", available exclusively at Shanghai Tang online and in-store. In Chinese culture, the rabbit is often referred to as a spirit that represents prosperity and good fortune. Long Di takes inspiration from this traditional mythology and creates illustrations that portray the rabbit's auspicious symbolism in a contemporary style.   In the three limited-edition prints of the paintings, the white rabbit embraces a pink peach to signify long life and good health, the gold rabbit embraces a gold dollar to signify wealth and prosperity, and the pink rabbit transforms into countless hearts to convey that love is abundant. The postcard accompanying the print depicts a woman in and three rabbits in harmony, a symbol of fertility. These works combine the auspicious symbolism of ancient Chinese culture with a sense of humour in contemporary painting.   The bags, bone china tableware and scented candles are practical with a strong artistic touch; in line with Shanghai Tang's long-standing brand DNA of integrating art into the brand.   Artist Background:   Long Di, lives in Beijing and was born into an artistic family. Before becoming a professional artist, Long Di received her MA in American History from the University of Georgia and lived and worked in New York. Her life experiences have greatly influenced her work. She is adept at exploring people's emotions in the context of contemporary urban life, and uses vivid brushstrokes to describe the romantic, ironic or dramatic moments of contemporary gender power relationships.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822918,First Hydrogen Prepares LCVs for Deployment,"Vancouver, British Columbia -  Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2023 - First Hydrogen Corp. (TSXV: FHYD) (OTC Pink: FHYDF) (FSE: FIT) (""FIRST HYDROGEN"" or the ""Company"") is completing mileage accumulation and vehicle evaluation to optimise the efficiency of its zero-emission light commercial vehicles (LCVs) ahead of the vehicles' deployment with fleet customers in March 2023. Evaluations are being conducted with powertrain specialists AVL Powertrain, which put the vehicles through a range of real-world duty cycles, including urban, rural and highways routes. Based on the vehicle weight, battery size and powertrain energy consumption, First Hydrogen's two LCVs have an expected range of 400-600km, depending on the route, on a single refuelling, which takes less than 5 minutes.   Data collected from the two hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered vehicles (FCEV) will allow First Hydrogen to accurately determine fuel consumption and vehicle range in different driving scenarios. It will enable the Company to utilize AI for predicting energy consumption, optimising fuel efficiency and identifying areas for further development. The data will capture the real-world capabilities of First Hydrogen's future zero-emission vehicles, starting with its Generation II vehicle.   The data allows comparison to simulations made for the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) testing that is part of EU law. A global standard, WLTP is used by buyers and commercial fleet managers to compare vehicles' energy consumption, emissions, and, for electric vehicles, range calculations. Tests will take place until mid-March and data analysis will follow. Initial figures are expected by mid-March 2023 and will support First Hydrogen engineers to showcase the vehicles' competitive Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), which is key information for commercial fleet managers investing in new vehicles. The data will also allow potential customers to draw true comparisons between FCEVs, battery electric vehicles and vehicles with internal combustion engines.   The tests will be completed before First Hydrogen deploys its two vans for trials with major fleet operators in the UK as part of a programme with the Aggregated Hydrogen Freight Consortium (AFHC). These operational trials offer companies, including national supermarkets, utilities, roadside assistance, and healthcare providers, the chance to experience zero-emission LCVs alongside their own fleets.   Stephen Pendrey, Chief Engineer for First Hydrogen Automotive, says: ""These tests are an important part of our vehicle development and help us to ensure the vehicle is performing as efficiently as possible and in line with expectations. The data enables us to factor in vehicle weight and payload to calculate the amount of energy used for propulsion. The results provide verifiable data on expected range per kilogram of hydrogen used. This information shows commercial vehicle owners and fleet managers the output they can expect in specific conditions and illustrates the financial benefits of switching to a FCEV.""   About First Hydrogen Corp. (FirstHydrogen.com)  First Hydrogen Corp. is a Vancouver and London UK-based company focused on zero-emission vehicles, green hydrogen production and distribution and supercritical carbon dioxide extractor systems. The Company is designing and building hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered light commercial demonstrator vehicles (""LCV"") under two agreements with AVL Powertrain and Ballard Power Systems Inc. The LCV will have a range of 500+ kilometres. At the same time, the Company has launched its bespoke vehicle design phase which will develop its fleet of proprietary zero-emission vehicles. First Hydrogen is also developing refueling capability working with FEV Consulting GmbH, the automotive consultancy of FEV Group of Aachen Germany. As well, the Company is pursuing opportunities in green hydrogen production and distribution in the UK, EU and North America.   On behalf of the Board of Directors of   FIRST HYDROGEN CORP.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822950,"Serbia, Kosovo leaders weigh EU proposals to improve ties","BRUSSELS (AP) — The leaders of Serbia and Kosovo are holding talks on Monday on European Union proposals aimed at ending a long series of political crises and setting the two on the path to better relations and ultimately mutual recognition.

            Tensions have simmered between Serbia and its former territory since Kosovo unilaterally broke away in 2008; a move recognized by many Western countries but opposed by Serbia, with the backing of Russia and China.

            Recently, those tensions flared over seemingly trivial matters like vehicle license plate formats, or the arrest of an ethnic Serb police officer, triggering renewed concern among Western leaders that a new Balkan conflict might break out just as Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its second year.











            At meetings in Brussels, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti are expected to discuss ways to put the European proposals into action. Both leaders have already discussed the plan, which hasn't been made public, and EU officials are confident of progress.

            A senior EU official said before the talks that “we need to break the vicious circle of crisis.” He said the proposals are “not the end of the road” when it comes to normalizing ties between Belgrade and Pristina, but that given recent tensions, the EU plan is the “maximum achievable at this point.”

            The official briefed reporters on the condition that he not be named because of the highly sensitive nature of the meetings. Previous talks between Vucic and Kurti have degenerated into arguments and mutual recrimination, but this time both leaders have already endorsed the proposals “in principle,” he said.

            Vucic said Sunday, before the meetings supervised by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, that he’s “ready to work on the concept and implementation of the proposed plan with clearly defined limitations.”

            He didn't specify the “limitations,” but he has repeatedly said that they include the refusal to recognize Kosovo as an independent state as well as agree to it becoming a U.N. member.

            The EU has mediated negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo since 2011, but few of the 33 agreements that have been signed were put into action. The EU and the U.S. have pressed for faster progress since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. 

            Earlier this month, hundreds of Serbian nationalists gathered in Belgrade to demand that Vucic reject the EU plan and pull out of the talks.

            Shouting “Treason” and carrying banners reading “No surrender,” the right-wing protesters blocked traffic as they gathered near the Serbian presidency building. The protesters are also strongly pro-Russia, and one banner read: “Betrayal of Kosovo is betrayal of Russia!”

            In recent months, U.S. and EU envoys have visited Pristina and Belgrade regularly to encourage them to accept the new proposals, and the two leaders met with senior EU representatives on the sidelines of a major security conference in the German city of Munich earlier this month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822951,Dilbert distributor severs ties to creator over race remarks,"Dilbert comic strip creator Scott Adams experienced possibly the biggest repercussion of his recent comments about race when distributor Andrews McMeel Universal announced Sunday it would no longer work with the cartoonist.

            Andrews McMeel Chairman Hugh Andrews and CEO and President Andy Sareyan said in a joint statement that the syndication company was “severing our relationship"" with Adams.

            In the Feb. 22 episode of his YouTube show, Adams described people who are Black as members of “a hate group” from which white people should “get away.” Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work.











            Andrews and Sareyan said Andrews McMeel supports free speech, but the comments by the cartoonist were not compatible with the core values of the company based in Kansas City, Missouri. 

            “We are proud to promote and share many different voices and perspectives. But we will never support any commentary rooted in discrimination or hate,” they said in the statement posted on the company website and Twitter.

            The creator of the long-running comic that pokes fun at office-place culture defended himself on social media against those whom he said ""hate me and are canceling me.”

            The backlash against Adams arose following comments on “Real Coffee with Scott Adams.” Among other topics, Adams used the YouTube show to reference a Rasmussen Reports survey that had asked whether people agreed with the statement “It's OK to be white.""

            Most agreed, but Adams noted that 26% of Black respondents disagreed and others weren't sure.

            The Anti-Defamation League says the phrase was popularized in 2017 as a trolling campaign by members of the discussion forum 4chan but then began being used by some white supremacists.

            Adams, who is white, repeatedly referred to people who are Black as members of a “hate group” or a “racist hate group” and said he would no longer “help Black Americans."" 

            “Based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from Black people,” Adams said on his Wednesday show. 

            In another episode of his online show Saturday, Adams said he had been making a point that “everyone should be treated as an individual” without discrimination.

            ""But you should also avoid any group that doesn’t respect you, even if there are people within the group who are fine,” Adams said. 

            Dilbert had already been dropped by several media outlets by the time of the announcement from its distributor.

            “We have decided to no longer publish the ‘Dilbert’ comic strip in our international print edition following racist comments by Scott Adams,"" said Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for The New York Times who said Dilbert was published in the international print edition but not in the U.S. edition or online.

            
                The Washington Post said it would stop publishing Dilbert in light of “Scott Adams’s recent statements promoting segregation,"" although the strip could not be prevented from running in some forthcoming print editions.

            
                The Los Angeles Times cited Adams' “racist comments” while announcing Saturday that Dilbert will be discontinued Monday in most editions and that its final run in the Sunday comics — which are printed in advance — will be March 12. 

            
                The San Antonio Express-News, which is part of Hearst Newspapers, said Saturday it will drop the Dilbert comic strip, effective Monday, “because of hateful and discriminatory public comments by its creator.” 

            
                The USA Today Network tweeted Friday that it will stop publishing Dilbert ""due to recent discriminatory comments by its creator.”

            
                The Plain Dealer in Cleveland and other publications that are part of media company Advance Local also announced they are dropping Dilbert. 

            “This is a decision based on the principles of this news organization and the community we serve,” Plain Dealer Editor Chris Quinn wrote. ”We are not a home for those who espouse racism. We certainly do not want to provide them with financial support.""

            Christopher Kelly, vice president of content for NJ Advance Media, wrote that the news organization believes in “the free and fair exchange of ideas.”

            “But when those ideas cross into hate speech, a line must be drawn,” Kelly wrote.

            Twitter CEO Elon Musk defended Adams in posts on the platform, saying the media previously ""was racist against non-white people, now they’re racist against whites & Asians.”Dilbert comic strip creator Scott Adams experienced possibly the biggest repercussion of his recent comments about race when distributor Andrews McMeel Universal announced Sunday it would no longer work with the cartoonist.Andrews McMeel Chairman Hugh Andrews and CEO and President Andy Sareyan said in a joint statement that the syndication company was “severing our relationship"" with Adams.In the Feb. 22 episode of his YouTube show, Adams described people who are Black as members of “a hate group” from which white people should “get away.” Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work.Andrews and Sareyan said Andrews McMeel supports free speech, but the comments by the cartoonist were not compatible with the core values of the company based in Kansas City, Missouri.“We are proud to promote and share many different voices and perspectives.

            The Hawks reached an agreement with Snyder on a five-year deal only five days after firing McMillan on Tuesday. The team has scheduled a news conference for Monday to introduce Snyder.











            The announcement from the team Sunday came shortly after the Hawks’ second straight win under interim coach Joe Prunty, a buzzer-beating 129-127 win over the Brooklyn Nets.

            PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Damian Lillard set franchise and career highs with 71 points — tied for the most in the NBA this season — and 13 3-pointers and the Portland Trail Blazers snapped a two-game skid with a 131-114 victory over the Houston Rockets. 

            Lillard tied Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell for the most points in a game this season after Mitchell also scored 71 in a win over Chicago on Jan. 2. Lillard broke his own franchise mark of 61 points, which he’d done twice, on a 3-pointer with 4:42 left that also topped his previous career record for 3s, which was 11. 

            Lillard’s 13 3-pointers were one shy of the NBA record set by Golden State’s Klay Thompson in 2018. Thompson’s Warriors teammate Stephen Curry (2016) and Chicago’s Zach LaVine (2019) also made 13 3s.

            MILWAUKEE (AP) — Jrue Holiday scored 33 points, Brook Lopez made a tiebreaking layup with 24.8 seconds left and the Milwaukee Bucks edged the Phoenix Suns 104-101 for their 14th consecutive victory.

            The nationally televised game didn’t include Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo or Phoenix’s Kevin Durant.

            Antetokounmpo was out with a bruised right quadriceps after leaving in the first quarter of the Bucks’ 128-99 victory over the Miami Heat on Friday. Durant has yet to appear in a game for the Suns and hasn’t played since Jan. 8 because of sprained right medial collateral ligament. 

            Lopez had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks.

            DALLAS (AP) — Anthony Davis had 30 points and 15 rebounds, including a putback dunk for the late lead, and the Los Angeles Lakers erased a 27-point deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 111-108.

            LeBron James scored 26 points as the Lakers won their fourth in five games by turning a showcase of stars from a laugher into a thriller that featured 13 lead changes in the fourth quarter.

            Luka Doncic scored 26 points for the Mavs, but the youngest of the four superstars was limited and frustrated after a 14-point first quarter that sent Dallas on its way to the huge lead. Kyrie Irving had 21 points and 11 rebounds for Dallas.

            BASEBALL

            SAN DIEGO (AP) — All-Star slugger Manny Machado has agreed to a new $350 million, 11-year contract that will keep him with the San Diego Padres through 2033, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Machado must pass a physical before the deal, which was first reported by ESPN, is finalized.

            Machado, 30, had said that after this season he planned to opt out of the $300 million, 10-year free agent deal he signed in 2019. With the $120 million he already has received, the new deal increases the free-spending Padres’ commitment to Machado to $470 million over 15 years.

            Machado finished second in the NL MVP race last year and now he'll anchor a superstar-laden lineup that includes Xander Bogaerts, Juan Soto and Fernando Tatis Jr., who can return on April 20 from an 80-game suspension for performance-enhancing drugs.

            NHL

            NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Timo Meier is going to the New Jersey Devils in the latest ante of the high-stakes poker game among Eastern Conference playoff contenders.

            Meier joins the Devils after the New York Islanders made a big acquisition, the NHL-leading Boston Bruins got bigger and tougher and the Rangers added one scorer and could get another significantly productive winger before the deadline Friday.

            New Jersey sent a 2023 first-round pick, a conditional 2024 first-rounder, forward Andreas Johnsson and prospects Shakir Mukhamadullin, Fabian Zetterlund and Nikita Okhotiuk to San Jose. In return, the Devils got Meier, defenseman Scott Harrington and prospects Timur Ibragimov, Santeri Hatakka and Zach Emond.

            Meier is under team control for at least the next year. He’s a pending restricted free agent with a $10 million qualifying offer for the 2023-24 season. The 26-year-old Swiss forward has 31 goals and 21 assists in 57 games this season. 

            NEW YORK (AP) — Rangers defenseman K’Andre Miller was given a match penalty and ejected after spitting at Kings defenseman Drew Doughty late in the first period of the Rangers’ 5-2 win Sunday.

            Miller’s absence left the Rangers with just five defensemen the remainder of the game — the second time in two days they’ve had to finish a game a player short at the position.

            After the game Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said he didn’t see the play when it happened. He said Miller told him it was ‘an accident.’ Miller was not made available to reporters following the game.

            TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The slumping Tampa Bay Lightning added an element of grit into their lineup to punch up their late-season playoff push by acquiring forward Tanner Jeannot in a trade with the Nashville Predators.

            And the Lightning paid a high price in doing so by trading away third-year defenseman Cal Foote, as well as five draft picks, including a 2025 first-round selection that is top-10 protected. Tampa Bay also traded its second-round pick in the 2024 draft, as well as its third- fourth- and fifth-round selections this year.

            The trade was completed shortly after the Lightning fell to 2-2-2 in their past six following a 7-3 loss at Pittsburgh, and comes less than a week before the NHL’s trade deadline on Friday.

            FRISCO, Texas (AP) — The Dallas Stars acquired Evgenii Dadonov from the Montreal Canadiens for Denis Gurianov in a swap of Russian forwards designed to give the Central Division leaders an offensive boost.

            Montreal is retaining half of Dadonov’s $5 million salary cap hit for the rest of the season as part of the trade. That saves Dallas some money while it sheds Gurianov’s $2.9 million.

            Dadonov, 33, has 18 points in 50 games this season for Montreal, which is in the middle of a rebuild. He does have a track record of producing offense in the NHL.

            GOLF

            PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Chris Kirk waited nearly eight years to win a PGA Tour event again. Waiting one more hole on Sunday was no problem.

            Kirk stuck his approach to the par-5 18th to tap-in range, and his birdie on the first hole of a playoff lifted him past Eric Cole for the victory at the Honda Classic. It was his fifth career win — his first since prevailing at Colonial in 2015.

            And he’ll be the last Honda winner. The car company is ending its title sponsorship of the event after 42 years, with a new sponsor set to be in place — the PGA Tour hopes, anyway — in the coming weeks.

            Kirk and Cole finished 72 holes tied at 14-under 266, Kirk shooting 69 on Sunday, Cole shooting 67.

            Kirk earned $1,512,000 for the win, and is now eligible to play the Masters again for the first time since 2016. Cole earned $915,600 for the runner-up finish, a check that more than doubles what the 34-year-old has earned in 14 previous tour starts.

            AUTO RACING

            FONTANA, Calif. (AP) — Kyle Busch sent Fontana off in style Sunday, storming up from the back after an early penalty and earning his first victory for Richard Childress Racing while winning on this Southern California track for the fifth time.

            Busch held off Chase Elliott and Ross Chastain in NASCAR’s final race on the two miles of gloriously weathered asphalt at Auto Club Speedway, which will soon be demolished to make room for a half-mile track.

            Busch drove his Chevrolet to victory in only his second race with RCR, which scooped him up in December after his 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing ended. This win was Busch’s first since Bristol last season on a dirt track, and his first on pavement since Pocono in 2021.

            With his 61st career victory, Busch earned a win in his record 19th consecutive Cup season, breaking a tie with Richard Petty.NBAATLANTA (AP) — Quin Snyder has been hired as coach of the Atlanta Hawks to replace the fired Nate McMillan.The Hawks reached an agreement with Snyder on a five-year deal only five days after firing McMillan on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822963,Shanghai Tang X Chinese Contemporary Artist Long Di Collaboration Collection: The Year of The Rabbit Collection,"SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 27 February 2023 - With the brand spirit of ""Make Life a Party"", Shanghai Tang is a luxury brand that represents the international high-end lifestyle by adhering to the core of cultural pioneers and contemporary Eastern aesthetics. Shanghai Tang has always been committed to promoting contemporary Chinese art to enrich the meaning of modern fashion and bring a fresh approach to high fashion. In recent years, SHANGHAI TANG has collaborated with Xu Bing on special collections, with Zhou Yi Lun and Chen Wei on the first concept shop ""Ji Chun"", and with Long Di on the Year of the Tiger collection, among others. Extending the legend of its founder, Sir David Tang, to promote contemporary art in China, SHANGHAI TANG continues to create opportunities for art and fashion, striving to be a central force in the development of a more profound interpretation of Eastern aesthetics.            With Art Basel just around the corner, Shanghai Tang has collaborated with artist Long Di to launch a limited-edition art collection called ""Rui Rabbit Spring"", available exclusively at Shanghai Tang online and in-store. In Chinese culture, the rabbit is often referred to as a spirit that represents prosperity and good fortune. Long Di takes inspiration from this traditional mythology and creates illustrations that portray the rabbit's auspicious symbolism in a contemporary style.   In the three limited-edition prints of the paintings, the white rabbit embraces a pink peach to signify long life and good health, the gold rabbit embraces a gold dollar to signify wealth and prosperity, and the pink rabbit transforms into countless hearts to convey that love is abundant. The postcard accompanying the print depicts a woman in and three rabbits in harmony, a symbol of fertility. These works combine the auspicious symbolism of ancient Chinese culture with a sense of humour in contemporary painting.   The bags, bone china tableware and scented candles are practical with a strong artistic touch; in line with Shanghai Tang's long-standing brand DNA of integrating art into the brand.   Artist Background:   Long Di, lives in Beijing and was born into an artistic family. Before becoming a professional artist, Long Di received her MA in American History from the University of Georgia and lived and worked in New York. Her life experiences have greatly influenced her work. She is adept at exploring people's emotions in the context of contemporary urban life, and uses vivid brushstrokes to describe the romantic, ironic or dramatic moments of contemporary gender power relationships.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822972,Taiwan's Guishan Island will reopen to tourists in March,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Starting from March 1, tourists will be able to visit Guishan Island, also known as Turtle Island, off the coast of Yilan.The small island off of Taiwan’s northeast coast has been off-limits to tourists for the past three months. Starting in March, tourists can again visit the island, but visitors will be capped at 1,800 people per day, reported UDN.

Every year, from Dec. 1 to Feb. 28, the island is closed to tourists to allow the local ecology to recuperate. The island, which resembles a large turtle on the horizon, is full of bio-diversity and the government hopes to keep the environmental impact of tourists to a minimum each year.On Feb. 28, the local government of Yilan will be hosting a Guishan Beach Cleanup event to prepare for the return of tourists to the island. The event is expected to draw about 500 people.UDN reported that last year, about 120,000 people came to visit the island. The local government asks that all visitors respect the local ecology, and try to leave as little trace of their presence as possible.Tours to Guishan can be arranged by applying to the Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area administration, on a first-come, first-served basis. The geological features around Guishan Island make it an unforgettable place to visit. A major highlight is the natural ocean hot spring, which produces clouds of sulfur beneath a sheer rock cliff along part of the island’s coast.",2023/02/27,2120,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822990,Italy migrant tragedy death toll over 60; dozens missing,"STECCATO DI CUTRO, Italy (AP) — The death toll rose to 62 in the migrant tragedy off Italy's southern coast after rescue crews recovered three more bodies Monday, driving home once again the desperate and dangerous boat crossings of people seeking to reach Europe. Dozens more were believed to be missing.

            At least seven children perished after a wooden boat broke up in stormy seas on the shoals off the Calabrian coast Sunday. Another 80 people survived, but more were feared dead given survivor reports that the boat, which set off from Turkey last week, had carried about 170 people.

            Authorities in the southern city of Crotone asked relatives to provide descriptions and photos of their loved ones through a dedicated email and phone line to help identify the dead, who were being housed in a makeshift morgue at a sports arena.











            Fazal Amin, himself a migrant from Pakistan, waited outside the stadium in Crotone on Monday in search of information about a friend's brother in Turkey whose phone stopped working.

            “He just wants to know if he is dead or alive,” Amin said.

            Italian authorities rejected criticism of a delayed rescue, noting they had dispatched two rescue boats shortly after the European Union’s border agency spotted the 20-foot (6-meter) boat Saturday night as it headed toward shore. The boats had to turn back given the rough seas. 

            The beach at Steccato di Cutro, on Calabria’s Ionian coast, was littered with the splintered remains of the migrant vessel as well as the belongings its passengers had brought with them, including a toddler’s tiny pink sneaker, Mickey Mouse pajama pants and a yellow plastic pencil case decorated with pandas. 

            There were only a few life jackets scattered amid the debris. 

            The United Nations and Doctors Without Borders, which had crews on the scene, said many of the victims were Afghans, including members of large families, as well as Pakistanis and Iraqis. Afghans were the second top nationality to seek asylum in the EU last year, and have increasingly fled the spiraling security, humanitarian and economic troubles that followed the Taliban takeover in August 2021. 

            On Monday, two coast guard vessels searched the seas north to south off Steccato di Cutro while a helicopter flew overhead and a four-wheel vehicle patrolled the beach. A strong wind whipped the seas that still churned up splinters of the boat, gas tanks, food containers and shoes. 

            Firefighters confirmed three more bodies had been recovered Monday morning, but held out little hope for finding survivors.

            “I think no, because the sea conditions are too difficult,” said provincial fire Cmdr. Roberto Fasano. “But we can never abandon this hope.” 

            Italy’s Sky TG24 said at least three people had been detained on suspicion they helped organize the trip from Izmir, Turkey. 

            Italy is a prime destination for migrant smugglers, especially for traffickers launching boats from Libyan shores, but also from Turkey. According to U.N. figures, arrivals from the Turkish route accounted for 15% of the 105,000 migrants who arrived on Italian shores last year, with nearly half of those fleeing from Afghanistan.

            Would-be refugees leaving Turkey have increasingly taken the more lengthy and dangerous Mediterranean journey to Italy to avoid Greece, where authorities have been repeatedly accused of pushing back migrant boats to Turkey. Overcrowded refugee camps in Greece and the increasing difficulty to join family in Western and Northern Europe have also led more people to pay smugglers thousands of euros to get straight to Italy instead.

            The dynamic of the disaster was still coming into focus Monday. The EU’s Frontex border agency confirmed it had spotted the ship heading toward the Calabrian coast on Saturday at 10:26 p.m. and alerted Italian authorities, who dispatched two patrol boats. It said the ship, while “heavily overcrowded,” showed no signs of distress.

            The Frontex plane left the scene at 11:11 p.m. because of a fuel shortage, according to the agency, which also confirmed to The Associated Press that the Italian patrol boats had to turn back because of rough weather conditions.

            The rescue operation was declared early Sunday after the busted-up remains of the boat were discovered on the shore near Crotone, Frontex said. 

            Interior Minister Matteo Piatedosi defended the rescue amid criticism that the migrants had been essentially abandoned. A placard outside the makeshift morgue in Crotone on Monday read: “People at risk at sea must be rescued. Assassins!”

            “It was impossible to conduct any possible maneuver to get close (to the migrant ship) or to carry out a rescue due to the sea conditions,"" Piatedosi told reporters late Sunday. ""We always have to consider that rescues carried out by institutional rescue teams must avoid putting at risk the lives of the rescuers while they are trying to rescue others.”

            Firefighter Inspector Giuseppe Larosa said the first rescue crews to arrive were devastated by how many children had drowned, and observed that the bodies of the dead had scratches all over them, as if they had tried to hang onto the boat to save themselves.

            “It was a spine-chilling scene,"" Larosa said on the beach Monday morning. He said the reaction of the survivors haunted him. 

            “The thing that struck me the most was their silence,"" he said. “The terror in their eyes and the fact that they were mute. Silent.”

            The mayor of Cutro declared a day of mourning Monday, with flags on public buildings at half-staff. A city ordinance invited all residents, and especially schoolchildren, to observe a minute of silence at 11 a.m.

            Italy's government under Premier Giorgia Meloni has focused on trying to block migrant boats from departing, while discouraging humanitarian rescue teams from working in the central Mediterranean where Libyan-based smugglers operate. Meloni said Sunday that the government was committed to that policy “above all by insisting on the maximum collaboration with the countries of origin and departure.”

            Italy has complained bitterly for years that fellow EU countries have balked at taking in migrants, many of whom are aiming to find family or work in northern Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a redoubling of efforts to deal with the problem. 

            “The resulting loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy,” she said in a tweet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822991,"Ensemble, assemble! 'Everything' cast celebrates SAG triumph","LOS ANGELES (AP) — All at once, they were everywhere. 

            After claiming their biggest triumph yet in an awards season full of them — the Screen Actors Guild Award for best ensemble to go with three of the four individual film SAG Awards — the cast of “Everything Everywhere All at Once"" was supposed to head backstage as a group to be led through the kitchen at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles and into the area where a horde of cameras awaited winners. 

            But like the multiple versions of multiverse characters in the film that has become the Oscars favorite for best picture, the cast members — including best female actor winner Michelle Yeoh, best supporting male actor winner Ke Huy Quan and best supporting female actor winner Jamie Lee Curtis — scattered all over the place, some back into the audience, some to the bathroom, some who-knows where. 











            Of the top-billed cast, only 94-year-old James Hong showed up backstage, where an Associated Press reporter was waiting to embed with them on their victory lap. Hong, as the senior member, gave the last speech of the night and took full advantage, talking at length about his 70 years as a member of the acting guild.

            “I hope I will come back when I’m 100 years old!” Hong said to close his speech. 

            Andy Le and Brian Le, who play minor but menacing martial artists in the film, were nothing but gentle as they each took one of Hong's arms and helped him down the makeshift stairs at the back of the stage and into the hallway. 

            Mark Wahlberg, who had just given the cast the night's biggest award, greeted Hong. 

            “I just wanted to say hi,” Wahlberg said with a smile. “You are truly a legend. You brought the house down.” 

            Hong, Le and Le slowly made their way through the kitchen and back into the spotlight of the media room, where castmate Tallie Medel awaited them. 

            Curtis, an upset winner over Angela Bassett in her category, was next to appear, holding one of the blue, stone SAG statuettes and wearing a red gown. 

            “Alright, I’m here sorry, sorry, I had to pee!” she said. 

            Jenny Slate, who plays Debbie the Dog mom, Yeoh's laundromat customer-turned fighting foe in the film, emerged from another hallway, as did Harry Shum Jr. 

            Yeoh then burst through a door from the ballroom like a gowned version of one of the many action heroes she has played through the decades. 

            She was followed soon after by Quan, who played several incarnations of her husband in the film. 

            “Coming everyone!” Quan shouted as he bounded gleefully into his castmates.

            Photographers began shooting pictures, but Curtis wouldn't have it until the whole ensemble had assembled. Stephanie Hsu, who plays Yeoh's daughter and antagonist in the film and was also nominated in Curtis' category, was not among them yet. 

            “Wait wait wait, wait until Stephanie is here!” Curtis said. Pointing at each person shooting photos, she said, “You, put the camera down, you, put the camera down. Not without Stephanie.” 

            While they waited, they noticed Brendan Fraser, best male actor winner for “The Whale,” standing nearby with his trophy, looking overwhelmed. Several walked over to celebrate him. 

            “I’m so glad I got to watch you have this beautiful moment,"" Slate told him. 

            Quan reached up and gave the much larger Fraser an enthusiastic hug. 

            “You made me cry again!” Fraser told Quan, who had given a tearful speech about becoming the first Asian actor to win his award. 

            Quan, who like Fraser has made a dramatic comeback after a long Hollywood hiatus, is likely to get another opportunity at the Academy Awards on March 12. 

            After also taking the top prizes at the Directors Guild and Producers Guild awards, it would be a stunner if any film other than “Everything Everywhere” wins best picture at the Oscars. 

            When Hsu finally appeared, Curtis told the photographers to shoot away. 

            The cast shouted for Fraser join them for photos. Hesitating at first, he gave in and joined them, his eyes beaming. “We did it!” he said as they smiled for cameras. 

            The group has won so many awards, it was becoming hard to keep track of them. 

            “I put one down and it's lost,” Curtis said. 

            “Wait, Michelle has two!” someone shouted. 

            Quan, Yeoh and Curtis then posed individually while holding an award in each hand. Curtis handed one to Hong, who pretended he couldn't bear its weight before cradling the statue like a baby. 

            Daniel Scheinert, the film's co-director with Daniel Kwan, watched from the side and stayed out of pictures, letting his actors have the stage on this night. 

            When Yeoh saw Scheinert, she hurried over and hugged him. Several photographers descended on the duo. Scheinert didn't stop them, pointing out he had been an actor of sorts in his movie. 

            “I had a cameo,” he said. “That counts.”

Hong, as the senior member, gave the last speech of the night and took full advantage, talking at length about his 70 years as a member of the acting guild.“I hope I will come back when I’m 100 years old!” Hong said to close his speech.Andy Le and Brian Le, who play minor but menacing martial artists in the film, were nothing but gentle as they each took one of Hong's arms and helped him down the makeshift stairs at the back of the stage and into the hallway.Mark Wahlberg, who had just given the cast the night's biggest award, greeted Hong.“I just wanted to say hi,” Wahlberg said with a smile. “You are truly a legend.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822992,North Korea holds rare meeting on farming amid food shortage,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened a major political conference dedicated to agriculture, state media reported Monday, as outside assessments suggest the country is facing a serious shortfall of food.

            South Korean experts estimate that North Korea is short around 1 million tons of grain, nearly 20 percent of its annual demand, after the pandemic likely disrupted unofficial grain imports from China and the government has restricted food sales at markets.

            Recent, unconfirmed reports in South Korean media have said that some North Koreans have died of hunger. But most experts have seen no indication of mass deaths or famine in North Korea. 











            During a high-level meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party that began Sunday, senior party officials reviewed last year’s work on state goals to accomplish “rural revolution in the new era,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported.

            The report said that the plenary meeting of the party’s Central Committee will identify “immediate, important” tasks on agricultural issues and “urgent tasks arising at the present stage of the national economic development.” 

            KCNA didn’t say whether Kim spoke during the meeting or how long it would last. Senior officials such as Cabinet Premier Kim Tok Hun and Jo Yong Won, one of Kim’s closest aides who handles the Central Committee’s organizational affairs, also attended.

            Plenary meetings are key decision-making venues for the Workers’ Party. In recent years, Kim has held a plenary meeting two to four times a year to formulate major policies.

            It is the first time the party has convened a plenary session only to discuss agriculture. Monday’s report didn’t elaborate on its agenda, but the party’s Politburo said earlier this month that “a turning point is needed to dynamically promote radical change in agricultural development.”

            Most analysts say North Korea’s food situation today is nowhere near the extremes of the 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of people died in a famine. However, some experts say its food insecurity is likely at its worst since Kim took power in 2011, after COVID-19 restrictions further shocked an economy battered by decades of mismanagement and crippling U.S.-led sanctions imposed over Kim’s nuclear program. Russia’s war on Ukraine possibly worsened the situation by driving up global prices of food, energy and fertilizer.

            It’s unclear whether North Korea will take any significant steps to address food shortages. The impoverished country devotes much of its scarce resources to its nuclear program.

            “To produce more grains, they should increase inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural machines. But North Korea rarely comes up with such measures,” said Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University in South Korea. “They have a limited budget. They can still take such steps (to produce more grain) with the money they’re spending on its missile development program.”

            North Korea has accelerated missile tests since last year, launching more than 70 missiles, many of them nuclear-capable weapons that place the U.S. mainland, South Korea and Japan within striking distance.

            Nam said the current food problems don’t pose a serious political threat to Kim, noting that his family’s rule wasn’t shaken even during the 1990s famine. 

            Last year, North Korea’s grain production was estimated at 4.5 million tons, a 3.8% drop from a year earlier according to South Korean government assessments. The North was estimated to have produced between 4.4 million tons to 4.8 million tons of grain annually from 2012-2021, according to previous South Korean data.

            North Korea needs about 5.5 million tons of grain to feed its 25 million people annually, so it’s short about 1 million tons this year. In past years, half of such a gap was usually met by unofficial grain purchases from China, with the rest remaining as unresolved shortfall, according to Kwon Tae-jin, a senior economist at the private GS&J Institute in South Korea.

            Kwon says trade curbs due to the pandemic have likely hindered unofficial rice purchases from China. Efforts by North Korean authorities to tighten controls and restrict market activities have also worsened the situation, he said.

            South Korea’s Unification Ministry said the North’s current food shortage is more an issue of distribution than an absolute shortage, because much of the grain harvested last year has not been consumed yet.

            Ministry officials said that the North’s food insecurity has worsened as authorities tightened controls over private grain sales in markets, instead trying to confine the grain trade to state-run facilities.

            With the country’s factory and machinery sectors likely decimated by the border controls, Kim has been focusing on boosting grain production and reviving construction and other sectors that are less dependent on imported materials. Some experts say Kim likely aims to burnish his image as a leader who cares for public livelihoods as he seeks public support of his fight against U.S.-led sanctions and pressure campaigns. 

            State media reported that Kim and his “beloved” daughter broke ground Saturday on a project to build thousands of new homes in the Sopho district of Pyongyang, the capital. It was the seventh known public activity involving Kim’s daughter, believed to about 10 years old, since she made her first public appearance in November.

            Last year, North Korea reopened freight train traffic with China and Russia and relaxed domestic restrictions, after it made a highly dubious claim that it had overcome the pandemic only three months after it acknowledged its first domestic outbreak. Analysts say it’s still unlikely that North Korea will completely end its curbs any time soon because many of its people remain unvaccinated and its public health care system is largely broken.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened a major political conference dedicated to agriculture, state media reported Monday, as outside assessments suggest the country is facing a serious shortfall of food.South Korean experts estimate that North Korea is short around 1 million tons of grain, nearly 20 percent of its annual demand, after the pandemic likely disrupted unofficial grain imports from China and the government has restricted food sales at markets.Recent, unconfirmed reports in South Korean media have said that some North Koreans have died of hunger.

            Cologne-Bonn airport said that all but two of the day's 136 planned flights wouldn't depart from or arrive there, German news agency dpa reported. In Dusseldorf, only 89 of the planned 330 flights were expected to take place as scheduled, with most of the rest being canceled.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822994,Pakistani police arrest prominent Imran Khan supporter,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani police arrested Monday a retired army general and prominent supporter of former Prime Minister Imran Khan on charges of inciting the public and government employees against national institutions, officials said. 

            The charge against retired Gen. Amjad Shoaib, which carries a seven-year sentence, came after he appeared on Pakistani BOL news channel on Saturday criticizing authorities for keeping Khan’s supporters jailed, especially in remote areas of the country. 

            They were arrested amid Khan’s latest campaign dubbed “fill the jail cells” with detainees — or “jail bharo” in Urdu — as a way to pressure the government into holding early elections. 











            Last Wednesday in the former premier's hometown of Lahore and some other urban areas, Khan’s supporters protested, hopped into police vans and posed for cameras, taunting police to arrest them en masse and defying a ban on rallies. 

            Police mostly stayed back but at least 200 Khan supporters were arrested in different places in eastern Punjab province and elsewhere, as Khan's supporters had aimed for.

            In his TV appearance, Shoaib allegedly urged civil servants to refuse to do their duties. The charge against him claims Shoaib's remarks were part of a “planned conspiracy"" to weaken the country. Shoaib does not hold any office in Khan’s party. 

            Fawad Chaudhry, a senior leader from Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf opposition party, condemned the arrest of the 80-year-old Shoaib, saying such actions would “bring nothing but more hatred and anxiety."" 

            Shahbaz Sharif replaced Khan as prime minister after the former cricket star turned Islamist politician was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament in April 2022. 

            Since then, Khan — who has claimed his ouster was a conspiracy backed by the U.S. — has been seeking early elections. Washington and Sharif have denied Khan's claims and Sharif has rejected calls for early elections, saying the vote would be held as planned later this year. 

            Sharif's government has struggled with lingering political instability but also a surge in militant attacks and violence over the past months across the country. 

            On Monday, suspected militants killed four workers and wounded three others at a coal mine in southwestern Pakistan, according to police official Syed Akbar. No one claimed responsibility for the attack in Harnai, a district in restive Baluchistan province that is home to most of the region's coal mines.

            Separately, a shootout left two soldiers and two militants dead following a raid in North Waziristan, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the military said. Waziristan was a base for the Pakistani Taliban until the army claimed to have cleared the region of insurgents. However, attacks have continued, raising concerns the Pakistani Taliban are regrouping there.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823019,"France to unveil new economic, military strategy in Africa","PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron will unveil on Monday his country's changing economic and military strategy in Africa for the coming years, as France's influence substantially declines on the continent.

            Macron is expected to call for a more balanced partnership with African nations, in a speech at the Elysee presidential palace before he begins an ambitious Africa trip on Wednesday to Gabon, Angola, the Republic of Congo and Congo.

            Monday's speech comes at a time when France’s influence on the continent is facing more challenges than it has in decades. 











            In less than a year, French troops had to withdraw from Mali, which turned instead to Russian military contractors, and most recently from Burkina Faso, which also appears to increasingly look towards Moscow. 

            A growing anti-France sentiment has led to street protests in several West and North African countries against the former colonial power.

            In addition, historical economic ties that France had with the region are being challenged by the growing commercial presence of Russia, China and Turkey.

            “It’s not a trip that aims at getting into the race to regain a regretted influence,"" a top official with the French presidency said. The trip isn't aimed to “try to get back to the past. It’s more to respond to a demand for partnership, for relations, but with new methods and a new approach,” he said.

            The official was speaking on condition of anonymity in line with the French presidency's customary practices. 

            Macron is notably expected to detail changes that France will bring in its military deployment in the Sahel region.

            Last year, he announced the formal end of the so-called Barkhane military force after France withdrew its troops from Mali. French operations to help fight Islamic extremists in the Sahel region are now focusing mostly on Niger and Chad, where the country still has about 3,000 troops.

            Macron in recent years insisted any French presence in Africa should be based on a “partnership” as part of efforts to move away from post-colonial interference. 

            “Faced with the strategic threats ahead, whether it’s war in Ukraine, economic shock, pandemic shock, it’s crucial that Europe and Africa are as aligned as possible and get, let’s say, as intimate as possible in their dialogue,"" the French official said.

            Macron, 45, is the first French president born after the colonial era. He has previously sought to extend France’s cooperation with English-speaking countries, like Ghana and Kenya, and increase French investments in Africa’s private sector.

            During this week’s tour, he will notably visit Portuguese-speaking Angola, with the aim to develop links especially in the fields of agriculture and food industry as well as energy, including oil and gas. 

            Yet Macron's tour this week in central Africa already faces questions.

            Some opposition activists in Gabon have denounced his visit, which they perceive as offering support to President Ali Bongo Ondimba - whose family has ruled since the 1960s - ahead of presidential election later this year. 

            Similar questions have been raised in Congo ahead of a December presidential election there. 

            “Before, during and after this trip, the president of the republic, like all French authorities, will show strict neutrality regarding these elections,"" the French top official said. 

            The Elysee stressed Macron is traveling to Gabon mainly to attend a major climate-related summit focusing on the preservation of forests.

            He will also seek to show France's commitment to improving economic and cultural relations with two French-speaking countries - neighbors Republic of Congo and Congo - through talks with authorities as well as with ordinary citizens, entrepreneurs, artists and activists, according to the Elysee.PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron will unveil on Monday his country's changing economic and military strategy in Africa for the coming years, as France's influence substantially declines on the continent.Macron is expected to call for a more balanced partnership with African nations, in a speech at the Elysee presidential palace before he begins an ambitious Africa trip on Wednesday to Gabon, Angola, the Republic of Congo and Congo.Monday's speech comes at a time when France’s influence on the continent is facing more challenges than it has in decades.In less than a year, French troops had to withdraw from Mali, which turned instead to Russian military contractors, and most recently from Burkina Faso, which also appears to increasingly look towards Moscow.A growing anti-France sentiment has led to street protests in several West and North African countries against the former colonial power.In addition, historical economic ties that France had with the region are being challenged by the growing commercial presence of Russia, China and Turkey.“It’s not a trip that aims at getting into the race to regain a regretted influence,"" a top official with the French presidency said. The trip isn't aimed to “try to get back to the past. It’s more to respond to a demand for partnership, for relations, but with new methods and a new approach,” he said.The official was speaking on condition of anonymity in line with the French presidency's customary practices.Macron is notably expected to detail changes that France will bring in its military deployment in the Sahel region.Last year, he announced the formal end of the so-called Barkhane military force after France withdrew its troops from Mali.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823028,Andrew Tate to appeal third arrest extension in Romania,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Andrew Tate, the divisive social media influencer and former professional kickboxer who is detained in Romania on suspicion of organized crime and human trafficking, arrived Monday at an appeals court in the capital Bucharest to challenge a decision last week to extend for a third time his detention by 30 days.

            Tate, 36, a British-U.S. citizen known for misogynistic views who has 5.2 million Twitter followers, arrived at the Bucharest Court of Appeal handcuffed to his brother Tristan, who is held in the same case. Two Romanian women in the case are also under house arrest.

            The Tates, who were initially detained in Bucharest in late December, will look to overturn a judge’s Feb. 21 decision to extend their detention by 30 days for a third time at the request of prosecutors. If the court rules against them Monday, they will remain in custody until at least late March. 











            The brothers have already lost two previous appeals against prior 30-day extensions that have kept them behind bars while investigations continued. None of the four has yet been formally charged.

            A document explaining an earlier decision to keep them in jail said the judge took into account the “particular dangerousness of the defendants” and their capacity to identify victims “with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities.”

            Tate, who has lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech. He has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence and alleged their case is a “political” conspiracy designed to silence him.

            Romania’s anti-organized crime agency said in a statement after the December arrests that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were subjected to “acts of physical violence and mental coercion” and were sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group.

            The agency said victims were lured with pretenses of love and later intimidated, placed under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for the financial gain of the crime group.

            In January, Romanian authorities descended on a compound near Bucharest linked with the Tate brothers and towed away a fleet of luxury cars that included a Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Porsche. They reported seizing assets worth an estimated $3.9 million.

            Prosecutors have said that if they can prove the cars’ owners gained money through illicit activities such as human trafficking, the assets would be used to cover the expenses of the investigation and to compensate victims. Tate also unsuccessfully appealed the asset seizure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823029,'An absurdity': Experts slam WHO excusal of sex misconduct,"GOMA, Congo (AP) — Two experts appointed by the World Health Organization to investigate allegations that some of its staffers sexually abused women during an Ebola outbreak in Congo dismissed the U.N. agency’s own efforts to excuse its handling of such misconduct as “an absurdity” on Monday, saying they were not satisfied that no senior officials have been fired.

            Some of the victimized women say — nearly four years later — they are still waiting for the WHO to terminate those responsible or be offered any financial compensation.

            In October 2020, Aichatou Mindaoudou and Julienne Lusenge were named by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to head a panel investigating reports that some WHO staffers sexually abused or exploited women in a conflict-ridden region of Congo during the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak.











            
                Their review found there were at least 83 perpetrators of abuse who worked for WHO and partners, including complaints of rape, forced abortions and the sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl, in the biggest known sex abuse scandal in the U.N. health agency’s history.

            The panel also found that three WHO managers mismanaged a sexual misconduct case first reported by the Associated Press, involving a U.N. doctor signing a contract to buy land for a woman he allegedly impregnated.

            A confidential U.N. report submitted to the WHO last month concluded that the managers’ handling of that case didn't violate WHO’s sexual exploitation policies, because the woman wasn't considered a beneficiary of WHO aid since she didn't receive any humanitarian assistance.

            “The restrictive approach favored by WHO is an absurdity,” Mindaoudou and Lusenge said in a statement, adding that any gaps or ambiguity in those policies should be weighed in favor of the victim to ensure the agency is held accountable.

            Anifa, a Congolese woman who worked at an Ebola clinic in northeastern Congo, said she was offered a job at double her salary in exchange for sex with a WHO doctor and was still traumatized by the experience.

            “How many times do I have to speak before (the doctors) at WHO responsible for the sexual abuse are punished?” she asked. “If WHO does not take radical measures, we will conclude that the organization has been made rotten by rapists.”

            Anifa, who didn't share her last name for fear of reprisals, said she didn't expect any financial compensation from the WHO, explaining that “money will not erase the wounds I have in my heart.” She reported the alleged misconduct to the WHO in 2019, but never received a response.

            WHO chief Tedros has said repeatedly the agency has a “zero tolerance” policy for sexual misconduct. 

            Mindaoudou, a former government minister in Niger and Lusenge, a human rights activist in Congo, also slammed the WHO for its failure to punish any senior staffers linked to the abuse. 

            “We are not satisfied,” they told the AP. “The ‘zero tolerance policy’ does not mean engaging in subterfuge to make sure no one is responsible for sexual abuse and exploitation.”

            Paula Donovan, who co-leads Code Blue, which seeks to hold the U.N. accountable for sexual offenses, said it was striking that experts appointed by the WHO itself were so openly critical of the agency.

            “Two courageous African women exposed sky-high levels of tolerance for misogyny and racism at the top of WHO,” she said. “Now it’s up to governments to launch their own truly independent investigation into the organization’s leaders, beginning with Dr. Tedros, to root out the poison infecting WHO.”

            When allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation surfaced in the press in September 2020, Tedros said he was “outraged” and that anyone found to be involved would face serious consequences. WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan claimed the agency had “absolutely no details” of the abuse.

            But the internal U.N. report noted that Tedros was informed of sexual abuse allegations in 2019 and that some cases of alleged misconduct were discussed by senior WHO staff shortly after they occurred. 

            The WHO has refused to comment on the internal U.N. report and the agency created a new department to prevent misconduct after the Congo sex abuse scandal. Dr. Gaya Gamhewage, who heads that work, told U.N. investigators that prior to being appointed, “sexual exploitation and abuse were not familiar terms to her.”

            Tedros said earlier this month that the agency has established a $2 million fund to help survivors of sexual abuse in Congo, but it's unclear how many women have obtained assistance.

            Jeanette, a woman who says she was impregnated by a WHO doctor while working at an Ebola center in Butembo, said she was pressured into having an abortion, which nearly killed her. She said she is waiting for the WHO to punish the doctor responsible for her pregnancy and has had no offers of financial compensation.

            “I don’t have the strength to work since the abortion,” she said. “WHO should know that their staffers are flatterers, freeloaders and liars.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823030,"Egypt's top diplomat in Damascus, meets with Syria's Assad","DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Egypt's foreign minister Monday met with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus and promised to deliver more aid to the quake-hit country.

            Sameh Shoukry is Egypt's most senior official to visit Syria since 2011, a day after Cairo's parliament speaker, Hanafy el-Gebaly, and a delegation of top Arab lawmakers visited Assad in a push to end Syria’s political isolation. 

            Syria was suspended from the Arab League in 2011 after Assad’s government cracked down brutally on mass protests against his rule — an uprising that quickly descended into a brutal civil war. The conflict has killed over 300,000 people and displaced half the country’s population of 23 million.











            Though several Arab countries began to rekindle ties with Assad in recent years, the process intensified after this month's massive earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria and killed more than 47,000 people, including over 1,400 people in government-controlled areas of Syria and more than 2,400 in the rebel-held northwest. The quake further compounded the war-torn country's deep economic crisis.

            Egypt, Jordan Saudi Arabia are among U.S. allies in the Middle East that have delivered quake aid to government-held areas in Syria. The United Arab Emirates sent more aid-loaded planes than any other nation, including Syria’s key allies Russia and Iran. 

            Shoukry told the media after meeting Assad and also his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad,that Egypt has thus far sent 1,500 tons of humanitarian aid.

            “We will continue to provide whatever humanitarian aid we can,” Shoukry said. When asked about why Cairo has not yet normalized ties with Damascus, he responded by saying his visit was “first and foremost humanitarian”. 

            Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi spoke with Assad over the phone on less than 48 hours after the earthquake hit, the first time the two had spoken in over a decade. For years, many public figures in Egypt have called on el-Sissi’s government to strengthen relations with Syria. Shoukry has also pushed for Damascus’s return to the Cairo-based Arab League.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823039,"UK says Sunak, von der Leyen seal deal to fix EU trade spat","LONDON (AP) — The U.K. and the European Union ended years of wrangling on Monday, sealing a deal to resolve their thorny post-Brexit trade dispute over Northern Ireland.

            British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the “decisive breakthrough” marked a “new chapter” in the U.K.-EU relationship.

            Sunak and and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed off on the deal at a meeting in Windsor England. Von der Leyen told a news conference it was “historic what we have achieved today.”











            The agreement, which will allow goods to flow freely to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K., ends a dispute that has soured U.K.-EU relations, sparked the collapse of the Belfast-based regional government and shaken Northern Ireland’s decades-old peace process.

            Fixing it is a big victory for Sunak — but not the end of his troubles. Selling the deal to his own Conservative Party and its Northern Ireland allies may be a tougher struggle. Now Sunak awaits the judgment of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, which is boycotting the region’s power-sharing government until the trade arrangements are changed to its satisfaction.

            Sunak is due to make a statement to the House of Commons later setting out details of the deal.

            Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member, the Republic of Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc in 2020, the two sides agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process.

            Instead there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. That angered British unionist politicians in Belfast, who say the new trade border in the Irish Sea undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.

            The Democratic Unionist Party collapsed Northern Ireland’s Protestant-Catholic power-sharing government a year ago in protest and has refused to return until the rules are scrapped or substantially rewritten.

            The DUP has stayed largely silent in recent days, saying it needs to see the details of a deal before deciding whether it meets the party’s self-imposed tests.

            DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said he was “neither positive nor negative” about the deal but would wait to see the details.

            Hints of compromise towards the EU also have sparked opposition from hard-line euroskeptics who form a powerful bloc in Sunak’s governing Conservative Party. Critics include former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who as leader at the time of Brexit signed off on the trade rules that he now derides. Johnson was ousted by the Conservatives last year over ethics scandals, but is widely believed to hope for a comeback.

            Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent pro-Brexit Tory lawmaker, said acceptance of any deal “will all depend"" on the DUP. ""If the DUP are against it, I think there will be quite a significant number of Conservatives who are unhappy,” Rees-Moog said.

            In a boost for Sunak’s chances of winning Conservative support, lawmaker Steve Baker — a self-styled “Brexit hardman” who helped topple Prime Minister Theresa May by opposing her Brexit deal in 2019 — said Sunak was “on the cusp of securing a really fantastic result.”

            Sunak has said Parliament will get to debate any deal he strikes, but he hasn't promised lawmakers a binding vote on it, and no vote in Parliament is expected this week.

            Relations between the U.K. and the EU, severely tested during the long Brexit divorce, chilled still further amid disputes over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The U.K. government introduced a bill that would let it unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, a move the EU called illegal. The bloc accused the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty it had signed.

            The mood between London and Brussels improved after Sunak, a pragmatic Brexit supporter, took office in October, replacing more belligerent predecessors — Johnson and Liz Truss.

            A deal is likely to remove customs checks on the vast majority of goods moving between the U.K. and Northern Ireland and to give Northern Ireland lawmakers some say over EU rules that apply there as part of the Protocol.

            The thorniest issue is the role of the European Court of Justice in resolving any disputes that arise over the rules.

            The U.K. and the EU agreed in their Brexit divorce deal to give the European court that authority. But the DUP and Conservative Brexiteers insist the court must have no jurisdiction in U.K. matters.

            After sealing the deal, Von der Leyen is due to have tea Monday with King Charles III at Windsor Castle, 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of London. Buckingham Palace said the meeting was taking place on the government’s advice, leading critics to accuse Sunak of dragging the monarch, who is supposed to remain neutral, into a political row.

            Follow AP’s coverage of Brexit at https://apnews.com/hub/brexit and of British politics at https://apnews.com/hub/british-politicsLONDON (AP) — The U.K. and the European Union ended years of wrangling on Monday, sealing a deal to resolve their thorny post-Brexit trade dispute over Northern Ireland.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the “decisive breakthrough” marked a “new chapter” in the U.K.-EU relationship.Sunak and and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed off on the deal at a meeting in Windsor England. Von der Leyen told a news conference it was “historic what we have achieved today.”The agreement, which will allow goods to flow freely to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K., ends a dispute that has soured U.K.-EU relations, sparked the collapse of the Belfast-based regional government and shaken Northern Ireland’s decades-old peace process.Fixing it is a big victory for Sunak — but not the end of his troubles. Selling the deal to his own Conservative Party and its Northern Ireland allies may be a tougher struggle. Now Sunak awaits the judgment of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, which is boycotting the region’s power-sharing government until the trade arrangements are changed to its satisfaction.Sunak is due to make a statement to the House of Commons later setting out details of the deal.Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member, the Republic of Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc in 2020, the two sides agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process.Instead there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. That angered British unionist politicians in Belfast, who say the new trade border in the Irish Sea undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.The Democratic Unionist Party collapsed Northern Ireland’s Protestant-Catholic power-sharing government a year ago in protest and has refused to return until the rules are scrapped or substantially rewritten.The DUP has stayed largely silent in recent days, saying it needs to see the details of a deal before deciding whether it meets the party’s self-imposed tests.DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said he was “neither positive nor negative” about the deal but would wait to see the details.Hints of compromise towards the EU also have sparked opposition from hard-line euroskeptics who form a powerful bloc in Sunak’s governing Conservative Party. Critics include former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who as leader at the time of Brexit signed off on the trade rules that he now derides. Johnson was ousted by the Conservatives last year over ethics scandals, but is widely believed to hope for a comeback.Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent pro-Brexit Tory lawmaker, said acceptance of any deal “will all depend"" on the DUP. ""If the DUP are against it, I think there will be quite a significant number of Conservatives who are unhappy,” Rees-Moog said.In a boost for Sunak’s chances of winning Conservative support, lawmaker Steve Baker — a self-styled “Brexit hardman” who helped topple Prime Minister Theresa May by opposing her Brexit deal in 2019 — said Sunak was “on the cusp of securing a really fantastic result.”Sunak has said Parliament will get to debate any deal he strikes, but he hasn't promised lawmakers a binding vote on it, and no vote in Parliament is expected this week.Relations between the U.K. and the EU, severely tested during the long Brexit divorce, chilled still further amid disputes over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The U.K. government introduced a bill that would let it unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, a move the EU called illegal. The bloc accused the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty it had signed.The mood between London and Brussels improved after Sunak, a pragmatic Brexit supporter, took office in October, replacing more belligerent predecessors — Johnson and Liz Truss.A deal is likely to remove customs checks on the vast majority of goods moving between the U.K. and Northern Ireland and to give Northern Ireland lawmakers some say over EU rules that apply there as part of the Protocol.The thorniest issue is the role of the European Court of Justice in resolving any disputes that arise over the rules.The U.K. and the EU agreed in their Brexit divorce deal to give the European court that authority. But the DUP and Conservative Brexiteers insist the court must have no jurisdiction in U.K. matters.After sealing the deal, Von der Leyen is due to have tea Monday with King Charles III at Windsor Castle, 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of London. Buckingham Palace said the meeting was taking place on the government’s advice, leading critics to accuse Sunak of dragging the monarch, who is supposed to remain neutral, into a political row.“I cannot quite believe that No. 10 would ask HM the King to become involved in the finalising of a deal as controversial as this one. It’s crass and will go down very badly in NI,” former Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said on Twitter.Sunak’s spokesman, Max Blain, said the government “would never” embroil the king in politics.“His Majesty has met with a number of foreign leaders recently,” he said, including Polish President Andrzej Duda and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “This is no different.”___Follow AP’s coverage of Brexit at https://apnews.com/hub/brexit and of British politics at https://apnews.com/hub/british-politics",2023/02/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823040,"New quake hits Turkey, toppling more buildings: 1 killed","ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A magnitude 5.6 earthquake shook southern Turkey on Monday, three weeks after a catastrophic temblor devastated the region, causing some already damaged buildings to collapse and killing at least one person, authorities said.

            More than 100 people were injured as a result of Monday's quake which was centered in the town of Yesilyurt in Malatya province, Yunus Sezer, the chief of the country’s disaster management agency, AFAD, told reporters. More than two dozen buildings collapsed. 

            A father and daughter who were trapped beneath the ruins of a four-story building in Yesilyurt were rescued with injuries. They had entered the damaged building to collect belongings.











            Elsewhere in Malatya, search-and-rescue teams were sifting through the rubble of two damaged buildings that toppled on some parked cars, HaberTurk reported. It was not clear if anyone was trapped under the debris.

            Malatya was among 11 Turkish provinces hit by the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that devastated parts of southern Turkey and northern Syria on Feb. 6.

            That quake led to more than 48,000 deaths in both countries as well as the collapse or serious damage of 185,000 buildings in Turkey. 

            AFAD's chief urged people not to enter damaged buildings, saying strong aftershocks continue to pose a risk. More than 10,000 aftershocks have hit the region since Feb. 6.

            The World Bank said Monday it estimates that the massive earthquake caused $34.2 billion in “direct damages” — an equivalent of 4% of the country's GDP in 2021. 

            The recovery and reconstruction cost could be potentially twice as large, the World Bank said, adding that GDP losses would also add to the earthquake's cost.

            The World Bank also estimated that 1.25 million people had been left temporarily homeless. 

            Meanwhile, fans of Turkish soccer team Besiktas threw stuffed toys on the field during a match on Sunday to support children affected by the earthquake. Toys and winter clothing were thrown on the stadium's grounds to be donated to children in the earthquake-hit regions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823041,Palestinian gunman critically wounds Israeli in new violence,"HAWARA, West Bank (AP) — A Palestinian gunman opened fire on Monday in the West Bank, critically wounding an Israeli man as a new wave of fighting showed no signs of slowing.

            The shooting occurred a day after two Israelis were killed by a Palestinian gunman in the northern West Bank, triggering a rampage by Israeli settlers through a Palestinian town that torched dozens of cars and homes. 

            The Israeli rescue service Mada said Monday's shooting took place at a junction near the Palestinian town of Jericho. They said a 25-year-old man was in critical condition and undergoing CPR as he was rushed to a hospital.











            Police said they were searching for the suspect, who escaped in a car.

            Earlier, Israel sent hundreds more troops to the northern West Bank following Sunday's violence, in which two Israelis were killed and settlers rampaged through a Palestinian town, torching homes and vehicles in the worst such violence in decades. 

            The responses to the rampage laid bare some rifts in Israel's new right-wing government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appealing for calm while a member of his ruling coalition praised the rampage as deterrence against Palestinian attacks.

            The events also underscored the limitations of the traditional U.S. approach to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Washington has been trying to prevent escalation while staying away from the politically costly task of pushing for a resolution of the core disputes. 

            As the violence raged in the West Bank, such an attempt at conflict management was taking place Sunday in Jordan, with the U.S. bringing together Israeli and Palestinian officials to work out a plan for de-escalation.

            Sunday's events kicked off when a Palestinian gunman shot and killed brothers Hillel and Yagel Yaniv, ages 21 and 19, from the Jewish settlement of Har Bracha, in a shooting ambush in the Palestinian town of Hawara in the northern West Bank. The gunman fled.

            Following the shooting, groups of settlers rampaged along the main thoroughfare in Hawara, which is used by both Palestinians and Israeli settlers. In one video, a crowd of settlers stood in prayer as they stared at a building in flames. 

            Late Sunday, a 37-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed by Israeli fire, two Palestinians were shot and wounded and another was beaten with an iron bar, Palestinian health officials said. Some 95 Palestinians were being treated for tear gas inhalation, according to medics.

            On Monday morning, the Hawara thoroughfare was lined with rows of burned-out cars and smoke-blackened buildings. Normally bustling shops remained shuttered. Palestinian media said some 30 homes and cars were torched.

            Sultan Farouk Abu Sris, a shop owner in Hawara, said he briefly went outside and saw scores of settlers setting containers and a home on fire. “They didn’t leave anything. They even threw tear gas bombs,” he said. “It’s destruction. They came bearing hatred.”

            At the scene of the shooting, Defense Minister Yoav Galant told reporters that Israel “cannot allow a situation in which citizens take the law into their hands,” but stopped short of outright condemning the violence. 

            “I ask everyone to heed the law and especially to trust in the army and security forces,” he said

            The Yaniv brothers were laid to rest in Jerusalem on Monday. 

            Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, described the situation as “a tense quiet.” He said the army deployed hundreds of additional troops to the area with the aim of de-escalation. Two battalions were sent late Sunday and a third on Monday, with several hundred soldiers each.

            The army has not caught the Palestinian gunman. Israeli police spokesman Dean Elsdunne said eight Israelis were detained in connection with Sunday’s rioting, and that six had already been released.

            Israeli troops also began removing settlers from a previously evacuated settlement outpost near the West Bank city of Nablus. Several settlers had camped there following Sunday's deadly shooting, Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported.

            Speaking at a settlement outpost reoccupied by Jewish settlers after Sunday’s shooting, the firebrand Public Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, the leader of the Jewish Power party, called for a “real war on terrorism"" and legalizing the outpost, which troops were once again clearing. 

            “We must crush our enemies,"" he said. As for the settler violence, he added: “I understand the hard feelings, but this isn’t the way, we can’t take the law into our hands.

            Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog urged settlers not to engage in vigilante actions. Merav Michaeli of the opposition Labor Party condemned the rampage as “a pogrom by armed militias” of West Bank settlers.

            In the ruling coalition, some fanned the flames.

            Tzvika Foghel, a lawmaker from Ben-Gvir's party, said the rampage would help deter Palestinian attacks. “I see the result in a very good light,” he told Army Radio when asked about what the interviewer referred to as a pogrom.

            Sunday’s violence has drawn condemnation from the international community. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the shooting attack and the rampage “underscore the imperative to immediately de-escalate tensions in words and deeds.” 

            Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli government responsible for what he called “the terrorist acts carried out by settlers under the protection of the occupation forces tonight.”

            The violence erupted shortly after the Jordanian government hosted talks at the Red Sea resort of Aqaba aimed at de-escalating tensions ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

            The Palestinians claim the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip — areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war — for a future state. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israel's settlements as illegal and obstacles to peace.

            So far this year, 62 Palestinians, about half of them affiliated with armed groups, have been killed by Israeli troops and civilians. In the same period, 14 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks.

            Last year was the deadliest for the Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem since 2004, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in those areas, Some 30 people on the Israeli side were killed in Palestinian attacks. 

            The West Bank is home to a number of hard-line settlements — several of them in the immediate vicinity of Hawara — whose residents frequently vandalize Palestinians land and property.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823072,Why Switching to a SaaS Model Can Benefit Your Company and Boost Your Bottom Line,"As businesses continue to evolve and adapt to changing market trends, they are always on the lookout for innovative solutions that can help them gain a competitive edge. In recent years, the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model has emerged as a popular option for many businesses looking to streamline their operations and reduce costs. In this article, we will explore the benefits of switching to a SaaS model and how it can help your company boost its bottom line.The SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) model has become increasingly popular in recent years, allowing businesses to access software applications through the internet rather than purchasing and installing them on their own devices. OneStream Live is a prime example of a SaaS-based solution that offers live streaming services to businesses and individuals. With OneStream Live, users can easily stream their content to multiple platforms simultaneously, such as Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram, without the need for multiple accounts or software installations. This makes it an ideal solution for content creators looking to reach a wider audience with their live streams.Before delving into the benefits of SaaS, let’s define what it is. SaaS is a software delivery model where applications are hosted on a third-party server and accessed via the internet. In other words, instead of installing software on your computer or server, you access it over the internet through a web browser or app. SaaS providers manage the infrastructure, maintenance, and security of the application, leaving businesses free to focus on their core competencies.Cost SavingsOne of the most significant benefits of switching to a SaaS model is cost savings. Traditional software requires businesses to invest in hardware, licenses, maintenance, and upgrades, which can be a significant drain on resources. With SaaS, businesses only pay for the software they use on a subscription basis. SaaS providers handle the infrastructure, maintenance, and upgrades, reducing the need for businesses to invest in expensive hardware and software licenses.SaaS also offers flexibility in pricing. Businesses can choose from a variety of subscription plans that match their needs and budget. As a result, SaaS can be an affordable option for small and medium-sized businesses that cannot afford to invest in expensive hardware and software.ScalabilityAnother benefit of SaaS is scalability. As your business grows, your software needs are likely to change. Traditional software may require significant investment to upgrade or scale up to meet your needs. With SaaS, scaling up or down is as simple as adjusting your subscription plan. SaaS providers offer a range of plans with different features and capacities, allowing businesses to choose the plan that matches their current needs and upgrade as their business grows.Moreover, with SaaS, businesses don’t need to worry about investing in additional hardware or infrastructure to support their growth. SaaS providers handle the infrastructure and maintenance, ensuring that the application can scale as the business grows.Ease of UseSaaS is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. SaaS applications are accessible via a web browser or app, and users can access them from anywhere with an internet connection. This eliminates the need for businesses to install and maintain software on individual computers, reducing the need for IT support and maintenance.Furthermore, SaaS applications are designed to be intuitive, with a user-friendly interface and easy-to-use features. This makes it easy for employees to adopt and use the software, reducing the learning curve and increasing productivity.Security and Data BackupSaaS providers offer robust security and data backup features, ensuring that businesses’ data is safe and secure. SaaS providers use state-of-the-art security protocols to protect data, including encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. Moreover, SaaS providers have teams of experts who monitor and update their security systems to protect against the latest threats.Additionally, SaaS providers offer data backup and recovery services, ensuring that businesses can recover their data in the event of a disaster. This eliminates the need for businesses to invest in expensive data backup and recovery systems.CollaborationSaaS applications are designed to facilitate collaboration among team members, regardless of their location. SaaS applications offer features like real-time document sharing, video conferencing, and instant messaging, enabling teams to work together seamlessly. This improves communication and collaboration, leading to better decision-making and increased productivity.Moreover, SaaS applications can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, allowing team members to collaborate remotely, which is especially important in today’s work environment where remote work has become the norm for many businesses. SaaS applications also offer version control features that allow team members to track changes to documents and ensure everyone is working on the latest version. This eliminates the need for email chains and multiple copies of the same document, reducing the risk of errors and confusion.Improved Customer ExperienceSaaS applications can also help businesses improve their customer experience. Many SaaS applications offer features like customer portals, self-service options, and automated support that can improve the customer experience. For example, a customer portal can allow customers to access their account information, track orders, and request support, reducing the need for customer support staff and improving response times. Automated support features can provide customers with instant answers to common questions, reducing wait times and improving satisfaction.Furthermore, SaaS applications can provide businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. SaaS applications can track customer interactions with the application, including which features they use and how often they use them. This information can be used to personalize the customer experience, tailor marketing campaigns, and improve product offerings.ConclusionSwitching to a SaaS model can offer significant benefits for businesses of all sizes. SaaS can reduce costs, improve scalability, increase security, and enhance collaboration, among other benefits. Moreover, SaaS can improve the customer experience, providing businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.When considering a switch to SaaS, it’s important to research different providers and their offerings to find the best fit for your business. Factors to consider include pricing, features, security, and customer support. Additionally, it’s important to plan for the transition to ensure a smooth migration and adoption process.Overall, SaaS can be a powerful tool for businesses looking to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and improve their bottom line. With its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use, SaaS is an excellent option for businesses of all sizes and industries.",2023/02/27,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823080,Hundreds blocked on Croatia roads as snowstorm spurs chaos,"ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Hundreds of people in Croatia spent the night in their cars or at gas stations and reception centers Monday after a snowstorm over the weekend caused traffic to grind to a halt and left parts of the country cut off.

            The sudden change of weather after a period of warm and balmy days has also snarled traffic in neighboring Serbia and Bosnia, leaving areas in western Serbia without power and cutting railway traffic to neighboring Montenegro.

            Croatian authorities said roads leading to and from the Adriatic Sea coastline remain closed because of snow and strong winds. Media reported that cars and buses were parked along the main Croatian highway as they wait to move on.











            Officials urged people to postpone any planned trips after closing down roads following unsuccessful attempts earlier to briefly reopened them to traffic. 

             “We all knew It (bad weather) was coming,"" said senior emergency official Damir Trut for regional N1 television. ""I am really surprised people didn't listen.”

            About 300 people have stayed in the reception centers that have been set up because of the situation, said Natalia Turbic, local emergency official in Gracac in central Croatia. Others sought places in private accommodation in the area, she said.

            State television HRT reported that hundreds of people that couldn't reach the reception centers stayed in buses and cars or looked for gas station cafes nearby which opened their doors for stranded motorists and passengers. 

            People were lying on the floor or sleeping on chairs, HRT said. A group of soccer fans who were traveling from the capital Zagreb to the coastal town of Split were among those stuck on the way.

            “There is no use in getting irritated,” Melita Ancic, a bus passenger, told HRT. “These are extraordinary circumstances. We just need to be patient.”

            Marijan Grubisic was traveling from Germany to Bosnia when he got stranded. He told HRT that “we didn't expect something like this.”

            “It's been tough, lots of snow, very hard, very cold,” he said.

            While the situation was most dramatic in Croatia, problems were also reported in western Serbia and higher-altitude regions of Bosnia. 

            Serbia's state railway company said that trains to Montenegro weren't running, mostly because of fallen trees and problems in power supply in areas near the two countries' border.

            The towns of Prijepolje and Bajina Basta were without electricity overnight Sunday to Monday, the Tanjug news agency reported. 

            Bosnian authorities said Monday that heavy snow and wind have slowed down traffic throughout the country, especially in the mountains. Landslides and fallen trees are causing further problems, traffic authorities said, urging caution.ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Hundreds of people in Croatia spent the night in their cars or at gas stations and reception centers Monday after a snowstorm over the weekend caused traffic to grind to a halt and left parts of the country cut off.The sudden change of weather after a period of warm and balmy days has also snarled traffic in neighboring Serbia and Bosnia, leaving areas in western Serbia without power and cutting railway traffic to neighboring Montenegro.Croatian authorities said roads leading to and from the Adriatic Sea coastline remain closed because of snow and strong winds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823081,Hundreds protest new proposed election law in Baghdad,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Baghdad on Monday to denounce a draft elections law that would increase the size of the country’s electoral districts, potentially undermining independent candidates.

            The current legislation, under which the 2021 election was held, breaks up each of the country’s 18 provinces into several electoral districts. The law, which was a key demand of mass anti-government protests that kicked off in late 2019, was seen as giving independent candidates a better chance at winning.

            Last week, Parliament debated the draft, which would return Iraq to having one electoral district per governorate. Independent lawmakers who objected to the proposal, walked out of the session, which ended early due to losing its quorum. 











            The Parliament was set to discuss the proposed law again in its session on Monday, but lawmakers voted to postpone the discussion until Saturday.

            The return to a single district per province is backed by the Coordination Framework, a coalition of Iran-backed parties that forms the majority bloc in the current parliament, and which brought Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to power last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823082,China accuses US of 'bullying' with new 'illegal' sanctions,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Monday accused the U.S. of “outright bullying and double standards” in leveling what it called “illegal” sanctions on Chinese companies as part of U.S. actions against Russia’s Wagner Group and related companies and individuals. 

            The entities were targeted for their role in the war in Ukraine and mercenary activities, including human rights abuses, in Africa. 

            The sanctions “have no basis in international law or authorization from the Security Council, and are typical illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing.











            The punitive measures were “seriously harming China’s interests” and China “strongly rejects and deplores that and has lodged solemn complaints with the U.S. side,” Mao said.

            “While the U.S. has intensified its efforts to send weapons to one of the parties to the conflict, resulting in an endless war, it has frequently spread false information about China’s supply of weapons to Russia, taking the opportunity to sanction Chinese companies for no reason,"" she said. “This is outright bullying and double standards.""

            The Treasury and State departments announced the moves in coordinated statements that targeted dozens of Wagner Group affiliates, including some in the Central African Republic and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the president of Russia’s Kalashnikov Concern, the original manufacturer of the AK-47 assault rifle.

            Wagner, a private Russian military company, has been involved in heavy fighting in the east of Ukraine.

            The sanctions also hit the Chinese company Changsha Tianyi Space Science and Technology Research Institute Co.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823083,Ex-Obama campaigner voted head of Italy's Democratic Party,"MILAN (AP) — Elly Schlein, a 37-year-old U.S.-Italian national and longtime left-wing political operative who worked on two presidential campaigns for former U.S. President Barack Obama, defied polls to become the first woman to head Italy’s opposition Democratic Party.

            Schlein’s surprise victory Sunday over the popular governor of Emilia-Romagna, a traditional left-wing stronghold, is attributed to support from women and youth in the rank-and-file, while the party apparatus largely supported Stefano Bonaccini. 

            Schlein claimed 54% of the vote to Bonaccini’s 46%. 











            “We will be a big problem"" for Premier Giorgia Meloni, Schlein said to supporters, pledging to help the most vulnerable and shore up the labor market with better-paying, secure jobs. 

            Schlein took an immediate swipe at Meloni for her far-right government’s anti-migration policies, saying that the shipwreck deaths Sunday of dozens off southern Italy “weighs on the conscience of those who only weeks ago approved a decree whose only goal is to hinder rescues at sea.”

            Schlein called instead for a system that allows migrants to legally apply for entry into all European nations and for the EU to invigorate its humanitarian search-and-rescue mission. 

            Schlein takes over a badly splintered party that failed miserably to mount a credible campaign against Meloni in last fall’s elections, leading the PD's former leader to step down. 

            Schlein, who grew up in Switzerland with an Italian mother and American father, quit the center-left Democratic Party in 2015 over differences in the direction it was taking under then-Premier Matteo Renzi. She helped the Democratic Party campaign last summer as an independent candidate, winning a seat in parliament even as the party badly lost the general election, and became a card-carrying party member just recently to run as its leader. 

            A former European Parliament deputy, Schlein cut her political organizing chops on two Obama campaigns and has been aligned with the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ pan-European progressive moment DiEM25. She is often compared to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for her social justice advocacy. 

            Schlein gained national attention three years ago when she played a key role in blocking the right from taking power in her traditionally left-leaning region of Emilia-Romagna, famously confronting League leader Matteo Salvini over his immigration record. 

            Prior to winning election to parliament, she was vice governor of the region, working with Bonaccini, charged with social equity and environmental policy.MILAN (AP) — Elly Schlein, a 37-year-old U.S.-Italian national and longtime left-wing political operative who worked on two presidential campaigns for former U.S. President Barack Obama, defied polls to become the first woman to head Italy’s opposition Democratic Party.Schlein’s surprise victory Sunday over the popular governor of Emilia-Romagna, a traditional left-wing stronghold, is attributed to support from women and youth in the rank-and-file, while the party apparatus largely supported Stefano Bonaccini.Schlein claimed 54% of the vote to Bonaccini’s 46%.“We will be a big problem"" for Premier Giorgia Meloni, Schlein said to supporters, pledging to help the most vulnerable and shore up the labor market with better-paying, secure jobs.Schlein took an immediate swipe at Meloni for her far-right government’s anti-migration policies, saying that the shipwreck deaths Sunday of dozens off southern Italy “weighs on the conscience of those who only weeks ago approved a decree whose only goal is to hinder rescues at sea.”Schlein called instead for a system that allows migrants to legally apply for entry into all European nations and for the EU to invigorate its humanitarian search-and-rescue mission.Schlein takes over a badly splintered party that failed miserably to mount a credible campaign against Meloni in last fall’s elections, leading the PD's former leader to step down.Schlein, who grew up in Switzerland with an Italian mother and American father, quit the center-left Democratic Party in 2015 over differences in the direction it was taking under then-Premier Matteo Renzi.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823084,UN chief slams 'climate-wrecking' firms at human rights body,"GENEVA (AP) — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday stressed the importance of legal challenges against “climate-wrecking corporations"" like fossil-fuel producers, ratcheting up his call for the fight against climate change—- this time before the U.N.'s top human rights body. 

            Guterres opened the latest session of the Human Rights Council, part of an address that decried summary executions, torture and sexual violence in places like Ukraine; antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and the persecution of Christians; inequality and threats to free expression, among other issues.

            Guterres also sought to undergird the concept of human rights — which have faced ""public disregard and private disdain — and tie them together with environmental concerns.











            ""Human rights are not a luxury that can be left until we find a solution to the world’s other problems. They are THE solution to many of the world’s other problems,"" he said. “From the climate emergency to the misuse of technology, the answers to today’s crises are found in human rights.”

            Guterres has previously said that fossil-fuel producers need to be held to account, but pressing the issue before the U.N.'s top human rights body — made up of 47 member countries, plus scores of observer states — raises the stakes. 

            Nearly half the world's population — 3.5 billion people — live in “climate hot spots” that are “fast becoming human rights disaster zones where floods, droughts and storms mean people are 15 times more likely to die of climate impacts,” he said. 

            Then, he emphasized the role of the International Court of Justice, the U.N.'s main judicial body, to improve accountability for the most serious crimes — and said he welcomed moves toward accountability for human rights abuses “including those committed by the private sector.”

            “Legal challenges against climate-wrecking corporations are an important step forward,” Guterres said. 

            “Fossil fuel producers and their financial backers need to understand a crucial truth: pursuing mega-profits when so many people are losing their lives and rights, today and tomorrow, is completely unacceptable,” he added. 

            The comments came as the council opened its “high-level segment” at the start of its longest-ever session — more than five weeks. The presidents of Congo, Montenegro and Colombia were also speaking Monday, followed by envoys including the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Iran.

            The session comes as the world grapples with rights concerns including Russia’s war in Ukraine, repression of dissent in Russia and Belarus, new violence between Palestinians and Israelis, and efforts to solidify a peace deal in Ethiopia that ended two years of conflict between the national government and rebels in the Tigray region.

            Proponents say the Geneva-based rights body has grown in importance as a diplomatic venue because the U.N. Security Council in New York has been increasingly divided in recent years because of a major rift between affiliations among its five permanent members: China and Russia on one side, and the U.K., France and the U.S. on the other.GENEVA (AP) — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday stressed the importance of legal challenges against “climate-wrecking corporations"" like fossil-fuel producers, ratcheting up his call for the fight against climate change—- this time before the U.N.'s top human rights body.Guterres opened the latest session of the Human Rights Council, part of an address that decried summary executions, torture and sexual violence in places like Ukraine; antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and the persecution of Christians; inequality and threats to free expression, among other issues.Guterres also sought to undergird the concept of human rights — which have faced ""public disregard and private disdain — and tie them together with environmental concerns.""Human rights are not a luxury that can be left until we find a solution to the world’s other problems. They are THE solution to many of the world’s other problems,"" he said. “From the climate emergency to the misuse of technology, the answers to today’s crises are found in human rights.”Guterres has previously said that fossil-fuel producers need to be held to account, but pressing the issue before the U.N.'s top human rights body — made up of 47 member countries, plus scores of observer states — raises the stakes.Nearly half the world's population — 3.5 billion people — live in “climate hot spots” that are “fast becoming human rights disaster zones where floods, droughts and storms mean people are 15 times more likely to die of climate impacts,” he said.Then, he emphasized the role of the International Court of Justice, the U.N.'s main judicial body, to improve accountability for the most serious crimes — and said he welcomed moves toward accountability for human rights abuses “including those committed by the private sector.”“Legal challenges against climate-wrecking corporations are an important step forward,” Guterres said.“Fossil fuel producers and their financial backers need to understand a crucial truth: pursuing mega-profits when so many people are losing their lives and rights, today and tomorrow, is completely unacceptable,” he added.The comments came as the council opened its “high-level segment” at the start of its longest-ever session — more than five weeks. The presidents of Congo, Montenegro and Colombia were also speaking Monday, followed by envoys including the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Iran.The session comes as the world grapples with rights concerns including Russia’s war in Ukraine, repression of dissent in Russia and Belarus, new violence between Palestinians and Israelis, and efforts to solidify a peace deal in Ethiopia that ended two years of conflict between the national government and rebels in the Tigray region.Proponents say the Geneva-based rights body has grown in importance as a diplomatic venue because the U.N. Security Council in New York has been increasingly divided in recent years because of a major rift between affiliations among its five permanent members: China and Russia on one side, and the U.K., France and the U.S. on the other.",2023/02/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823128,China's youth unemployment: Young people shun new rat race,"China is currently hosting hundreds of in-person job fairs for the first time in three years — another sign that President Xi Jinping's draconian zero-COVID policy is history.The events are packed. The most-slack labor market in years has given employers the advantage while among the many candidates, competition is fierce.As the country reopens, unemployment — which peaked at 6.2% during the first year of the pandemic and again last May (6.1%) — is on course to slide. But analysts say the labor market recovery could be uneven, as different sectors of the world's second-largest economy rebound at varying speeds.Youth unemployment is, however, a major sticking point for Beijing. By international standards, the jobless figure among young Chinese people in urban areas was already high before the virus hit at around 13% and peaked last July when nearly 1 in 5 of those aged between 15 and 24 were out of work.""This is probably the worst time in the last two decades for young people in China to either regain employment or find their first jobs,"" Kevin Lin, a researcher and the Managing Editor of Asian Labour Review, told DW.Twenty years of unprecedented growth in China generated a huge number of jobs. But as the country shifted from low-cost manufacturing to a service economy dominated by high-technology exports, youth unemployment climbed much faster than for other demographics.To add insult to injury, Beijing announced a crackdown on the tech, education, entertainment and real estate sectors during the pandemic which spurred large-scale layoffs.Gaming giant Tencent, online retailer Alibaba and social media firm Weibo — big employers of young, highly educated Chinese workers — have all announced job cuts in recent months. As the property downturn took hold from the China Evergrande debt scandal in 2021, one real estate developer last year fired 90% of its staff.""As the private sector is the main driver of job creation, the employment situation for Chinese youth will ultimately depend on whether the post-COVID policies can effectively support the private sector and how confident private entrepreneurs are in the current business environment,"" Zhao Litao, a senior research fellow at the East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore, told DW.A slowing global economy, which many economists expect will tip into recession later this year, is likely to stymie demand for Chinese exports. Doubts also remain about how fast China's reopening can ramp up while the virus is still a threat.Some think Beijing has hidden the true scale of youth unemployment for decades, pointing to a move to boost college enrollment after the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, which saw the number of new students rise by over 40% in a single year.By 2021, around 44 million undergraduate students were enrolled in degree programs at public colleges and universities in China, compared to some 4 million at the turn of the century.""For those without the credentials for college, vocational schools teach nothing and are just another part of the holding pattern,"" for young people, said Dorothy J. Solinger, Professor Emerita, Department of Political Science, at the University of California, Irvine.""Serious attention needs to be paid to putting the educational system into sync with the jobs on offer,"" she added.The Chinese government has announced measures to encourage firms to hire younger workers, offering training subsidies and more apprenticeship schemes. Young graduates can also receive funding for their own startups.But any labor market reforms and stimulus measures take time to reverberate through a country with a 1.4 billion population when the number one priority has been to stamp out COVID-19.With China's economy no longer growing in double digits, upward mobility has also started to reverse while competition for jobs has grown more ardent in a society where the pressure to succeed remains high.During COVID-19 lockdowns, however, many young people began to reject the prospect of corporate careers — eschewing the rat race for lower-paid, more fulfilling work. The phenomenon is known as tang ping or lying flat.""Lying flat reflects an understandable mood among young workers who have given up trying,"" said Lin. ""The question is whether they can afford to really lay flat. China is not a welfare state and does not have mechanisms to support unemployed young people.""Tang ping also marks a reversal from an era when young migrant workers from rural areas of China moved to big cities, with the sole purpose of supporting their families. Many young people now want less stress and more leisure time.The long gap between finishing education and starting work has given them a chance to reprioritize their life goals. Many have started small businesses, volunteered at home or abroad, or chosen to freelance, Zhao explained.""This reflects value changes as the Chinese society and families are more accepting of slow and delayed entry into employment,"" she said.With fewer private sector jobs available, young Chinese graduates are sitting the civil service exam in record numbers. Until recently, they had shunned the public sector.But even the promise of job security was short lived due to the massive upheaval caused by COVID-19. Over the past three years, China's local governments have spent much of their budgets fighting the virus and have been forced to adopt austerity measures, including their own large-scale layoffs.Edited by: Rob Mudge",2023/02/27,,

It is the third trilateral meeting on the accession bid.Turkey's foreign minister said that Ankara could consider Sweden and Finland's membership separately.""It is not possible for us to give consent (to a NATO bid) before Sweden fulfills its commitments,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we have not seen satisfactory steps from Sweden on the implementation of the Madrid memorandum.""Sweden signed the memorandum last June. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Stockholm had changed its legislation to be in line with the agreement.NATO membership requires unanimous agreement among all members of the alliance, including Turkey.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he would not support Sweden's accession bid over recent protests in Stockholm.In one demonstration organized by a Kurdish group, an effigy of Erdogan was shown hanging from its feet in Stockholm. Another protest was organized by far-right politician Rasmus Paludan, who burned a copy of the Quran in front of the Turkish embassy.Erdogan faces a tightly contested presidential election in June.Turkey has also demanded that Sweden extradite dozens of suspects, including those it suspects of ties to Kurdish militant groups or to a failed coup attempt in 2016.sdi/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/27,,

The weapon launches from ships and submarines and can strike targets precisely from 1,000 miles away (some 1,600 kilometers), even in heavily defended airspace.Japan is also planning to develop for the first time a ""counter-strike"" capability — which would give it the ability to launch sites.Overall, the government plans to spend about $37 billion over five years on long-range missiles, the planned deployment of which will begin in 2026.Japan has said it will hike up defense spending by almost a quarter in 2023 to a record $51.7 billion for the financial year starting April 1.Tokyo hopes to more than triple spending on munitions it believes are needed to deter regional rivals China and North Korea, with Russia's attack on Ukraine spurring regional tensions.Japan is also set to boost spending on cyber warfare capabilities, drones ballistic missile defenses, warships, and transport aircraft, as well as reconnaissance and communications satellites.When it comes to air power, the government plans to acquire 16 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 stealth fighters for some $37 billion, half of which will be ""jump jets,"" known for their vertical take off and landings. They are to be deployed on aircraft carriers.The unprecedented level of spending is a reflection of Japanese fears about the possible invasion of neighboring Taiwan by China, heightened by Russia's war in Ukraine.Tokyo fears such a development could threaten Japanese islands and give Beijing a potential stranglehold on sea routes vital for the supply of oil from the Middle East.North Korea has added to regional insecurity by repeatedly conducting provocative weapons tests, including with missiles that landed in Japanese waters.Japan is also locked in a decades-old dispute with Russia over a chain of Pacific islands known as the Kuril Islands by Russia and in Japan as the Northern Territories.The Russian military maintains a presence on the islands, which have a population of some 20,000.Japan has joined other allies in imposing sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.The US and Japan plan to boost military and security cooperation after their top national security officials held talks in January.Japan has also signed a defensive agreement with the Philippines to strengthen military collaboration between the two island nations.rc/ar (AFP, Reuters, dpa, AFP)",2023/02/27,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823140,UN seeks $4.3 billion to cover Yemen 2023 humanitarian needs,"CAIRO (AP) — Global donors on Monday met to pledge aid to help millions of people in Yemen suffering from the fallout of an eight-year civil war, as the United Nations set a target of $4.3 billion to stave off one of the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

            More than 21 million people in Yemen, or two-thirds of the country's population, need help and protection, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, which says the humanitarian needs in Yemen are “shocking.” Among those in need, more than 17 million are considered particularly vulnerable.

            ""The people of Yemen deserve our support. But more than that, they deserve a credible path out of perpetual conflict and a chance to rebuild their communities and country,"" said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, addressing the donors. 











            The high-level gathering is co-hosted by Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.N. in the organization’s Palais des Nations in Geneva. It was attended by high-level officials from across the world including the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.

            Baerbock was the first to announce a pledge, saying her country will provide 120 million euros ($127 million) to Yemen's 2023 humanitarian response.

            “This terrible humanitarian disaster is one the world repeatedly and much too often has almost closed its eyes to,” she told reporters in Geneva.

            In his speech to the conference, Blinken called on donors to step up their contributions to meet the humanitarian demands in Yemen, pointing to last year’s funding shortages that forced U.N. agencies to scale down operations including food rations for thousands of families. He said the U.S. will provide more than $444 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen in 2023.

            “The scale of the challenge we face is daunting. But I urge everyone to keep our focus on the people we seek to help,” he told the conference.

            Blinken also called for an end to restrictions on humanitarian workers and operations, especially in Houthi-controlled areas where the rebels restrict the movements of female aid workers by forcing them to be accompanied by male guardians.

            The $4.3 billion appeal for 2023 is almost double the $2.2 billion that the U.N. received in 2022 to fund its humanitarian program in Yemen. The U.N. had sought $4.27 billion for 2022.

            Monday’s conference comes as the global economy remains rattled by the yearlong Russian invasion of Ukraine. Inflation rates have surged over the past year across the world, forcing many governments to focus on elevating the needs of their own people.

            Yemen’s conflict started in 2014, when the Iran-backed rebel Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north. A Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition intervened months later, in early 2015, to try and dislodge the rebels and restore the internationally recognized government to power. 

            The conflict has in recent years become a regional proxy war that has killed more than 150,000 people, including over 14,500 civilians. The war has also created a horrendous humanitarian crisis, leaving millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and pushing the country to the brink of famine.

            The conference is taking place as the warring sides continue to observe an informal and fragile cease-fire. Efforts are underway to declare a new truce after the parties failed to renew a U.N.-brokered truce in October.

            “We have a real opportunity this year to change Yemen’s trajectory and move towards peace, by renewing and expanding the truce,” Guterres, the U.N. chief, said.

            The truce, which took effect in April, brought some relief for Yemenis, especially in Houthi-held areas. It enabled commercial traffic to resume at Sanaa's airport and the sea port of Hodeida. 

            However, partly because of the territorial division — with roughly half of Yemen under Houthi control and the other half under government control — the country is haunted by an economic crisis. There is dual system of currency, dual exchange rates, restrictions on imports and double taxation on goods, according to the U.N. Panel of Experts investigating Yemen’s conflict. Annual inflation reached 45%, and food prices surged 58%, according to the panel’s report.

            There have also been Houthi attacks on oil facilities in government-held areas, resulting in the disruption of oil export, which is a major source of funds for the government.

            The war has decimated the country’s civilian infrastructure including its health care system. Hospitals and medical facilities have repeatedly been attacked.

            “Yemen requires urgent and robust support from international donors and other partners to effectively avert the potential collapse of its health system,” said Adham Ismail, the World Health Organization’s representative in Yemen.

            He said $392 million was needed for WHO-led operations in 2023 to ensure health facilities remain functioning and provide “even the most basic services to the 12.9 million most vulnerable people.”

            
                Climate change has added to the suffering. Yemen, located at the southwestern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, is “at the forefront” of a global climate crisis, as natural disasters, including floods and arid weather, threaten lives, the U.N. has said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823149,AI learns to outsmart humans in video games - and real life,"Speed around a French village in the video game Gran Turismo and you might spot a Corvette behind you trying to catch your slipstream.

            The technique of using the draft of an opponent's racecar to speed up and overtake them is one favored by skilled players of PlayStation's realistic racing game.

            But this Corvette driver is not being controlled by a human — it's GT Sophy, a powerful artificial intelligence agent built by PlayStation-maker Sony.











            Gran Turismo players have been competing against computer-generated racecars since the franchise launched in the 1990s, but the new AI driver that was unleashed last week on Gran Turismo 7 is smarter and faster because it's been trained using the latest AI methods.

            “Gran Turismo had a built-in AI existing from the beginning of the game, but it has a very narrow band of performance and it isn’t very good,"" said Michael Spranger, chief operating officer of Sony AI. “It’s very predictable. Once you get past a certain level, it doesn’t really entice you anymore.”

            But now, he said, “this AI is going to put up a fight.” 

            Visit an artificial intelligence laboratory at universities and companies like Sony, Google, Meta, Microsoft and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and it’s not unusual to find AI agents like Sophy racing cars, slinging angry birds at pigs, fighting epic interstellar battles or helping human gamers build new Minecraft worlds -- all part of the job description for computer systems trying to learn how to get smarter in games.

            But in some instances, they are also trying to learn how to get smarter in the real world. In a January paper, a University of Cambridge researcher who built an AI agent to control Pokémon characters argued it could “inspire all sorts of applications that require team management under conditions of extreme uncertainty, including managing a team of doctors, robots or employees in an ever-changing environment, like a pandemic-stricken region or a war zone.”

            And while that might sound like a kid making a case for playing three more hours of Pokémon Violet, the study of games has been used to advance AI research — and train computers to solve complex problems — since the mid-20th century.

            Initially, AI was used on games like checkers and chess to test at winning strategy games. Now a new branch of research is more focused on performing open-ended tasks in complex worlds and interacting with humans, not just for the purpose of beating them.

            “Reality is like a super-complicated game,” said Nicholas Sarantinos, who authored the Pokémon paper and recently turned down a doctoral offer at Oxford University to start an AI company aiming to help corporate workplaces set up more collaborative teams.

            In the web-based Pokémon Showdown battle simulator, Sarantinos developed an algorithm to analyze a team of six Pokémon — predicting how they would perform based on all the possible battle scenarios ahead of them and their comparative strengths and weaknesses.

            Microsoft, which owns the popular Minecraft game franchise as well as the Xbox game system, has tasked AI agents with a variety of activities — from steering clear of lava to chopping trees and making furnaces. Researchers hope some of their learnings could eventually play a role in real-world technology, such as how to get a home robot to take on certain chores without having to program it to do so.

            While it ”goes without stating"" that real humans behave quite differently from fictional video game creatures, “the core ideas can still be used,” Sarantinos said. “If you use psychology tests, you can take this information to conclude how well they can work together.”

            Amy Hoover, an assistant professor of informatics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who’s built algorithms for the digital card game Hearthstone, said “there really is a reason for studying games” but it is not always easy to explain.

            “People aren’t always understanding that the point is about the optimization method rather than the game,” she said.

            Games also offer a useful testbed for AI — including for some real-world applications in robotics or health care — that’s safer to try in a virtual world, said Vanessa Volz, an AI researcher at the Danish startup Modl.ai, which builds AI systems for game development.

            But, she adds, “it can get overhyped."" 

            “It’s probably not going to be one big breakthrough and that everything is going to be shifted to the real world,” Volz said.

            Japanese electronics giant Sony launched its own AI research division in 2020 with entertainment in mind, but it's nonetheless attracted broader academic attention. Its research paper introducing Sophy last year made it on the cover of the prestigious science journal Nature, which said it could potentially have effects on other applications such as drones and self-driving vehicles.

            The technology behind Sophy is based on an algorithmic method known as reinforcement learning, which trains the system by rewarding it when it gets something right as it runs virtual races thousands of times.

            “The reward is going to tell you that, ‘You’re making progress. This is good,’ or, ‘You’re off the track. Well, that’s not good,'"" Spranger said.

            The world's best Gran Turismo players are still finishing ahead of Sophy at tournaments, but average players will find it hard to beat — and can adjust difficulty settings depending on how much they want to be challenged.

            PlayStation players will only get to try racing against Sophy until March 31, on a limited number of circuits, so it can get some feedback and go back into testing. Peter Wurman, director of Sony AI America and project lead on GT Sophy, said it takes about two weeks for AI agents to train on 20 PlayStations. 

            “To get it spread throughout the whole game, it takes some more breakthroughs and some more time before we’re ready for that,” he said. 

            And to get it onto real streets or Formula One tracks? That could take a lot longer.

            
                Self-driving car companies adopt similar machine-learning techniques, but “they don’t hand over complete control of the car the way we are able to,” Wurman said. “In a simulated world, there’s nobody’s life at risk. You know exactly the kinds of things you’re going to see in the environment. There’s no people crossing the road or anything like that.”Speed around a French village in the video game Gran Turismo and you might spot a Corvette behind you trying to catch your slipstream.The technique of using the draft of an opponent's racecar to speed up and overtake them is one favored by skilled players of PlayStation's realistic racing game.But this Corvette driver is not being controlled by a human — it's GT Sophy, a powerful artificial intelligence agent built by PlayStation-maker Sony.Gran Turismo players have been competing against computer-generated racecars since the franchise launched in the 1990s, but the new AI driver that was unleashed last week on Gran Turismo 7 is smarter and faster because it's been trained using the latest AI methods.“Gran Turismo had a built-in AI existing from the beginning of the game, but it has a very narrow band of performance and it isn’t very good,"" said Michael Spranger, chief operating officer of Sony AI. “It’s very predictable. Once you get past a certain level, it doesn’t really entice you anymore.”But now, he said, “this AI is going to put up a fight.”Visit an artificial intelligence laboratory at universities and companies like Sony, Google, Meta, Microsoft and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and it’s not unusual to find AI agents like Sophy racing cars, slinging angry birds at pigs, fighting epic interstellar battles or helping human gamers build new Minecraft worlds -- all part of the job description for computer systems trying to learn how to get smarter in games.But in some instances, they are also trying to learn how to get smarter in the real world. In a January paper, a University of Cambridge researcher who built an AI agent to control Pokémon characters argued it could “inspire all sorts of applications that require team management under conditions of extreme uncertainty, including managing a team of doctors, robots or employees in an ever-changing environment, like a pandemic-stricken region or a war zone.”And while that might sound like a kid making a case for playing three more hours of Pokémon Violet, the study of games has been used to advance AI research — and train computers to solve complex problems — since the mid-20th century.Initially, AI was used on games like checkers and chess to test at winning strategy games. Now a new branch of research is more focused on performing open-ended tasks in complex worlds and interacting with humans, not just for the purpose of beating them.“Reality is like a super-complicated game,” said Nicholas Sarantinos, who authored the Pokémon paper and recently turned down a doctoral offer at Oxford University to start an AI company aiming to help corporate workplaces set up more collaborative teams.In the web-based Pokémon Showdown battle simulator, Sarantinos developed an algorithm to analyze a team of six Pokémon — predicting how they would perform based on all the possible battle scenarios ahead of them and their comparative strengths and weaknesses.Microsoft, which owns the popular Minecraft game franchise as well as the Xbox game system, has tasked AI agents with a variety of activities — from steering clear of lava to chopping trees and making furnaces. Researchers hope some of their learnings could eventually play a role in real-world technology, such as how to get a home robot to take on certain chores without having to program it to do so.While it ”goes without stating"" that real humans behave quite differently from fictional video game creatures, “the core ideas can still be used,” Sarantinos said. “If you use psychology tests, you can take this information to conclude how well they can work together.”Amy Hoover, an assistant professor of informatics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who’s built algorithms for the digital card game Hearthstone, said “there really is a reason for studying games” but it is not always easy to explain.“People aren’t always understanding that the point is about the optimization method rather than the game,” she said.Games also offer a useful testbed for AI — including for some real-world applications in robotics or health care — that’s safer to try in a virtual world, said Vanessa Volz, an AI researcher at the Danish startup Modl.ai, which builds AI systems for game development.But, she adds, “it can get overhyped.""“It’s probably not going to be one big breakthrough and that everything is going to be shifted to the real world,” Volz said.Japanese electronics giant Sony launched its own AI research division in 2020 with entertainment in mind, but it's nonetheless attracted broader academic attention. Its research paper introducing Sophy last year made it on the cover of the prestigious science journal Nature, which said it could potentially have effects on other applications such as drones and self-driving vehicles.The technology behind Sophy is based on an algorithmic method known as reinforcement learning, which trains the system by rewarding it when it gets something right as it runs virtual races thousands of times.“The reward is going to tell you that, ‘You’re making progress. This is good,’ or, ‘You’re off the track. Well, that’s not good,'"" Spranger said.The world's best Gran Turismo players are still finishing ahead of Sophy at tournaments, but average players will find it hard to beat — and can adjust difficulty settings depending on how much they want to be challenged.PlayStation players will only get to try racing against Sophy until March 31, on a limited number of circuits, so it can get some feedback and go back into testing. Peter Wurman, director of Sony AI America and project lead on GT Sophy, said it takes about two weeks for AI agents to train on 20 PlayStations.“To get it spread throughout the whole game, it takes some more breakthroughs and some more time before we’re ready for that,” he said.And to get it onto real streets or Formula One tracks? That could take a lot longer.Self-driving car companies adopt similar machine-learning techniques, but “they don’t hand over complete control of the car the way we are able to,” Wurman said. “In a simulated world, there’s nobody’s life at risk. You know exactly the kinds of things you’re going to see in the environment. There’s no people crossing the road or anything like that.”",2023/02/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823151,"GOP leaders, stung by losses, plan to wade into Senate races","WASHINGTON (AP) — A football legend who held a gun to his ex-wife’s head. Rivals who nearly brawled during a televised debate. A venture capitalist who voiced sympathy for the Unabomber. 

            And that's just to name a few. 

            Republican Senate primaries in several pivotal states last year exuded a carnival-like aura, dominated by far-right candidates whose ill-advised remarks and damaging personal baggage ultimately cost the party its chance of retaking a majority. But even as alarms sounded over a growing crisis of electability, party leaders mostly stood by, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the Senate GOP's campaign chief, who insisted on remaining neutral in the nominating contests. 











            Now, at the dawn of the 2024 campaign season, Republicans say they are taking steps to avoid a repeat. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which Scott formerly led, intends to wade into party primaries in key states, providing resources to its preferred candidates in a bid to produce nominees who are more palatable to general election voters. 

            It may be easier said than done. Similar efforts have backfired in recent years, with the party's restive base rejecting the attempts. The new push will test anew whether the GOP establishment can steer a party reshaped by Donald Trump's insurgent presidency back to mainstream appeal. 

            ""One thing I kept hearing when I took this job was that Republicans are sick and tired of losing,"" said Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, the new chairman of the NRSC. ""This is our last chance this decade to target red-state Democrats, so we’re going to do whatever it takes to recruit candidates who can win both a primary and general election.”

            The new approach was on display this month during an NRSC retreat at the Breakers, a luxury resort in Palm Beach, Florida, which drew senators and potential candidates, including Dave McCormick. The hedge fund CEO narrowly lost Pennsylvania's 2022 Republican Senate primary to Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Trump-backed TV personality who was defeated in the general election by Democrat John Fetterman by roughly 5 percentage points. 

            McCormick, who is considering another run in 2024, spoke at the multiday event, according to two senior Republican strategists, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the details of the private gathering. 

            Later, before a crowded banquet room that included at least one other potential rival for the Pennsylvania seat, Daines singled out McCormick with praise, saying he would make an excellent candidate, according to one of the strategists.

            If he enters the primary, McCormick has also been promised support from the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that spends millions of dollars on TV advertising, according to two other Republican strategists familiar with the matter.

            That serves as a warning to anyone else thinking about the race: If McCormick gets in, he would have the full weight and resources of the Senate Republican campaign operation behind him. 

            Another example of recent intervention is the committee's early endorsement of Rep. Jim Banks in Indiana's Senate primary. Though Indiana is reliably Republican, a crowded primary, like in 2018, could sap resources better spent in competitive states. Banks has yet to draw a serious competitor. 

            The move could also be viewed as a show of good faith to Trump, as well as the conservative group Club for Growth, who have often worked at cross-purposes with Republican Senate leaders. Banks is close with Donald Trump Jr., Trump's oldest son, and he has also been championed by Club for Growth. 

            Some Republicans contrast the new approach the NRSC intends to take with that of Scott. Consider his handling of Colorado's Senate primary in 2022. Joe O'Dea, a moderate Republican and construction company owner, was viewed by many as the kind of candidate who could win in the onetime swing state during a good year for the GOP. 

            But Scott pointedly declined to endorse O'Dea during a trip to the state, while also offering praise for O'Dea's rival, a state legislator who espoused conspiracy theories, crossed police lines at the U.S. Capitol during the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection and struggled to raise campaign cash.

            O'Dea ultimately lost the general election by nearly 15 percentage points. But the incident offers an example of power centers within the party working at cross purposes — in this case, Scott declining to get behind a candidate many viewed as the party's only chance to win. 

            It also helped fuel a feud between Scott and McConnell, which sowed chaos throughout the Senate Republican campaign effort and culminated in a failed challenge by Scott of McConnell's position as Senate leader. 

            A spokesman for Scott declined to comment. Scott previously said that “the nice thing” about the campaign chief job is that “everybody gets to try what they believe works,” while calling for the party to stay out of primaries and ""let the voters do it.”

            In a statement, Josh Holmes, a top McConnell adviser, offered praise for Daines' leadership of the committee, which Daines took over late last year. 

            “Leader McConnell enthusiastically supports Senator Daines and his effort to help recapture the majority,” Holmes said. He “has a high level of confidence in his ability to deliver the best candidate for every race across the map.”

            Yet there are limits to what the NRSC can do. Trump, who remains a potent force in GOP politics, was largely successful pushing a slate of far-right candidates in marquee Senate primaries last year. With his third bid for the White House now underway, it's unclear whether he intends to do the same in 2024. 

            Beyond recruiting candidates, the NRSC also plans to conduct media training. In some cases it intends to stay out of primaries in which its involvement could become a liability. It also plans to lend fundraising assistance, help candidates build out their infrastructure and keep tabs on whether its candidates are running competent digital operations. 

            That's basic politics and may sound obvious. But many of the first-time candidates running during last year's midterms failed to pay attention to such details, ultimately requiring last-minute intervention from the party ahead of the general election.

            Former NFL star Herschel Walker struggled on the campaign trail to address his messy personal life, including allegations of domestic abuse and children he fathered and largely abandoned. 

            Lackluster fundraising by then-Senate candidate J.D. Vance in Ohio forced a bailout from the Senate Leadership Fund, which spent millions of dollars on TV advertising on his behalf on his ultimately successful campaign. In the primary, Vance bested two rivals who nearly came to blows in a debate. One of them, Mike Gibbons, is viewed as a potential contender in the state's 2024 contest.

            Then there is Arizona candidate Blake Masters, who excelled in the primary thanks to an endorsement from Trump and $15 million that his mentor, tech billionaire Peter Thiel, invested in a pro-Masters super PAC.

            In the general election, however, Democrats seized on past comments made by Masters, and voters recoiled. Those comments included sympathetic remarks made by Masters about the Unabomber as well as his calls for privatizing Social Security in a state with an outsize share of voters who rely on the program. Masters was also out-fundraised nearly 8-1 in the general election. The party eventually cut him loose, and he lost by the greatest margin of any Republican running statewide. 

            “We need people running who can win,” said Steven Law, the CEO of the Senate Leadership Fund. ""We’re raising the resources to ensure we have quality candidates.” 

            Recent history indicates those efforts don’t always work out. 

            Luther Strange, who had the party’s backing in 2017, lost a fierce Senate primary to Roy Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice who was credibly accused of sexual misconduct, including pursuing relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. 

            Retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, a far-right purveyor of conspiracy theories, won his primary last year in New Hampshire even after a super PAC financed by Law's Senate Leadership Fund spent $4.6 million against him, campaign finance disclosures show. 

            Even Walker, perhaps one of the most disastrous Republican candidates in recent memory, was endorsed by McConnell and other top Republicans before the primary. 

            “Let’s not get caught in the assumption that the only thing that determines who candidates are is Mitch McConnell and the NRSC,” said J.B. Poersch, who leads Senate Democrats’ main super PAC. “These are not stupid people, and they have a lot of experience. But there seems to be denial about who their party is and where they are currently. The MAGA right is also part of this process.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823152,US House select committee on China mulls fact-finding trip to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Representative Mike Gallagher, the chairman of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, indicated that he is planning a trip to Taiwan with fellow committee members to understand the threat and defensive aspects of a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan.Gallagher spoke about his low-profile visit to Taiwan last week, and his remarks were quoted by the Financial Times. Gallagher said he was invited by officials of Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) to return to Taiwan with fellow committee members for a “fact-finding trip” to better understand “the dynamics of a military invasion.”“I’d like to take the minister of defense up on the offer to ... go with him to various military sites and see how they’re preparing,” Gallagher said. “It would be very useful for my members to see the problem up close.”Following his return from Taiwan to Washington last week, Gallagher spoke with the Washington Post. He said that arming Taiwan so that the country can adequately deter and resist a Chinese invasion should be one of Washington’s primary foreign policy objectives.Any future visit by Gallagher and other members of the select committee would be to better understand the logistics of a defensive military campaign and the difficulty of keeping supply lines open during a potential war, per FT. Gallagher and other members of congress are treating the possibility of a Chinese attack on Taiwan seriously, and taking measures to ensure Taiwan and the U.S. are both prepared for any military contingency.

Gallagher did not mention any potential dates for the fact-finding trip, but he did say that time is of the essence. Currently, there is also speculation that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will visit Taipei sometime this spring, but no dates have been confirmed.

Two other members of the house select committee on China, Ro Khanna and Jake Auchinloss were also in Taiwan last week to discuss trade issues. The select committee is scheduled to hold its first hearing in Washington on Tuesday (Feb. 28).",2023/02/27,1649,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823153,"228, Japan, and selective amnesia","TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — Today commemorates the 228 Massacre of 1947 and its horrific aftermath.News reports about various memorial activities being held fill the newspapers and short, potted histories of the events will be added to the internet and shared around. Those short, potted histories almost always leave out an important detail.It does not matter whether the author is pan-blue or pan-green, both sides do not really like to talk about it, but its legacy colors politics and foreign affairs to this day. Much (though not necessarily all) of the brutality imposed on the Taiwanese by the newly arrived Chinese troops in the late 1940s was due to their hatred of the Japanese, and with this in mind, reading the horrific accounts of atrocities committed gives it more context.Those soldiers had only been fighting the Japanese just over a year earlier in a brutal war that had started in 1937 and only ended in 1945. While in China, the Imperial Japanese Army committed some of the worst atrocities in history.During the Rape of Nanjing, the Japanese engaged in an orgy of rape and massacre, leaving hundreds of thousands dead. Horrific and barbaric experiments were conducted on tens of thousands on living people.The hatred and loathing most of those Chinese soldiers had for the Japanese must have run very deep indeed, and many no doubt wanted revenge. Then they were sent to Formosa, then still legally a colony of the Empire of Japan.After 50 years as a Japanese colony, Taiwan had changed significantly since it was part of the Manchurian Qing Empire. The Japanese had developed Taiwan, and it was far more modern and well-run than China by that point.It had modern infrastructure, stately Japanese-style buildings and grand train stations and government buildings, including the current presidential office building. Signage was often in Japanese, shops sold Japanese products.Most of the people spoke Japanese and some dressed in Japanese-style clothing. They slept on tatami mats in homes full of Japanese goods.Aside from a small number who went to fight for China, the vast majority of Taiwanese soldiers in World War II fought on the Japanese side. That’s a fact the incoming Chinese soldiers were all too well aware of, and many former Taiwanese soldiers were targeted as a result.It did not help that aside from soldiers hailing from China’s Fujian Province and some Hakkas, there was a major language barrier. Even the Fujianese soldiers were probably put off by Taiwanese speakers, as many Japanese words and phrases had entered into the language (and remain today).The Taiwanese initially welcomed the Chinese. They had suffered under the Japanese.All that modern infrastructure was not for the Taiwanese, it was for the economic benefit of Japan and the hundreds of thousands of Japanese residents. Exceptions, such as much improved sanitation for Taiwanese, were in the end about controlling disease to keep the Japanese safe.Taiwanese were second-class citizens, with the best jobs and education opportunities largely reserved for the Japanese. When Taiwanese could get good jobs, their pay was significantly lower and for the most part Taiwanese were simply a source of cheap labor.In all the books I’ve read on the subject from the period by Taiwanese authors, all describe chafing and suffering under Japanese oppression. It’s only later that some Taiwanese, such as former President Lee Tung-hui (李登輝, then called Iwasato Takenori), had positive things to say about the Japanese era — but that is because of what came next.The incoming Republic of China (ROC) officials set about looting Taiwan both to pay for the civil war raging in China and to fulfil their own deeply corrupt desires. Inflation spiralled out of control, basic items like rice became unaffordable and crime skyrocketed, often committed by the incoming troops.The previously oppressive but orderly life under the Japanese had now become dystopian and dangerous oppression under the ROC. By February of 1947, graffiti was all over Taipei reading “dogs go, pigs come,” with the Japanese being the outgoing “dogs” and the ROC the incoming “pigs.”It only took just over a year for the Taiwanese to rise up in revolt in what we now refer to as 228. Rebels took over swathes of the country, but Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) ordered in reinforcements to conduct a brutal and ruthlessly successful crackdown.This has all left an important stamp on both Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) current thinking on Japan, and some selective amnesia in both the blue and green camps. Today the DPP is strongly pro-Japan, the KMT less so.Unlike their counterparts in the other former colony of Japan, Korea, pan-green supporters view their Japanese colonial era with something that at times is outright nostalgic. They remember the increased development, better education and better incomes under the Japanese, but almost never mention the oppression and being treated as second-class subjects.That they were fighting on the Japanese side of the war is glossed over, and the subject of the sex slaves (“comfort women”) the Imperial Japanese Army used as instruments of rape is not brought up. They prefer to emphasize the positive aspects of the era, like the grand architecture and cultural influences that are still evident today. The Koreans, on the other hand, remember all the downsides, and it remains a major roadblock in relations between the two countries today.The main difference between Koreans and Taiwanese is that, for most Taiwanese, what came after the Japanese was so much worse in terms of governance (the Koreans did face civil war, though). Most Taiwanese have also received very little education on the Japanese era in school, and know very little about it.Pan-green supporters point to the Japanese influence as one of the reasons that Taiwanese are distinct from Chinese. They are right, as anyone who has spent any time in China knows.But they also do not want to push that too far, and I suspect that is why they do not want to talk about the revenge factor by Chinese troops. They want to underscore that Taiwanese are unique and should be independent, and around 228 there was a lot of discussion within the Allies as to whether it would revert to Japan, stay under the ROC, or become independent.The KMT has retained a suspicion of Japan that lingers to this day, especially those from 49er families that fled the Chinese Civil War. They remember what Japan did in China.However, by the 1950s, the KMT-controlled ROC had to try and get along with Japan as part of the Cold War front against Communism. That was partly out of self-interest, partly at the behest of the United States.However, the KMT-era history books glorified China’s fight in the war and the eventual victory over Japan. They established the day that Taiwan was handed over to the ROC, October 25, as Retrocession Day, which remained a holiday until the year 2000.The party commemorates victories and key dates from the war of resistance to Japan to this day. Former President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) ordered a four-month-long “70th Anniversary of Victory Over Japan” celebration in 2015 that cost NT$72.45 million, something that would be unimaginable under a DPP government.That was an intentional irritant to the relationship with Japan by the KMT, but there are others. With some justification, the KMT periodically brings up the shameful behavior by the Japanese government toward the remaining sex slaves, but the DPP shies away from the issue, in spite of the women in question being Taiwanese.Another is the issue of the Senkaku Islands, which are called Diaoyutai in Taiwan and Diaoyu in China. All three countries claim the islands, but they are administered by Japan.The KMT periodically also tries to raise nationalist fervour over the islands. DPP leaders, like President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) respond with formulaic statements like “the Diaoyutais are of course ROC territory,” but it’s obvious to everyone that she hopes the issue would just go away.Incidentally, former President Ma wrote his thesis at Harvard on ROC claims to the islands. The KMT introduces these irritants to Japan relations, but never pushes it too far, they are aware that the relationship with Japan is necessary and looked on favorably by the U.S.For the KMT, they leave the Japanese element out of the 228 discussion because it does not look good that their soldiers were at least partly so brutal due to revenge. It also undermines their narrative that Taiwanese are Chinese, because clearly they were not being treated as such by the ROC in 228 and the aftermath.",2023/02/27,2088,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823160,IRA splinter group claims responsibility for police shooting,"LONDON (AP) — Police in Northern Ireland said Monday they were looking into an unverified statement by an Irish Republican Army splinter group claiming responsibility for the shooting of a senior police officer.

            A statement purportedly from the dissident group known as the New IRA appeared on a wall in Londonderry late Sunday, claiming it was responsible for Wednesday's attack on Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell.

            Two masked men shot Caldwell in front of his young son after the off-duty officer coached a children's soccer team in Omagh, about 60 miles (nearly 100 kilometers) west of Belfast. Caldwell remained in critical condition in hospital.











            Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan said Monday police were aware of the claim of responsibility and was “reviewing its contents as part of the overall investigation.”

            Police said last week they were treating the attempted murder of Caldwell as terrorism-related, and that the New IRA was its primary line of enquiry. 

            Six men were detained for questioning.

            Paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland put down their arms after the 1998 Good Friday peace accord largely ended three decades of violent conflict, known as “the Troubles,"" between Irish republican and British loyalist groups and U.K. security forces. 

            But small IRA splinter groups have continued to launch sporadic attacks on security forces. The last fatal attack on a police officer in Northern Ireland was the April 2011 killing of Constable Ronan Kerr, who died when a booby-trap bomb exploded under his car in Omagh.LONDON (AP) — Police in Northern Ireland said Monday they were looking into an unverified statement by an Irish Republican Army splinter group claiming responsibility for the shooting of a senior police officer.A statement purportedly from the dissident group known as the New IRA appeared on a wall in Londonderry late Sunday, claiming it was responsible for Wednesday's attack on Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell.Two masked men shot Caldwell in front of his young son after the off-duty officer coached a children's soccer team in Omagh, about 60 miles (nearly 100 kilometers) west of Belfast.

            According to Syria's state news agency SANA, the two mines exploded east of the central town of Salamiyeh. All the casualties were taken to a hospital in the town, the report added. It wasn't immediately clear what had triggered the explosions.

            It is not uncommon for mines left behind years ago, when IS controlled large parts of Syria, to go off inadvertently, usually when stepped on, inflicting casualties.











            IS was driven out of all the territory it once held in Syria and neighboring Iraq in 2019, but the extremists left behind countless bombs and booby traps, and large areas have yet to be cleared. The militant group’s sleeper cells still carry deadly attacks both in Syria and Iraq.

            SANA said the first explosion on Monday killed nine people and wounded two while the second killed one person and wounded 10.

            Earlier this month, IS sleeper cells attacked workers collecting truffles near the central town of Sukhna, killing at least 53 people, mostly workers but also some Syrian government security forces.

            The truffles are a seasonal delicacy that can be sold for a high price. Since the truffle hunters work in large groups in remote areas, IS militants in previous years have repeatedly preyed on them, emerging from the desert to abduct them, kill some and ransom others for money.DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Land mines left behind by the Islamic State group in central Syria went off in two different locations on Monday, killing 10 workers as they were collecting truffles in the countryside and wounding 12, state media reported.According to Syria's state news agency SANA, the two mines exploded east of the central town of Salamiyeh.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823193,Kimberly Palmer: 5 ways to deal with money envy,"If you’ve ever scrolled through social media posts only to be gripped with envy when you see a friend posing in front of their beautiful house or enjoying themselves at a luxurious resort, then you understand how easy it is to want what other people have. Financial envy is real, and sometimes it can be ugly.

            “Financial envy is absolutely normal. It’s part of the human condition,” says Yvonne Hampton, who holds a doctorate in personal financial planning and runs a financial therapy practice in the Kansas City, Missouri, area.

            And it’s not necessarily a bad thing, she adds. “It’s an opportunity to dig more deeply internally about why we have that feeling so we can work through it and be happier in our own lives.”











            If you’re wondering how to turn the so-called green-eyed monster into a positive force in your life, here are five steps to take.

            1. LET GO OF SHAME

            “A lot of progress can be made simply by acknowledging: ‘Yes, I feel envious,’” says Rick Kahler, a certified financial therapist and certified financial planner in Rapid City, South Dakota. “Be compassionate toward yourself,” he adds.

            Then, you can more easily turn toward the concrete steps that help you meet your financial goals, whether it’s paying off debt, saving for a down payment or building up an emergency fund for greater financial security.

            2. GET SPECIFIC ABOUT YOUR TRIGGERS

            People are more likely to feel envious of people in their own peer group versus mega-rich icons like Jeff Bezos or Oprah Winfrey, Hampton says. “Those feelings are a signal: If you are envious of a neighbor getting a new car, what is that feeling?”

            Perhaps it’s rooted in a desire to earn more money or spend your money differently. Once you figure out the cause of the feeling, then you can address it and make changes in your own life.

            “It can give us insight into what we really want,” Hampton says. If it truly is about buying a car, then you can give yourself a savings goal and start setting money aside each month.

            3. USE ENVY AS A MOTIVATOR, NOT A DETRACTOR

            Some forms of envy may be helpful, says Robert Leahy, author of “The Jealousy Cure” and clinical professor of psychology in psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine. He notes that envy is visible across cultures governed by hierarchies, including with animals like dogs, and even in human toddlers. In its most positive light, envy can lead us to learn from the success of others and apply lessons to our own lives.

            But it also has a dark side, stirring up feelings of inferiority and insecurity. Envy can lead to self-harm, such as cultivating feelings of hatred toward wealthy people, which can drain energy away from your own life and pursuits, said Rainer Zitelmann, a historian and sociologist and author of “The Art of a Successful Life,” in an email from his home in Berlin, Germany.

            Zitelmann warns that unchecked envy can easily become destructive. “You should acknowledge envy whenever you experience it, because envious people only end up harming themselves,” he wrote.

            4. RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU DON’T SEE

            While your first reaction to a friend’s social media posts might be envy, the truth of their situation could be far more complex than the photo suggests, Hampton points out.

            “We don’t know the whole story. You don’t know how long they saved for that house, or how hard they worked for it, or if their parents paid for it. Maybe they’re screaming at 3 a.m. about paying the mortgage,” she says.

            It’s easy to feel jealous of someone’s public posts that showcase the highlights of their life without any of the behind-the-scenes struggle.

            “In all the time I’ve been doing (financial therapy), I’ve never met someone who felt like they had it all. We’re all dealing with something. Even if you’re at the higher income spectrum, there are still challenges and these are challenging times with inflationary pressures,” Hampton says.

            5. REFLECT ON WHAT ACTUALLY BRINGS YOU JOY

            Leahy suggests a thought exercise to counteract materialistic envy: “Imagine everything has been taken away,” he says, including all of your possessions. You get one thing back at a time, but only if you can make the case that you appreciate it. That process clarifies your values, he says. “You can see you have many different sources of satisfaction and purpose.”

            And in a final tip from Leahy: Think back to an experience of real contentment in your life. It might have been as simple as sitting by a lake with a friend — perhaps not an Instagrammable moment, but one that was far more meaningful.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823195,Winds tear through Southern Plains; Northeast to see snow,"Parts of the Southern Plains counted the injured and surveyed the damage Monday after tornadoes and other powerful winds swept through, while some Michigan residents faced a fifth consecutive day without power following last week’s ice storm.

            In California, the National Weather Service said a series of winter storm systems will continue moving into the state through Wednesday after residents got a brief break from severe weather Sunday.

            Parts of the Northeast that have seen little snow this winter were under a winter storm warning. And forecasters warned of continued high winds in parts of the Plains and of thunderstorms and possible tornadoes in the Ohio Valley.











            A look at the weather threats around the country:

            TORNADO CLEANUP, FORECAST

            Police in Norman, Oklahoma, responded Sunday night to storm damage in parts of the city, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City. Officials said there were 12 confirmed weather-related injuries there, none considered critical.

            Crews canvassed the damaged area looking for others who might be injured. Possible tornadoes and wind gusts as high as 90 mph (144 kilometers) were reported in Oklahoma, with downed trees and power lines, road closures and damage to homes around Norman and Shawnee.

            Frances Tabler, of Norman, told KOCO-TV that she suffered a small cut on her head when a storm hit her home, tearing off much of its roof and sending debris flying. She said it was a miracle her children weren't hurt, although her daughter was trapped for awhile in a bedroom. 

            “I could hear the wind coming. All of a sudden all the back windows, where the kids bedrooms are, I could hear them just crashing, busting out. And I got up, and then the wind just threw me back, and I’m screaming,"" Tabler told KOCO. “It was just like a blizzard in the house with all the debris flying. I was screaming for my kids.”

            A tornado touched down Sunday near Liberal, Kansas, the weather service said, and more than a dozen homes were reported damaged, according to KSNW-TV. One person had minor injuries, the station said.

            There were reports of nine tornadoes in Kansas, Oklahoma and northwestern Texas, said Bob Oravec, a lead forecaster for the weather service. Weather service teams planned to survey storm damage Monday to determine the strength of the tornadoes.

            The severe weather threat remained Monday, with thunderstorms expected to produce damaging gusts across the Ohio Valley, according to the Storm Prediction Center. At least a few tornadoes are were possible, especially across Ohio on Monday afternoon, the center said. The weather service forecast strong winds Monday in Kansas and Missouri, with gusts topping 60 mph (96 kph).

            NORTHEAST SNOWSTORM

            While not expecting a blockbuster storm by regional standards, southern New England braced for what could be the most significant snowfall of what has so far been a mild winter.

            A winter storm warning covered parts of the Northeast, including Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island, with heavy snow forecast for Monday evening through Tuesday afternoon.

            Boston could get 5 inches and a messy Tuesday morning commute, according to the weather service. As much as 10 inches could fall in western Massachusetts, northwest Connecticut and southern Vermont. 

            MICHIGAN ICE STORM

            In Michigan, crews continued to work to restore electricity. Leah Thomas, whose home north of Detroit lost power Wednesday night, finally got her power back late Sunday afternoon.

            Thomas said she feels lucky that she and their 17-year-old son were able to stay at her parents’ nearby home, which still had power, while they are in Florida.

            With her husband traveling out of town, Thomas said it was up to her to recharge the battery to their home’s backup sump pump Sunday with her car. She went to multiple stores to find a long cable for the task.

            Although her basement didn't flood during the outage, Thomas said Monday morning that she lost all the food in her refrigerator, including about $200 worth of prepared meals she had in her freezer. She said she would have moved her food to her parents' freezer but did not because DTE Energy had repeatedly notified her that her home's power would be back on soon. 

            Instead, it took nearly four days for the power to be restored.

            “We did lose all our food because we didn't realize the outage was going to be so long. DTE kept telling us the power would be back the same day,"" Thomas said.

            With the local school district on midwinter break, she said, some of their neighbors have been out of town and will return to find a mess from burst water pipes and flooded basements.

            “They don’t know what they’re coming home to,"" she said.

            In hard-hit southeastern Michigan, still reeling from the ice storm and high winds, the state’s two main utilities — DTE Energy and Consumers Energy — reported more than 92,000 homes and businesses without power as of late Monday morning. More than 63,000 of those were DTE customers.

            CALIFORNIA GETS A BREAK

            California, meanwhile, got a brief break from severe weather after a powerful storm a day earlier swelled Los Angeles-area rivers to dangerous levels, flooded roads and dumped snow at elevations as low as about 1,000 feet (300 meters). The sun came out briefly Sunday in greater Los Angeles, where residents emerged to marvel at mountains to the north and east blanketed in white. 

            Suburban Santa Clarita, in hills north of Los Angeles, received its first significant snowfall since 1989.

            “We went outside and we let our sons play in the snow,” resident Cesar Torres told the Santa Clarita Signal. “We figured, while the snow’s there, might as well make a snowman out of it.”Parts of the Southern Plains counted the injured and surveyed the damage Monday after tornadoes and other powerful winds swept through, while some Michigan residents faced a fifth consecutive day without power following last week’s ice storm.In California, the National Weather Service said a series of winter storm systems will continue moving into the state through Wednesday after residents got a brief break from severe weather Sunday.Parts of the Northeast that have seen little snow this winter were under a winter storm warning.

She said she would have moved her food to her parents' freezer but did not because DTE Energy had repeatedly notified her that her home's power would be back on soon.Instead, it took nearly four days for the power to be restored.“We did lose all our food because we didn't realize the outage was going to be so long. DTE kept telling us the power would be back the same day,"" Thomas said.With the local school district on midwinter break, she said, some of their neighbors have been out of town and will return to find a mess from burst water pipes and flooded basements.“They don’t know what they’re coming home to,"" she said.In hard-hit southeastern Michigan, still reeling from the ice storm and high winds, the state’s two main utilities — DTE Energy and Consumers Energy — reported more than 92,000 homes and businesses without power as of late Monday morning. More than 63,000 of those were DTE customers.CALIFORNIA GETS A BREAKCalifornia, meanwhile, got a brief break from severe weather after a powerful storm a day earlier swelled Los Angeles-area rivers to dangerous levels, flooded roads and dumped snow at elevations as low as about 1,000 feet (300 meters). The sun came out briefly Sunday in greater Los Angeles, where residents emerged to marvel at mountains to the north and east blanketed in white.Suburban Santa Clarita, in hills north of Los Angeles, received its first significant snowfall since 1989.“We went outside and we let our sons play in the snow,” resident Cesar Torres told the Santa Clarita Signal. “We figured, while the snow’s there, might as well make a snowman out of it.”",2023/02/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823196,Norway protests target wind farm on land used by herders,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Dozens of activists, including Greta Thunberg of neighboring Sweden, blocked the entrance to Norway’s energy ministry in Oslo Monday to protest a wind farm they say hinders the rights of the Sami Indigenous people to raise reindeer in Arctic Norway.

            The activists, mainly teenagers, lay outside the ministry entrance holding Sami flags and a poster reading “Land Back.”

            The protesters from organizations called Young Friends of The Earth Norway and the Norwegian Sami Association’s youth council NSR-Nuorat, said “the ongoing human rights violations” against Sami reindeer herders “must come to an end.” Several of the activists donned the Sami's traditional bright-colored dress and put up a tent used by the Arctic people.











            In October 2021, Norway’s Supreme Court ruled that the construction of the wind turbines violated the rights of the Sami, who have been using the land to raise reindeer for centuries. However, the wind farm is still operating.

            “It is absurd that the Norwegian government has chosen to ignore the ruling,” said Thunberg, who joined the protest early Monday.

            Over the weekend, the protesters had occupied the ministry’s lobby but were evicted by police early Monday, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. They shifted their protest to chaining themselves outside the main entrance to the ministry, prompting authorities to urge employees to work from home.

            By chaining themselves, “we make it practically more difficult to move us,” activist Ella Marie Hætta Isaksen told NRK.

            Norway's Energy Minister Terje Aasland told NRK that although the Supreme Court has ruled that the construction of the wind farm is invalid, the court does not say anything about what should happen to it.

            The government must “make new decisions that are in line with the premise of the Supreme Court’s judgment,” Aasland told the broadcaster.

            Other activists who were sitting outside the doors of nearby government buildings “have been ordered to move and if they don’t we will remove them by force,"" said police spokesman Brian Skotnes shortly before officers were seen carrying activists away. They were not arrested.

            The Sami live in Lapland, which stretches from northern parts of Norway through Sweden and Finland to Russia. They once faced oppression of their culture, including bans on the use of their native tongue.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823200,UN chief points to 'massive' rights violations in Ukraine,"GENEVA (AP) — Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has triggered “the most massive violations of human rights” in the world today, the head of the United Nations said Monday, as the war pushed into its second year with no end in sight and tens of thousands dead.

            The Russian invasion “has unleashed widespread death, destruction and displacement,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a speech to the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council in Geneva.

            After failing to capture Kyiv in the opening weeks of the invasion on Feb. 24 last year and suffering a series of humiliating setbacks during the fall, Russia has stabilized the front and is concentrating its efforts on capturing four provinces that Moscow illegally annexed in September — Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine, meanwhile, hopes to use battle tanks and other new weapons pledged by the West to launch new counteroffensives and reclaim more of the occupied territory.











            Guterres said “attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have caused many casualties and terrible suffering.” 

            The intense fighting for territory in eastern Ukraine was in sharp focus Sunday at a Ukrainian field hospital treating wounded from the intense battle for the city of Bakhmut, which is devastated. A constant flow of battered and exhausted soldiers came in on stretchers.

            Anatoliy, the chief of the medical service, said his team treats dozens of soldiers every day and barely has time to eat.

            “My medics work practically non-stop. Before the full-scale invasion we had 50-60 wounded in a nine-month rotation, and now sometimes we have more (than that) in one day,” he told The Associated Press. He provided only one name for security reasons.

            Guterres' remarks came as the Ukrainian military said that Russia launched attacks with exploding drones on several regions of the country from late Sunday until Monday morning, killing two people.

            Meanwhile, Belarusian opposition activists claimed a military air base outside Belarusia’s capital that hosts Russian warplanes came under attack Sunday by Belarusian guerrillas.

            BYPOL, an online messaging app channel run by the activists, and several other online resources operated by the Belarusian opposition, said an A-50 early warning and control aircraft was seriously damaged in the attack at the Machulishchy base near Minsk.

            The activists provided no evidence to support the claims, which couldn’t be independently verified. Belarusian and Russian officials made no comment, but Belarusia's President Alexander Lukashenko urged top military and security officials on Monday to tighten discipline.

            Russia used the territory of its ally Belarus to invade Ukraine a year ago. Belarus continues to host Russian troops, warplanes and other weapons.

            Guterres, in his Geneva speech, cited cases of sexual violence, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and violations of the rights of prisoners of war documented by the U.N. human rights office.

            He decried how the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now 75 years old, has been “too often misused and abused.”

            “It is exploited for political gain and it is ignored, often, by the very same people,” Guterres said. “Some governments chip away at it. Others use a wrecking ball.”

            “This is a moment to stand on the right side of history,” he told the council, the U.N.’s top human rights body. Russia withdrew from its seat last year amid a surge in international pressure over the war in Ukraine.

            Dozens of high-level envoys at the Geneva meeting — many from Western countries — lashed out at Russia over its conduct of the war. At the simultaneous Conference on Disarmament, another U.N.-backed body, delegates criticized Putin’s decision to suspend Russia’s participation in the New START agreement with the United States, the last nuclear arms control agreement between Moscow and Washington.

            Russia was not represented at the council, and its top envoy to the session wasn’t expected to speak until Thursday.

            Russian officials have shown little sign they may be reconsidering their attack on their neighbor, however.

            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday: “We aren’t seeing any conditions for a peaceful settlement now.”

            Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council that is chaired by President Vladimir Putin, went a step further, once again raising the specter of nuclear war and a nightmare outcome to Europe’s biggest and deadliest conflict since World War II.

            He chided the U.S. and its allies for providing Ukraine with military and other support to help push back the Kremlin’s forces. Their longer-term aim, he claimed, is to break up Russia.

            Putin has also framed the war in those terms, saying it's an existential risk to Russia.

            In the Sunday-Monday attacks, Ukraine’s General Staff said Kyiv's forces shot down 11 out of 14 Iranian-made Shahed drones.

            Ukraine’s presidential office said Monday that at least two civilians were killed and nine others wounded by Russian attacks over the previous 24 hours.

            It said intense fighting has continued around Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Vuhledar in the Donetsk region, which have come under relentless Russian shelling.

            Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the Russian offensive aimed at securing control of eastern Ukraine has effectively become bogged down while losing “huge numbers of weapons and ammunition.”

            Zhdanov said the Ukrainian military, in turn, is building up forces for a future counteroffensive in the south while pummeling Russian positions and depots there.

            “Ukraine has significantly intensified the shelling of Russian positions in the south, destroying roads and depots, which is an important condition for the success of a future counteroffensive,” he said.

            In other developments, the Russian military claimed its forces struck an electronic intelligence center near Brovary, just east of Kyiv. 

            Russia’s Defense Ministry also said that Russian forces struck a special operations center of the Ukrainian armed forces near the western city of Khmelnytskyi. 

            The ministry didn’t say when the strikes were launched, and its claim couldn’t be independently verified.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823202,German government pushes back on call to close Facebook page,"BERLIN (AP) — The German government on Monday pushed back against a demand by the country's data protection commissioner to take down its Facebook page over data privacy concerns.

            The commissioner, Ulrich Kelber, said Wednesday that he had given the government's press office four weeks to shut down the page. 

            “All public agencies have a responsibility to uphold the law in exemplary fashion,” Kelber said. “The result of my assessments is that this is currently impossible when running a fan page because of the wide-ranging processing of users' personal data.”











            He argued that people who run such Facebook pages and the social network's owner, Meta, are jointly responsible for what is done with users' personal data, and that the government was unable to prove that data protection principles — a deeply held concern in Germany — were being adhered to.

            The government will use the coming weeks to examine Kelber's decision carefully and decide on its next steps, spokesman Wolfgang Büchner said. 

            “We are of the opinion that Facebook alone is responsible for its data processing under data protection law,"" he told reporters in Berlin. He added that obtaining legal clarity is important for all concerned.

            “From our point of view, our Facebook presence is an important part of our public relations work which we would like to stick with for the time being,” Büchner said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823203,Supreme Court student loan case: The arguments explained,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is about to hear arguments over President Joe Biden’s student debt relief plan, which impacts millions of borrowers who could see their loans wiped away or reduced.

            So far, Republican-appointed judges have kept the Democratic president's plan from going into effect, and it remains to be seen how the court, dominated 6-3 by conservatives, will respond. The justices have scheduled two hours of arguments in the case Tuesday, though it will probably go longer. The public can listen in on the court’s website beginning at 10 a.m. EST.

            Where things stand ahead of the hearing as well as what to expect:











            HOW DOES THE FORGIVENESS PLAN WORK?

            The debt forgiveness plan announced in August would cancel $10,000 in federal student loan debt for those making less than $125,000 or households with less than $250,000 in income per year. Pell Grant recipients, who typically demonstrate more financial need, would get an additional $10,000 in debt forgiven.

            College students qualify if their loans were disbursed before July 1. The plan makes 43 million borrowers eligible for some debt forgiveness, with 20 million who could have their debt erased entirely, according to the Biden administration.

            The White House says 26 million people have applied for debt relief, and 16 million people had already had their relief approved. The Congressional Budget Office has said the program will cost about $400 billion over the next three decades.

            HOW DID THE ISSUE WIND UP AT THE SUPREME COURT?

            The Supreme Court is hearing two challenges to the plan. One involves six Republican-led states that sued. The other involves a lawsuit filed by two students. 

            A lower court dismissed the lawsuit involving the following states: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina. The court said the states could not challenge the program because they weren't harmed by it. But a panel of three federal appeals court judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit — all of them appointed by Republican presidents — put the program on hold during an appeal. The Supreme Court then agreed to weigh in.

            The students' case involves Myra Brown, who is ineligible for debt relief because her loans are commercially held, and Alexander Taylor, who is eligible for just $10,000 and not the full $20,000 because he didn’t receive a Pell grant. They say that the Biden administration didn't go through the proper process in enacting the plan, among other things. 

            Texas-based U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman, an appointee of President Donald Trump, sided with the students and ruled to block the program. Pittman ruled that the Biden administration did not have clear authorization from Congress to implement the program. A federal appeals court left Pittman's ruling in place, and the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case along with the states' challenge.

            HOW DID BIDEN GET TO CANCEL THE DEBT?

            To cancel student loan debt, the Biden administration relied on the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act, commonly known as the HEROES Act. Originally enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack, the law was initially intended to keep service members from being worse off financially while they fought in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now extended, it allows the secretary of education to waive or modify the terms of federal student loans as necessary in connection with a national emergency.

            Trump, a Republican, declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency in March 2020, but Biden recently announced that designation will end May 11. The Biden administration has said that the end to the national emergency doesn't change the legal argument for student loan debt cancellation because the pandemic affected millions of student borrowers who might have fallen behind on their loans during the emergency.

            WHAT ARE THE JUSTICES LIKELY TO ASK ABOUT?

            Expect the justices to be focused on several big issues. The first one is whether the states and the two borrowers have the right to sue over the plan in the first place, a legal concept called “standing.” If they don't, that clears the way for the Biden administration to go ahead with it. To prove they have standing, the states and borrowers will have to show in part that they're financially harmed by the plan.

            Beyond standing, the justices will also be asking whether the HEROES Act gives the Biden administration the power to enact the plan and how it went about doing so.

            WHEN WILL BORROWERS KNOW THE OUTCOME?

            It will likely be months before borrowers learn the outcome of the case, but there's a deadline of sorts. The court generally issues all of its decisions by the end of June before going on a summer break. 

            Whether or not the debt gets cancelled, the case's resolution will bring changes. While federal student loan payments are currently paused, that will end 60 days after the case is resolved. And if the case hasn't been resolved by June 30, payments will start 60 days after that.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823205,Trans people face 'horrifying' rhetoric at statehouses,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — It was pharmacist Gwendolyn Herzig's first time testifying before a legislative committee when she spoke to several Arkansas lawmakers in a packed hearing room this month about a bill restricting gender-affirming care for minors.

            Herzig, who is transgender, spoke out against the legislation and told the panel that one of the biggest obstacles trans people face is a lack of empathy. Only a few minutes later, a Republican lawmaker asked her an inappropriate question about her genitalia.

            “It was horrifying,"" she said.











            The exchange, which was livestreamed on the Legislature's website and has since been widely shared on social media, is an example of the type of demeaning questions and rhetoric that transgender people meet when they show up to statehouses to testify against new bills targeting their rights. 

            In South Dakota, a lawmaker invoked “furries"" — people who dress up as animals — when talking about gender-affirming care. In Montana, a legislator compared parents supporting their children in finding treatment to asking doctors to carry out medically assisted suicide.

            Advocates worry that increasingly hostile rhetoric about transgender people could have a chilling effect on those who want to speak out against new restrictions and could do lasting damage to a community of trans youth that is already marginalized.

            “I feel like that's what they're trying to do, to keep us from coming and exercising this right that we have,"" said Rumba Yambu, executive director of Intransitive, an advocacy and support group for transgender people in Arkansas. “Because who wants to go and be asked about their genitalia in front of a bunch of strangers? Especially strangers in power.""

            So far this year, at least 150 bills targeting transgender people have been introduced, which is the highest in a single year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. 

            Bans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted this year in South Dakota and Utah, and Republican governors in Tennessee and Mississippi are expected to sign similar bans into law. Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges.

            The push has included efforts in some states to restrict gender-affirming care for adults and proposed bans on drag shows that opponents have warned would also discriminate against transgender people.

            Herzig came to the state Capitol to testify against a bill attempting to reinstate Arkansas' ban on gender-affirming care for minors by making it easier to file malpractice lawsuits against providers. In her testimony, Herzig talked about working with transgender patients who are on hormone replacement therapy.

            “Bills like SB199 are designed to hinder, not help, Arkansans by creating barriers to evidence-driven health care they deserve under the guise of helping the young and innocent,"" she said, later saying a vote for the bill was “unpatriotic, and casts doubts on our own health and research institutions who have worked through health care fields to improve the lives of Americans.”

            During follow-up questions, Republican Sen. Matt McKee asked Herzig if she is transgender. 

            When she said yes, he asked: “Do you have a penis?""

            The question was met with jeers and audible gasps in the packed committee room.

            “That's horrible,"" Herzig responded, telling McKee that asking her such a question was inappropriate and noting she was testifying as a health care professional.

            “I had never been so publicly humiliated in my life,” Herzig told The Associated Press in an interview days later.

            McKee did not respond to an email or phone call, but defended his question in a written statement.

            “As a father of 4 daughters, I will do everything in my power to protect my children and the children of Arkansas, especially from the woke mob who intend to push their agenda and beliefs down our throats and destroy our families,"" McKee's statement said.

            The idea of protecting children by withholding medical care is undermined by health experts, who have said minors with gender dysphoria who do not receive appropriate care face dramatically increased risk of suicide and serious depression.

            McKee's questions were similar in tone to those posed to Debi Jackson's teen Avery, who is transgender and nonbinary, when they testified before Missouri legislators last year about a proposal to ban trans girls and women from participating on sports teams matching their gender identity.

            During the hearing, a lawmaker asked Avery if they were “gonna go through the procedure."" Since that exchange, Jackson said Avery hasn't wanted to testify again before the Legislature.

            “It’s this same idea that in any of these discussions about trans people just being treated with basic dignity and respect, legislators want to reduce them to one body part,"" Jackson said. “They miss the entirety of the human being sitting in front of them having a conversation.”

            Advocates say the rhetoric surrounding these proposed bans further exacerbates an already treacherous environment for transgender people, their families and medical providers. Children’s hospitals around the country have faced an uptick of harassment and threats of violence for providing gender-confirming care.

            Though she said she's received an outcry of support since her testimony, Herzig said she and the pharmacy she owns have also gotten hateful emails and calls.

            People opposed to gender-affirming care for minors argue that children are too young to make decisions about their futures, sometimes comparing such treatments to child abuse. That's despite medical experts saying the care is safe when administered properly. 

            Nearly every major medical group, including the American Medical Association, has opposed the bans on such care for minors.

            Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last year ordered the state’s child welfare agency to investigate reports of gender-affirming care for kids as abuse, but a judge has since blocked those investigations. 

            Amber Briggle, the mother of a transgender teenager in Texas whose family was investigated after Abbott's order, said she gets frustrated when speaking before lawmakers in her state who she thinks already have made up their minds on the issue. But Briggle said she plans on returning to Texas' Capitol this year and that Herzig's encounter motivates her even more to show up and speak out.

            “They should not have to fight this alone,"" Briggle said of transgender people testifying in statehouses. “They should know they have loving, supporting allies in their corner.""

            Herzig said she probably would not have testified had she known she was going to be asked about her genitalia.

            “I felt like I was pretty much prepared for any combative question,"" she said. “Except that.""LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

Matt McKee asked Herzig if she is transgender.When she said yes, he asked: “Do you have a penis?""The question was met with jeers and audible gasps in the packed committee room.“That's horrible,"" Herzig responded, telling McKee that asking her such a question was inappropriate and noting she was testifying as a health care professional.“I had never been so publicly humiliated in my life,” Herzig told The Associated Press in an interview days later.McKee did not respond to an email or phone call, but defended his question in a written statement.“As a father of 4 daughters, I will do everything in my power to protect my children and the children of Arkansas, especially from the woke mob who intend to push their agenda and beliefs down our throats and destroy our families,"" McKee's statement said.The idea of protecting children by withholding medical care is undermined by health experts, who have said minors with gender dysphoria who do not receive appropriate care face dramatically increased risk of suicide and serious depression.McKee's questions were similar in tone to those posed to Debi Jackson's teen Avery, who is transgender and nonbinary, when they testified before Missouri legislators last year about a proposal to ban trans girls and women from participating on sports teams matching their gender identity.During the hearing, a lawmaker asked Avery if they were “gonna go through the procedure."" Since that exchange, Jackson said Avery hasn't wanted to testify again before the Legislature.“It’s this same idea that in any of these discussions about trans people just being treated with basic dignity and respect, legislators want to reduce them to one body part,"" Jackson said. “They miss the entirety of the human being sitting in front of them having a conversation.”Advocates say the rhetoric surrounding these proposed bans further exacerbates an already treacherous environment for transgender people, their families and medical providers. Children’s hospitals around the country have faced an uptick of harassment and threats of violence for providing gender-confirming care.Though she said she's received an outcry of support since her testimony, Herzig said she and the pharmacy she owns have also gotten hateful emails and calls.People opposed to gender-affirming care for minors argue that children are too young to make decisions about their futures, sometimes comparing such treatments to child abuse. That's despite medical experts saying the care is safe when administered properly.Nearly every major medical group, including the American Medical Association, has opposed the bans on such care for minors.Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last year ordered the state’s child welfare agency to investigate reports of gender-affirming care for kids as abuse, but a judge has since blocked those investigations.Amber Briggle, the mother of a transgender teenager in Texas whose family was investigated after Abbott's order, said she gets frustrated when speaking before lawmakers in her state who she thinks already have made up their minds on the issue. But Briggle said she plans on returning to Texas' Capitol this year and that Herzig's encounter motivates her even more to show up and speak out.“They should not have to fight this alone,"" Briggle said of transgender people testifying in statehouses. “They should know they have loving, supporting allies in their corner.""Herzig said she probably would not have testified had she known she was going to be asked about her genitalia.“I felt like I was pretty much prepared for any combative question,"" she said. “Except that.""",2023/02/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823207,Japan air force member sues government in sexual harassment,"TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese air force serviceperson filed a lawsuit against the government on Monday, saying it had failed to protect her from verbal sexual harassment from a male colleague and then systematically covered up the problem for more than a decade.

            The plaintiff, who was only identified as a current member of the Air Self Defense Force, faced verbal sexual abuse starting as soon as she was assigned to Naha air base on the southern island of Okinawa in 2010, her lawyers said.

            The plaintiff is seeking about 11.7 million yen ($85,800) in damages from the government for failing to protect her from the harassment and failing to create a better working environment, and for not countering the criticism she received for speaking out, causing her to suffer for more than 10 years, lawyer Daisuke Tabuchi told reporters.











            The lawyers said the perpetrator also made similar comments to other female air force members, but they didn't openly complain to avoid friction. They said they want to call into question the tendency of the male-dominated military to neglect and cover up sexual harassment. 

            The Defense Ministry said it had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.

            The harassment from the plaintiff's colleague included frequent comments about her body and public questions about her sex life, her lawyers said.

            She sought help from her supervisors and an SDF sexual harassment consultation department, but subsequent awareness training put her on the spot, giving her a reputation as a troublemaker rather than a victim, they said.

            After six years' endurance, she filed an earlier lawsuit against the perpetrator in 2016 at Naha District Court, which dismissed the case the following year even though it acknowledged his sexual harassment. It said he could not be held responsible as an individual public servant and that the government should bear responsibility. The decision was upheld by a high court.

            The plaintiff also filed a criminal complaint with the military police in 2019, but prosecutors eventually dropped the case, according to the lawyers. 

            They said she has developed stress and insomnia, and has suffered career setbacks in an alleged organizational revenge for her having spoken up.

            Sexual misconduct complaints are often disregarded in Japan, and victims tend to face criticism for speaking up.

            Lawyers say Japan's military has lagged behind private companies in dealing with harassment. 

            “The Self Defense Force has faced staff shortages and is desperately recruiting members, and yet problems like these are left unchecked,"" said Yukiko Takei, another lawyer for the plaintiff. ""We must say governance at the Japanese military is not properly functioning.""

            Monday’s lawsuit comes weeks after another SDF sexual harassment victim, former army soldier Rina Gonoi, filed a civil lawsuit against five alleged perpetrators and the government over sexual abuse she suffered.

            She went public with her experience last year, demanding that the Defense Ministry re-investigate her case, in which she said she was repeatedly assaulted by several servicemen, causing her to give up her military career. The army dropped her case after she initially filed a complaint in 2021, saying there was insufficient evidence.

            Preliminary results of a ministry-wide harassment investigation launched in response to Gonoi’s case found 1,414 complaints, the ministry said in December. About 84% involved abuse of power, while sexual harassment accounted for 116 cases, or 7.7%, the ministry said.TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese air force serviceperson filed a lawsuit against the government on Monday, saying it had failed to protect her from verbal sexual harassment from a male colleague and then systematically covered up the problem for more than a decade.The plaintiff, who was only identified as a current member of the Air Self Defense Force, faced verbal sexual abuse starting as soon as she was assigned to Naha air base on the southern island of Okinawa in 2010, her lawyers said.The plaintiff is seeking about 11.7 million yen ($85,800) in damages from the government for failing to protect her from the harassment and failing to create a better working environment, and for not countering the criticism she received for speaking out, causing her to suffer for more than 10 years, lawyer Daisuke Tabuchi told reporters.The lawyers said the perpetrator also made similar comments to other female air force members, but they didn't openly complain to avoid friction.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823210,"Pope to visit Hungary in April, migration and war on agenda","ROME (AP) — Pope Francis will visit Hungary at the end of April, the Vatican said Monday, in a trip expected to focus on migration to Europe and Russia’s war in Ukraine. 

            The April 28-30 trip to Budapest represents a proper state visit after Francis made a brief, hours-long stopover in 2021 to close out a church conference. That visit was visibly awkward, given that Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s hard-line views on migration and Francis' call for countries to welcome those fleeing war, hardship and poverty.

            Since then, Hungary has accepted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion. Francis, who has repeatedly expressed solidarity with Ukraine, met at the Vatican with Orban last April and thanked him for taking them in. 











            Upon arrival, Francis will meet with Orban, a contentious leader who has centered his political brand around a staunch rejection of immigration and a focus on preventing Hungary from becoming “mixed race.” 

            While Hungary accepted Ukrainian refugees, it has refused to provide weapons to Kyiv or allow their transfer across its borders, and has lobbied against European Union sanctions on Moscow and held up some financial aid packages to Ukraine. 

            Francis has been supportive of Ukraine’s plight following Russia’s invasion -- likening it to a 1930s genocide of Ukrainians blamed on Soviet leader Joseph Stalin -- while Orban has been lukewarm in his support for Hungary’s eastern neighbor. 

            Still, Orban has cast his view of the war as being in line with the Vatican’s, saying during a speech Feb. 18 that his government and the papacy were the only powers in Europe advocating for peace in Ukraine. 

            Francis has also tried to maintain relations with Moscow and the Russian Orthodox Church. Hungary was key in blocking the EU from sanctioning the head of the Russian church, Patriarch Kirill, over his support for the war.

            Francis will meet with refugees during his visit, as well as children. On his final day, he will deliver a speech to the Hungarian academic and cultural world, in which he is likely to issue a message to Europe at large.

            Francis, who just returned from Congo and South Sudan, has other trips confirmed or in the works this year. The 86-year-old pope, who marks his 10th anniversary as pontiff next month, is due to participate in World Youth Day in Lisbon, Portugal in August. He has said the Vatican is studying a possible trip to Mongolia at the end of September, after a brief stop in Marseille, France.

            Justin Spike reported from Budapest, Hungary.ROME (AP) — Pope Francis will visit Hungary at the end of April, the Vatican said Monday, in a trip expected to focus on migration to Europe and Russia’s war in Ukraine.The April 28-30 trip to Budapest represents a proper state visit after Francis made a brief, hours-long stopover in 2021 to close out a church conference. That visit was visibly awkward, given that Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s hard-line views on migration and Francis' call for countries to welcome those fleeing war, hardship and poverty.Since then, Hungary has accepted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion. Francis, who has repeatedly expressed solidarity with Ukraine, met at the Vatican with Orban last April and thanked him for taking them in.Upon arrival, Francis will meet with Orban, a contentious leader who has centered his political brand around a staunch rejection of immigration and a focus on preventing Hungary from becoming “mixed race.”While Hungary accepted Ukrainian refugees, it has refused to provide weapons to Kyiv or allow their transfer across its borders, and has lobbied against European Union sanctions on Moscow and held up some financial aid packages to Ukraine.Francis has been supportive of Ukraine’s plight following Russia’s invasion -- likening it to a 1930s genocide of Ukrainians blamed on Soviet leader Joseph Stalin -- while Orban has been lukewarm in his support for Hungary’s eastern neighbor.Still, Orban has cast his view of the war as being in line with the Vatican’s, saying during a speech Feb. 18 that his government and the papacy were the only powers in Europe advocating for peace in Ukraine.Francis has also tried to maintain relations with Moscow and the Russian Orthodox Church.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823211,U.N. suspends flights in E. Congo after helicopter fired on,"GOMA, Congo (AP) — A United Nations helicopter came under heavy fire in eastern Congo, bringing the mission to suspend flights in the conflict-riddled region, the organization said Monday.

            A helicopter returning from Walikale to the regional capital, Goma in North Kivu province, came under attack for 10 minutes last week but was able to land safely in Goma with all three crew and 10 passengers unharmed, said a statement by the U.N.'s World Food Program. 

            Flights have been suspended on specific routes in the region until the security situation can be reassessed, said the U.N. The helicopter delivers assistance to some of Congo's most remote areas which would otherwise be inaccessible because of poor roads or insecurity.











            No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but this is the second time this month that a U.N. mission’s helicopter came under fire in North Kivu province. The previous incident killed a South African peacekeeper and injured another. The United Nations Security Council said the deliberate targeting of peacekeepers could constitute war crimes. 

            Fighting in eastern Congo has been simmering for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources — while others try to defend their communities. The violence spiked in late 2021 when M23 rebels, which had been largely dormant for nearly a decade, resurfaced and started capturing territory. 

            The fighting has internally displaced more than 5 million people, threatening many civilians with starvation, according to several aid groups. 

            “For armed groups seeking to force civilians under their control, firing at aircraft may prove an easy way to suspend aid deliveries and influence food supplies into an area,” said Benjamin Hunter, Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a risk intelligence firm.GOMA, Congo (AP) — A United Nations helicopter came under heavy fire in eastern Congo, bringing the mission to suspend flights in the conflict-riddled region, the organization said Monday.A helicopter returning from Walikale to the regional capital, Goma in North Kivu province, came under attack for 10 minutes last week but was able to land safely in Goma with all three crew and 10 passengers unharmed, said a statement by the U.N.'s World Food Program.Flights have been suspended on specific routes in the region until the security situation can be reassessed, said the U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823233,Japan to ease COVID border measures for travelers from China,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan is easing its coronavirus border measures for tourists from China beginning Wednesday by testing only random passengers, a top government spokesman said Monday.

            Since December, Japan has been testing all travelers from mainland China at four designated airports on grounds of surging infections in that country and a lack of information. Visitors from China are also required to show a proof of pre-boarding negative test.

            Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference that as of Wednesday, only random testing will be carried out on passengers from China.











            The change is intended to “promote smooth international travel” taking into consideration relatively low infection rates among arrivals over the past two months, Matsuno said. All samples analysed at the border were of the omicron strains, which are already found inside Japan, he said.

            Proof of pre-boarding negative test will still be required, he said.

            Direct flights from China, currently only allowed to land at Narita, Haneda, Chubu and Kansai, will be expanded to other airports. 

            China, which lifted its “zero-COVID” policy in December, retaliated for the stricter border measures imposed by Japan and South Korea by temporarily suspending short-term visas for the nationals of the two countries. China has since resumed issuing visas in Japan. 

            South Korea has already removed entry restrictions for short-term travelers from China since the beginning of January, as officials saw the pandemic in China being stabilized.

            Japan plans to largely relax its mask-wearing requests on March 13 and leave it up to individuals. It will also downgrade COVID-19 to the equivalent of seasonal influenza in May.TOKYO (AP) — Japan is easing its coronavirus border measures for tourists from China beginning Wednesday by testing only random passengers, a top government spokesman said Monday.Since December, Japan has been testing all travelers from mainland China at four designated airports on grounds of surging infections in that country and a lack of information.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823234,Germany seeks North Sea wind park link to those of neighbors,"BERLIN (AP) — The German government said Monday that it wants to set up a new power line network to connect its own offshore wind parks with those of its North Sea neighbors in order to eliminate bottlenecks in the European energy market.

            Governments in northwestern Europe are hoping that wind power at sea will provide a large share of their future clean energy needs. Germany in particular needs to boost offshore wind powered electricity generation to meet its ambitious goal of shutting down all coal powered plants and generating 80% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

            One big problem at present is the lack of power lines, which results in bottlenecks that prevent wind park-generated electricity from reaching consumers and industries further inland.











            Germany's economy minister, Robert Habeck, said that by building more interconnectors at sea, his country will be able to tap additional cheap electricity from offshore wind parks, including from European neighbors such as Denmark and the Netherlands.

            This will also boost security of supply at times of high demand and allow Germany to export more renewable energy when it has a surplus, he said.

            North Sea nations last year announced plans to massively increase offshore wind power in the coming decades as part of an effort to combat climate change and become independent of fossil fuel imports from Russia.BERLIN (AP) — The German government said Monday that it wants to set up a new power line network to connect its own offshore wind parks with those of its North Sea neighbors in order to eliminate bottlenecks in the European energy market.Governments in northwestern Europe are hoping that wind power at sea will provide a large share of their future clean energy needs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823241,Democrat Elissa Slotkin to seek Michigan's open Senate seat,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan will seek the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Debbie Stabenow in 2024, becoming the first high-profile candidate to jump into the battleground state race. 

            In a video announcing her campaign, Slotkin says that the nation seems “to be living crisis to crisis” but that there “are certain things that should be really simple, like living a middle-class life in the state that invented the middle class.”

            “This is why I’m running for the United States Senate,” Slotkin says in the video released Monday morning. “We need a new generation of leaders that thinks differently, works harder and never forgets that we are public servants.”











            Slotkin, a 46-year-old former CIA intelligence officer and third-term representative, is coming off an impressive victory in last year's midterms, winning reelection despite having been considered vulnerable. Her contest against Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett was the third-most expensive House race in 2022.

            She is the first Democrat to announce her intentions to run for a seat that will be crucial to the party's efforts to maintain control of the Senate, where it holds a 51-49 majority. The only other candidate in the race so far is Republican Nikki Snyder, a State Board of Education member.

            Slotkin, first elected to Congress in 2018 when she flipped a traditionally Republican district, has consistently won close races in the battleground state and has proved herself to be an effective fundraiser. 

            After narrowly winning reelection in 2020, she was targeted by Republicans in last year's midterms after new congressional maps divided her home district. She was forced to run in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, where she was a new face for about a third of the district's voters, many in rural GOP-leaning counties north of Lansing.

            Throughout the campaign, Slotkin touted herself as a Democrat representing a Trump-voting district, emphasizing to voters her pragmatism and highlighting her role on the House’s bipartisan Problem-Solvers Caucus.

            She has represented two congressional districts that experienced mass shootings, and she has called for stronger gun laws. Now a congresswoman for the Lansing area, she represents an area that includes Michigan State University, where a gunman killed three people and injured five others this month. She previously represented Oxford, where a school shooter killed four students and injured seven others at Oxford High School in 2021.

            The dean of Michigan Democrats, the 72-year-old Stabenow shocked many in the party when she announced last month that she would not be seeking a fifth term, saying she had “decided to pass the torch” to a new generation of leaders.

            Slotkin was immediately named as a favorite to replace the outgoing senator and began forming a national campaign team, telling the AP in January that she was putting her “ducks in a row” before an announcement. 

            With Michigan having one of the deepest Democratic benches in the country, many expected the primary to be highly competitive. But in the days leading up to Slotkin’s announcement, multiple high-profile candidates withdrew their names from consideration.

            “Serving our state in Washington, DC would be a great opportunity, but instead I will keep standing tall for Michigan, right here at home,” Democratic Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II said on social media on Sunday. 

            Also on the Democratic side, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has been discussed as a potential candidate. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a rising star in the party, said last week that she would not run for the Senate.

            Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who lost his Republican primary last year after voting to impeach President Donald Trump in 2021, is still considering a GOP run for the seat. Freshman Rep. John James, one of Republicans' top choices to run for the Senate in 2024 after two previous unsuccessful bids, filed last week to instead run for reelection in his Detroit-area House district next year.

            Republicans have taken just one of Michigan’s last 15 Senate races, winning an open seat in 1994.

            Slotkin's Senate run creates an open House race in the 7th Congressional District in 2024. Barrett, who lost to Slotkin by five percentage points in the House district last year, has also been encouraged by Republicans to seek Stabenow's seat.LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan will seek the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Debbie Stabenow in 2024, becoming the first high-profile candidate to jump into the battleground state race.In a video announcing her campaign, Slotkin says that the nation seems “to be living crisis to crisis” but that there “are certain things that should be really simple, like living a middle-class life in the state that invented the middle class.”“This is why I’m running for the United States Senate,” Slotkin says in the video released Monday morning. “We need a new generation of leaders that thinks differently, works harder and never forgets that we are public servants.”Slotkin, a 46-year-old former CIA intelligence officer and third-term representative, is coming off an impressive victory in last year's midterms, winning reelection despite having been considered vulnerable. Her contest against Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett was the third-most expensive House race in 2022.She is the first Democrat to announce her intentions to run for a seat that will be crucial to the party's efforts to maintain control of the Senate, where it holds a 51-49 majority. The only other candidate in the race so far is Republican Nikki Snyder, a State Board of Education member.Slotkin, first elected to Congress in 2018 when she flipped a traditionally Republican district, has consistently won close races in the battleground state and has proved herself to be an effective fundraiser.After narrowly winning reelection in 2020, she was targeted by Republicans in last year's midterms after new congressional maps divided her home district. She was forced to run in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, where she was a new face for about a third of the district's voters, many in rural GOP-leaning counties north of Lansing.Throughout the campaign, Slotkin touted herself as a Democrat representing a Trump-voting district, emphasizing to voters her pragmatism and highlighting her role on the House’s bipartisan Problem-Solvers Caucus.She has represented two congressional districts that experienced mass shootings, and she has called for stronger gun laws. Now a congresswoman for the Lansing area, she represents an area that includes Michigan State University, where a gunman killed three people and injured five others this month. She previously represented Oxford, where a school shooter killed four students and injured seven others at Oxford High School in 2021.The dean of Michigan Democrats, the 72-year-old Stabenow shocked many in the party when she announced last month that she would not be seeking a fifth term, saying she had “decided to pass the torch” to a new generation of leaders.Slotkin was immediately named as a favorite to replace the outgoing senator and began forming a national campaign team, telling the AP in January that she was putting her “ducks in a row” before an announcement.With Michigan having one of the deepest Democratic benches in the country, many expected the primary to be highly competitive. But in the days leading up to Slotkin’s announcement, multiple high-profile candidates withdrew their names from consideration.“Serving our state in Washington, DC would be a great opportunity, but instead I will keep standing tall for Michigan, right here at home,” Democratic Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II said on social media on Sunday.Also on the Democratic side, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has been discussed as a potential candidate. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a rising star in the party, said last week that she would not run for the Senate.Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who lost his Republican primary last year after voting to impeach President Donald Trump in 2021, is still considering a GOP run for the seat. Freshman Rep. John James, one of Republicans' top choices to run for the Senate in 2024 after two previous unsuccessful bids, filed last week to instead run for reelection in his Detroit-area House district next year.Republicans have taken just one of Michigan’s last 15 Senate races, winning an open seat in 1994.Slotkin's Senate run creates an open House race in the 7th Congressional District in 2024. Barrett, who lost to Slotkin by five percentage points in the House district last year, has also been encouraged by Republicans to seek Stabenow's seat.",2023/02/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823242,Putting Mongolia on the digital map: Bolor-Erdene Battsengel,"Bolor-Erdene Battsengel wants to transform Mongolia into a “digital first” country — and help young people, especially girls in this sparsely populated nation of 3.3 million, to learn how to code.

            During her time with Mongolia's digital development and communications authority, including a year as vice minister, Battsengel, 30, worked on digitizing the country's government services so people in remote areas don't have to spend long days traveling and waiting in lines for access to things like passport renewals or filing taxes. 

            Today, Battsengel is completing a policy fellowship at Oxford University and runs Girls Code, which teaches girls from disadvantaged communities and nomadic families computer programming. 











            She spoke to The Associated Press about facing online harassment as a young woman in politics and about Mongolia's unique position as a democracy nestled between Russia and China. Over 84% of Mongolia's population is connected to the internet, up from just 18% a decade ago, according to the World Bank. 

            The interview has been edited for clarity and length. 

            QUESTION: Why was this digitization project so important? 

            ANSWER: Mongolia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. We have nomadic communities living in the countryside. Unlike the people in the cities, nomads would have to drive 5-10 hours just to get to their government facility. 

            And then they would, you know, have to stay there for a week to wait for the passport or come back. So now it’s very convenient. And one of the things I love about Mongolia is that now you can see a herder on a horse in the middle of nowhere, using e-Mongolia and registering a company or getting an ID card or looking at their social security etc. 

            Q: What is internet access like in Mongolia? 

            A: We have 330 small villages and towns in Mongolia. It’s a very big country for 3.2 million people and the most important thing I worked on was digital inclusion — I wanted to reach out to people who do not have regular access to the internet. Those are the communities who need to be connected, to be well-informed. So now we have internet in all 330 small villages and towns in Mongolia. And it’s relatively free, we haven't banned any website or social media or anything like that. So actually the statistics on our spending on social media is quite high. 

            Mongolia is a democratic country. And it’s very interesting actually, being stranded between Russia and China and trying to protect our democracy. When they travel to Mongolia, I know a lot of people are shocked there is free speech. And now with social media and internet, a lot of things are coming out. For example, currently the Mongolian prime minister has a big fight against corruption. So a lot of parliament members are being prosecuted, resigning because of the corruption issues. 

            Q: Why did you leave your government post? 

            A: My vision always has been to transform Mongolia to a digital nation, because Mongolia is a very mining dependent economy. I genuinely still believe that digital technology will give us a second chance and it will be the second economic sector in Mongolia. 

            When I worked in government, it was typical that I would get a question asking me like, “Oh, whose assistant are you?"" Or like, ""Are you here to work as a waitress?"" Whenever you see a young woman, it’s the stereotype. And even from the public, it’s an unusual image. And then I got a lot of cyberbullying from old male politicians because they would see me as a competitor. But I also got a lot of young supporters as well. So by the time I resigned, I needed to be able to fight against the system. But me being in the system, it was almost impossible to fight. I wanted to resign and then bring young people together, especially women together, and also tell them realistically what it is like to be in government as a young woman.

            Q: What changes are you hoping for in Mongolia? 

            A: I always feel bad that the world does not know what’s happening in Mongolia, not aware of the things that we have done except like Genghis Khan or horses or these typical images. I really hope that the world learns about modern Mongolia. I believe it is the next tech hidden gem. 

            Q: Do you think that you will be able to push for them better now that you are organizing from the outside? 

            A: What I’m looking for, honestly, and hoping to achieve in the future is a generational shift in the government. Mongolia is very small country. We have to use young talent. And if you have been in the government for 20, 30 years, not understanding the modern world and not willing to accept advancement and human rights, etc., you can't really make much change. 

            So for us to create change or create this society, we want young people, especially talented, well-educated, persistent young people, to join together. I get a lot of questions from Harvard graduates who are Mongolian but working in the U.S. Graduates from Cambridge, Oxford, who want to join the government or who want to come back to Mongolia and work. But still they’re on the fence. They can’t decide. So I hope we are going to bring those young people together.Bolor-Erdene Battsengel wants to transform Mongolia into a “digital first” country — and help young people, especially girls in this sparsely populated nation of 3.3 million, to learn how to code.During her time with Mongolia's digital development and communications authority, including a year as vice minister, Battsengel, 30, worked on digitizing the country's government services so people in remote areas don't have to spend long days traveling and waiting in lines for access to things like passport renewals or filing taxes.Today, Battsengel is completing a policy fellowship at Oxford University and runs Girls Code, which teaches girls from disadvantaged communities and nomadic families computer programming.She spoke to The Associated Press about facing online harassment as a young woman in politics and about Mongolia's unique position as a democracy nestled between Russia and China.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823243,3 parties claim early leads in Nigeria's presidential vote,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Each of the three frontrunners in Nigeria’s hotly contested presidential election claimed Monday they are on the path to victory as preliminary results trickled in two days after Africa's most populous nation went to the polls.

            Only four of Nigeria's 36 states had officially announced results by midday Monday, with three of those going to ruling party candidate Bola Tinubu. The fourth was won by main opposition party candidate Atiku Abubakar.

            Also in the mix as a perceived frontrunner was Peter Obi with the Labour Party. A winner is not expected to be announced until at least Tuesday. After the previous presidential election in 2019, it took four days for officials to declare a victor. 











            A runoff election will be held if no candidate secures at least one-quarter of the votes from two-thirds of Nigeria’s 36 states and the capital city, in addition to receiving the highest number of votes.

            On Monday, the African Union observer mission said voting had been delayed in more than 80% of polling units mainly because of logistical challenges caused by Nigeria’s currency swap program. The redesign of the Nigerian bank note, the naira, caused cash shortages nationwide and voters and poll workers had difficulties getting to polling stations Saturday. Voters in some states had to wait until late in the evening to cast ballots, while in other states the election continued Sunday.

            Observers from the missions of the African Union and the West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS said that the election was generally “encouraging” except for isolated cases of violence that disrupted voting in some states. 

            After Tinubu's victory in Ekiti state, the incumbent party said it was on course to stay in power. 

            “If the information we are beginning to receive from various parts of the country is anything to go by, one has every reason to be optimistic that our candidate will win,” Abdullahi Adamu, the party chairman, told the state-run News Agency of Nigeria.

            The Labour Party also claimed that it was winning, though Obi has not yet officially won any of the states first announced.

            “We are far ahead and we are already leading and we are winning in 24 states,” said Yunusa Tanko, spokesman for the Labour Party. Its candidate, Obi, is a surprise frontrunner in what is usually a two-horse race, with his popularity surging in polls weeks ahead of the vote. The party accused election officials of not being present in their strongholds and said some of their supporters were denied the opportunity to vote. 

            As the full results haven’t been released yet, analysts caution that early unsubstantiated claims of victory will do nothing but deepen public mistrust of the electoral process and undermine the legitimacy of the polls.

            “The claims by the three parties aim to motivate their voters who are urged to protect ballot boxes from rigging. But the unsubstantiated claims of victory increase the risk of protests, both peaceful and violent by disappointed voters,” said Mucahid Durmaz, senior analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk intelligence company.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823262,Kremlin image-maker turned critic Gleb Pavlovsky dies at 71,"MOSCOW (AP) — Gleb Pavlovsky, a Soviet-era dissident who served as a Kremlin political consultant helping burnish President Vladimir Putin's image, has died, his family said Monday. He was 71.

            Pavlovsky worked as a top adviser for the Kremlin for 15 years and was widely seen as one of the key architects of Russia's post-Soviet political system.

            Pavlovsky's death was reported by his family on his messaging app channel. The announcement said he died Sunday at a Moscow hospice following a grave illness. Funeral arrangements weren't immediately announced.











            Pavlovsky was born in the Black Sea port of Odesa and became engaged in dissident activities as a university student.

            He was arrested in 1982 and later that year was sentenced to three years of internal exile. During his trial, Pavlovsky pleaded guilty to the charges and testified against some of his colleagues, a move that some members of the dissident movement have never forgiven.

            After serving his sentence, Pavlovsky returned to Moscow in 1985 and became an active member of the pro-democracy camp spawned by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms.

            After the 1991 Soviet collapse, he began working as a political consultant and in 1996 he helped stage a successful re-election campaign for Russia’s first president, Boris Yeltsin.

            When Yeltsin stepped down to anoint Putin as his preferred successor, Pavlovsky was involved in securing Putin's first election in March 2000. He continued to consult the Kremlin until falling out of favor and losing the job of an adviser to the presidential office in 2011.

            Following his dismissal, Pavlovsky became sharply critical of the Kremlin, denouncing the authorities' efforts to tighten control over Russia's political scene, including a relentless crackdown on the opposition and independent media.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823263,Slovenia band Laibach concert in Ukraine canceled amid rift,"LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) — A planned concert by Slovenia’s popular bank Laibach in Ukraine next month has been cancelled after the group angered Ukrainians by remarks interpreted to suggest that Kiyv was a client state fighting a war for its Western masters.

            The iconic band known for using military-style imagery and totalitarian symbols, was due to perform in Ukraine's capital Kyiv on March 31.

            The band said the concert aimed to show support for the Ukrainian people during the war, but organizers said its remarks caused “controversy” and discord, forcing the cancellation. 











            Ukrainians were apparently angered by Laibach's statement to The Guardian newspaper that called the war “a cynical proxy war for the geostrategic interests"" of world powers. 

            Slovenia's STA news agency said many Ukrainians posting on Facebook compared Laibach's statement to Russian state propaganda that portrays the invasion as a conflict with NATO and reduces Ukraine to a puppet state of the West. 

            “While the team showed support for Ukraine and Ukrainians and condemned the Russian regime, a large part of the audience came out categorically against Laibach’s visit,” the Bel Etage Music Hall said on Facebook late on Sunday. 

             “In order to prevent the unnecessary division of Ukrainians into different camps and to eliminate the cause of discord, we have decided to cancel the Laibach concert at Bel Etage,"" the statement added. 

            Laibach told STA Monday that they were “categorically asked to declare that all Russians are bad and that all Russian art is worthless, which of course they did not agree to do.”

            The band had earlier addressed the issue on Facebook, saying “to all those who doubt our views, let us therefore once again make it very clear that Russia is the main aggressor in this clash of destructive political and geostrategic interests.”

            “Not to be mistaken - we love Russian literature, music and art,"" said Laibach in a post last week. “But in this senseless war between Russia and Ukraine, we are wholeheartedly on the side of Ukraine and its people who - as in the old biblical story of David and Goliath - are fighting with dignity against a stronger enemy.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823265,Can Manchester United really win a quadruple of trophies?,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — In just 12 months, Manchester United has gone from jeers to cheers. 

            Sunday’s League Cup final celebrations at Wembley came a year to the day since a chorus of boos rang around Old Trafford after a goalless draw with lowly Watford. 

            The 20-time English champions went on to record their worst season in the Premier League and finished 35 points below title-winning Manchester City. 











            Few could have expected such a rapid turnaround when new manager Erik ten Hag was hired last summer. But the man who led Ajax to three Dutch titles in four seasons has already got United back to winning ways, ending a six-year trophy drought and keeping the club fighting on three more fronts going into the final months of the campaign. 

            As improbable as a quadruple might be, United is still in contention in all domestic competitions and advanced to the round of 16 in the Europa League after last week’s memorable win against Spanish league leader Barcelona. 

            And with confetti still scattered on the field at Wembley, Ten Hag set out his mission to deliver more silverware. 

            “It is one cup in February but it shows the right direction. This has to be the inspiration,” he said. “If you work very hard, if you stick together then things are possible.”

            THE FA CUP

            United hosts West Ham in the fifth round on Wednesday with a place in the quarterfinals at stake. 

            The competition has already opened up after a host of Premier League clubs went out in the early rounds, including league leader Arsenal, Cup holder Liverpool and big-spending Chelsea. 

            With Fulham taking on Leeds, it means another top-flight team will make way before the next round, along with the loser between United and West Ham. 

            Should United advance, then City remains the biggest threat, along with fourth-place Tottenham. 

            Both of those teams face second-division opposition, with City traveling to Bristol City on Tuesday and Spurs playing away at Sheffield United on Wednesday.

            THE EUROPA LEAGUE

            The win against a Barcelona team that is seven points ahead of Champions League holder Real Madrid in Spain has seen United installed as the favorite to lift the trophy. 

            But there are a number of big names left in the competition, including Arsenal, Juventus and Roma. 

            United faces another Spanish team in Real Betis in the round of 16 and should be confident after overcoming Barca in the playoffs. Yet, even if the Europa League is considered European soccer’s second-tier competition, there are plenty of tests to come if Ten Hag’s team advances again.

            The scheduling of the competition has also been an issue for teams in the past, given that games are played on Thursday nights, which can impact preparations for domestic matches at the weekend.

            THE PREMIER LEAGUE

            While a prolonged title challenge could be too big of an ask for a team that is still early in its development, third-place United is currently in contention at the top, sitting eight points behind Arsenal. 

            And having already played both Arsenal and City twice this season, there is the chance to close the gap when the leading pair face each other again in April. 

            Ten Hag will be encouraged by the fact that his team is improving as the season progresses, while Arsenal has shown signs of wobbling in recent weeks and City is yet to fully convince.

            The depth of United’s squad could be the biggest obstacle, with Christian Eriksen’s ankle injury ruling him out for the majority of the rest of the season and Anthony Martial struggling to stay fit. 

            It has left Ten Hag more reliant on January loan signings Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer than he might have wanted. Both have contributed, but cannot offer the same quality as Eriksen and Martial. 

            Casemiro’s recent suspension saw the team struggle to cope in his absence, while Marcus Rashford is the primary source of goals.

            Should anything happen to the England forward, it would potentially derail United’s season.

            United’s lack of title experience is another factor, which is why serial winners like Casemiro and Raphael Varane could be crucial in the closing stages of the campaign. Lisandro Martinez and Antony also have experience of winning league titles under Ten Hag at Ajax. 

            CAN IT BE DONE?

            Under iconic former manager Alex Ferguson, United became the first and only English soccer team to win the league title, Champions League and FA Cup in one season in 1999. 

            City won a treble of domestic trophies – the league, FA Cup and League Cup – in 2019. Pep Guardiola's team is also still in contention to emulate United's 99 treble this season.

            Liverpool looked on course for an unprecedented quadruple last season, but ended up with just the FA Cup and League Cup after finishing runner-up in the league and losing to Madrid in the Champions League final.

            After securing one trophy, a second of any description, along with a top-four Champions League-qualifying spot would be considered a major success for Ten Hag.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823275,"Solder Ball Mounter Market Scope, Kay Factors, Latest Trends, Limiting Factors Analysis and Forecast to 2032","Global Solder Ball Mounter Market Scope and Overview:A solder ball mounter is a machine used in electronics manufacturing to place tiny spheres of molten solder onto the pads of a printed circuit board (PCB) before mounting components. These spheres, also called solder balls, are typically made from a lead-free alloy of tin, silver, and copper. The process of placing solder balls onto a PCB is called “ball placement,” and it is a critical step in the production of advanced semiconductor devices such as microprocessors, memory chips, and integrated circuits. The solder balls serve as the electrical and mechanical connections between the chip and the PCB.The solder ball mounter typically works by picking up a small amount of molten solder from a heated bath using a precision nozzle or needle, and then precisely depositing the solder ball onto the appropriate pad on the PCB. This process is repeated hundreds or thousands of times for each chip on the PCB and requires high precision and accuracy to ensure that each solder ball is placed correctly. Modern solder ball mounters often use automated vision systems to help align the solder balls with the pads on the PCB. This technology allows for faster and more accurate placement and reduces the risk of defects and failures in the finished product.Solder Ball Mounter Market Key Factors:INCREASING DEMAND FOR ELECTRONICS: Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, and other consumer electronics, are driving the demand for solder ball mounters. These machines are essential for producing advanced semiconductor devices, which are used in a wide range of electronic products.ADVANCEMENTS IN SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY: The continuous advancements in semiconductor technology, such as the development of new materials and manufacturing processes, are driving the demand for more advanced solder ball mounters. Manufacturers need these machines to keep up with the evolving demands of the industry and produce higher-quality products.RISING ADOPTION OF AUTOMATION: The increasing trend towards automation in manufacturing processes is also driving the growth of the solder ball mounter market. These machines are highly automated and can perform precise and complex tasks with a high degree of accuracy, which helps to improve productivity and efficiency.GROWING DEMAND FOR LEAD-FREE SOLDER: The rising demand for lead-free solder in electronics manufacturing is also driving the growth of the solder ball mounter market. Many countries have regulations in place that limit the use of lead in electronic products, which is leading to a shift towards lead-free solder and increasing demand for solder ball mounters that can work with these materials.INCREASING INVESTMENT IN R&D: The growing investment in research and development activities by semiconductor manufacturers is also driving the demand for more advanced solder ball mounters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823276,Lebanese state media archives looted in heart of Beirut,"BEIRUT (AP) — Unknown assailants broke into the offices of Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency and stole the servers that contain its archives, the Information Ministry said Monday.

            The theft occurred in a tightly secured area, further reflecting the cash-strapped country’s continued decay. The archives are located in a building that houses two ministries, across the street from the Lebanese central bank, and adjacent to the heavily-guarded Interior Ministry that is in charge of security in the country.

            Information Ministry employees Monday morning saw the door to the archive room below ground level open and its lock broken.











            According to the statement from caretaker Information Minister Ziad Makari, the archives contained photos and material dating back to 1961. The assailants also stole five computers.

            Makari later tweeted that only a small part of the archives were stolen and that the main database is still accessible. “The repercussions of the robbery are both moral and material,"" he tweeted. “Work is underway and we will not stop to uncover the perpetrators and punish them.”

            The theft is another blow to Lebanon as it confronts a devastating economic crisis. The country for years has struggled to fund and maintain its state media agencies and archives. France and Lebanon in 2022 signed an agreement to digitize its archives as part of wider efforts to preserve Lebanese heritage and history.

            Laure Sleiman, who was the state-run news agency’s director from 2009 until late 2019, led the archival process after discovering over two million photo negatives in a dark room with broken furniture, office equipment, and rats.

            Makari said an investigation is currently underway to find the stolen servers and apprehend the perpetrators.

            “I cannot express the sadness I felt when I heard the news,” Sleiman told The Associated Press. “I trust in the work of the intelligence branch, but it will all depend who stole it and if politics will intervene in the investigation as it always does.”BEIRUT (AP) — Unknown assailants broke into the offices of Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency and stole the servers that contain its archives, the Information Ministry said Monday.The theft occurred in a tightly secured area, further reflecting the cash-strapped country’s continued decay.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823277,"Betty Boothroyd, 1st female UK Commons speaker, dies at 93","LONDON (AP) — Betty Boothroyd, the first — and so far only — female speaker of Britain’s House of Commons, has died, parliamentary authorities said Monday. She was 93.

            Boothroyd, who presided over the Commons’ often raucous debates with no-nonsense humor between 1992 and 2000, died Sunday at a hospital in Cambridge, southern England. 

            Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called Boothroyd “a remarkable woman who dedicated her life to politics.”











            “The passion, wit and sense of fairness she brought to politics will not be forgotten,” he said.

            Born in Dewsbury, northern England, in 1929, Boothroyd worked as a dancer in a chorus line troupe called the Tiller Girls before entering politics. She worked as an assistant to several lawmakers and, after several unsuccessful runs, was elected to Parliament in 1973 for the Labour Party.

            Nineteen years later, she became the first woman to be elected speaker by lawmakers in the 700-year history of the role.

            She dropped the tradition of wearing a shoulder-length white wig, and favored skirts over the knee-length breeches worn by her predecessors. Her iron-voiced admonition of ″Order! Order!″ and brisk Yorkshire humor helped keep unruly lawmakers in line.

            After leaving the job, she was appointed to Parliament’s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords.

            Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who served from 1997 to 2007, said that Boothroyd “was a truly outstanding speaker, presiding with great authority, warmth and wit, for which she had our deep respect and admiration.”

            Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said Boothroyd was “an inspiring woman” and “an inspirational politician.”

            “She stuck by the rules, had a no-nonsense style, but any reprimands she did issue were done with good humor and charm,” he said. “Betty was one of a kind. A sharp, witty and formidable woman — and I will miss her.”LONDON (AP) — Betty Boothroyd, the first — and so far only — female speaker of Britain’s House of Commons, has died, parliamentary authorities said Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823278,Harris to promote broadband in South Carolina as 2024 looms,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris is promoting the Biden administration's achievements on broadband internet access during a visit to South Carolina, recently minted as the site of Democrats' first presidential votes of the 2024 campaign.

            Harris' trip on Monday, her fourth to the early-voting state since becoming vice president, will “highlight progress on the Administration’s efforts to expand affordable high-speed internet nationwide,” according to guidance from the White House.

            But the trip to Columbia also comes as Democrats’ national attention hones in on South Carolina, where a landslide 2020 primary win gave Joe Biden the momentum to notch Super Tuesday wins and bounce several opponents from the race.











            Biden has repeatedly acknowledged the state’s pivotal role in his nomination as well as the significance of its heavily Black Democratic electorate. During remarks at a fundraiser last year, Harris thanked South Carolina Democrats, who “set President Joe Biden and me on a path to the White House.”

            Late last year, Biden asked the Democratic National Committee to move the state to the top of the presidential primary voting calendar, which party officials did this month. Via its email lists, South Carolina’s Democratic Party has already begun selling buttons, mugs and apparel flaunting the state’s new status with the tagline “South Carolina Democrats Pick Winners.”

            But Harris’ appearance also comes as a debate swirls over whether Biden — who, at age 80, is the nation’s oldest president — should seek a second term in office, as is widely expected. According to a poll released this month from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, just 37% of Democrats said they wanted Biden to seek a second term.

            Though he’s long said it’s his intent to seek reelection, Biden has yet to make it official, struggling to dispel questions about whether he’s too old to continue serving as president. In an exclusive interview last week with The Associated Press, first lady Jill Biden gave one of the clearest indications yet that her husband will run in 2024, saying that there’s “pretty much” nothing left to do but figure out the time and place for the announcement.

            The Republican candidate field is already forming, with a focus on South Carolina, home to the first GOP presidential primary in the South. Former President Donald Trump held a campaign event in the Statehouse last month, and former Gov. Nikki Haley announced her candidacy in Charleston a few weeks later. Sen. Tim Scott is also mulling a potential bid.

            Equalizing access to high-speed internet has been a priority for Biden, who in 2021 signed into law a $1 trillion infrastructure package that, alongside traditional public works projects like building roads and bridges, included $65 billion for broadband expansion.

            Expanding broadband internet availability also has been a top priority for Rep. Jim Clyburn, one of the White House's top Capitol Hill supporters and South Carolina's lone congressional Democrat. Clyburn, the chamber's assistant Democratic leader, has long advocated for more widespread internet access nationwide, pushing for affordable, high-speed networks in rural communities.

            Last week, Clyburn appeared alongside Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to announce the formation of a program — funded by the bipartisan infrastructure package — designed to identify the areas of greatest need in South Carolina and invest in broadband infrastructure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823279,Williamson becomes Democratic primary's 1st Biden challenger,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Bestselling self-help author Marianne Williamson, who brought quirky spiritualism to the 2020 presidential race, has announced she's running for president again, becoming the first major Democrat to challenge President Joe Biden for his party’s nomination in 2024. 

            Williamson is formally kicking off her campaign with an event in Washington on Saturday. Without mentioning former President Donald Trump, she noted in a weekend Facebook post that his unconventional White House win makes it “odd for anyone to think they can know who can win the presidency.”

            “I’m not putting myself through this again just to add to the conversation,” Williamson wrote. “I’m running for president to help bring an aberrational chapter of our history to a close, and to help bring forth a new beginning.”











            Williamson, 70, says she plans to follow her Washington announcement with travel to states voting early in the Democratic primary. That includes New Hampshire, where she's suggested she'd participate in the state’s primary if it defies Democratic National Committee rules and holds the nation’s first presidential nominating contest despite the party making South Carolina its leadoff state for 2024. 

            “I feel my forty years being up close and personal with the trauma of so many thousands of individuals gives me a unique perspective on what is needed to help repair America,” Williamson wrote. “We need a politics that treats not just symptoms, but cause. That does not base itself on the crass imperatives of endless corporate profit, but on the eternal imperatives of our principles and values.”

            Williamson is the only Democrat in the race — for now. Biden hasn’t yet announced a formal reelection bid that aides say is likely coming in April. 

            Her primary challenge of a sitting president from her own party would be the longest of long shots under any circumstances. But that’s especially true this cycle, as the Democratic establishment — and even potential presidential hopefuls who could have competed with Biden from the left or middle — has closed ranks with remarkable uniformity behind the president. 

            A spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey and purveyor of physic memorabilia online, Williamson spent about a year seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.

            One of her signature proposals was a plan to create a U.S. Department of Peace. She also advocated that the federal government pay massive financial reparations to Black Americans as atonement for centuries of slavery and discrimination.

            She suspended her campaign in the weeks before 2020′s leadoff Iowa caucus and later endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 bid. He finished second in the Democratic primary against Biden.

            The author of more than a dozen books and an unsuccessful independent candidate for Congress from California in 2014, Williamson first made a name for herself on the national political stage during the 2016 presidential race. That’s when she was a vocal support of Sanders’ progressive challenge of eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

            This time, she evoked a theme Biden used frequently before last fall's midterm elections, when Democrats showed surprising resilience. The president argues that American democracy is under threat from extreme “MAGA Republicans” loyal to Trump's Make America Great Again movement. Williamson said the nation's political traditions may not endure today's threats.

            “If we don’t preserve the blessings of democracy today,” she wrote in her Facebook post, “we should expect the threat of authoritarianism later.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Bestselling self-help author Marianne Williamson, who brought quirky spiritualism to the 2020 presidential race, has announced she's running for president again, becoming the first major Democrat to challenge President Joe Biden for his party’s nomination in 2024.Williamson is formally kicking off her campaign with an event in Washington on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823280,"Amid thaw, Egypt's FM in quake-hit Turkey to show solidarity","ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Egypt’s foreign minister arrived in Turkey on Monday to show solidarity with the quake-hit country, in the first high-level visit from Egypt since relations between Ankara and Cairo started to improve after years of friction.

            Sameh Shoukry traveled to the southern Turkish city of Mersin from Syria -- part of a two-legged trip seeking to convey Egypt’s solidarity with the earthquake-stricken populations.

            Diplomatic relations between Ankara and Cairo have been frosty for almost a decade. Erdogan was a close ally of Egypt’s previous Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the military amid widespread protests in 2013.











            Turkey in recent years abandoned its critical approach to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s government, as it tried to repair the frayed ties. In November, Erdogan and Sissi were photographed shaking hands during the World Cup in Qatar.

            Egypt's neighbor Libya remains a point of conflict between the two governments, with each backing rival administrations that divide the country’s east and west.

            “What is important for us is to bring the relationships back to the old level and to take them very far in the interests of both countries in accordance with their common interest,″ Shoukry told reporters, during a joint news conference with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu.

            The two stood in front of an Egyptian aid ship that docked at the port of Mersin. Cairo has sent numerous consignments of aid to Turkey since the earthquake struck on Feb. 6, killing tens of thousands — mostly in Turkey.

            “Friendship and brotherhood become apparent during times of difficulties and the Egyptian state and people have shown that they are the Turkish people's friends and brothers during these difficult times,” Cavusoglu said.

            The Turkish minister continued: “We are opening a new page in our relations. The development of ties between Turkey and Egypt is to both countries’ benefit.”

            The massive earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria has killed some 48,000 people in both countries and led to the collapse or serious damage of 173,000 buildings in Turkey. 

            On Monday, another earthquake shook southern Turkey, causing some already damaged buildings to collapse and killing at least one person.ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Egypt’s foreign minister arrived in Turkey on Monday to show solidarity with the quake-hit country, in the first high-level visit from Egypt since relations between Ankara and Cairo started to improve after years of friction.Sameh Shoukry traveled to the southern Turkish city of Mersin from Syria -- part of a two-legged trip seeking to convey Egypt’s solidarity with the earthquake-stricken populations.Diplomatic relations between Ankara and Cairo have been frosty for almost a decade.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823292,From Pharaoh Tutankhamun's curse to hate speech,"It is a discovery that captivated the world, and it remains one of the most important archaeological finds of all time: In 1922, the British Egyptologist Howard Carter and his team unearthed a stone staircase leading down to a sealed tomb in the Valley of the Kings, a royal burial ground for pharaohs in Egypt. In the tomb, they found Tutankhamun's sarcophagus, as well as a wide variety of funerary objects, basically still intact.The find triggered a media frenzy, and public fascination only grew when Carter's patron, the Earl of Carnavon, died in the midst of the excavation process. His death fueled the legend that the tomb was cursed. The lord was believed to have been punished by the pharaoh for disturbing the peace of the dead. And then, more deaths in the excavation team strengthened the myth.""There was the widespread impression that the Egyptians had secret knowledge that went well beyond ours, and that it was magical,"" historian Rolf-Bernhard Essig said.Therefore, a curse didn't feel unlikely amid the Egyptomania wave. Books and theater plays had already started spreading horror stories about walking mummies as early as the 19th century.""The press appealed to the lowest instincts of the readers and invented stories that were really well-received,"" Essig said. ""The curse of the pharaoh is one of the best-known phenomena internationally, although it is nearly 100% fictional.""Yet the myth remains popular today through novels, children's books, films and radio plays. The curse of the pharaoh is also still humorously refered to when tourists to Egypt fall ill with typical travel gastrointestinal infections.That inspired Essig to curate an exhibition on cursing and swearing, titled ""Potz! Lightning! From the Pharaoh's Curse to Hate Speech,"" which is now on show at the Berlin Museum for Communication.Cursing is probably as old as language itself and part of basic human behavior. A kind of magical power is attributed to using coarse or blasphemous words.""Of course, there were also curses and swear words in the Egyptian language. But that doesn't mean grave robbers were actually cursed,"" Essig said, adding that nothing on the topic was ever found by Egyptologists.So how did Egyptians actually swear? There is no historical documentation of this, as scribes did not chisel in stone the everyday curses used by, for example, pyramid builders.But there is evidence of royal curses on enemies. For example, the exhibition features a pair of modern flip-flops modeled on the gilded leather sandals from Tutankhamun's tomb. The soles feature depictions of tied-up enemies, which were ""trampled"" with every step — a way to ""magically"" curse rivals.Swear words share common characteristics across cultures. ""It's always about taboos,"" Essig said. Taboos transcending cultures and eras include bodily excretions and sex. ""Shit, for example, is a word used in many languages,"" says Essig, who, as a literary scholar, has long been fascinated by the function of language.Curses involving relatives are also very common in different languages, such as Arabic or Russian.Terms referring to animals are also often used as insults. In the exhibition, we learn that a donkey in Turkish stands for a cheeky brat, a fool or a bastard, depending on the context. In Russia, the billy goat is used to insult someone seen as an idiot. In Japan, ""gorilla"" is used to ridicule a man having a burst of anger. And to denigrate someone as coming from an unworthy family, the Chinese use the insult ""turtle's egg.""It has been found that swearing activates a particular part of the brain. Rational discussions are processed in the left hemisphere, whereas swear words also activate the right hemisphere, which is responsible for emotions. ""It's something we can't suppress because it's an involuntary expression. The brain does something without us being able to change anything,"" explains Essig.For example, if someone hits their thumb with a hammer, they may yell out a curse word or two. Of course, there are also those who swear very rarely or not at all, because they have a high level of self-control.Self-control appears to be lacking on social media, where insults in posts and comments are commonplace.Is hate speech a new dimension of insulting? Essig said the content had remained the same over the centuries: ""If you look at the insults from the 16th century, for example, the curses used were really disgusting.""But the main difference is that today's insults are being spread quickly around the world through the internet. Even if the fierceness of the terms hasn't changed, the technology allows a whole different of level of insults to emerge, Essig said: ""This fast and intense effect is indeed incredible.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823293,Siemens partners with India on railway modernization,"Last month, German engineering giant Siemens received the largest locomotive order in its history from government-owned Indian Railways.The deal, worth €3 billion (roughly $3.2 billion), was for 1,200 electric locomotives over a period of 11 years.The electric locomotives, which have an output of 9,000 horsepower, are to be used for freight transport.They can pull up to 4,500 metric tons of freight at up to 120 kilometers per hour (roughly 75 miles per hour).""Indian Railways will use the locomotives for freight transport, advancing the government's plan to increase the freight transported by rail to 40% to 45% by 2030, up from the current 27%,"" V. Shankar, former executive director of the railway board, told DW.The drives are to be manufactured at a Siemens plant in India, giving a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" strategy, under which he has urged foreign businesses to manufacture goods in the South Asian nation.Assembly will be carried out jointly with Indian Railways in the state of Gujarat on the western coast.The contract also includes maintenance and repair work for a 35 year period.""Siemens is supporting the sustainable transformation of India's transportation sector as the country seeks to almost double freight capacity on its railways,"" said Siemens CEO Roland Busch, when the contract was awarded.""I'm proud that this major order will help India achieve its ambitious goal of creating the world's largest green rail network, as our locomotives will save more than 800 million tons of CO2 emissions over their life cycle.""Siemens Mobility CEO Michael Peter pointed out that the new locomotives can replace as many as 500,000 to 800,000 trucks over their lifetimes.Busch, who was part of a high-powered group of CEOs of major German companies that accompanied Chancellor Olaf Scholz over the weekend to India, said that India has huge potential in green energy, infrastructures and health care.The group of executives met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi to discuss new opportunities for German firms to expand their footprint in the fast-growing economy.Around 1,800 German companies are active in India.The German chancellor said during the trip that he wanted progress towards a trade deal between the European Union and India.The agreement has long been held up by disagreements on tariffs and access for Indian workers to Europe.Scholz said Sunday that his government wants to make it easier for skilled workers, particularly information technology experts, from India to obtain work visas in Germany as the country struggles with a shortage of skilled labor.India, meanwhile, has one of the largest and busiest rail networks in the world.The colossal passenger railway system — often described as the nation's lifeline — is estimated to transport around 23 million people daily, some 8.4 billion passengers each year.The network operates over 12,000 trains carrying passengers and cargo along 67,415 kilometers of track. It is also the country's largest employer, with over 1.2 million employees.The enormous infrastructure, however, requires overhaul and constant maintenance.The railways have already begun phasing out diesel locomotives and getting closer to their climate change mitigation goals.Over 80% of the network has been electrified.""In the next eight years, we'll see the railways on a new journey of modernization,"" Modi said in December.Indian Railways is currently manufacturing hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered eco-friendly Vande Metro trains, which are expected to replace the old diesel-powered locomotives that were designed in the 1950s and 1960s.In a bid to accelerate green transition efforts, it is also looking to procure dozens of hydrogen-powered trains.The Indian transporter has reportedly held talks with major players in the sector, including Siemens.""The collaboration between the Indian Railways and Siemens is a testament to the power of international partnerships and the benefits of sharing expertise and resources. It will make it safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly,"" said Shankar.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/02/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823294,Putin's former 'political technologist' Gleb Pavlovsky dies,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's former adviser Gleb Pavlovsky died in Moscow on Monday after a serious illness at the age of 71, local media reported.Once an influential figure in Russian politics, Pavlovsky served as a political adviser to President Vladimir Putin but later became a critic of the Kremlin.Pavlovsky was born in the Ukrainian city of Odesa and was a dissident during the Soviet era. He served a sentence of internal exile in the northern republic of Komi in the 1980s.In 1995, Pavlovsky co-founded the Effective Policy Fund, a political strategy firm that worked on the presidential campaigns of Boris Yeltsin and his successor, Vladimir Putin.Pavlovsky worked as a Kremlin advisor and was a guiding figure during Putin's first two terms as president, from 2000 to 2008, and was primarily known for his role as a spin doctor and ""political technologist.""He was instrumental in the development of Russia's ""managed democracy"" that marginalized, exiled, or jailed Putin's rivals.However, he was dismissed after criticizing Putin and then-President Dmitry Medvedev's ""castling"" political maneuver, which allowed Putin — who had served for a term as prime minister — to run for a third term as president.Pavlovsky then became a critic of the Kremlin, and became known as one of the most insightful opponents of the administration.Reporting his death, the English-language Moscow Times newspaper described Pavlovsky as ""one of the most eloquent voices on the machinations and intrigue taking place in the halls of power.""On Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Pavlovsky said it was a war that Moscow couldn't win.""The previous Putin would not have done this,"" he said soon after the invasion. ""He was a very sane-thinking person. But this has all vanished now. He has an obsession about Ukraine that he didn't previously have. He is reacting now to the pictures in his own head.""Pavlovsky also took part in the unsuccessful 2004 presidential campaign of pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine. Yanukovych was eventually elected to power but was removed from office and sent into exile in 2014.Following Yanukovych's departure from Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea and began to back separatist proxy fighters in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.Edited by: Amanda Rivkin",2023/02/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823295,Ukraine updates: Belarus activists claim Russia A-50 attack,"Anti-government activists in Belarus have claimed responsibility for an attack on a Russian Beriev A-50 surveillance aircraft at an airfield near Minsk.They said the clandestine operation was carried out by a drone.Alexander Azarau, the leader of the ByPol opposition organization, told Poland-based exile media channel Belsat the Machulishchi attack was conducted by Belarusians who have fled the country and were ""in good hands.""Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, applauded the attack on Twitter as ""the most successful diversion"" since the start of 2022.""Glory to Belarusian partisans,"" he tweeted.""I am proud of all Belarusians who continue to resist the Russian hybrid occupation of Belarus & fight for the freedom of Ukraine,"" Tsikhanouskaya wrote on Twitter.The Russian aircraft Beriev A-50, also known as Mainstay by NATO, has command and control capabilities and the ability to track up to 60 targets at a time.Acts of sabotage in Belarus, which shares a border with both Ukraine and Russia, have been common since Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago.The country's autocratic leader Alexander Lukashenko is dependent on the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last year, Minsk allowed Moscow to use its territory for launching attacks on Ukraine.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Monday, February 27:A peace plan presented by China last week was the subject of detailed analysis, the Kremlin said on Monday, adding that Moscow saw no signs as of yet that a peaceful resolution could be achieved in Ukraine.""We are paying a great deal of attention to the plan of our Chinese friends,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. ""Of course, the details need to be painstakingly analyzed taking into account the interests of all the different sides. This is a very long and intense process.""The plan urges both sides to agree to a gradual de-escalation. It also warns against the use of nuclear weapons, which Russia has recently been hinting at.Meanwhile, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stressed it has always maintained communication with all sides in the conflict.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who had declared a ""no limits"" alliance with his Russian counterpart days before the invasion of Ukraine, has spoken to Vladimir Putin several times since the start of the war.Communication with the Ukrainian side however has been scarce.Meanwhile, China is getting prepared to welcome Belarus's autocratic president and Putin ally Alexander Lukashenko, who is visiting Beijing for three days at the invitation of Xi.China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning hailed in a regular press briefing on Monday the two-countries' 31-year-long diplomatic relations as well as the ""political mutual trust"" between them.""China looks forward to working with Belarus to take this visit as an opportunity to promote all-round cooperation between the two countries for further development,"" she said.The Kremlin expressed concern for Moldova's unrecognized breakaway region of Transnistria, amid fears that Moscow could use the tense region as an excuse to attack the country.""Naturally, the situation in Transnistria is the subject of our closest attention and a reason for our concern,"" Peskov told reporters. ""The situation is unsettled, it is being provoked, provoked from outside.""Moldova's pro-Western President Maia Sandu had accused Moscow earlier this month of plotting a coup. Russia denied such accusations.However, on Monday, Peskov suggested that European countries as well as Ukraine were causing ""provocation"" in the region.Moscow asserts that Kyiv plans to take over the Transnistria region, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Moldova have denied.Russian media earlier reported that Vadim Krasnoselsky, the self-styled president of Transnistria, had described the situation in the region as tense, urging citizens to remain calm.Ukraine's President Zelenskyy dismissed on Sunday night a top army commander in the eastern Donbas region, without giving reasons for the decision.Commander Eduard Moskalyov served in his post since March 2022.Russian and Ukrainian forces have been locked for weeks in fighting over control of the strategic Bakhmut town in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region.Kyiv is planning an attack in the coming months to reclaim territories occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern regions. One key area Ukraine is eying is Mariupol.The UK Defense Ministry said that pro-Russian officials have reported in the past week at least 14 explosions around Mariupol.""Russia will likely be concerned that unexplained explosions are occurring in a zone it had probably previously assessed as beyond the range of routine Ukrainian strike capabilities,"" the ministry said.Russian forces attacked the western city of Khmelnytskyi with Iranian-made drones early on Monday, killing two people and injuring three others.Mayor Oleksandr Symchyshyn reported the incident on social media.Meanwhile, Ukrainian armed forces said they shot down 11 out of 14 Iranian-made drones deployed by Russian forces overnight, including nine over the capital Kyiv.Moscow's Defense Ministry says Russian forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region.The ministry said Russian forces also shot down four HIMARS missiles and five drones launched by Ukraine.US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said that Washington agreed to provide battle tanks to Ukraine due to pressure from Berlin.US President Joe Biden agreed to the measure after Germany told him they did not want to send Leopard tanks without a similar commitment from Washington. Germany long hesitated on its decision to supply Kyiv with Leopard tanks.The US military had earlier deemed that the tanks were not fit for the battlefield in Ukraine.
Sullivan's statement contradicts past White House statements.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is set to visit the White House on Friday.UN officials condemned human rights violations committed in Ukraine during a Human Rights Council session.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the war had triggered ""massive violations"" of rights.UN High Commissioner Volker Turk warned that human rights gains were being reversed.Turk spoke of ""old destructive wars of aggression from a bygone era with worldwide consequences, as we have witnessed again in Europe with the senseless Russian invasion of Ukraine.""A poll conducted by Germany's DPA news agency suggests many Germans disapprove of arming Ukraine in its war against Russia.Thousands in Berlin attend 'naive' Ukraine peace rally. Organizers of the Rebellion for Peace protest have been criticized for playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin's hands.Ukraine's Zelenskyy says ""2023 will be the year of our victory"" as Poland says the first Leopard tanks have already been delivered to Kyiv.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823296,'Take It Down:' a tool for teens to remove explicit images,"“Once you send that photo, you can't take it back,” goes the warning to teenagers, often ignoring the reality that many teens send explicit images of themselves under duress, or without understanding the consequences. 

            A new online tool aims to give some control back to teens, or people who were once teens, and take down explicit images and videos of themselves from the internet. 

            Called Take It Down, the tool is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and funded in part by Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram. 











            The site lets anyone anonymously — and without uploading any actual images — create what is essentially a digital fingerprint of the image. This fingerprint (a unique set of numbers called a “hash”) then goes into a database and the tech companies that have agreed to participate in the project remove the images from their services. 

            Now, the caveats. The participating platforms are, as of Monday, Meta's Facebook and Instagram, Yubo, OnlyFans and Pornhub, owned by Mindgeek. If the image is on another site, or if it is sent in an encrypted platform such as WhatsApp, it will not be taken down. 

            In addition, if someone alters the original image — for instance, cropping it, adding an emoji or turning it into a meme — it becomes a new image and thus need a new hash. Images that are visually similar — such as the same photo with and without an Instagram filter, will have similar hashes, differing in just one character. 

            “Take It Down is made specifically for people who have an image that they have reason to believe is already out on the Web somewhere, or that it could be,” said Gavin Portnoy, a spokesman for the NCMEC. “You’re a teen and you’re dating someone and you share the image. Or somebody extorted you and they said, ‘if you don’t give me an image, or another image of you, I’m going to do X, Y, Z.’”

            Portnoy said teens may feel more comfortable going to a site than to involve law enforcement, which wouldn't be anonymous, for one. 

            “To a teen who doesn’t want that level of involvement, they just want to know that it’s taken down, this is a big deal for them,” he said. NCMEC is seeing an increase in reports of online exploitation of children. The nonprofit's CyberTipline received 29.3 million reports in 2021, up 35% from 2020.

            Meta, back when it was still Facebook, attempted to create a similar tool, although for adults, back in 2017. It didn't go over well because the site asked people to, basically, send their (encrypted) nudes to Facebook — not the most trusted company even in 2017. The company tested out the service in Australia for a brief period, but didn't expand it to other countries. 

            But in that time, online sexual extortion and exploitation has only gotten worse, for children and teens as well as for adults. Many tech companies already use this hash system to share, take down and report to law enforcement images of child sexual abuse. Portnoy said the goal is to have more companies sign up. 

            “We never had anyone say no,” he said.

            Twitter and TikTok so far have not committed to the project. Neither company immediately respond to a message for comment Sunday.

            Antigone Davis, Meta's global head of safety, said Take It Down is one of many tools the company uses to address child abuse and exploitation on its platforms. 

            “In addition to supporting the development of this tool and having, reporting and blocking systems on our on our platform, we also do a number of different things to try to prevent these kinds of situations from happening in the first place. So, for example, we don’t allow unconnected adults to message minors,"" she said. 

            The site works with real as well as artificial intelligence-generated images and “deepfakes,” Davis said. Deepfakes are created to look like real, actual people saying or doing things they didn't actually do.“Once you send that photo, you can't take it back,” goes the warning to teenagers, often ignoring the reality that many teens send explicit images of themselves under duress, or without understanding the consequences.A new online tool aims to give some control back to teens, or people who were once teens, and take down explicit images and videos of themselves from the internet.Called Take It Down, the tool is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and funded in part by Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.The site lets anyone anonymously — and without uploading any actual images — create what is essentially a digital fingerprint of the image.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823297,Supreme Court to hear challenge to consumer agency,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up a Republican-led challenge to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a case that could threaten how the consumer watchdog agency functions. It is the second time in three years that the justices will be examining the federal agency, which was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

            The case will not be heard before October. That's when the court begins its next term.

            Late last year, a federal appeals court — the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit — ruled that the agency’s funding structure is unconstitutional, threatening its ability to function. The Biden administration asked the high court to review that decision, which it has now agreed to do.











            The administration said the lower court’s ruling “calls into question virtually every action the CFPB has taken” since its creation. The decision “threatens to inflict immense legal and practical harms on the CFPB, consumers, and the nation’s financial sector,” the administration said.

            Since the bureau was created more than a decade ago by the Dodd-Frank Act, it has varied in its aggressiveness. During the Obama administration, it used its muscle to collect fines from banks and credit card companies; during the Trump administration, it drastically scaled back enforcement actions. Republicans have argued that the agency has unchecked power.

            The case the justices agreed to hear centers on the agency's funding. Unlike a majority of agencies, the CFPB does not get its funding from the annual budget process in Congress. Instead, it is funded directly by the Federal Reserve. The agency’s budget is capped at 12% of the total operating expenses of the Federal Reserve System. In the 2022 fiscal year, the agency received about $640 million.

            The case the justices will hear began when two associations sued over the agency's Payday Lending Rule. They argued in part that the agency's funding structure violated the Constitution, improperly insulating the agency from congressional supervision. A trial court ruled against the associations, but the appeals court agreed the funding structure was unconstitutional. Other courts that had previously looked at the agency's funding structure found no issue.

            In urging the justices to take the case, a group of 16 mostly Republican-led states called the CFPB “a failed experiment in administrative governance.” 

            Just three years ago, in 2020, the high court dealt with a different challenge to the agency. That case involved the agency's structure. The justices ultimately ruled that Congress had improperly insulated the head of the bureau from removal. The justices said the agency could continue to operate but that its director had to be removable by the president at will.

            The CFPB was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Democratic presidential candidate.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up a Republican-led challenge to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a case that could threaten how the consumer watchdog agency functions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823299,Man United's Rashford belatedly awarded cup final goal,"LONDON (AP) — Marcus Rashford has been credited with Manchester United's second goal in the club's 2-0 League Cup final win against Newcastle. 

            The England forward thought he had scored for the 25th time this season when his shot deflected off Newcastle defender Sven Botman in Sunday's Wembley final. 

            But the effort was adjudged an own-goal because the initial shot was considered to be off target before Botman's attempted block diverted the ball past goalkeeper Loris Karius.











            The incident has since been reviewed and the English Football League, which runs the competition, confirmed on Monday that Rashford has now been credited with the goal. 

            It makes him the leading scorer in the competition with six goals, having scored in every round. 

            It also extends Rashford's career-best scoring season and his impressive recent streak of 17 goals in his last 19 appearances.

            Lewandowski picked up the left-leg injury in Barcelona's 1-0 loss at Almeria in the Spanish league on Sunday, a result that allowed Madrid to cut the Catalan club's lead to seven points.

            Barcelona did not give a timetable for Lewandowski's recovery, but he is not expected to be fit for the first leg of the Copa semifinals at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.











            Barcelona will face Madrid two more times in the next few weeks, in the second leg of the Copa semifinals and in the Spanish league. Madrid won their last league meeting 3-1 in October, while Barcelona beat its rival by the same score in the Spanish Super Cup final in January. 

            Madrid is coming off a 1-1 home draw against city rival Atletico Madrid in the Spanish league.

            Lewandowski is the league's leading scorer with 15 goals. He had scored two goals in the last three games in all competitions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823301,"Energy agency: SUV growth weighs on emissions, batteries","BERLIN (AP) — Ever bigger cars pose a growing problem for the environment because they produce more greenhouse gas emissions and need larger batteries than their smaller cousins, according to the International Energy Agency.

            The Paris-based body suggested Monday that it’s time for the car industry to downsize its vehicles, citing data that showed the world’s 330 million sports utility vehicles, or SUVs, pumped out almost 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022.

            That’s more than the annual emissions of an industrial nation like Germany.











            “The shift towards heavier and less fuel-efficient conventional vehicles increases growth in both oil demand and CO2 emissions,"" the agency said, noting that SUVs consume about a fifth more gasoline than an average medium-sized car.

            “Between 2021 and 2022, oil use in conventional cars, excluding SUVs, remained roughly the same, but the oil consumption of SUVs globally increased by 500,000 barrels per day, accounting for one-third of the total growth in oil demand,” it said.

            And while conventional vehicle sales slowed slightly in 2022, by about 1 million SUVs and 1 million smaller cars, sales of electric vehicles almost doubled to a record of more than 10 million. For the first time, electric SUVs outpaced electric non-SUVs, at 5.5 million compared to 5.3 million.

            Electric SUVs require larger batteries than smaller cars, the agency noted.

            “A growing electric SUV market would impose additional pressure on battery supply chains and further increase demand for the critical minerals needed to make the batteries,” it said.

            The IEA urged policymakers and manufacturers to address the issue and suggested three possible actions: “Downsizing of the average car size; increasing battery swapping; and investing in innovative battery technologies.”BERLIN (AP) — Ever bigger cars pose a growing problem for the environment because they produce more greenhouse gas emissions and need larger batteries than their smaller cousins, according to the International Energy Agency.The Paris-based body suggested Monday that it’s time for the car industry to downsize its vehicles, citing data that showed the world’s 330 million sports utility vehicles, or SUVs, pumped out almost 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022.That’s more than the annual emissions of an industrial nation like Germany.“The shift towards heavier and less fuel-efficient conventional vehicles increases growth in both oil demand and CO2 emissions,"" the agency said, noting that SUVs consume about a fifth more gasoline than an average medium-sized car.“Between 2021 and 2022, oil use in conventional cars, excluding SUVs, remained roughly the same, but the oil consumption of SUVs globally increased by 500,000 barrels per day, accounting for one-third of the total growth in oil demand,” it said.And while conventional vehicle sales slowed slightly in 2022, by about 1 million SUVs and 1 million smaller cars, sales of electric vehicles almost doubled to a record of more than 10 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823303,"Japan, NZ to speed up intel sharing pact amid China concerns","TOKYO (AP) — The foreign ministers of Japan and New Zealand agreed on Monday to speed up talks on an intelligence sharing pact as the two island nations vowed to strengthen security ties and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region amid shared concern over an increasingly assertive China.

            New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta and her Japanese counterpart, Yashimasa Hayashi, also agreed during their talks in Tokyo to collaborate on priority issues for Pacific Island nations such as climate change, maritime security and infrastructure.

            The two countries pledged to ensure that the Pacific Island region, where China's influence is rapidly expanding, remains stable and prosperous and free from foreign interference and coercion, and that the ""rights, freedoms and sovereignty of all countries regardless of size or power are protected,” according to a statement released by Japan's Foreign Ministry.











            Hayashi said Japan, under its new National Security Strategy, is strengthening cooperation with like-minded countries to maintain and expand the ""free and open” international order, and that cooperation with New Zealand is extremely important. 

            In December, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government adopted key security and defense upgrades, including a counterstrike capability that breaks with the post-World War II principle limiting Japan to self-defense, while doubling defense spending in five years.

            Kishida told a parliamentary session on Monday that the Defense Ministry is purchasing 400 U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles for deployment as early as 2026. The Tomahawks would be used on Aegis radar-equipped destroyers and would be capable of striking targets as far as 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) away.

            But potential counter-strike usage requires highly advanced cyber-security and intelligence, which Japan lacks. It has been hoping to develop closer ties with members of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance and has signed intelligence-sharing agreements with the United States, Australia and Britain, and is discussing pacts with the two remaining members, New Zealand and Canada. 

            Hayashi said he and Mahuta agreed to “accelerate an early conclusion of an information security agreement, which will be a foundation of security and defense cooperation between the two countries.”TOKYO (AP) — The foreign ministers of Japan and New Zealand agreed on Monday to speed up talks on an intelligence sharing pact as the two island nations vowed to strengthen security ties and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region amid shared concern over an increasingly assertive China.New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta and her Japanese counterpart, Yashimasa Hayashi, also agreed during their talks in Tokyo to collaborate on priority issues for Pacific Island nations such as climate change, maritime security and infrastructure.The two countries pledged to ensure that the Pacific Island region, where China's influence is rapidly expanding, remains stable and prosperous and free from foreign interference and coercion, and that the ""rights, freedoms and sovereignty of all countries regardless of size or power are protected,” according to a statement released by Japan's Foreign Ministry.Hayashi said Japan, under its new National Security Strategy, is strengthening cooperation with like-minded countries to maintain and expand the ""free and open” international order, and that cooperation with New Zealand is extremely important.In December, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government adopted key security and defense upgrades, including a counterstrike capability that breaks with the post-World War II principle limiting Japan to self-defense, while doubling defense spending in five years.Kishida told a parliamentary session on Monday that the Defense Ministry is purchasing 400 U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles for deployment as early as 2026.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823304,Mets' Scherzer loves 'cat-and-mouse' game of MLB's new rules,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — New York Mets right-hander Max Scherzer described pitching under Major League Baseball's new rules as a “cat-and-mouse” game. 

            Contrary to previous years, Scherzer feels the pitcher finally has control of the tempo because of the new pitch clock.

            In his first start of the Grapefruit League schedule, Scherzer allowed a run in the second inning but struck out five while working the first two innings of the Mets’ 6-3 win over Washington.











            “Really, the power the pitcher has now — I can totally dictate pace,” the three-time Cy Young Award winner said. “The rule change of the hitter having only one timeout changes the complete dynamic of the hitter-and-pitcher dynamic. Yeah, I love it.”

            The pitch clock is among a series of new rules for this season — including limits on infield shifts and larger bases — that MLB hopes will improve pace of play and introduce more action into the game.

            The average game time through three days of spring training is 2 hours, 39 minutes, down from an average of 3:01 for all of spring training last year.

            Scherzer says he is learning to play around with the pitch clock.

            Washington’s Michael Chavis, the second hitter in the second inning, stepped out of the box when he felt Scherzer was taking too long. That was fine with Scherzer. 

            The right-hander held the ball for more than 10 seconds before delivering the next pitch as Chavis had to remain in the batter’s box, locked eyes with Scherzer. The veteran pitcher felt he had imposed his will, even though Chavis ultimately singled to right.

            “I can work extremely quick. And I can work extremely slow,” Scherzer said. “There’s another layer here to be able to mess with the hitter’s timing.

            “I can come set even before the hitter’s in the box. I can’t pitch until eight (seconds left on the clock). But as soon as his eyes are up, I can go. If his eyes are up with 12 seconds to go, I can fire.

            ""I had the conversation with the umpire (David Rackley) to make sure that’s legal. And that is (legal). I’m just getting used to how this is going to be in 2023.”

            According to MLB, there were 69 pitch-timer violations through the first 35 spring training games over the weekend — including 35 violations in 16 games Sunday.

            While Scherzer thinks the timer is working in pitchers' favor, hitters aren't complaining, either.

            “I like it,"" Yankees star Aaron Judge said. ""I think you can kind of play around with it a little bit. I think it definitely speeds up the game. Anything that kind of keeps the pitcher moving and on the go, and hopefully keep him out of breath, I’m looking forward to it.”

            Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said MLB is providing updates — nearly in real time — on the rules changes package that is making this spring training unique.

            The two major changes are a pitch clock and a limit on extreme infield shifts.

            “They did a really nice job of sending out a memo this morning with all the things that took place yesterday and questions that players and managers that just had to be addressed in order that you can cover it with your staff and club as you feel appropriate,” Marmol said. “So we did that with our staff and brought two different points with our players because they’ve done a really good job of communication.”

            There were more hiccups on Sunday throughout the Cactus and Grapefruit League games, but most took the changes in stride. 

            Rockies reliever Daniel Bard was called for a ball after throwing a warmup pitch after the 30-second deadline heading into an inning. The 30-second mark before innings was also a source of confusion during the Cardinals-Marlins game. Two Cardinals pitchers were called for balls before the start of innings before, according to Marmol, the umpires gathered and realized they were interpreting the rule incorrectly.

            “It’s spring training for everybody,” Marmol said. “Those things will get ironed out before we get out of here.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823316,AP sources: Haslams agree to purchase Lasry's stake in Bucks,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Cleveland Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam have agreed to purchase Marc Lasry’s 25% stake of the Milwaukee Bucks in a deal that puts the value of the NBA franchise at $3.5 billion, two people with knowledge of the negotiations said Monday.

            The agreement has not been finalized, said the people, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the Bucks nor the Haslams publicly disclosed any element of the agreement.

            Those numbers, if finalized, would mean the Haslams plan to spend about $875 million for Lasry’s stake of the team.











            The Haslams, who also own the Columbus Crew of Major Soccer League, have explored buying other professional sports teams, including the Minnesota Timberwolves in the past. Sportico was first to report the Haslam Sports Group’s interest in the Bucks. ESPN and The Athletic were first to report the agreement on Monday.

            It would be the second-highest valuation in NBA history, behind the $4 billion valuation for the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury when Mat Ishbia acquired them in a deal that closed earlier this month. It’s also a massive return on Lasry’s initial investment.

            The Haslams bought the Browns from Randy Lerner in 2012 for $1.05 billion. Their tenure in Cleveland mostly has been defined by losing records, changes and controversy.

            The Browns have made the playoffs only once under the Haslams, who have made numerous coaching and front-office overhauls in their pursuit of a Super Bowl title. Last year, they were criticized for acquiring quarterback Deshaun Watson in a trade before signing him to a record contract while he was being accused of sexual misconduct by two dozen women in Texas.

            Lasry and Wesley Edens, both New York investment firm executives, bought the Bucks from former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl for about $550 million in 2014 with pledges to keep the team in Milwaukee. The Bucks' ownership group also includes Jamie Dinan and Mike Fascitelli.

            The Bucks have enjoyed great success since that sale. They moved into a new arena in 2018, won their first NBA title in 50 years in 2021 and have built a perennial contender around Greek superstar and two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.

            The surging valuations almost certainly mean that the expansion fees will be well beyond what was originally thought when the NBA decides to add teams — something that will likely start getting discussed seriously once the league and the union complete their talks on a new labor agreement and the NBA completes its next rights deal with broadcast partners.

            If the Suns and Bucks are both being valued in the $3.5-to-$4 billion range, it stands to reason that expansion fees will be at least that much and likely more when the league decides the time is right to add clubs.

            “It is natural at some point that an organization expands,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this month at the All-Star weekend in Salt Lake City.

            “The view from our governors has been let’s figure out exactly what the new CBA looks like, let’s figure out what our new media deals look like. Then let’s think about expansion,” Silver said. “So invariably we will. There’s no active discussions in the league office right now, but we’ll turn back to it in a few years.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823324,Montenegro ends court stalemate that has threatened EU bid,"PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Montenegro's lawmakers on Monday elected all but one of the judges of the country's top court, ending a stalemate that has threatened to halt the Balkan nation's European Union membership bid. 

            Montenegro's Constitutional Court has been blocked for months with main political players failing to agree on new members. The court has seven judges but four places have been vacant since September.

            EU officials have warned Montenegro that it must allow for the normal functioning of the Constitutional Court if it wants continue on its path to join the EU. The court is crucial for the rule of law and as the country holds an important presidential election next month.











            Lawmakers on Monday approved three out of four judges but failed to agree on the fourth candidate. The vote still means that the court is formally unblocked despite lacking one member. A new vote to elect the fourth judge is expected within weeks. 

            “Good news from Montenegro today! ” tweeted Vladimir Bilcik, the European Parliament member dealing with the region. “I hope a fourth judge can be elected soon. The culture of dialogue and compromise across party lines is the only way forward for progress on the EU path.”

            Montenegro has been locked in a political crisis for months after its government fell in a no-confidence vote and main political players couldn't agree on whether to call an early election or try to form a new government.

            The presidential vote on March 19 is expected to reflect the divisions among pro-Western, and pro-Serbia and pro-Russia voters, in the Balkan nation of around 620,000 people. Long-serving pro-Western incumbent Milo Djukanovic is running for another term in office. 

            Montenegro used to be part of a union with Serbia before splitting in 2006. The country joined NATO in 2017, defying Russian opposition, and is widely considered as the next in line for EU membership.PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Montenegro's lawmakers on Monday elected all but one of the judges of the country's top court, ending a stalemate that has threatened to halt the Balkan nation's European Union membership bid.Montenegro's Constitutional Court has been blocked for months with main political players failing to agree on new members.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823336,"DeSantis takes over Disney district, punishing company","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a bill that gives him control of Walt Disney World's self-governing district, punishing the company over its opposition to the so-called “Don't Say Gay” law. 

            The bill requires DeSantis, a Republican, to appoint a five-member board to oversee the government services that the Disney district provides in its sprawling theme park properties in Florida. 

            ""Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,"" he said at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista. ""There's a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day.""











            The signing came as DeSantis gears up for an expected presidential run and marks a high-profile legislative victory for a governor whose leveraging of cultural and political divides has pushed him to the fore of national Republican politics. DeSantis, whose book, “The Courage to be Free,” is coming out Tuesday, has moved in recent weeks to expand his national profile and political network through fundraisers and meetings with donors, elected officials and conservative influencers.

            The takeover of the Disney district began last year when the entertainment giant publicly opposed “Don’t Say Gay,” which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate. 

            DeSantis moved to quickly to penalize the company, directing lawmakers in the GOP-dominated Legislature to dissolve Disney's self-governing district during a special legislative session last year, beginning a closely watched restructuring process. 

            In February, DeSantis called on lawmakers to again return to deal with Disney and finalize state control over the district in another hastily called special session that signaled the governor's willingness to wield the power of state government to accomplish political goals, a strategy that is expected to continue in the coming months ahead of his potential White House run. 

            The new law changes the district’s name from the Reedy Creek Improvement District to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and subjects it to various layers of state oversight. Board members are currently named through entities controlled by Disney.

            It leaves the district and its financial abilities and debt obligations intact, addressing a chief concern of surrounding governments. It also prevents people who have worked with or contracted with a theme park in the past three years from serving on the district’s new governing board.

            Having a separate government allows the district to issue bonds and provide zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure services on its land. Republican critics of the district argue it gives Disney a commercial advantage unavailable to others.TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823341,Chicago: What to expect on election night,"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot faces eight challengers in the city's elections on Tuesday, a tough reelection campaign for an incumbent who made history as the first Black woman and first openly gay person to serve in the role.

            A former federal prosecutor who had never before run for political office, Lightfoot was something of a surprise winner four years ago, claiming an overwhelming victory in a runoff. Her four years in office have included issues with high crime rates and ongoing friction with the city's teachers union, and should she lose her bid to return to city hall, Lightfoot would become the first Chicago mayor in decades to run for reelection and fail.

            With nine candidates in the race, it is unlikely that anyone will exceed the 50% threshold needed to win the officially nonpartisan election outright. That means the winner is likely to be decided in an April 4 runoff between the top two vote-getters.











            Most observers peg the race as a four-person contest among Lightfoot, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia and Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson. 

            Vallas, the only white candidate in the race, is positioning himself as a moderate, with backing from the Chicago police union. Garcia, the only Hispanic candidate, is focusing hard on Latino neighborhoods and Hispanic TV and radio. Johnson is an organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union with a strong ground game made up of union volunteers.

            Here’s a look at what to expect on election night:

            ELECTION DAY

            Polls close at 8 p.m. ET.

            HOW CHICAGO VOTES

            Chicago holds nonpartisan jungle-style primaries that are open to all voters, who can register on election day. A candidate must win more than 50% of ballots cast to win outright. If no candidate does, the top two advance to a runoff election on April 4.

            AP will declare winners in the race for Chicago mayor. AP will also tabulate an additional 57 races, for Chicago alderperson and police council, but will not call winners in those races. In the 2022 general election, AP first reported results in Chicago at 8:35 p.m. ET. The election night tabulation ended just before 1 a.m. ET, with 88% of votes counted.

            DECISION NOTES 

            The AP does not make projections and will only declare a winner when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap.

            Should a candidate declare victory or offer a concession before the AP calls a race, we will cover newsworthy developments in our reporting. In doing so, we will make clear that AP has not yet declared a winner and explain why.

            
                The AP may call a race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a recount and legal challenge to change the outcome. In Illinois, there are no automatic recounts. Trailing candidates can request recounts if they receive at least 95% of the total votes of the winning candidate. 

            However, recounts in Illinois are for the purposes of legal discovery only and cannot by themselves change the results of an election.

            Q: WHAT DO TURNOUT AND ADVANCE VOTE LOOK LIKE? 

            A: As of Jan. 1, 2023, there were 1.6 million registered voters in Chicago. As of Sunday, 207,940 voters had cast advance ballots. 

            In the 2022 primary election, 49% of Chicago voters cast their ballots before election day. Mail-in ballots can arrive as late as March 14 and be counted so long as they are postmarked by election day.

            Election officials have said the number of mail ballots is up sharply from the last mayor’s race, in 2019, which could delay results.

            Q: HOW LONG DOES COUNTING USUALLY TAKE?

            A: Chicago counts a significant number of votes after election day, which could delay race calls in a competitive election. In the 2022 general election, the city counted 12% of votes after election day.

            Election officials said they plan to start releasing citywide results shortly after polls close at 8 p.m. ET. However, they don’t expect to start releasing results by ward until around 1 a.m. ET. 

            Following election day, the Board of Elections plans to update results several times each day on Wednesday and Thursday, and then periodically through the March 14 deadline to receive mail ballots.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823342,Jurors will visit crime scene site in Alex Murdaugh trial,"Jurors in Alex Murdaugh's murder trial in the shooting deaths of his wife and son will get to visit the South Carolina home where the killings took place before they begin deliberating, the judge ruled Monday.

            Lawyers for the disgraced South Carolina attorney asked for the trip to the Colleton County property called Moselle so that the jury can see the dog kennels near where the body of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh was found and the storage room where 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh was killed on June 7, 2021.

            Alex Murdaugh, 54, faces two counts of murder in the deaths of his wife and son. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted. Before the jury visit issue came up, both sides suggested that closing statements and deliberations could begin this week.











            Defense attorney Dick Harpootlian said Monday that it's important for jurors to visit the Murdaugh home to see “how small the feed room is ” and “where the feed room is compared to Maggie's body.""

            “You just cant really appreciate the spatial issues without really seeing them,” he said.

            Prosecutors told the judge that they didn't want the jury to visit because it has been 20 months since the killings and it looks different.

            Prosecutor Creighton Waters said trees planted between the Murdaugh home and the kennels shortly before the killings have grown taller and thicker, and one the state's key arguments is that Murdaugh, who testified that he was inside the house 1,100 feet (335 meters) away when investigators think the killings happened, should have been able to hear the rifle shots or shogun blasts. He said he didn’t.

            “If anything, that would require additional testimony because the scene is different,” Waters said on the trial's 25th day.

            Judge Clifton Newman agreed to schedule the visit, saying he usually allows them if either side requests one. Only the jury, the judge, lawyers, and police and security personnel can be there.

            The day of the visit has not been set.

            The judge agreed with Harpootlian to request that Colleton County deputies provide additional security on the property, which is currently under contract with a buyer for $3.9 million.

            The defense lawyer said over the weekend that several trespassers were found taking selfies outside the feed room where Paul Murdaugh died.

            “It's the most distasteful thing we've ever seen,” Harpootlian said.Jurors in Alex Murdaugh's murder trial in the shooting deaths of his wife and son will get to visit the South Carolina home where the killings took place before they begin deliberating, the judge ruled Monday.Lawyers for the disgraced South Carolina attorney asked for the trip to the Colleton County property called Moselle so that the jury can see the dog kennels near where the body of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh was found and the storage room where 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh was killed on June 7, 2021.Alex Murdaugh, 54, faces two counts of murder in the deaths of his wife and son.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823350,Turkey: New earthquake injures over 60 in hard-hit region,"Southeastern Turkey was hit by yet another deadly earthquake on Monday, with rescue operations still ongoing to rescue people trapped under buildings.It's the fourth earthquake to hit the region in three weeks, coming after the February 6 earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria.Monday's event measured a magnitude of 5.6 according to Turkish authorities, who said the quake took place in the Malatya province.The European-Mediterranean Seismological Center (EMSC) put the magnitude at 5.2, and said it occurred at a depth of 6.15 kilometers (3.8 miles).One person has been reported dead and 69 injured, with authorities saying 29 buildings collapsed as a result of Monday's tremor.Malatya province was badly hit in the February 6 catastrophe — losing about 2,300 residents according to Mayor Selahattin Gurkan.On Monday, Yunus Sezer, who runs Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), said rescue teams had been deployed to five buildings in Malatya.AFAD's general director of earthquake and risk reduction, Orhan Tatar, said the region had suffered more than 45 aftershocks measuring between 5.0 and 6.0 over the past three weeks, calling it ""very extraordinary activity.""AFAD tweeted that Monday's quake had destroyed buildings, and that search and rescue teams had been dispatched to the area.On February 6, Turkey and neighboring Syria were rocked by 7.7 and 7.6 magnitude quakes that killed more than 50,000 people. Rescue and recovery efforts have been ongoing due to the massive scale of devastation.The death toll has risen every day since as rescue teams continue to recover bodies trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings.More than 20 million people have been affected by the geological catastrophe in Turkey and another 8.8 million in Syria.The United Nations said the February 6 quake was the deadliest in Turkish history.More than 160,000 buildings collapsed or were severely damaged in the February 6 quake. The AFAD has repeatedly warned people to stay away from damaged buildings in earthquake zones.To date, Turkish authorities have arrested 184 individuals for possible complicity in the collapse of numerous buildings in the region. On Saturday, authorities announced they would continue to expand their investigation.The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been quick to blame developers for the massive damage. These are accused of having used substandard materials and workmanship while raking in profits during Turkey's building boom — one of the main drivers of its ailing economy.Erdogan is facing perhaps his largest political challenge yet. He was elected as prime minister in 2003 in the wake of another massive quake that killed over 18,000 people in 1999. Erdogan served as prime minister until 2014, when he ran for president and was elected to the post he still currently holds.The country is now assessing how it can go ahead with elections scheduled for June.Prior to recent elections, Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) made a point of granting amnesty to builders whose structures did not meet Turkish building standards.Erdogan, who has run the country for two decades, has promised to rebuild some 270,000 homes in the region within one year's time.Turkey's High Election Board was set to dispatch a delegation to the quake-hit region Monday in an effort to determine whether the tally could go ahead.js/rs (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823351,Are Korean TV dramas shifting focus from love to revenge?,"South Korea's drama series already have legions of fans around the world, but one media critic has warned that this could change as the industry shifts away from the popular romance tales of the past and instead embraces plotlines focused on revenge.In a column published in The Korea Herald on February 8, long-time contributor Kim Seong-kon explained that ""Hallyu,"" or the Korean Wave, of popular culture had grown out of television dramas such as the romance ""Winter Sonata"" or ""Dae Jang Geum.""""In those series, young people love each other despite ordeals and obstacles, or strive to accomplish noble goals of becoming the best in their fields of expertise,"" Kim wrote. ""Such dramas portrayed South Korea as a romantic and historic place foreigners wanted to visit.""In recent years, however, ""things have radically changed,"" he said.In today's television offerings — such as ""The Glory,"" ""Eve"" or ""Revenge of Others"" — ""the protagonist, who is obsessed with vengeance, devotes his or her life to get revenge on someone for misdeeds they inflicted in the past,"" he saidIn some stories, revenge is meted out to school bullies or rich and powerful businessmen.""One of the unacknowledged problems with such revenge dramas is that they unwittingly depict South Korea as a land of resentment and vendettas,"" Kim suggested.""Without intending to, they also make Korea out to be a society run rampant with school bullying.""Such publicity might make South Korea a less attractive place for foreigners.""Kim said the sudden emergence of revenge dramas could be the result of increased numbers of people believing they have been ""the victims of social injustice,"" a sentiment that has been encouraged by ""left-wing politicians"" who have ""exploited the situation by pouring fuel on popular enmity towards the rich and the privileged.""Others with their fingers on the pulse of South Korean youth culture are less convinced of any connection.""I am unsure if there is a notable increase in the number of revenge plotlines,"" said Jungmin Kwon, an associate professor at Portland State University in Oregon who specializes in East Asian popular culture.""It is true that Korean citizens are very sensitive to matters related to social injustice, the gap between the haves and have-nots, and economic inequality,"" she told DW.""However, this is not a new occurrence, although sensitivity may have increased recently.""Korean television has always enjoyed revenge dramas, she said, and it would be difficult to link these shows to ""political predisposition.""More importantly, she said, there are no reasons for television companies to make programs that, ""may agitate less privileged viewers against the wealthy in consideration of the current political leadership.""Yet, she agreed that K-dramas had seen a shift to more diverse narratives and characters.""TV shows used to be concentrated on family melodramas, trendy romances, or historical dramas,"" Kwon said. ""Now, with the advance of media technologies, we are living in an age in which multi-platforms and multi channels are competing to grab eyeballs.""Traditional TV networks have been losing their foothold, and the younger generations are migrating to streaming services and mobile devices to consume media content.""Fierce competition has forced content providers to look for new materials, angles and a variety of characters, especially if they want to appeal to the all-important youth segment of the viewing public.""Genres such as noir, mystery, crime, fantasy and action, which used to be less employed in the TV industry, are on the rise,"" she said. ""And in terms of characters, we do see more and more TV shows with female leads, senior leads and queer characters, albeit mostly in supporting roles.""David Tizzard, an assistant professor of education at Seoul Women's University and a columnist for a Korean daily focusing on social affairs, says K-dramas were ""a new cultural phenomenon"" that emerged from the radio serials of the nation's difficult days in the 1950s and 1960s.""These weekly episodes were generally focused on love triangles and featured urban people exploring modernization,"" he said. ""They were fantasy depictions of life written by the country's elite to provide a sense of release from the reality of poverty the population experienced.""As color television became a staple, Korean dramas became the same thing. They focused on love triangles and often showed a depiction of life more glamorous than society was actually living through,"" he added. ""They were successful because of the star power of the actors and the nature of the story lines.""They resonated in Asia for the same reason. There was also appeal in ""a romanticized version of a simpler, more conservative life,"" Tizzard said.""If people watch dramas today, however, I'm pretty sure they might immediately think Korea is a place of horrific bullying, violence, suicide and death,"" he said. ""Those concepts seem to resonate and be very popular in the West. It's a way of making them more accessible to a larger audience beyond the female viewers who primarily engage with the high-teen and romance concepts.""But he dismisses the suggestion in Kim's column that a character in a television program who successfully avenges him or herself on a rival might be mimicked by an individual in real life.""That's a trope as old as time,"" he emphasized. ""That rock and roll is the devil's music. That playing computer games will turn you violent. I don't believe these dramas will affect large numbers in society and turn them into vigilantes.""There will always be isolated incidents and they should, of course, be treated seriously — but I don't believe these programs will create a rise in people seeking revenge against others.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/02/27,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823352,Norway: Thunberg joins Indigenous protests against turbines,"The Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg joined Indigenous Sami demonstrators on Monday, blocking the entrance to Norway's Energy Ministry.The demonstrators in Oslo are calling for the government to carry out a court order that deemed wind turbines in northwestern Norway illegal.The Sami Indigenous people, who are spread out across mostly parts of Norway, but also Sweden, Finland and Russia, have been herding reindeer for centuries. The practice represents a preservation of both livelihood and tradition.Herders say the loud sounds produced by the wind turbines scare away reindeer.In 2021, Norway's Supreme Court ruled that two wind farms on the northwestern Fosen peninsula violated the rights of six Sami families.The ruling stipulated that the farms breached the UN International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, as they prevented the Sami families from practicing their culture of reindeer herding.The Supreme Court's ruling did not say what should happen to the turbines on the farms. The turbines in Fosen, therefore, operate to this day.""Indigenous rights, human rights, must go hand-in-hand with climate protection and climate action. That can't happen at the expense of some people. Then it is not climate justice,"" Thunberg told Reuters news agency outside the ministry's main entrance with other demonstrators.Protesters had occupied the ministry's reception area since Thursday. They were forcibly removed and temporarily detained in the early hours of Monday, only to convene again hours later, this time outside the ministry.Sami protesters wore the gakti, their traditional costume, inside out as a sign of dissent.The Energy Ministry said it was hoping to find a compromise on what it said was a complex legal quandary. It vowed to exert every effort to resolve the matter without taking longer than was necessary.""We understand that this case is a burden for the reindeer herders,"" Energy and Petroleum Minister Terje Aasland said in a statement to Reuters.The 151 turbines provide energy for about 100,000 Norwegian homes.Farm owners include Germany's Stadtwerke München, the Norwegian utilities Statkraft and TroenderEnergi, and the Swiss firms Energy Infrastructure Partners and BKW.rmt/rs (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/27,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823366,"EU, UK hail 'new chapter' in post-Brexit ties with Northern Ireland deal","The United Kingdom and the European Union have struck a new deal on post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland after more than a year of wrangling and political acrimony. Standing alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hailed a ""decisive breakthrough"" which ""will start making a positive difference to people's lives in Northern Ireland almost immediately.""The new plans, dubbed the ""Windsor Framework,"" will scrap some checks on goods crossing from the rest of the United Kingdom into Northern Ireland, and give Northern Irish lawmakers greater say over future EU rules.Both sides insist the agreement marks a ""new chapter"" in EU-UK relations — but in Belfast, the jury's still out.Under the proposed framework, products bound only for Northern Ireland will pass through a new minimal-check ""green lane."" Products considered ""at risk"" of crossing the island into Ireland and therefore entering the EU's single market will go through a ""red lane"" with EU compliance checks.""This means if food is available on supermarket shelves in Great Britain, it will be available on supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland,"" Sunak told reporters. The new deal will also guarantee the future supply of UK-approved medicines to Northern Ireland.Von der Leyen said to make this work, both sides had ""agreed on strong safeguards like IT access, labels and enforcement procedures that will protect the integrity of the EU's single market.""Great Britain encompasses England, Scotland and Wales. The United Kingdom comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Brussels' red line remains intact: Von der Leyen said the EU's top court would have the ""final say"" on EU laws applying in Northern Ireland.Observers believe that this will prove unpopular with some in Belfast who want an end to EU jurisdiction. Lawmakers there will, however, get beefed up powers with an ""emergency brake"" mechanism to intervene on EU goods laws ""that would have significant and lasting effects on everyday lives"" in Northern Ireland, Sunak said.Britain's 2016 decision to leave the EU threw up a new political conundrum because Northern Ireland left the bloc with the rest of the UK, while the neighboring Republic of Ireland remained a member.Since the UK can diverge from EU health and safety standards and other rules post-Brexit, a new system was needed to govern how goods cross the island of Ireland.All sides ruled out creating a land border on the island to uphold theGood Friday Agreement, a 1998 accord struck to end decades of sectarian conflict between unionist communities and nationalist communities Northern Ireland.""The history of Northern Ireland has been defined by two communities that are characterised by their different and opposing constitutional aspirations for the future of Northern Ireland,"" Belfast-based research fellow Lisa Claire Whitten told DW. ""You have Unionists who feel and identify as being British, and they want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. So the relationship between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, for them is crucially important. But you also have nationalists who identify more as Irish and they their constitutional aspiration is for Northern Ireland to join with the rest of the island of Ireland — the Republic of Ireland.""The settled-on solution was the Northern Ireland Protocol, under which some checks are carried out at ports and airports in Northern Ireland on goods from Great Britain.But this has proved politically polarizing. Not only were there technical issues for businesses, it's been seen as an existential threat by some. Whitten told DW there had been ""a sense of new divisions between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.""""For unionists, that feels like a violation of their Britishness and a threat to the place of Northern Ireland within the UK,"" she said.On Monday, Sunak insisted the changes would remove ""any sense of a border in the Irish Sea.""After the Northern Ireland Protocol partially came into effect in 2021, the EU and UK began exchanging accusations. London tabledlegislation to unilaterally rewrite parts of the mutually-agreed text in 2022 and Brussels started suing the UK.Throw in three British prime ministers and more than a year of stop-start negotiations — ""it's been messy,"" one EU diplomat who asked not to be named told DW. ""There's been a massive erosion of trust.""But a turning point came when Sunak took office, according to the diplomat, marking what Brussels views as ""a return to practical government on the part of the UK.""The source said forging a common response to Russia's war in Ukraine had also helped bring London and Brussels closer.""Today is a happy day,"" they said. ""Getting this deal is what we've been working toward.""But the story doesn't end here with a neat happy ending.All eyes are now on Belfast to see what the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) makes of the deal. The party has been refusing to enter into a political power-sharing arrangement in the Northern Irish Assembly over staunch opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol.""In broad terms it is clear that significant progress has been secured across a number of areas whilst also recognising there remain key issues of concern,"" DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said in a statement published Monday.""The DUP will want to study the detail of what has been published today as well as examining the detail of any and all underpinning legal texts.""If the deadlock doesn't end, critics will likely cast the new deal as a failure.Sunak said the UK parliament would vote on the proposals but gave no date, stressing that ""time and care"" would be needed as parties digest the deal. EU ratification will also be needed.Whitten hopes power-sharing will be restored soon but doubts this will happen overnight. She says the new deal will likely ""require compromise on all sides — which although not unfamiliar in the history of Northern Ireland, is not often comfortable.""Edited by: Anne Thomas",2023/02/27,,

The youngest victim was only 9-years-old.""These 15 are among countless Ukrainian children allegedly kidnapped by Russia during its war of aggression against Ukraine,"" Baerbock said.""We won't rest until all these kids are home,"" she said, ""because children's rights are human rights and human rights are universal.""A year ago, the Human Rights Council decided to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate violations of human rights in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and international humanitarian law and secure evidence for court proceedings.The commission's mandate was initially limited to one year. It will present a report on March 20.Baerbock spoke out in favor of extending the mandate of the commission. The UN experts must also be empowered to investigate the cases of abducted children, she said.The Human Rights Council in Geneva is the UN's central forum for human rights. The council consists of 47 elected member states and has various instruments at its disposal to advocate for the protection of human rights.dh/rs (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/27,,

The announcement comes on the heels of souring ties between France and several African nations.""The bases as they exist now are a heritage from the past,"" Macron said in an address on Monday evening.""The change will happen in the coming months with a noticeable reduction of our numbers and a greater presence in these bases of our African partners,"" Macron said. This ""reorganization ... does not intend to be a withdrawal,"" he added.The French president said there would be a notable fall in French military personnel but an increase in an effort to provide training and equipment.The bases would also see a ""rise in the presence of their African partners according to goals defined"" by these partners, he said.Some African countries have criticized France for failing to curb Islamist militancy in the Sahel region in particular.Anti-French sentiment is running high in former French colonies Mali and Burkina Faso after military coups there that led to fallouts with Paris.French troops pulled out of Mali last year after the country's military leadership began cooperating with the Russian mercenary Wagner Group.In January, Burkina Faso gave France one month to withdraw its troops, and officially ended French military operations in the country in February.Macron said he would not allow France to become ""the ideal scapegoat"" in Africa. He also said he refused to be drawn into an outdated competition between powers for control of the continent.The French president described the Russian mercenary Wagner Group as the ""life insurance of failing regimes in Africa,"" saying it contains ""criminal mercenaries.""The Wagner Group is already active in Mali and the Central African Republic; reports also suggest the group is now looking to get a foothold in Burkina Faso, which Russia denies.Macron said African nations would eventually stop turning to the mercenary group, nothing that they are ""preying on mines, raw materials.""Macron heads off on a four-nation tour of central African countries starting on Wednesday as Paris seeks to counter growing Chinese and Russian influence on the continent.He will first visit Gabon for an environmental summit, followed by Angola, then the Republic of Congo, and finally the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.dh/rs (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/27,,

The bank will release a separate damage estimate for Syria on Tuesday.Bjerde said the initial rapid damage assessment for Turkey of $34.2 billion was equivalent to about 4% of its economic output in 2021, but that did not include indirect or secondary impacts on the growth of its economy, or the most recent earthquake a week ago.""Our experience is that reconstruction needs can run as high as two to three times the estimated direct physical damage,"" she said.The Feb. 6 earthquakes of 7.8 magnitude and 7.5 magnitude, the most deadly in modern Turkey's history, killed more than 44,300 people.The World Bank said the earthquakes had been followed by more than 7,500 aftershocks, creating the largest such disaster to strike Turkey in over 80 years.The bank's Global Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Estimation (GRADE) report estimates that 1.25 million people were made homeless by damage to their homes, or their complete collapse.The heaviest damage occurred in 11 provinces in southern Turkey that have some of the country's highest poverty rates, and host more than 1.7 million Syrian refugees, or about half the total Syrian refugee population in Turkey, the report found.The World Bank has provided immediate assistance of $780 million for Turkey from two existing projects in Turkey, as well as $1 billion in a new emergency recovery project.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; editing by John Stonestreet and Ed Osmond)",2023/02/28,308,World

VORTEX offers solution and the convenient of cloud surveillance to The Washing Well. 

            Background

            Midwest American weather can be challenging for businesses, especially during the winter. Those that operate 24 hours a day with minimal staff, such as Jefferson, Iowa-based The Washing Well Laundromat, require depend able surveillance around the clock for a multitude of reasons and locations, no matter during sunny, warm days or at 2am during a blizzard.











            Being able to access important footage from anywhere any time of day or night had become a necessity for The Washing Well. The owners wanted to check on their location remotely to help them determine if the laundromat needed any attention such as cleaning, snow removal, or general maintenance, while also providing security for both the owner's and customers' property.

            Challenge

            Video security surveillance is vital for any and every business' continued well being, whether that organization be small, medium, or large in terms of both number of personnel and size of facility (or facilities). Nowadays, NVRs (network video recorders) and even computer hard drives are still popular choices for security professionals, but those that require larger and larger volumes of data as the weeks, months, and years roll by need new ways to effectively store, move, and access these files, many instances when not on site. When stored on site on an NVR or similar hard drive device, precious time is wasted when a security professional is not able to access vital information in real time.

            VIVOTEK's new cloud-based video surveillance as a service (VSaaS), VORTEX, eliminates these challenges.

            Solution

Central Iowa's Tech Zone chose VORTEX and a total of five of its indoor and outdoor security solutions for a comprehensive end-to-end AI surveillance solution that seamlessly integrates deep-learning-based network cameras with cloud video management software to solve The Washing Well's security surveillance solution issues.

            VORTEX provides intelligent and easy-to-use data analysis services. What's more, its hybrid cloud architecture allows it to transcend conventional storage frameworks. No longer is dedicated video management software or centralized management systems required to manage and process video data. Now, video data can be stored and analyzed via edge computing directly within the camera and backup in the cloud, significantly reducing time, cost, and bandwidth limitations of the past.

            VORTEX allows for receiving push notifications of deep-learning-based events on a smart device in real-time to never miss important messages again. With VORTEX, managing a surveillance system is more effective and easier than ever before with wide camera selection, crystal clear image quality, Edge AI analytics, hassle-free, zero configuration, and, like all VIVOTEK products, it is trustworthy and reliable.

            Thee VSaaS features powerful AI video analysis technologies, upgraded real-time detection and post-hoc search functionality, state-of-the-art deep search algorithms to convert metadata into searchable and quantifiable information and refine people, vehicle, and environment detection accuracy over time.

All of these features are merged seamlessly to maximize operational efficiency and storage reliability while minimizing network interruptions and downtime.

            Overall, Tech Zone installed five VORTEX cameras throughout the interior and exterior of the business. Three IT839-H 5MP interior/exterior turret cameras are being utilized in the store room, inside the laundromat, and at the rear parking lot locations. Two FD839-EHTV interior/exterior remote focus dome cameras are being utilized for the front parking lot and inside the laundromat.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823422,Teledyne e2v provides a highly-integrated radiation-tolerant DDR4 memory solution with Texas Instruments power supply,"GRENOBLE, FRANCES -  Media OutReach - 28 February 2023 - To help satellite OEMs to streamline their system development work, as well as reducing the time and engineering effort involved, Teledyne e2v and Texas Instruments (TI) collaborated on a new radiation-tolerant DDR4 modular platform. This field-proven hardware consists of a 4GB/8GB capacity DDR4T0xG72 DDR4 memory from Teledyne e2v accompanied by a TI TPS7H3301-SP DDR termination low drop-out (LDO) voltage regulator that provides a stable supply for the DDR4 module.            Optimized for implementations where there are acute size, weight and power (SWaP) constraints to factor in, the DDR4/TPS7H3301-SP platform is very compact and convenient to use. The constituent components have already gone through comprehensive space characterization and qualification procedures to help designers achieve long-term operation without single event latch-up (SEL) and single event upset (SEU) issues arising.   This platform allows elevated levels of data storage capacity to be achieved inside a very small form factor. It requires three times less PCB area versus solutions from the competition, and its volume is smaller by a factor of ten.   Versatility is another plus point, with the DDR4T0xG72/TPS7H3301-SP modular platform being applicable across a wide range of space-grade processors (including Teledyne e2v and others), FPGAs/ACAPs (such as AMD/Xilinx, Microchip, NanoXplore, etc.) and custom-built ASICs.   More information on it is available at:  https://semiconductors.teledyneimaging.com/en/products/memory/space-radiation-tolerant-4gb-8gb-ddr4/   ""Having access to pre-tested, easy-to-integrate hardware is of real benefit to those constructing systems for space deployment,"" states Thomas Guillemain, Marketing Manager for Digital Processing Solutions at Teledyne e2v. ""This joint platform results in significant value for our space customers, particularly on SWaP.""   ""The DDR4T0xG72/TPS7H3301-SP solution means that space systems will now have access to a small-format module that saves critical board area and offers high power density and verified radiation hardness and reliability,"" adds Mark Toth, marketing and applications engineering manager for space-grade power products at TI.   The radiation-validated TI and Teledyne e2v devices that make up this solution are featured in Alpha Data's Versal Core development kit ADK-VA600.  Hashtag: #Teledynee2v

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823434,US army secretary says Chinese invasion of Taiwan not imminent,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — China will not likely attack Taiwan any time soon, U.S. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said on Monday (Feb. 27).

            “I’m personally not of the view that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan is imminent, but we have to obviously prepare. We have got to be prepared to fight and win that war,” Wormuth said at an event hosted by Washington, D.C.-based think tank American Enterprise Institute.

            She said that the U.S. wants to “avoid fighting a land war in Asia.” Wormuth added “This is all about deterrence.”

            Meanwhile, U.S. Army Pacific Commander General Charles Flynn said China has hinted that a Taiwan invasion could happen at some point but suggested Beijing probably is not ready to take on such an endeavor.











            “They are on a historical trajectory. The military arm they have created is extraordinary,” he said. “They are preparing those forces for something … The prize is Taiwan.”

            Both officials shared some measures the army is taking to prepare for a regional conflict, including adopting new training and capabilities in the Indo-Pacific, more strategic deployment of troops in the region, and use of long-range hypersonic weapons capable of reaching Mach 5.

            They also stressed the importance of congressional support, especially in terms of funding, and drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine.

            Wormuth and Flynn’s comments follow CIA Director William Burns’ assessment that Chinese leader Xi Jinping may have doubts about his nation’s ability to seize Taiwan by 2027. “I think our judgment at least is that President Xi and his military leadership have doubts today about whether they could accomplish that invasion,” he said in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday (Feb. 26).

            Additionally, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) has also warned that ""2027 is a year we need to watch out."" He said China's economy is sputtering and there is growing discontent among the populace.

            If Xi is not able to address these issues during his fourth term in 2027, he may attempt to ""resort to the use of force"" or create an external crisis to distract from domestic issues, Wu said.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — China will not likely attack Taiwan any time soon, U.S. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said on Monday (Feb. 27).“I’m personally not of the view that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan is imminent, but we have to obviously prepare.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823481,Bowtie the Insurtech Startup Takes The Lead in Insurance Digitalisation,"Local start-up revolutionising the traditional insurance industry with technology

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 28 February 2023 - In today’s digital age, many industries have begun to introduce emerging technologies to develop innovative services. The transformation and upgrading of the insurance industry is also in full swing. As the first virtual insurance company in Hong Kong,  Bowtie is committed to integrating innovative technology and medical expertise to provide Hong Kong people with a zero-intermediary, commission-free online insurance platform.    Insurtech creates competitive advantage for businesses      According to a recent  M&A report by Bain & Company, investment in insurtech has grown from US$4.9 billion in 2018 to US$8.4 billion in 2020, amounting to an increase of 70%. Between 2020 and 2021, the amount of investment doubled to US$17.3 billion.   In this digital era, many traditional insurance companies are trying to create a smoother insurance application and claim experience through innovative technologies. By leveraging data analysis, the Internet of Things (IoT), deep learning trained artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies, they seek to improve overall operational efficiency and provide customers with products at more competitive prices.    Bowtie uses technology to reshape the new insurance landscape      As the first  virtual insurance company in Hong Kong, Bowtie is determined to transform the traditional insurance sales method, providing zero-intermediary, commission-free pure online insurance, and offering customers truly stress-free and unfettered protection. In addition, Bowtie’s insurance products and premium information are completely transparent. Customers do not need to leave any personal identity or credit card information. Instead, they can get a basic quote instantly and conveniently by selecting their age, gender and indicate whether they are a smoker or non-smoker.   For traditional insurance companies, underwriting may take 3 weeks or more to complete. Bowtie’s own original intelligent underwriting system can flexibly respond to each applicant’s individual situation and automatically adjust the underwriting content. The process does not require a physical examination, and the questions are mainly multiple-choice, meaning a much shorter processing time. Customers can complete the insurance application in just 4 minutes and acquire the underwriting result within 5 days.   Bowtie also understands that the types of policy and coverage that each person needs are different. “Here to help, no hard sell” is one of Bowtie’s commitments to their customers. Standing by the belief that “what is best is just right”, Bowtie focuses on providing customers with personalized insurance advice and helps every applicant choose the insurance products that meet their actual personal needs, rendering the insurance application process less complex.    Accumulating over 10,000 VHIS customers in just three years since establishment      Bowtie firmly believes that the original purpose of insurance is to protect what matters in life. For this reason, the company actively uses technology to reduce costs and provides truly personalised “pure protection” insurance products, so that the public can get better protection at a lower price.   In order to continuously optimise the existing operating model of the insurance industry, Bowtie redesigned a new insurance company from scratch. In addition to recruiting talents from local and Silicon Valley start-ups, the company also recruited many elites in the insurance industry, including former C-level executives from the top ten insurance companies. Bowtie’s team use their expertise to make a positive impact on society and are determined to lead the industry into the era of pure online insurance.   In May 2022, Bowtie, which had then been established for only 3 years, achieved a record of more than 10,000  VHIS customers and a total insured amount of over HK$40 billion, providing coverage for more than 60,000 Hong Kong people in total. The online insurance market size has also been multiplying, showing no signs of slowing down or regressing.   At present, Bowtie not only provides  VHIS Standard and  VHIS Flexi but also  high-end medical,  life insurance,  critical illness insurance,  accidental insurance,  cancer insurance,  group medical and other zero-commission insurance plans, making real protection just within your reach. The monthly premium is as low as HK$100. Customers who have successfully applied online for specified products may also enjoy  outpatient services, premium reduction or  BowtieCash.

The congressman shared the letter with the high-end tabloid, The Daily Beast.The letter was written on behalf of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. and started out by saying, “I am writing to express serious concern …”It continued by saying its “one-China principle” was a part of the international order and Taiwan belonged to China. “China will not allow Taiwan to be divided from it in whatever form.”The letter implied that members of congress were questioning the “one-China” principle and were the “root cause” behind developing Taiwan Strait tensions. “The tension across the Taiwan Strait is escalating, and the prospects of peace across the Taiwan Strait are seriously threatened, of which the root cause is that the one-China principle has been severely undermined,” the letter added.In response, Auchincloss was reported as saying, “They’re angry. I don’t care.“We’re going to stand with freedom and democracy wherever it is in the world, in Ukraine, in Taiwan, and on the streets of Tehran,” said Auchincloss, who is a member of the Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). “We can’t flinch just because the CCP is angry.”",2023/02/28,1793,Politics

Temple authorities contacted local police, who began an investigation to help recover the antique, which had been the centerpiece of the temple.The Weiyang Temple dates back to the Qianlong Period of the Qing Dynasty, a period where arts and craft flourished around 200 years ago. The temple was renovated and expanded in 1923, and underwent many reconstructions to better preserve a number of prized antiques.A researcher of history and literature, surnamed Kuo (郭), a few days ago, discovered a post on social media that resembled the altar owned by the temple. After comparing photos taken by visiting tour groups, he noticed the original altar was still in place in 2019, but it suddenly changed in 2020.Altar recovered after being swapped out by a criminal group. (CNA photo)After further investigation, his suspicions were confirmed. The temple suspected a criminal group may have been working behind the scenes to execute the swap. There was a fear that other Penghu temples might have been similarly duped.After receiving the report, Baisha Police Precinct took up the case and began to identify suspects. Due to the large size of the altar table, and the complexity of producing a replica, police suspected a large criminal group was involved.The police investigation found that the original dragon altar had been moved to Kaohsiung's Cianjin District. Baisha Police Precinct Chief Lu Wenting (呂文廷) is confident the case will be solved and that all criminal parties involved will be apprehended.The case has highlighted wider ranging concerns that ancient cultural relics could easily be looted as few temples use surveillance cameras and employ minimal security.",2023/02/28,1411,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823516,"Allianz: Expected rise in strikes, riots and protests to test business resilience","Businesses are increasingly witnessing the impact of protest movements and civil unrest on their operations, a trend that is forecast to grow         A new report by AGCS identifies five factors likely to power ongoing incidences of political violence activity around the world         Strikes, riots, and civil commotion racked up $12bn of losses for businesses and institutions from just six major incidents in recent years         Businesses should view the current climate as a catalyst for evaluating best practices and policies around preparing office locations and employees for the impact of potential civil unrest.      MUNICH, GERMANY -  Media OutReach - 28 February 2023 - Anger over growing social inequality and the cost-of-living, foundering faith in governments and institutions and increasingly polarized politics, together with a rise in activism and environmental concerns, are the main factors expected to fuel ongoing incidences of strikes, riots and civil commotion (SRCC) around the world, according to a new  report from insurer  Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS). The heightened SRCC risk environment means businesses need to remain vigilant about the different threats such activity can pose. In addition to buildings or assets suffering costly material damage, operations can be severely disrupted, resulting in significant loss of income.   ""Incidences of strikes, riots and civil commotion have not only increased in recent years, they are also becoming more intense and catastrophic. These types of events are making our era one of uncertainty,"" says  Srdjan Todorovic, Head of Political Violence and Hostile Environment Solutions at AGCS. ""We have seen multibillion-dollar loss events in the US, Chile, and Colombia. The threat is changing, and although many of the reasons for it are universal – whether economic, political, or environmental – it can play out differently in different regions, with various levels of violence and disruption. Operational and security management within organizations should view the current climate as a catalyst for evaluating best practices and policies around preparing locations and employees for potential civil unrest and building resilience.""   Civil unrest risks rose in over 50% of countries between Q2 and Q3 2022 alone, according to the Verisk Maplecroft  Civil Unrest Index - out of 198 countries, 101 saw an increase in risk. Since 2017, more than  400 significant anti-government protests have erupted worldwide. It is unsurprising then that 'political risks and violence' ranks as a top 10 peril in the  Allianz Risk Barometer in 2023. While the Ukraine war is a major factor in this ranking, the results also show that the impact of SRCC activity ranks as a  political violence risk of top concern with a combined score of almost 70%. Unrest is now spreading more quickly and widely thanks in part to the galvanizing effect of social media. This means multiple locations can be impacted, potentially resulting in multiple losses for companies. Such events are also lasting for longer - almost a quarter of the 400 significant anti-governments protests since 2017 were in excess of three months – helping to ensure financial costs are mounting. Reported damages from just six civil unrest events around the world between 2018 and 2023 resulted in at least  $12bn in economic/insured losses.   Five risk drivers of civil unrest  In the report AGCS' political violence team highlight the five main factors they expect to power further SRCC activity in 2023 and beyond:   The ongoing cost-of-living crisis: Although inflation is now thought to have peaked in many countries the after-effects continue to take their toll. Just over half of protests globally in 2022 were  triggered by economic issues, and public confidence in the financial future is shaky. Half the countries surveyed in the  2023 Edelman Trust Barometer showed a year-over-year double-digit decline in the belief that their families will be better off in five years' time. Further protest activity is likely and although mostly peaceful, it can turn violent.   Distrust of governments and institutions: Governments thought to be corrupt or perceived to have been in power for too long can bring people out onto the streets. Economic grievances about food, fuel, pay, or pensions can expand from issues-led demonstrations to wider anti-government movements. In 2022 and early 2023 protests ignited over the rights of women and minorities in Iran, fuel prices in Kazakhstan, economic failures in Sri Lanka, abortion rights in the US, and Covid restrictions in China. Europe continues to be hit by multiple strikes over pay and working conditions. Political instability in Peru, Brazil and Argentina has also resulted in widespread and violent protest.   Increasing polarization: Political divisions are stoking tensions around the world undermining social cohesion and escalating conflict. Polarized opinions can become particularly entrenched on social media and in some countries such polarization is turning violent. Recent years have seen a big shift to the left and the right in many countries with few liberal democracies maintaining a sense of balance where political parties compete for the center ground.   A rise in activism: In recent years, movements that have been significantly galvanized by social media include the ­global Occupy movement against economic inequality, the Black Lives Matter protests highlighting racial inequality, the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and harassment, and the Stop the Steal campaign, which falsely claimed electoral fraud in the election of US president Joe Biden.   ""Where politics are polarized, people can feel a greater sense that their personal values are under attack and will take to the streets to defend them,"" says Todorovic. ""Riots can erupt as a result around a single flashpoint, such as a heavy-handed response by authorities that is deemed unjust."" These can then escalate across a wider area, with larger numbers of people involved, to become civil commotion. If this spills over into violence and opportunism, businesses can be vulnerable to property damage and looting.   Climate and environmental concerns: Where governments are seen to row back on climate-change progress, such as fracking or reopening coalmines as a solution to reliance on Russian gas, there could be unrest. Businesses that are deemed to profit excessively from fossil fuels while many people struggle could also be targeted. ""Environmental protestors made colorful headlines in 2022 – such as activists pouring soup on a Van Gogh painting or gluing themselves to roads – and will continue to do so in 2023,"" says  Etienne Cheret, a Regional Practice Group Leader, Crisis Management at AGCS. ""Climate change demonstrations tend not to be violent, but they can be disruptive, particularly if they affect transport infrastructure. We expect this kind of activity to continue, if not escalate, in the coming year.""   Implement, test and update continuity plans  Incidences of civil unrest can be difficult to predict because they often start with a specific trigger such as a change in government, a piece of new legislation or a sudden price rise. However, there are many things businesses can do to minimize disruption. Allianz Risk Consulting has developed  a list of technical recommendations for companies, such as implementing, and then regularly testing and updating, a business continuity plan. Specialist insurance can help protect companies against damage resulting from political violence, as well as any interruption to the business. Policies can cover civil war, SRCC, terrorism and war.

(Key populations are communities at higher risk of HIV infection including gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who use drugs, sex workers, transgender people and people in prisons and other closed settings.) The 2023 theme, ""Save lives: Decriminalise"", points to the positive impact on health and life outcomes when discriminatory and punitive laws are removed.         Community worker providing counseling on the use of condoms and lubricant for harm reduction in Dien Bien province, Viet Nam on 24 October 2022 Credit: VAAC (Vietnam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control)/UNAIDS/LHSS (Local Health System Sustainability Project)       ""Criminal laws targeting key populations and people living with HIV violate human rights, deepen the stigma people face and put them in danger by creating barriers to the support and services they need,"" said UNAIDS Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Eamonn Murphy. ""Decriminalisation is an essential step toward building a supportive legal and policy environment that addresses the social determinants of health.""       UNAIDS is    sharing the stories of people in Asia and the Pacific who have experienced reduced access to healthcare, justice and other human rights due to criminal laws and the prejudice they perpetuate.       ""The war on drugs has created a lot of stigma and a culture that views people who use drugs as criminals. When we access healthcare, we get treated as bad people. Many choose not to go even if they know they are unwell or at-risk,"" said Tedjo, a paralegal and past drug-user.       Ikka explained that during her former life as a sex worker she and her colleagues never reported customers who physically or sexually assaulted them or did not pay. She said: ""If someone called the police, they would arrest the sex worker and not the client. The police wouldn't take your report. They think they have more important cases than you.""        In 2021, the world set ambitious targets to remove criminal laws that are undermining the AIDS response through the    political declaration on HIV and AIDS. UN member states made a commitment that by 2025 less than 10% of countries would have punitive legal and policy environments that affect the HIV response. Despite some promising reforms, the world and region are far from achieving this target.      The Asia Pacific situation      ""States have a moral and legal obligation to remove discriminatory laws and enact laws that protect people from discrimination,"" said Harry Prabowo, Programme Manager of the Asia Pacific Network of People living with HIV and AIDS (APN+). ""The meaningful engagement of people living with HIV and key populations is critical to ensure countries develop effective laws that do not have negative, unintended consequences.""       Analysis by UNAIDS and UNDP reveals that just ten of 38 countries in the Asia Pacific region explicitly prohibit discrimination against people living with HIV. On the other hand, 17 countries have either HIV-specific penal laws or public health laws which criminalise HIV transmission, exposure or non-disclosure. Five countries retain formal HIV-related travel and migration restrictions while 12 have mandatory HIV test requirements relating to entry, stay and residence. Legislation, policies and practices that further stigmatise people living with HIV are not in the interest of public health.        Fourteen countries in the region retain corporal or capital punishment penalties for drug possession. There are compulsory centres or similar systems for people who use drugs in 21 nations. In 2012 and 2020 United Nations agencies called for the permanent closure of compulsory facilities for people who use drugs citing lack of due process, forced labour, inadequate nutrition, and denial or limited access to healthcare. Progress to end compulsory treatment for people who use drugs in East and Southeast Asia has largely stalled according to a    2022 report. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and UNAIDS are supporting countries to transition to evidence-informed and human-rights based services.        Eighteen Asian and Pacific countries either fully or partially criminalise consenting sex between adult men. Gay men and other men who have sex with men living in countries with severe criminalisation are almost five times as likely to be infected with HIV as those living in countries without such criminal penalties.        Except for New Zealand, all countries in the region criminalise some aspect of sex work. In countries where sex work is heavily criminalised, sex workers are seven times more likely to be living with HIV than peers in countries where it is wholly or partially legalised.        Six countries in the Asia Pacific region—Cambodia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Thailand—have joined the    Global Partnership for Action to Eliminate all Forms of HIV-related Stigma and Discrimination. This is a partnership that harnesses the combined power of governments, civil society, donors, academia and the United Nations to catalyse action to end stigma and discrimination, including in legal and justice systems.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823535,Taiwan's economic freedom among best in world,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — In the 2023 Index of Economic Freedom, Taiwan is ranked fourth best in the world, its top result since records began in 1995.The nation's overall economic freedom score of 80.7 put it in second place out of 39 economies in the Asia-Pacific region, just behind Singapore, which was in first place globally with a score of 83.9. Switzerland and Ireland were second and third, respectively.However, overall, the Asia-Pacific’s score was 58.2, which was just below the world average of 59.3 and “the lowest it has been over the past two decades,” according to Washington-based The Heritage Foundation. The index covers 12 financial freedoms, including property rights, in 184 countries.The U.S. was 25th and Japan 28, while China was in 154th position and described as “repressed.” Bottom of the pile was North Korea at 176. Countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine were not ranked.Taiwan’s economy was rated “free” by the index. Its citation read:“A strong commitment to the rule of law and openness to global commerce have enabled it to become a global leader in economic freedom. The dynamic economy has benefitted from a well-developed institutional framework, a tradition of private-sector entrepreneurial dynamism, and open-market policies that facilitate the free flow of goods and capital.”The Heritage Foundation said foreign investment was welcome in Taiwan and the financial sector continued to evolve. It said the regulatory sector was efficient and “business freedom is well protected.” The rule of law was praised and taxation was reasonable.However, it was also made clear in the report, “China’s ongoing attempts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically hinder its economic growth and threaten its presence in overseas markets.“Taiwan’s trade-dependent economy is driven by a competitive manufacturing sector that encompasses electronics, machinery, petrochemicals, and information and communications technology products.”",2023/02/28,1778,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823537,Reuters reporters' online accounts faked to approach China activists,"Two Reuters journalists had their identities faked by an unknown person or people who then used sham social media accounts to engage with Chinese activists on several online platforms over several months.

            The false representations of the two journalists, Shanghai bureau chief Brenda Goh and Hong Kong-based correspondent Jessie Pang, starting in late November, appeared on platforms including Instagram and the Telegram message app.

            The impersonator or impersonators were seeking information about a group linked to protests the same month against China's strict COVID-19 controls, according to screenshots and several accounts provided to Reuters.

            An Australia-based Chinese activist and dissident artist known as Badiucao first disclosed the impersonations on Saturday on Twitter.











            A fake account was set up on Instagram and one on Telegram purporting to be Pang, according to screengrabs from Badiucao seen by Reuters. Another activist told Reuters he had conversed with a fake persona of Goh via Telegram for three months.

            Badiucao tweeted that he had been approached on Telegram by someone purporting to be Pang, asking for information on a Chinese-language online platform called Citizens Daily that carries protest art.

            ""Hello everyone,"" an imposter wrote in a Telegram chatroom, according to screenshots seen by Reuters that were provided by Badiucao. ""I am Jessie with Reuters."" The imposter then asked two members of the group: ""Do you two have any ties to Citizens Daily?""

            The imposter sought to gain the group's trust by giving details of Pang's background and recent work, Badiucao said.

            Badiucao said he became suspicious at the language and questions posed by the imposter, however, and asked to verify the person's identity through Pang's verified Twitter account.

            The imposter said he or she had no control over the Twitter account, as it was ""run by a team at Reuters"", a screenshot of the conversation provided by Badiucao showed.

            The person then sent Badiucao, a political cartoonist prominent among protesters, a photo of Pang's press ID, which had expired.

            Reuters could not ascertain who was behind the fake journalist personas. After the fakes were exposed, all their known accounts and conversations were deleted. None of Goh's or Pang's official social media accounts appeared to have been hacked.

            A Reuters spokesperson said: ""We are looking into the impersonation and theft of press credentials of Reuters journalists and will take appropriate action.""

            A spokesperson for Instagram owner Meta Platforms Inc META.O said the platform had taken down the imposter’s account, declining to comment further. Telegram did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the impersonations of the journalists' accounts on that platform.

            A spokesman for Hong Kong's Security Bureau said: ""Members of the public are encouraged to report to the Police if there is any suspected crime. The Police will take appropriate actions on reports of crime accordingly.""

            An administrator at Citizens Daily, responding to a request for comment, said the group suspected Chinese state involvement in the impersonations. The administrator declined to give their name, citing the risk of reprisals, and did not offer any evidence to support this assertion.

            China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Public Security Bureau did not respond to requests for comment on Citizens Daily's claim or on the impersonation of the journalists.

            Citizens Daily had been a conduit for sharing information among protesters during the November demonstrations in multiple Chinese cities against Beijing's zero-COVID policy, with some calling for President Xi Jinping to step down and an end to Communist Party rule.

            The civil disobedience was unprecedented in mainland China since Xi assumed power a decade ago, sparking a wave of arrests and a broad security clampdown.

            An activist with the Twitter handle ""accelflopping"" told Reuters that an imposter purporting to be Goh contacted him via Telegram. To gain his trust, the person showed a picture of Goh's press card and provided other personal details, including Goh's nationality.

            This activist, who is based overseas, said he only learned of the subterfuge from Badiucao on Saturday after having communicated with the ""fake Brenda"" since late November about his group's plans for future protests. They spoke via Telegram text message, apart from one short phone call, he said.

            He declined to disclose his name, citing sensitivities.

            A person with the Twitter handle ""775lighting"" tweeted about also having been approached several times since Feb. 4 by a ""fake Jessie"" Pang, who sought to ""steal sensitive details"" about their protest activities.

            Reuters could not reach this person for comment.



            (Reporting by James Pomfret; Editing by William Mallard)Two Reuters journalists had their identities faked by an unknown person or people who then used sham social media accounts to engage with Chinese activists on several online platforms over several months.The false representations of the two journalists, Shanghai bureau chief Brenda Goh and Hong Kong-based correspondent Jessie Pang, starting in late November, appeared on platforms including Instagram and the Telegram message app.The impersonator or impersonators were seeking information about a group linked to protests the same month against China's strict COVID-19 controls, according to screenshots and several accounts provided to Reuters.An Australia-based Chinese activist and dissident artist known as Badiucao first disclosed the impersonations on Saturday on Twitter.A fake account was set up on Instagram and one on Telegram purporting to be Pang, according to screengrabs from Badiucao seen by Reuters. Another activist told Reuters he had conversed with a fake persona of Goh via Telegram for three months.Badiucao tweeted that he had been approached on Telegram by someone purporting to be Pang, asking for information on a Chinese-language online platform called Citizens Daily that carries protest art.""Hello everyone,"" an imposter wrote in a Telegram chatroom, according to screenshots seen by Reuters that were provided by Badiucao. ""I am Jessie with Reuters."" The imposter then asked two members of the group: ""Do you two have any ties to Citizens Daily?""The imposter sought to gain the group's trust by giving details of Pang's background and recent work, Badiucao said.Badiucao said he became suspicious at the language and questions posed by the imposter, however, and asked to verify the person's identity through Pang's verified Twitter account.The imposter said he or she had no control over the Twitter account, as it was ""run by a team at Reuters"", a screenshot of the conversation provided by Badiucao showed.The person then sent Badiucao, a political cartoonist prominent among protesters, a photo of Pang's press ID, which had expired.Reuters could not ascertain who was behind the fake journalist personas. After the fakes were exposed, all their known accounts and conversations were deleted. None of Goh's or Pang's official social media accounts appeared to have been hacked.A Reuters spokesperson said: ""We are looking into the impersonation and theft of press credentials of Reuters journalists and will take appropriate action.""A spokesperson for Instagram owner Meta Platforms Inc META.O said the platform had taken down the imposter’s account, declining to comment further. Telegram did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the impersonations of the journalists' accounts on that platform.A spokesman for Hong Kong's Security Bureau said: ""Members of the public are encouraged to report to the Police if there is any suspected crime. The Police will take appropriate actions on reports of crime accordingly.""An administrator at Citizens Daily, responding to a request for comment, said the group suspected Chinese state involvement in the impersonations. The administrator declined to give their name, citing the risk of reprisals, and did not offer any evidence to support this assertion.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Public Security Bureau did not respond to requests for comment on Citizens Daily's claim or on the impersonation of the journalists.Citizens Daily had been a conduit for sharing information among protesters during the November demonstrations in multiple Chinese cities against Beijing's zero-COVID policy, with some calling for President Xi Jinping to step down and an end to Communist Party rule.The civil disobedience was unprecedented in mainland China since Xi assumed power a decade ago, sparking a wave of arrests and a broad security clampdown.An activist with the Twitter handle ""accelflopping"" told Reuters that an imposter purporting to be Goh contacted him via Telegram.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Request Sample Data To Learn More About This Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352548In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global SaaS Software Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

China maintains it is protecting its historic territory.""For the Philippines, it allows us an alternative partner to counter China aside from U.S.,"" Rommel Jude Ong, former vice commander of the Philippine navy, said of the prospect of patrols.""Whether we like it or not, we need to calibrate our activities with the U.S. also to make sure we do not get drawn to issues that solely reside between the U.S. and China.""Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles last week said Australia wanted to expand its bilateral defence relationship with the Philippines and joint patrols were ""the next step"".Japan, Australia and the United States are among dozens of countries that recognise a landmark arbitration case in 2016 won by the Philippines that invalidated China's expansive territorial claim.Beijing does not recognise the ruling. It says it respects freedom of navigation but opposes actions that undermine what it considers its sovereignty.'EXTREMELY PLEASED'With some overlapping maritime claims, the Philippines has been ramping up rhetoric to challenge what it calls illegal Chinese activities in its exclusive economic zone.It has made 77 complaints to China since Marcos took office in June last year. This month, he summoned the Chinese ambassador, concerned about ""aggressive"" Chinese maritime actions.""Washington is extremely pleased that the Philippines is taking a stronger stand in its territorial rights,"" added ambassador Romualdez, who is relative of Marcos.The move is a stark departure from predecessor Duterte's open disdain for the United States and efforts to appease China. Duterte was widely criticised for being reluctant to press China to abide by the arbitration ruling, concerned it could hurt investment.Marcos on Monday described the South China Sea issue as ""the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world"".""There was a time where we did not have to worry about these threats and the intensification of the competition between the superpowers,"" he said in a speech to soldiers.Early this month, Marcos granted the United States greater access to Philippine military bases by adding four more sites, on top of five existing locations, under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, an agreement predecessor Duterte had threatened to scrap.EDCA allows U.S. access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but not a permanent presence.Romualdez, who was also ambassador under Duterte, said recent developments showed ""the relationship between the United States and the Philippines today is definitely at its best"".(Additional reporting by Kirsty Needham in Sydney; Editing by Martin Petty and Nick Macfie)",2023/02/28,385,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823614,White House sets deadline for purging TikTok from federal devices,"The White House on Monday gave government agencies 30 days to ensure they do not have Chinese-owned app TikTok on federal devices and systems.In a bid to keep U.S. data safe, all federal agencies must eliminate TikTok from phones and systems and prohibit internet traffic from reaching the company, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young told agencies in a guidance memorandum seen by Reuters.The ban, ordered by Congress late last year, follows similar actions from Canada, the EU, Taiwan and more than half of U.S. states.The device ban — while impacting a tiny portion of TikTok's U.S. user base — adds fuel to calls for an outright ban on the video-sharing app. National security concerns about China surged in recent weeks after a Chinese balloon drifted over the U.S.ByteDance-owned TikTok has said the concerns are fueled by misinformation and has denied using the app to spy on Americans. The action does not affect the more than 100 million Americans who use TikTok on private or company-owned devices. TikTok did not immediately comment on the White House memo.Congress in December voted to bar federal employees from using the Chinese-owned video app on government-owned devices and gave the Biden administration 60 days to issue agency directives. The vote was the latest action by U.S. lawmakers to crack down on Chinese companies amid national security fears that Beijing could use them to spy on Americans.Federal Chief Information Security Officer Chris DeRusha said ""this guidance is part of the Administration’s ongoing commitment to securing our digital infrastructure and protecting the American people’s security and privacy.""Many government agencies including the White House, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department had banned TikTok from government devices before the vote.The TikTok ban does not apply if there are national security, law enforcement or security research activities but agency leadership must approve these activities, Young's memo said and ""blanket exceptions applying to an entire agency are not permitted.""On Tuesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee is set to vote on a bill that would give President Joe Biden the authority to ban TikTok from all U.S. devices.""My bill empowers the administration to ban TikTok or any software applications that threaten U.S. national security,"" Representative Mike McCaul, the committee chair, said. ""Anyone with TikTok downloaded on their device has given the (Chinese Communist Party) a backdoor to all their personal information. It’s a spy balloon into your their phone.""The American Civil Liberties Union said it opposed a congressional ban on TikTok.The White House memo said within 90 days, agencies must address any use of TikTok by IT vendors through contracts and with 120 days agencies will include a new prohibition on TikTok in all new solicitations.Earlier on Monday, Canada announced a ban on TikTok from government-issued devices, saying it presents an ""unacceptable"" level of risk to privacy and security, adding to the growing rift between the two countries.The Canadian ban was issued ""without citing any specific security concern or contacting us with questions,"" a TikTok spokesperson said.The European Union's two biggest policy-making institutions last week banned TikTok from staff phones for cybersecurity reasons.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chris Sanders and Lisa Shumaker)",2023/02/28,244,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823615,"China must be 'more honest' on COVID origins, envoy says","China must be more honest about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. ambassador to China said on Monday, after reports that the U.S. Energy Department concluded the pandemic likely arose from a Chinese laboratory leak.Nicholas Burns, speaking by video link at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, said it was necessary to push China to take a more active role in the World Health Organization (WHO) if the U.N. health agency was to be strengthened.China also needed to ""be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the COVID-19 crisis,"" Burns said, referring to the central Chinese city where the first human cases were reported in December 2019.The Wall Street Journal first reported on Sunday that the U.S. Energy Department had concluded the pandemic likely arose from a Chinese laboratory leak, an assessment Beijing denies.The department made its judgment with ""low confidence"" in a classified intelligence report recently provided to the White House and key members of Congress, the Journal said, citing people who had read the intelligence report.Four other U.S. agencies, along with a national intelligence panel, still judge that COVID-19 was likely the result of natural transmission, while two are undecided, the Journal reported.The Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment.President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday there were a ""variety of views in the intelligence community"" on the pandemic's origins.""A number of them have said they just don't have enough information,"" Sullivan told CNN.Asked to comment on the report, which was confirmed by other U.S. media, China's foreign ministry referred to a WHO-China report that pointed toward a natural origin for the pandemic, likely from bats, rather than a lab leak.""Certain parties should stop rehashing the 'lab leak' narrative, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the origins-tracing issue,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.'A LITTLE BIT ORWELLIAN'Burns told the Chamber event that it was a difficult moment for U.S.-China relations, with Beijing seeking to deflect blame after the U.S. military this month downed an alleged Chinese spy balloon that drifted across the continental United States.""We're now in this surreal moment where the Chinese, who I think lost the debate over the balloon globally, lost influence and credibility around the world because of what they've done - they're now blaming this on us,"" Burns said.""It's a little bit Orwellian. And it's a little bit frustrating, because I think everybody knows the truth here.""China reacted angrily when the U.S. military downed the balloon on Feb. 4, saying it was for monitoring weather conditions and had blown off course.Burns added that it was the obligation of the United States to maintain its military strength ""in and around Taiwan"" to ensure the self-governed island claimed by Beijing has the ability to deter any kind of ""offensive action"" by China.""It's also ... our responsibility to galvanize the rest of the world to make sure that the Chinese cannot get away with coercion or intimidation against Taiwan itself,"" he said.(Reporting by Michael Martina and David Brunnstrom in Washington and the Beijing newsroom; Editing by Don Durfee and Alistair Bell)",2023/02/28,292,World

Report Ocean predicts that the global Service Order Software market size will reach million $in 2028 with a CAGR of % from 2022-2028.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Request Sample Data To Learn More About This Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis352542In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Retail Banking Software Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.
