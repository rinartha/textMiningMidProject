https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837699,Woman in southern Taiwan dies after being stabbed by ex-boyfriend,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A 51-year-old woman surnamed Hsia (夏) was fatally stabbed by her ex-boyfriend, a 55-year-old man surnamed Chiu (邱), on Thursday (March 16).The attack happened at Jinshihu Market in Kaohsiung at around 9:00 a.m., after Hsia angrily approached Chiu, who worked as a fishmonger at the market. The two reportedly began dating in 2022 and had recently separated but were still in contact.A report from LTN says Hsia applied for a restraining order against Chiu, citing acts of violence and domestic abuse. Hsia and Chiu, both unmarried, only dated for half a year.Chiu reportedly sent LINE messages to Hsia the evening before the attack, but she did not respond. Instead, Hsia chose to directly confront Chiu at the market Thursday morning to discuss ending their relationship.While the two were arguing, Chiu used one of the knives at his market stall to stab Hsia in her side. She immediately tried to flee from Chiu but was pursued by the man for about 300 meters.Chiu was detained by officers who were in the area and witnessed Chiu pursuing the injured woman. Hsia collapsed in the street nearby and was rushed to a hospital, but she was later pronounced dead from her wounds at around 11:00 a.m.An acquaintance of Chiu told officers that he was angry with Hsia because of a dispute over money, and he suspected that she had begun dating another person.The Social Affairs Bureau of Kaohsiung City urged people not to directly confront others when either party is angry, reported LTN. When two people experience an acrimonious breakup, it is best to end contact completely to avoid worsening the situation.",2023/3/16,9328,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837732,Man given life in prison for 2019 killing of Gdansk mayor,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The man who fatally stabbed Gdansk Mayor Paweł Adamowicz in 2019 was sentenced to life in prison by a Polish court on Thursday.Stefan Wilmont stabbed the 53-year-old Adamowicz on stage during a life charity event on Jan. 13, 2019. Adamowicz died from his wounds the next day despite a blood transfusion and other efforts by doctors to save him. The killing shocked Poles and plunged the nation into grief.Judge Aleksandra Kaczmarek said in her ruling that Wilmont had committed an “unprecedented murder” in Poland’s history, but didn't say it was a political crime, despite Wilmont's criticism of the party that Adamowicz belonged to, which is now in the opposition.Kaczmarek stressed that Wilmont's crime was “terrifying” as he had planned it in a way for the public to see and later showed no remorse during the trial.The sentencing came after a three-year long investigation and a year-long trial and was in line with the prosecution's motion. Wilmont’s lawyers said they would appeal the sentence.Adamowicz's brother, lawmaker Piotr Adamowicz, said the verdict closed one stage in the case, but that an appeal trial could be expected later this year.“No one can give my brother his life back,” Adamowicz said.The situation is not “not easy” for the family who went through a “huge tragedy in 2019” that is brought back to them at every court session.The conservative ruling Law and Justice party has faced accusations that a hostile atmosphere created against Adamowicz and other socially liberal politicians spread by state media created fertile ground for the violence against him.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837733,"Don't leave Global South out of green tech growth, UN warns","The majority of developing nations are set to miss out on the economic benefits of booming green technologies, slowing progress toward their climate goals and widening the inequality gap between rich and poor countries, a United Nations report warned Thursday.The U.N.'s agency for trade and development, or UNCTAD, said that unless the international community and national governments actively tend to green tech industries in developing countries, the benefits associated with lower-emission technologies will be near inaccessible for many poorer nations particularly in Latin America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa.“We are at the beginning of a technological revolution based on green technologies,” said UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan. “Developing countries must capture more of the value being created in this technological revolution to grow their economies.”Electric vehicles, solar and wind energy and green hydrogen are projected to reach a market value of $2.1 trillion by 2030, four times higher than they’re worth today. The industries are set to explode as nations try and limit their planet-warming emissions to try and curb warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).Countries like Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam were part of a few countries singled out in the report as emerging nations with policies that will enable them to develop some of their green technology sectors for the future. It also pointed to Brazil's bioethanol industry and Chile's green hydrogen potential as examples of successful clean energy industry takeoffs.The report outlines more than a dozen technologies, including gene editing, blockchain, nanotechnologies and renewable power that are currently being used or developed mostly by industrialized nations. The body has made an urgent appeal to reform existing global trade and intellectual property transfer rules to allow developing countries to harness their own green industries and also be able to access technologies developed in richer states.“Developing countries need agency and urgency in coming up with the right policy responses” to help the growth of green technology in their own nations, said Shamika Sirimanne, UNCTAD's director of technology. Sirimanne urged developing nations to adopt innovation and energy policies that would propel their clean energy and technology industries.The report found that total exports of green technologies from the industrialized north almost tripled from $60 billion in 2018 to over $156 billion in 2021. In comparison, Global South exports rose from $57 billion to $75 billion in the same time period.High income nations like the United States, Sweden, Singapore and Switzerland dominated the report's ranking of countries ready for the massive boom in the industry and are primed to benefit the most from spiking investments in green technology.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

The building belonged to the regional border patrol section of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, the media reports said.Footage posted on social media appeared to show fire engulfing parts of the building, with plumes of thick smoke rising over the city. Regional Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837735,MLB umpires will have a new view this season -- on Zoom,"NEW YORK (AP) — Umpires will have a new view this season: on Zoom.Major League Baseball struck a deal with Zoom Video Communications Inc. allowing on-field umpires to watch videos being evaluated by the replay operations center during contested calls.MLB first adopted instant replay in September 2008 for home boundary calls and expanded it to a wide variety of decisions for the 2014 season. There were 1,434 video reviews last season that included 1,261 team challenges with 50.2% leading to overturned calls.Until now, the on-field crew chief listened to the replay umpire in New York with audio only, joined by the umpire who made the initial call if different from the crew chief. The umps walked over to the side of the field through 2013 to listen on a headset, then from 2014-21 an attendant brought out a headset to the field for them. Last year, umps switched to a wireless belt pack and MLB for the first time allowed then to announce replays and decisions over ballpark public address systems.On-field umps this year will have 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablets brought out to them by a technician. They will be connected to the Zoom contact center and the replay operations center so they can see what replay is being viewed. The replay umpire still gets the final call.""You’ll be able to see who’s in the chair, who might be with that person, what plays they’re looking at, and be able to pair a visual interaction with the traditional audio interaction that they have discussing the call in the field,” MLB Chief Operations and Strategy Officer Chris Marinak said.A limited number of broadcasts will have access to the Zoom videos being seen by the umps: Apple TV+ and MLB Network Showcase telecasts. Marinak said the new technology could become available for postseason telecasts, and ballpark videoboards will have access to the Zoom views on the telecasts — which will have the company's branding.Zoom also will be used by MLB during the first day of the amateur draft in Seattle on July 9. It’s too early to determine whether Zoom can be incorporated into robot plate umpires, the automated ball-strike system being tested throughout Triple-A this season.“That whole ecosystem is open for innovation and experimentation,” Marinak said. “We’re absolutely going to try things out and see what sticks. For ABS, I think it’s too early to say that we’re settled on one particular process and technology in the long-run. We’re still I think doing a lot of experimentation and open to really anything as we try things out at the minor league level.”Zoom, launched in 2011, was increasingly used by MLB teams during the pandemic. For much of 2021 and ’22, Zoom replaced in-person media availabilities for players and managers.“They’ve been a customer for many years utilizing our meetings, our rooms our phone technology and then deeper integrations as we know over the past few years, the way in which people have leveraged video has really evolved,” said Janine Pelosi, Zoom’s chief marketing officer. “What I think it’s going to do is add that technology where it’s not getting in the way of the game. I think that that’s critical. And it’s going to bring the fans into the experience.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837736,Dortmund needs quick recovery to keep Bundesliga exciting,"BERLIN (AP) — After hitting its first bumps of 2023, Borussia Dortmund needs to recover quickly to keep the Bundesliga title race exciting before facing Bayern Munich.Schalke ended Dortmund’s perfect league record since the turn of the year with a 2-2 draw on Saturday. It came after the club was knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea the previous Tuesday — a 2-0 loss in the second leg that ended Dortmund’s 10-game winning run since the winter break.There’s concern now that tiredness and injuries are taking their toll just when the season enters its decisive phase. Ten matches in the Bundesliga remain. Dortmund next hosts Cologne on Saturday before visiting Bayern for “der Klassiker” on April 1.Worries about the form of forward Sébastien Haller are not helping.Haller had been expected to help fill the gap left by Erling Haaland’s departure for Manchester City, but the Ivory Coast striker has scored only one goal in 12 appearances in all competitions since returning in January after six months out for testicular cancer treatment.“I'm not as forgetful as one or two journalists or the media,” Dortmund coach Edin Terzić said Thursday. “I said at the time in Bad Ragaz (Switzerland), when we found out about this serious illness, that there would be turmoil and dismay in the next days. And that as soon as there was a game, that it would all be forgotten. Then it's all about the No. 9 from Borussia Dortmund.”Terzić said he remembered saying in January before Haller's return that it was the best thing this year that the forward was back with the team.“And I'm sticking to that. It's an unbelievably great feeling to have Sébastien back on the field with us every day,"" Terzić said. “Of course he'd like to have scored 20 goals already, and we'd like it, too — it's no secret. But we know he's taken an extraordinary journey in the last few months. And we will support him with that and his development so he's back to 100% again soon.""Haller will get more practice against Cologne.Dortmund and Bayern were even on points before last weekend, but Bayern has pulled two points ahead thanks to Schalke's favor. The Bavarian powerhouse appears to have weathered its own drop in form and doesn’t look likely to gift Dortmund any more opportunities as it chases a record-extending 11th consecutive league title.Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl blamed a lack of focus and efficiency for the draw at Schalke. Dortmund was clearly the better team but failed to make more of its goal chances, while the home team twice drew level thanks to some uncommitted defending from the visitors.Injuries have played a role, though Terzić should still have had enough quality players to beat Schalke, a team that only recently pulled itself out of last place and has only four wins this season.Germany midfielder Julian Brandt was arguably in the best form of his life before he had to go off injured against Chelsea, and forwards Karim Adeyemi, Youssoufa Moukoko and Marco Reus were all missing for the match against Schalke. Goalkeeper Gregor Kobel is also injured.“We had a completely full (substitutes) bench in the first weeks of January,” Kehl said. “Still the squad was capable of winning today. It’s not a question of quality, also not the players who came in.”Kehl referred to the impact of substitutes after coming on in January and February, when Gio Reyna (twice) and Reus scored late goals to clinch wins.“Today it was probably a case of less influence from the bench,” Kehl said.Reyna has had a limited role this season, making only five starts, but he was still the player with most goals (five) available against Schalke because of the injuries among Dortmund’s forward line.Fortunately for Dortmund, Reus — the team captain — is expected to return on Saturday.Bayern visits Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837742,Kompany back at beloved Man City seeking FA Cup upset,"With his arms outstretched, fists clenched and a focus on his face, Vincent Kompany glistens in statue-form outside Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium.Since 2021, the steel sculpture has served as a permanent reminder of the instrumental role that City’s former captain played in the most decorated era in the club’s history.On Saturday, City fans can catch a view of the real-life Kompany when he returns to the Etihad.He’s not back to cheer on his former team. Instead, he'll be attempting to eliminate it from the FA Cup.Four years after leaving City as one of its greatest ever players — and potentially its most important — Kompany is making his name in soccer coaching and is a manager of increasing repute at second-division club Burnley, which has been drawn to play City in the FA Cup quarterfinals.In his first year at the northwest club that was relegated from the Premier League last season, Kompany has quickly got Burnley — a team formerly known for its direct and pragmatic style of play — playing free-flowing, easy-on-the-eye soccer and to the top of Championship with a 13-point lead.An instant return to the Premier League beckons. Indeed, it’s pretty much a matter of when, not if, Burnley seals promotion.Kompany’s burgeoning coaching status can be elevated even higher, though, if he can mastermind an improbable FA Cup win against City, a club he knows inside out after 11 years there as a player.His wife is from Manchester. So are his children, who are City fans.“The kids will now have a tough decision who to support,” Kompany said with a smile.In the short term, it’s about reaching the semifinals of the FA Cup and, with it, securing a trip to Wembley Stadium.There’s a longer-term narrative at play, though.Given his trajectory in coaching along with his bond and historical importance to City, Kompany is widely regarded as a future manager of the club. Pep Guardiola, the current City manager, even said it himself.“I think his destiny to become manager of Man City is already written in the stars,” Guardiola said a few weeks ago. “It is going to happen. I don’t know when, but it’s going to happen.”Kompany was a pillar behind City’s emergence as a force in English and now European soccer following his signing in 2008, just prior to the club coming under ownership from Abu Dhabi. He was captain of the team for eight years and won four Premier League titles.After leaving City, Kompany returned to his native Belgium and retired after a year playing with Anderlecht, where he then spent two years as coach.It was a bold decision to move to Burnley in the offseason of 2022 because the club had just been relegated and had a style of play and identity so intrinsically linked to its long-time former manager, Sean Dyche, who worked wonders on a small budget in his 9 1/2 years at the helm.In no time at all, Kompany has done away with it and turned Burnley into an enterprising scoring machine. The 3-1 win at Hull on Wednesday took Burnley to 74 goals for the campaign — nine more than any other team in the Championship — and the team also has the best defensive record despite losing England goalkeeper Nick Pope and defenders James Tarkowski, Ben Mee and Nathan Collins in the wake of relegation.After the game against Hull, Kompany spoke of Burnley being at the start of a cycle and having a “three-or-four-year period together.”“Can we continue that and keep improving the club? That’s the aim,” he said.That will be music to the ears of Burnley’s American ownership, the ALK Capital investment group. Kompany certainly seems the real deal, an intelligent man — in 2017, he got a Master’s degree in business administration from Manchester Business School — and a leader with some gravitas.Footage on social media of a locker-room rant at his Anderlecht players last year showed he is not a person to be crossed.He is also loyal, which points to Kompany potentially sticking with Burnley even if bigger clubs come calling.There would be an emotional pull, however, if City ever needed a new manager and it’s hard not to view Saturday’s FA Cup game as something of an audition for Kompany.___Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837744,France looks to sign off with big home win against Wales,"PARIS (AP) — After demolishing England with a performance that made him cry with joy, France coach Fabien Galthié wants his entertainers to finish the Six Nations in style with a home win against Wales on Saturday.Defending champion France even has an outside chance of keeping its title. But it must beat Wales at Stade de France and hope No. 1-ranked Ireland then slips up at home to an England side reeling from last weekend's 53-10 hammering by Les Tricolores.It was England's third heaviest defeat ever, a humiliation made even worse by France’s highest score and largest margin of victory in 110 meetings with its old rival. Four of France's seven tries were by forwards who ran like centers, such was the attacking threat throughout the side.Scrumhalf Antoine Dupont was so good the English crowd briefly forgot the torture being inflicted, standing as one to give him a standing ovation when he came off.“The Twickenham match gave us a lot of satisfaction, we can't hide that,” said Galthié, who couldn't hide his emotions or stop his gleeful tears. “But we also saw some room for improvement. We could have played better with the ball and without the ball, done better in our transitional play.”That strive for perfection typifies Galthié, whose side won every match last year — including against every other side in the top 10 — on its way to a national-record 14-game winning streak.It ended when the indomitable Irish won 32-19 on Feb. 11 to stamp their authority on this tournament.But Galthié does not want to lose any momentum from the England game in what is No. 2-ranked France's last official test before cranking up its bid to win the World Cup for the first time. The three-time runner-up has a mouth-watering opener against three-time champion New Zealand at Stade de France on Sept. 8.Galthié's an astute tactician but he's also pragmatic, and expects 2021 champion Wales to provide a sterner test than some may think.“Two years ago, this Wales side was two minutes away from winning the Grand Slam in our stadium,” Galthié said, referring to France's 32-30 win back then. “Two seasons isn't a long time ago and there are players in that side who won three Grand Slams and five (Six Nations) tournaments.”Wales is not the side it once was, though, and sits in fifth place, but Galthié knows that one thing never changes.“Whatever happens, the Welsh always put their bodies on the line. They give everything, everything, everything,” he said. “For a long time, they tormented the France team.”Wales won 29-17 in Rome last Saturday to confirm the Italians in the wooden spoon position.“Last weekend was really important for us getting a win in the Six Nations and building a bit of confidence,"" Gatland said. “It was a step in the right direction but there’s still lots for us to work on.”Wales has scored the least tries (seven) and conceded the second most with England (14). France and Ireland share the lead with 16 tries each.“France last weekend put in probably one of the best performances seen in a long, long time,"" Gatland said. ""We’ve got to go out there and start well, make sure we’re in that arm wrestle with them and give ourselves that opportunity.”France's wrestling strength was boosted by prop Uini Atonio, who was immediately recalled at the end of a three-week ban for a dangerous tackle against Ireland. The guy Galthié calls the “best scrummer in the world” plays his 50th test.Wales made six changes including returns for former captains Dan Biggar and Alun Wyn Jones, and center George North. No. 8 Taulupe Faletau plays his 100th Welsh test.Gatland said part of his selection thinking was to reward great servants of Wales. He suggested ""up to eight players"" may be making their last Six Nations appearance because he has to start building for the World Cup this year and in 2027.“The message to them who might be playing their last Six Nations game is enjoy the occasion and the moment. For a lot of them, it might be the last time they do that.”___Lineups:France: Thomas Ramos, Damian Penaud, Gael Fickou, Jonathan Danty, Ethan Dumortier, Romain Ntamack, Antoine Dupont (captain); Gregory Alldritt, Charles Ollivon, Francois Cros, Romain Taofifenua, Thibaud Flament, Uini Atonio, Julien Marchand, Cyril Baille.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837745,Injury rules Liverpool player Bajcetic out for the season,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Stefan Bajcetic will miss the rest of the season because of injury, the Liverpool midfielder said Thursday.Bajcetic missed his team's 1-0 loss to Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday because of what was described as a “stress response” around his adductor.The 18-year-old Spanish youth international broke into Liverpool's first team in August and has been a rare positive in a season of struggle for the Merseyside club.“Unfortunately I’ve picked up an injury that will keep me out until the end of the season,” Bajcetic wrote on Instagram. ""It’s very sad to say goodbye to this amazing season for me but I understand this is part of football and will only make me stronger physically and mentally.“I would also like to say thank you to you reds for all the support through the season and I assure you I will do my best to be back stronger than ever.”Bajcetic's absence is the latest blow for Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who has had to deal with a host of injuries to key players this season, including Virgil van Dijk, Thiago Alcantara, Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota.Klopp revealed his concern when addressing Bajcetic's injury this week.“With Stefan, it is a stress response, which is absolutely bad,” he said. “We have just to let it settle then and we will see when he can come back.”Liverpool was eliminated from the Champions League on Wednesday after being beaten 6-2 on aggregate by Madrid in the round of 16.Klopp is now left with the job of trying to salvage the campaign by securing a top-four finish and a return to Europe's elite competition next season.“It’s the competition and we want to be part of it every year and it’s now a massive task for us,"" Klopp said Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837746,US jobless aid claims fell last week as layoffs remain low,"Fewer Americans applied for jobless claims last week as the labor market continues to thrive despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool the economy and tamp down inflation.Applications for jobless claims in the U.S. for the week ending March 11 fell by 20,000 to 192,000 from 212,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday.The four-week moving average of claims, which flattens out some of week-to-week volatility, fell by 750 to 196,500, remaining below the 200,000 threshold for the eighth straight week.Applications for unemployment benefits are seen as a barometer for layoffs in the U.S.In a note to clients, analysts at Oxford economics said there are still few signs that the recent jump in layoff announcements, particularly in the tech sector, is translating to a rise in unemployment.“Many announced layoffs don’t end up happening, and those that have been laid off are quickly finding work elsewhere, reflecting the ongoing imbalance between labor demand and supply,” the analysts wrote.At its February meeting, the Fed raised its main lending rate by 25 basis points, the eighth straight rate hike in its year-long battle against stubborn inflation. With recent data showing that those rate hikes have done little to bring down inflation and even less to cool the economy and labor market, many analysts were expecting the Fed to raise rates by another half-point when it meets next week.However, the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history over the last week — which have been blamed in large part to rising interest rates — have some economists thinking Fed officials will tread more lightly next week and either raise its rate by 25 basis points or perhaps not at all.The central bank’s benchmark rate is now in a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. Before the banking sector turmoil that began last week, the Fed had signaled that two more rate hikes were likely this year. Some analysts had even forecast three increases that could push the lower end of that rate to 5.5%.The Fed’s rate increases are meant to cool the economy, labor market and wages, thereby suppressing prices. But so far, none of those things have happened, at least not to the degree that the central bank had hoped.Inflation remains more than double the Fed’s 2% target, and the economy is growing and adding jobs at a healthy clip.Last month, the government reported that employers added a substantial 311,000 jobs in February, fewer than January’s huge gain but enough to keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively to fight inflation. The unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, from a 53-year low of 3.4%.Fed policymakers have forecast that the unemployment rate would rise to 4.6% by the end of this year, a sizable increase historically associated with recessions.Though the U.S. labor market remains strong, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, where many companies overhired after a pandemic boom. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs in recent months.Earlier this week, Facebook parent Meta said it was slashing another 10,000 jobs, in addition to the 11,000 culled in November. The social media giant also said it would not fill 5,000 open positions.The real estate sector has taken the biggest hit from the Fed’s interest rate hikes. Higher mortgage rates — which have risen closer to 7% again in recent weeks — have slowed home sales for 12 straight months. That’s almost in lockstep with the Fed’s rate hikes that began last March.About 1.68 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended March 4, a decrease of 29,000 from the week before.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837747,Poland to be 1st NATO member to give Ukraine fighter jets,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland said Thursday it plans to give Ukraine about a dozen MiG-29 fighter jets, which would make it the first NATO member to fulfill Kyiv's increasingly urgent requests for warplanes to defend itself against the Russian invasion.Warsaw will hand over four of the Soviet-made warplanes “within the next few days,” President Andrzej Duda said, and the rest needed servicing but would be supplied later. The Polish word he used to describe the total number can mean between 11 and 19.“They are in the last years of their functioning, but they are in good working condition,” Duda said.He did not say whether other countries would follow suit, although Slovakia has said it would send its own disused MiGs to Ukraine. Poland also was the first NATO nation to provide Ukraine with German-made Leopard 2 tanks.On Wednesday, Polish government spokesman Piotr Mueller said some other countries also had pledged MiGs to Kyiv, but did not identify them. Both Poland and Slovakia had indicated they were ready to hand over their planes, but only as part of a wider international coalition doing the same.The government in neighboring NATO member Germany appeared caught off guard by Duda's announcement.“So far, everyone has agreed that it’s not the time to send fighter jets,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told reporters. “I don’t have any confirmation from Poland yet that this has happened.”The White House called Poland’s move a sovereign decision and lauded the Poles for continuing to “punch above their weight” in assisting Kyiv, but it stressed the move would have no bearing on President Joe Biden, who has resisted calls to provide U.S. F-16s to Ukraine.“There’s no change in our view with respect to fighter aircraft at this time,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. “That is our sovereign decision. That is where we are, other nations can speak to their own” decisions.The White House said Poland notified the U.S. of its decision to provide MiGs before Duda announced the move.Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine had several dozen MiG-29s it inherited in the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, but it’s unclear how many remain in service after more than a year of fighting.The debate over whether to provide non-NATO member Ukraine with fighter jets started last year, but NATO allies expressed concern about escalating the alliance's role in the war. The hesitation continued even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made increasingly vocal pleas for Western supporters to share their warplanes.Duda made the announcement during a joint news conference in Warsaw with the visiting Czech President Petr Pavel.Duda said Poland’s air force would replace the planes it gives to Ukraine with South Korea-made FA-50 fighters and American-made F-35s.Poland has provided Ukraine with crucial support during the war. It is hosting thousands of American troops and has taken in more Ukrainians than any other nation during the refugee exodus sparked by the Russian invasion.The central European nation experienced Russian invasions and occupations for centuries and still fears Russia despite being a NATO member.___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837748,Haas dismisses a report alleging it broke Russian sanctions,"KANNAPOLIS, North Carolina (AP) — The Haas Formula One team has dismissed a report claiming its parent company broke sanctions by providing machinery to Russia as “simply false.”Haas F1 responded in a statement Thursday to a report by American broadcaster PBS on Tuesday alleging that the Haas Automation company had provided machines and parts to Russia. This would have been in violation of U.S. export control and sanctions regulations after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.“That story is simply false, both in its overall impression and in many of its particular statements,” the Haas F1 team said in a statement. “The 18 machines referenced in the story left the Haas Automation factory prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""Haas added that it completely terminated its relationship with Abamet Management — its independent distributor for Russia and Belarus — on March 3, 2022, soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.“Since that date, Haas has not sold or shipped any machines, parts, or software to Abamet or anyone else in Russia,” Haas said.Haas Automation said in a separate statement that it also canceled 50 existing machine orders from Abamet on March 3.Two days later, Russian driver Nikita Mazepin was dropped by the Haas F1 team and Haas also ended its sponsorship with Uralkali, the Russian fertilizer company owned by Mazepin’s father.Dmitry Mazepin is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his son’s contract to drive was linked to the team sponsorship.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837805,At least 5 killed in mysterious north Iraq helicopter crash,"DOHUK, Iraq (AP) — A mysterious helicopter crash in northern Iraq has killed at least five people, allegedly including militants belonging to an outlawed Kurdish insurgency group, according to statements Thursday from the Iraqi Kurdish-run counterterrorism agency and the regional government.The AS350 Eurocopter crashed in the district of Chamanke in Dohuk province in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region on Wednesday night, the counter-terrorism agency said in a statement posted on social media.At least five passengers were killed, said Lawk Ghafuri, spokesperson for the government of northern Iraq’s Kurdish semi-autonomous region.“The investigations are ongoing by security officials to determine the ownership of the helicopter,"" Ghafuri said in a post on Twitter.At least seven were on board, according to an investigator at the crash scene speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation with the media.The helicopter was carrying militants belonging to the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK, the counter-terrorism statement said. No party has of yet claimed ownership of the chopper.Iraq's government, the U.S-led coalition and Turkey had been contacted by the Iraqi Kurdish regional government about the crash, but each denied the helicopter was theirs, the statement added.Zagros Hiwa, a PKK spokesperson, said the group does not possess helicopters and they were also investigating the incident. He also cast doubt on the presence of PKK militants onboard the flight, saying they may have a coalition helicopter carrying fighters with the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, a Syrian Kurdish group allied with the U.S.-led forces.A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition declined to comment, saying the crash fell outside the scope of the coalition's operations.Turkish defense ministry officials said that initial reports that the helicopter had been Turkish were “completely untrue” and that there was no helicopter flight belonging to the Turkish military in the region.The PKK has been waging an insurgency against Turkey since the 1980s and is considered a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and the European Union. Its militants have established safe havens in northern Iraq and frequently come under attack by Turkey in the region.___Associated Press writer Salar Salim in Irbil, Iraq, contributed to this report.___This story was corrected to show that Lawk Ghafuri is the regional government’s spokesperson, not the regional president’s spokesperson.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837806,Senior Iranian official visits UAE on heels of Saudi deal,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A senior Iranian official visited the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, just days after Tehran agreed to restore diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia in a Chinese-brokered deal that raised hopes of a broader rapprochement across Middle East.Ali Shamkhani, the head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said his visit was a “meaningful beginning for the two countries to enter a new stage of political, economic and security relations,” Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported. It said he was accompanied by the head of Iran's central bank and other senior officials.He met with the president of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and other senior officials to discuss “opportunities for enhancing cooperation between the two countries,” the UAE's official WAM news agency reported.Sunni Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf have viewed Iran with suspicion since the 1979 Islamic Revolution toppled a U.S.-allied monarch in Tehran. Relations have worsened since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, as Shiite-majority Iran has spread its influence across the region and supported powerful armed proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and the Palestinian territories.In the Chinese-brokered agreement, which built on talks held in Iraq in recent years, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties which were severed in 2016, when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shiite cleric and Iranian protesters stormed its embassy in Tehran.The deal raised hopes for a lasting peace in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia has been at war with the Iran-aligned Houthi militia since 2015. That conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed the Arab world's poorest country to the brink of famine.The UAE, a close Saudi ally that also intervened in Yemen, returned its ambassador to Iran last August for the first time since 2016, as did the Gulf Arab nation of Kuwait. Dubai, a major international business hub in the UAE, is home to a large Iranian community.Suspicions still run deep, however, especially following a series of attacks on oil tankers off the coast of the UAE, as well as Saudi oil facilities, in 2019, which were widely blamed on Iran. Last year, a drone strike launched by the Iran-backed Houthis hit Abu Dhabi, hurting the UAE's reputation as a safe harbor in the volatile Middle East.The UAE was the first of four Arab nations to normalize relations with Israel in the so-called Abraham Accords in 2020. The two countries were drawn together in large part because of their shared suspicions of Iran. Israel views Iran as its greatest threat, and the two countries have waged a shadow war for several years.The Saudi-Iran deal raised concerns in Israel, which has long hoped to forge an alliance with Arab Gulf states against Tehran.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837807,"Indonesia acquits 2 police, jails 1 for deadly soccer crush","SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) — An Indonesian court on Thursday acquitted two police officials charged with negligence leading to the deaths of 135 people in October when police fired tear gas inside a soccer stadium, setting off a panicked run for the exits. A third official was sentenced to 18 months in prison.The disaster in Kanjuruhan stadium in East Java’s Malang city was among the world’s worst sporting tragedies. Some 43 children were among the deaths and about 580 spectators were injured.A panel of three judges at Surabaya District Court, which was under heavy police guard, absolved police officers Wahyu Setyo Pranoto and Bambang Sidik Achmadi of charges because they found no direct causal link between the defendants' actions and the deadly crowd crush. The two were released Thursday.Presiding judge Abu Achmad Sidqi Amsya said the court found that Pranoto, the Malang police head of operations, never ordered the use of tear gas at the match and knew that international soccer governing body FIFA had advised against its use in stadiums.Amsya said the tear gas ordered by Achmadi, head of crowd control, was aimed at the center of the pitch and dissipated in the wind without hitting any spectators.“The defendant has not been proven legally and convincingly guilty,” Amsya said.He ordered that the two defendants be released from detention immediately after the decision.However, the tear gas fired into the stands under Hasdarmawan's instruction caused a rush to six exits where many fans were crushed or suffocated and died, Amsya said.Like many Indonesians, Hasdarmawan uses only one name.The court convicted Hasdarmawan, who was head of East Java police’s mobile brigade unit at the time of the tragedy, of criminal negligence causing death and bodily harm, concluding a two-month trial in which about 140 witnesses testified. Hasdarmawan was sentenced to 18 months — far below the three years sought by prosecutors. He said he is considering appealing the decision.Prosecutors said they are considering whether to appeal all three defendants' cases. An appeal must be filed within seven days.Thursday’s verdict drew outcries from rights activists and families of the victims.Responding to the acquittal of two police officers, Amnesty International Indonesia said the authorities have failed to provide justice to victims of excessive force in Indonesia, despite vows in the aftermath of the disaster to hold those responsible to account.“The families of victims are understandably distraught at the meagre results of the cases, which have fallen far short,” the group’s executive director Usman Hamid said in a statement, adding that there is a deeply entrenched and broad pattern of violence and abuse of power by Indonesian security forces.“Lack of accountability also sends a dangerous message to members of the security forces who may be reassured that they can operate with a free hand and zero consequences,” he said.Cholifatul Noor, a mother whose 15-year-old son Jovan Farellino died in the stadium crush, urged the prosecutors to appeal the verdicts.“This court decision really hurts us, this is another tragedy for us who seek justice for our children,” she said with tears running down her face. “My beloved son should not die while watching football. … What if this happened to their children?”“I will not stand by this decision, I will keep fighting until all those who are responsible for the deadly stampede at the stadium get the harshest punishment,” she said.Authorities in Surabaya, the capital of East Java province, deployed 350 police to secure the court for its ruling Thursday. Arema fans, known widely as “Aremania,” were prohibited from coming to Surabaya during the trial to avoid any clashes.Abdul Haris, who chairs the organizing committee for Arema FC — the team that hosted the match — was sentenced on March 9 to 18 months in prison. The club’s security chief, Suko Sutrisno, got 12 months. Surabaya District Court judges said the two defendants had not verified the safety of the stadium since 2020 and did not prepare an emergency plan to handle special cases per the Football Association of Indonesia’s 2021 security and safety regulations.On Wednesday, prosecutors said they filed appeals to the higher court against the sentences for Haris and Sutrisno.The trial for another suspect, Akhmad Hadian Lukita, is still pending. He heads PT Liga Indonesia Baru, which administers the country’s top professional soccer division.At a separate military court in early February, a soldier was sentenced to four months in prison for hitting two spectators who ran onto the field.Police had described the pitch invasion as a riot and said two officers were killed, but witnesses accused them of overreacting. Videos showed officers kicking and hitting fans with batons and forcibly pushing spectators back into the stands.National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo removed the police chiefs of East Java province and Malang district and suspended 20 other officers after the tragedy over violations of professional ethics.An investigation set up by Indonesian President Joko Widodo in response to a national outcry over the deaths concluded that the tear gas was the main cause of the crowd surge. It said police on duty had no knowledge that the use of tear gas is prohibited at soccer stadiums and used it “indiscriminately” on the field, in the stands and outside the stadium, causing the more than 42,000 spectators inside the 36,000-seat stadium to rush to the exits — several of which were locked.Widodo’s fact-finding team also concluded that national soccer association PSSI had been negligent and ignored safety and security regulations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837809,Scotland and Italy want to finish Six Nations on a high,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Scotland and Italy still have a lot to play for when they kick off the last round of the Six Nations on Saturday at Murrayfield.Scotland wants to confirm third place, to be the best of the rest after its only losses to No. 1-ranked Ireland and No. 2 France.Italy wants a first win after blowing its big chance last weekend when Wales was in Rome.A win for Scotland would equal its best finish in the Six Nations era. It has placed third five times previously, but not since 2019.“We need to finish strong,” Scotland prop Pierre Schoeman said. “Third place isn't the best we would have wanted but we faced two teams who are in the top two in the world. If it's second or third place, then we need to fight for that.”They will fight for it without star backs Finn Russell and Stuart Hogg, both injured.As Scotland's chief playmaker, Russell has been outstanding. His boots will attempt to be filled by Blair Kinghorn, who grew into the role on the tour of Argentina last July but was dropped after missing a last-minute penalty to beat Australia in October.Ollie Smith, who crossed the tryline along with Kinghorn against Australia, will make his first Six Nations start at fullback.Also back were Edinburgh forwards Hamish Watson and Sam Skinner.Scotland turned around after a tight first half with Ireland and dropped in energy that was taken advantage of by the visitor. It can't afford another passive half against an Italy which plays hard to the final whistle but struggles to finish chances.Italy made 11 line breaks against Wales — the most by anyone in any match this year — but converted only two into tries. Meanwhile, Wales made four line breaks and finished three. The failure to convert was Italy's downfall in losing the likely wooden spoon decider to Wales 29-17.But coach Kieran Crowley said they won't be changing their game plan.“I am not going to die wondering,” he said. “Italy are where they are because of the way they have played over the last 10 years. If we keep doing the same thing we have always done, we will always be in the same place.”Italy will debut Zebre wing Simone Gesi and, possibly off the bench, his clubmate and hooker Marco Manfredi. Scrumhalf Stephen Varney has been dropped and Alessandro Fusco promoted to quicken the ruck speed. ___Lineups:Scotland: Ollie Smith, Kyle Steyn, Huw Jones, Sione Tuipulotu, Duhan van der Merwe, Blair Kinghorn, Ben White; Jack Dempsey, Hamish Watson, Jamie Ritchie (captain), Jonny Gray, Sam Skinner, Zander Fagerson, George Turner, Pierre Schoeman. Reserves: Ewan Ashman, Rory Sutherland, WP Nel, Scott Cummings, Matt Fagerson, Ali Price, Ben Healy, Cameron Redpath.Italy: Tommaso Allan, Pierre Bruno, Juan Ignacio Brex, Tommaso Menoncello, Simone Gesi, Paolo Garbisi, Alessandro Fusco; Lorenzo Cannone, Michele Lamaro (captain), Sebastian Negri, Federico Ruzza, Edoardo Iachizzi, Marco Riccioni, Giacomo Nicotera, Danilo Fischetti.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837810,Madrid needs win at Barcelona to stay in Spanish title hunt,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — After brushing aside Liverpool with surprising ease in the Champions League, Real Madrid appears to again be reaching its peak form when titles are on the line.The 6-2 aggregate victory over the English team put Madrid in the final eight of Europe’s elite competition and with the possibility for a treble of titles this season, including the Spanish league and Copa del Rey.But that feat hinges on producing another big win at Barcelona on Sunday.Barcelona leads the Spanish league and has opened up a nine-point gap on second-place Madrid. A loss at Camp Nou would leave Madrid needing a meltdown by its top rival over the remaining weeks to keep its title, while a victory would confirm that the team is hitting its stride when it counts.Despite being one of the favorites to lift what would be a record-extending 15th European Cup, Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said he and his teammates won't overlook the domestic league.“We have to try to go as far as we can in every competition, because even though we are in the quarterfinals (of the Champions League), it depends on who you play and maybe in April you are already out of contention and have nothing to play for,” Courtois said after Wednesday’s 1-0 win over Liverpool. “So it is important to win this Sunday and stay in the league race.”Karim Benzema, who has missed several games this season with a series of minor injuries, said he will be ready to go against Barcelona despite taking knock on his leg that left him limping after he scored against Liverpool.The game will be the second of three “clasicos” played in just over a month. The two Spanish powerhouses will also play on April 5 when Madrid returns to Barcelona in the second game of the Copa del Rey semifinals after the Catalan side won 1-0 in the capital in February.The last time Barcelona played Madrid it was missing Robert Lewandowski, Ousmane Dembélé and Pedri because of injuries and had to rely on its defense in the first Copa del Rey semifinal game. Lewandowski, who leads the league with 15 goals, is now back playing, while Pedri is doubtful. Dembélé is not expected to be ready.The success of Barcelona’s costly rebuilding project last year, which involved the selling of part of its future television revenues and other assets so it could buy players like Lewandowski, rests on it winning its first league title since 2019. It has already flopped out of the Champions League and Europa League.Barcelona is now eyeing a domestic double — if it can keep its leads over Madrid in both the league and the cup competition amid a growing scandal over its payments to the vice president of Spain’s refereeing committee from 2001-18.Earlier this season, Madrid beat Barcelona 3-1 in the league in October, while Barcelona bettered Madrid 3-1 in the Spanish Super Cup final in January.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837811,"Experts, banks look for ideas to stop next bank failure","WASHINGTON (AP) — The warning signs were all there. Silicon Valley Bank was expanding at a breakneck pace and pursuing wildly risky investments in the bond market. The vast majority of its deposits were uninsured by the federal government, leaving its customers exposed to a crisis.None of this was a secret. Yet bank supervisors at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the state of California did nothing as the bank rolled over the cliff.“Their duty is to make sure that the bank is being run in a safe and sound manner and is not a threat,’’ said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a nonprofit that advocates tougher financial regulations. ""The great mystery here is why the supervision was AWOL at Silicon Valley Bank.’’The search for causes and culprits — and solutions — is refocusing attention on a 2018 federal law that rolled back tough bank regulations put in place after the 2008-2009 financial crisis and, perhaps even more, on the way regulators wrote the rules that put that law in place.The Silicon Valley Bank collapse — the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history — is also raising difficult questions about whether the FDIC needs to offer more protection for deposits.On Friday, regulators shuttered and seized the bank, based in Santa Clara, California. For months it had made a losing bet that interest rates would stay low. They rose instead — as the Federal Reserve repeatedly raised its benchmark rate to fight inflation — and the bank’s bond portfolio plunged in value. As its troubles became public, worried depositors started to withdraw their money in an old-fashioned bank run.And over the weekend the federal government, determined to restore public confidence in the banking system, decided to protect all the bank’s deposits, even those that exceeded the FDIC’s $250,000 limit.The demise of Silicon Valley Bank Friday and of New York-based Signature Bank two days later has revived bad memories of the financial crisis that plunged the United States into the Great Recession of 2007-2009.In the wake of that cataclysm, set off by reckless lending in the U.S. housing market, Congress passed the so-called Dodd-Frank law in 2010, tightening financial regulation. Dodd-Frank focused especially on “systemically important’’ institutions with assets of $50 billion or more — so big and interconnected with other banks that their collapse could bring the whole system down.Those institutions had to maintain a bigger capital buffer against losses, keep more cash or other liquid assets on hand to handle a bank run, undergo annual “stress tests’’ from the Federal Reserve and write a “living will’’ to arrange for their affairs to be settled in an orderly manner if they fail.But as the crisis faded into the past, and more and more banks grumbled about the burden of complying with the new rules, Congress decided to provide relief from the Dodd-Frank legislation. Among other things, it ditched the $50 billion asset threshold for the most stringent oversight, pushing it up to $250 billion. Many large lenders, including Silicon Valley Bank, were thereby freed from the tightest regulatory scrutiny.Critics like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leading critic of the banking industry, denounced the bill at the time, saying it would encourage banks to take more risk.The law gave Federal Reserve officials the authority to reimpose tougher regulations on banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion if they felt it necessary.But they chose not to be tough on those banks. For example, they only required a stress test every two years, not annually. So Silicon Valley Bank didn’t have to undergo a stress test in 2022 and wasn’t due for one until later this year.Todd Phillips, a fellow at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute and a former FDIC lawyer, said Congress’ deregulatory push during the Trump years created a “vibe shift.""""It basically gave regulators permission to take their eyes off″ lenders like Silicon Valley Bank, he said. ”The regulators ran with that.’’Warren and other lawmakers on Tuesday introduced legislation to undo the 2018 law and restore the tougher Dodd-Frank regulations.But Kelleher at Better Markets said that U.S. bank regulators “don’t have to wait for a divided Congress to act in the best interests of the American public.’’They could rewrite 20 bank-friendly rules the Fed and other bank agencies put in place during the Trump years. For example, for banks with $100 billion or more in assets, Phillips wrote in a report Wednesday, regulators should reinstate annual stress tests and raise capital requirements, among other things.“When we roll back regulations so that bank executives can use these banks to boost their profits, to boost their own salaries, to get big bonuses, they are doing it by taking on more risk,’’ Warren told reporters Wednesday. “Banking should be boring. And we have a chance here in Congress to make banking more boring again.’’The sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has also turned attention to federal deposit insurance.The FDIC only covers up to $250,000. But Silicon Valley Bank, the go-to institution for tech entrepreneurs, held cash for many startups: 94% of its deposits — including money that companies need to meet their payrolls — were above the $250,000 threshold and vulnerable to losses when the bank failed.The idea that so many depositors would lose their savings threatened to shake public faith in the banking system. So the Biden administration announced Sunday night that the FDIC would cover 100% of deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, and also at Signature BankNow some are calling for a permanent increase in the deposit insurance limit.“I hope now going forward they’re not going to treat this increase in the guaranteed deposits as just a one-shot response ... but make it ongoing,’’ said Barney Frank, former chair of the House Financial Services Committee and director of failed Signature Bank. He also suggested an increase for businesses so they can meet payrolls.But the Roosevelt Institute’s Phillips said the issue is complicated. If you cover business' payrolls, should you cover deposits they have earmarked to pay rent or suppliers? And unlimited deposit coverage would mean even the richest and most financially sophisticated people would have to take no responsibility for monitoring the financial health of their banks.Covering all deposits would also require the FDIC to charge banks more for the extra insurance, a prospect that the industry has not been receptive to in the past. The industry unsuccessfully lobbied to reduce FDIC insurance assessments last year.However, having full insurance might be a competitive advantage.A group of small banks in Massachusetts created their own private deposit insurance fund in the 1990s, allowing depositors to be insured over the $250,000 limit through this state-based program. While it costs more for the small banks to participate than just being insured through the FDIC, Massachusetts bankers said they've been attracting customers since Silicon Valley Bank's failure.“Maybe our rates are not as competitive as the biggest banks, but customers like that we insure 100% of their funds,” said Catherine Dillon, chief operating officer of Bank Five in Fall River, Massachusetts. ___ Sweet reported from New York.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837813,"Newsom pledges 1,200 tiny homes for California's homeless","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California will spend about $30 million to build 1,200 small homes across the state this year, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday, part of a plan to help house the nation's largest homeless population and to address an issue that has persistently plagued the state during the governor's time in office.The homes, some as small as 120 square feet (11 square meters), can be assembled in 90 minutes and cost a fraction of what it takes to build permanent housing. Newsom said the homes can create space to help clear homeless encampments that have sprung up across the state's major cities. Federal courts have ruled cities can't clear homeless encampments if there are no shelter beds available.“We need to focus more energy and precision on addressing encampments,” Newsom said. “There's no humanity there. People are dying on our watch.”Newsom announced the plans in Sacramento on the first stop of a planned four-city tour, where he has promised to make major policy announcements on housing, health care and public safety. The tour is replacing the governor's traditional State of the State address.Local leaders across the country have used small homes for years to help house their homeless populations. In San Jose, a city of nearly 1 million people at the south end of the San Francisco Bay, Mayor Matt Mahan said the city has installed 500 small homes in the past three years. The rate of the city's homeless people who were unsheltered dropped to 75% from 84%, the first decline in many years, he said.""If you look around the world at places that have gotten a handle on this challenge, it's because they've scaled up safe places for people to go,"" he said.But critics said Newsom is spending more money on things that won't do enough to help. Since taking office in 2019, Newsom has signed off on more than $22.3 billion in new spending on housing and homelessness programs. California's homeless population has increased 6% since 2020, compared to a 0.4% increase in the rest of the country, according to an an analysis of federal data by the Public Policy Institute of California.California now has nearly a third of all homeless people in the United States.“This is just another Band-Aid on a crisis that is out of control in California,” said Brian Jones, the Republican leader of the state Senate. “We know that throwing money at this problem doesn’t work.”Sacramento will get 350 of the homes. Los Angeles will get 500, San Jose will get 200 and San Diego will get 150. While the state is paying to build and install the homes, local governments will be in charge of maintaining them. That includes deciding where to put them. The homes will have electricity, but they won't have plumbing, water or cooking appliances, according to the Governor's Office.Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness, called Newsom's proposal a “modest step forward.” He estimated the homes in Sacramento would be enough to house about 10% of the city's homeless population.“I wish that elected officials, not only the governor but up and down the state, would have a broader perspective in terms of trying to approach our homeless crisis and affordable housing crisis with a sense of scale rather than a 10% solution,” he said.Newsom acknowledged that criticism on Thursday, saying he knows progress is not happening fast enough. He said small homes are not the solution, but they can help.“It's not just about sweeping things under the rug or kicking people off the streets and sidewalks and claiming a job well done,” Newsom said. “That doesn't do justice.”California's homelessness problem is in part a byproduct of its shortage of affordable housing, an issue that advocates say impacts many more people than simply those living on the streets.Nathen Avelar, 18, said he has struggled with unstable housing most of his life. Avelar grew up with his mother and twin brother in the Central Valley city of Merced, where he said there is plenty of new housing but all out of their reach.For a few years, they lived in a home that was infested with mold, which aggravated his brother’s asthma and forced them to leave. They moved in with his grandmother; if not for her home, which they often shared with multiple other family members, Avelar said they likely would have been homeless.“I remember a couple of times we drove around looking for houses, and we always saw these nice houses on the street and I knew we would never be able to afford them,” he said. “That was really disheartening.”Avelar, who worked part-time for a voter engagement group that supported Newsom during an unsuccessful 2021 recall attempt, said he wants the governor’s administration to build more affordable housing.Leaders of the state's biggest cities and counties want Sacramento to define more clearly their role in addressing homelessness and how the state will measure the success of local programs that receive state funding.Currently state homelessness funding has “all sorts of rules that have to be put in and half a dozen different state departments involved in order to find one program,” said Graham Knauss, executive director of the California State Association of Counties. “That needs to change. That is not government at its best.”The association's solution is to ask the state Legislature to pass laws clearly defining the responsibilities of local and state government, coupled with recurring state funding for local governments every year. Knauss said the association is talking with lawmakers and the governor's office about passing legislation.“We certainly should not expect that we’re going to get ongoing progress on homelessness while using one-time funding to do it,” he said.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837814,UK bans TikTok on government phones on security grounds,"LONDON (AP) — British authorities said Thursday that they are banning the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok from government mobile phones on security grounds, following similar moves by the U.S. and European Union.Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden told Parliament that the ban applies with immediate effect to work phones and other devices used by government ministers and civil servants. He described the ban as a “precautionary move,"" and said it does not apply to personal phones and devices.“Given the particular risk around government devices, which may contain sensitive information, it is both prudent and proportionate to restrict the use of certain apps, particularly when it comes to apps where a large amount of data can be stored and accessed,"" Dowden told British lawmakers.The U.S. government mandated last month that employees of federal agencies have to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the White House, U.S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states already had banned the app.The European Union, Belgium and others have also temporarily banned the app from employee phones.The moves were prompted by growing concerns that TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, would give user data such as browsing history and location to the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.The company has insisted that such concerns are based on “misinformation” and said it was taking steps to boost protection of user data from the U.K. and Europe.“We believe these bans have been based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics, in which TikTok and our millions of users in the U.K, play no part,” the company said. “We remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns but should be judged on facts and treated equally to our competitors.""China accused the United States on Thursday of spreading disinformation and suppressing TikTok following reports that the Biden administration was calling for the short-form video service's Chinese owners to sell their stakes in the popular app.Last year, Britain’s Parliament shut down its TikTok account, which was intended to reach younger audiences, just days after its launch after lawmakers raised concerns.",2023/3/16,,World

The first 80km of the course was located in a mountainous area, with the highest altitude being 540m. The race then moved to flat terrain, with the last few kilometers featuring sharp turns.After the first KOM at the 25km mark, many breakaway groups continuously attacked, with the peloton eventually letting the breakaway go with a time gap of two minutes at one point, according to the release. However, the peloton caught up with the breakaway with just 6km left, leading to an 80-person sprint.In the end, Enrico Zanoncello from Green Project-Bardiani CSF-Faizane emerged as the champion of the fifth stage, crossing the finish line with a time of 3:13:20.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837817,Mobile sports bets booming in some states as others shy away,"The stakes are higher in Ohio this year for March Madness — and not just because it's a regional host for the first round of the men's NCAA basketball tournament.For the first time, Ohio sports fans can click on a mobile app or tap into kiosks at bars, restaurants or grocery stores and legally bet on the famed tournament.Kansas and Massachusetts also are new additions to the world of online sports betting since the NCAA tournament last tipped off. A total of 33 states and the District of Columbia now offer at least some form of sports wagering — each scrambling for shares of a multibillion-dollar enterprise that has rapidly expanded after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it nearly five years ago.Ohio got off to a booming start when it launched sports betting in January. In its first month, Ohio bettors wagered more than $1.1 billion, generating more than $20 million in state tax revenue. That nearly tripled the revenue amount that legislative analysts had projected for the entire first six months of operation. But no one's blaming them for missing the mark.“They couldn’t know how big of a market we were going to have on day one,” said Jessica Franks, communications director at the Ohio Casino Control Commission.Whereas some states started with limited in-person sports betting and gradually added mobile apps, Ohio began more aggressively — simultaneously launching numerous mobile options and retail locations. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is now proposing to double the tax rate on sports betting.New York began allowing sports betting in 2019, but only in person at four upstate casinos, limiting the market. Betting boomed when the state began allowing people to make sports bets through cell phones and computers in January 2022. In the first month, more than $1.6 billion was wagered through online sports betting, compared to just $15 million through in-person sports bets at casinos.New York charges a 51% tax on revenue from mobile sports betting — a far higher rate than other states — with most revenue going to education. Budget officials originally projected that mobile sports betting would generate $357 million in state tax revenue for the 2023 fiscal year, which ends March 31. Bettors have blown that away. Through February, mobile sports betting had generated $661 million of tax revenue for education.State Sen. Joseph Addabbo Jr., who advocated for sports betting as chair of the Senate Racing, Gaming and Wagering Committee, said even he is amazed at the results.“There is an appetite, certainly, to do sports betting with a mobile device,"" Addabbo said.New York and Ohio both have large populations and multiple professional sports teams to help drive interest in sports betting.Arkansas, a much smaller state without major league sports teams, began in-person sports betting at casinos in July 2019. Things really took off last year when it launched mobile sports betting. State figures show nearly $3 million was wagered on this year's Super Bowl — more than three times the annual amount before mobile betting was allowed.State officials expect people from neighboring states to cross into Arkansas to bet on March Madness.“We will be surprised if March doesn’t set a new monthly record for sports betting in the state,” said Scott Hardin, spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.Other states also have exceeded expectations for sports betting revenues.Indiana's sports wagering taxes topped $31 million in the 2022 fiscal year — well more than the $12 million projection when lawmakers authorized it in 2019. New Hampshire's tax take of nearly $24 million from sports betting easily doubled its original projection for the 2022 fiscal year.But not every state is banking as many bucks as projected from sports betting.Legislative analysts in Montana, which allows sports bets only from online networks inside bars and casinos, had anticipated that $79 million of bets would be cast last fiscal year, generating $4.8 million of state tax revenue. The actual results were about half that — $2.4 million of state tax revenue from about $45 million of sports bets.Connecticut received less than $20 million in sports betting taxes in the first 16 months since wagering began in October 2021. Legislative analysts had projected $21 million in its first full fiscal year.Nationwide, legal sports betting has generated more than $3 billion in state and federal taxes since the 2018 Supreme Court ruling allowing it, according to the American Gaming Association. It's producing about one-quarter of what eventually could be expected from a fully mature market.The debate about sports betting has shifted from ""`Is this something we should consider?' to 'How should we go about doing this in a way that best serves our constituencies?’” said Casey Clark, the association's senior vice president.The prospects for sports betting to expand into more states this year appear mixed.A bill legalizing sports betting passed the Kentucky House and advanced Wednesday to the Senate but still faces a high hurdle. Similar bills have died in the past in the Senate, and this year's version would a need three-fifths vote to pass.Supporters also are taking another run at a sports betting bill in Minnesota and various other states.In Missouri, attempts to authorize sports betting have gotten bogged down in the Senate over whether to pair them with regulations on slot-machine-style games that have been popping up in convenience stores.In Georgia, sports betting bills have stalled amid debate about whether a constitutional amendment is needed, how to spend the potential tax revenue and whether to pair sports betting with the legalization of casinos and horse racing tracks.The three most populous states — California, Texas and Florida — all currently lack online sports betting. The Seminole Tribe of Florida, which received exclusive state rights to run sports betting, shut down its online app in December 2021 after federal courts ruled it violated a rule requiring people to be physically present on tribal land when wagering.After the most expensive ballot issue battle in U.S. history, California voters last November rejected a pair of rival sports betting initiatives backed by Native American tribes and the gambling industry. Supporters are likely to try again, though it's unclear when that might occur.___Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Mo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837834,UN-backed inquiry accuses Russia of war crimes in Ukraine,"GENEVA (AP) — Russian attacks against civilians in Ukraine, including systematic torture and killing in occupied regions, amount to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity, according to a report from a U.N.-backed inquiry released Thursday.The sweeping human rights report, released a year to the day after a Russian airstrike on a theater in Mariupol killed hundreds sheltering inside, marked a highly unusual condemnation of a member of the U.N. Security Council.At a commemoration Thursday in Kyiv of the theater bombing, dozens of Ukrainians placed flickering candles around a giant, taped Cyrillic inscription reading “CHILDREN,” an echo of the enormous painted warning that was in place in front of the theater and behind it at the time of the airstrike.“Those planes that were in the air, I couldn’t believe it until the last minute that they were going to bomb us, peaceful people. You do have mothers and kids; how could you throw those bombs on us? I will never forgive them, never,” said Mariupol resident Nataliia Korchma at Thursday's commemoration.Among potential crimes against humanity, the report cited repeated attacks targeting Ukrainian infrastructure since the fall that left hundreds of thousands without heat and electricity during the coldest months, as well as the “systematic and widespread” use of torture across multiple regions under Russian occupation.""There were elements of planning and availability of resources which indicate that the Russian authorities may have committed torture as crimes against humanity,"" said Erik Møse, a former Norwegian Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights judge who led the investigation.The investigation also found crimes committed against Ukrainians on Russian territory, including deported Ukrainian children who were prevented from reuniting with their families, a “filtration” system aimed at singling out Ukrainians for detention, and torture and inhumane detention conditions.A commission of inquiry is the most powerful tool used by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council to scrutinize abuses and violations around the world. The investigation released Thursday was set up during an urgent debate shortly after Russia’s invasion last year.The commission's three members are independent human rights experts, and its staff gets support and funding from the council and the U.N. human rights office.The report's authors noted a “small number” of apparent violations by Ukrainian forces, including one they said was under criminal investigation by Ukrainian authorities, but reserved the vast majority of their report for allegations against Russia.Russia did not respond to the inquiry's appeals for information.Most of the abuses highlighted by the investigation were already known, and the report is far from the first to accuse Russia of war crimes. However, the inquiry's findings come with the imprimatur of the international community: The experts work under a mandate overwhelmingly created last year by the Human Rights Council, which brings together the governments of 47 U.N. member countries.Møse, who served as president of an international tribunal established to prosecute genocide cases from the massacre of members of Rwanda's ethnic Tutsi minority in 1994, said investigators have created a list of individuals to hold accountable for human rights violations in Ukraine.He said the list would be ""submitted to the relevant authorities in this issue,” but the team acknowledged the difficulty of investigations involving a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.Ultimately, the report may add to efforts to boost accountability for crimes committed in the war — whether by the International Criminal Court or by some individual countries that have taken on the right to apply “universal jurisdiction” to prosecute atrocities, wherever they may take place.___Hinnant reported from Paris.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837835,Women's World Cup prize money gets big FIFA raise to $150M,"The Women’s World Cup is getting an increase in prize money of more than 300% for this year’s tournament.The $152 million fund for the first 32-team tournament — covering prize money, team preparation and payments to players' clubs — is a huge boost from the 24-team edition in 2019, and 10 times what it was in 2015.Some of the $110 million in pure prize money should be dedicated to paying players, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said Thursday in Rwanda after being re-elected by acclamation through 2027.Players' union FIFPRO said Thursday it has challenged FIFA to secure a “global guarantee of at least 30% of prize money” that is paid to players.FIFA also said the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand won't be sponsored by the Saudi Arabian tourism authority. Talks about a possible deal had caused unease among players and the tournament co-hosts.Government and World Cup organizers in both host countries had questioned if the deal with Visit Saudi would be appropriate for the women’s tournament, especially given Saudi Arabia’s record on women’s rights. Among the players urging FIFA to rethink it, United States forward Alex Morgan said the proposal was “bizarre.”Infantino called the dispute a “storm in a teacup” and said extending the Visit Saudi deal, which started at the men’s World Cup in Qatar, was a discussion that “didn’t lead into a contract.”“There is a double standard here which I really don’t understand,” the FIFA president said, aiming a barb at critics of the deal.He said Australian companies had export trade to Saudi Arabia worth $1.5 billion each year and “this doesn’t seem to be a problem or an issue.”The Australian soccer federation said in a statement it welcomed FIFA clarifying the Visit Saudi speculation.“Equality, diversity and inclusion are really deep commitments for Football Australia,” chief executive James Johnson said, “and we’ll continue to work hard with FIFA to ensure the Women’s World Cup is shaped in this light.”Infantino also again expressed his anger with broadcasters for offering too little for TV rights. He said FIFA will not sell broadcast rights for the tournament in Australia and New Zealand at the prices currently being offered“Women deserve much, much more than that and we are there to fight for them and with them,” he said.Female players worldwide have been fighting for equal pay and equal respect with men’s national teams, including the defending champion United States, Canada, France and Spain.Infantino set a target of equal prize money for men and women at their next World Cups, in 2026 and 2027, respectively — a tough task when the 32 men’s teams shared $440 million at last year's World Cup in Qatar.The FIFA president angrily targeted broadcasters, some of them public service channels funded by taxpayers, who he said offered up to 100 times less for rights to the women’s tournament.Infantino first raised the issue in October in New Zealand, and insisted FIFA still would not sell at those prices with women’s soccer drawing audiences perhaps 20-50% less than for men’s games.“Well, offer us 20% less, 50% less. But not 100% less,"" Infantino said in closing remarks to the FIFA Congress. ""That’s why we can’t do it.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837838,Spanish federation sides against Barcelona over payments,"MADRID (AP) — The Spanish soccer federation has joined the long list of entities deciding to take legal action against Barcelona in the corruption case.Prosecutors last week formally accused Barcelona of alleged corruption, fraudulent management and falsification of documentation in regard to payments of millions of euros for more than a decade to a company that belonged to the vice president of the country’s refereeing committee.A judge ordered the accusations to be investigated, and prosecutors specialized in anticorruption were handling the case.Others siding against the club include the Spanish government, the Spanish league, Real Madrid and more clubs. They will all be accusing parties in the proceedings over the controversial payments that have shocked Spanish soccer.The federation said on Thursday it sent a report to UEFA about why it was going against Barcelona. It said it has been contributing with authorities, and has started its own investigation.It called for “serenity” in the world of soccer to “help reduce the tensions"" surrounding the refereeing collective in Spain.“This is not beneficial for soccer,” the federation said. “Justice requires time, and the alleged illegal actions must be proven.”Barcelona's payments became public last month. The club has denied wrongdoing or conflict of interest, saying it paid for technical reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games.Club president Joan Laporta said Barcelona was “the victim of a campaign to harm its honorability.”Prosecutors said in court documents seen by the Associated Press that the payments by the club totaled up to 7.3 million euros ($7.7 million) from 2001-18. They said the “quantity was not justified because it was not foreseen in the statutes of the club nor approved by its general assembly (of club members).”There is so far no evidence that referees or game results were actually influenced during the period in which Barcelona made the payments.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837839,UK's Cleverly tells struggling Moldova: 'You are not alone',"CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly visited Moldova's capital Thursday, where he is set to pledge 10 million pounds ($12.5 million) in financial aid to help the small, embattled country tackle what his office called “malign interference” from Russia.Cleverly met with his Moldovan counterpart Nicu Popescu in Chisinau, where they will discuss efforts to support Moldova, a European Union candidate that has faced a protracted series of crises since Moscow launched its war in neighboring Ukraine.“You are not alone, we, together with international partners will help the Republic of Moldova to face this unprecedented, brutal war on your doorstep,"" Cleverly said at a news conference. ""With the exception of Ukraine, no other country has felt the impact of Putin’s cruel war more deeply than Moldova.”The British official’s visit marks the start of a regional trip that will also include Georgia, and comes at a turbulent time for the two former Soviet republics which both have aspirations of joining the EU and aren’t members of the NATO military alliance.The financial aid that the UK will pledge on Thursday will help Moldova’s economic and governance reforms, and bolster anti-corruption efforts as it looks to forge closer ties with its Western partners, much to the ire of Moscow, its historic partner.“Few societies understand the underhand tactics of Russian malign activity more than Moldova and Georgia,"" Cleverly said ahead of his visit to Chisinau. “We must reinforce their resilience to Russia’s hybrid threats, safeguard the democratic choices of their people and protect them from the threat on their doorstep.""Moldova's Popescu said Thursday that the support from the UK shows “we have strong friends and we enjoy their steadfast support.”The UK's new financial pledge will be in addition to 12 million pounds pledged to Moldova last year, which Cleverly said helped it defend against cyber attacks, tackle Russian disinformation, reform its armed forces and fight official corruption.In Moldova, police on Sunday said they foiled a plot by groups of Russia-backed saboteurs specially trained to cause mass unrest at protests against the country’s new pro-Western government. Days earlier, U.S. intelligence officials had said that people with ties to Russian intelligence aimed to use the protests as a basis to try to topple Moldova's government.The protest was one of several held in recent weeks organized by a group called Movement for the People, which is backed by Moldova’s Russia-friendly Shor Party that holds six seats in the country’s 101-seat legislature.The Shor Party’s leader, Ilan Shor, is a Moldovan oligarch currently in exile in Israel, who is named on a U.S. State Department sanctions list as working for Russian interests. The UK also added Shor to a sanctions list in December.Georgia too was rocked this month by mass protests over a so-called “foreign agents law,” which opponents said would curtail media freedoms and could be used to stifle dissent. Protesters in Tbilisi said the bill was inspired by a similar law in Russia that has been used to silence critics. Last week, the bill was overwhelmingly voted against by Georgia’s parliament.The UK is set to pledge 500,000 pounds to Georgia to protect the country from “external interference” ahead of parliamentary elections next year, according to Cleverly's office.___Stephen McGrath reported from Kidderminster, England.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837841,Nationals prospect Cade Cavalli needs Tommy John surgery,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Washington Nationals pitching prospect Cade Cavalli needs Tommy John reconstructive elbow surgery and will miss the 2023 season, general manager Mike Rizzo said Thursday.The team released a statement from Rizzo saying that an MRI exam showed that Cavalli sprained his ulnar collateral ligament.The right-hander exited a spring training start against the New York Mets after 2 2/3 innings on Tuesday.“While Cade will not pitch in 2023, he continues to be a very important part of our franchise’s future and we look forward to having him back on the mound,” Rizzo said. “We will provide an update on his surgery when it is available.”The 24-year-old Cavalli was the No. 22 overall pick in the 2020 amateur draft after playing college baseball at Oklahoma. He made his major league debut in August against the Cincinnati Reds, then felt something in his shoulder while playing catch the next day and was shut down for the rest of last season.He had been expected to be part of Washington's starting rotation this season as the club continues to try to rebuild.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837844,Cricket ump Aleem Dar retires after record 435 men's games,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Cricket umpire Aleem Dar of Pakistan has retired after officiating in a record 435 men’s international matches.Dar was replaced by countryman Ahsan Raza, who joined newcomer Adrian Holdstock of South Africa on an expanded 12-man panel of elite International Cricket Council umpires on Thursday.The 54-year-old Dar had been on the elite panel since its inception in 2002, and officiated in a record 144 test matches, 222 one-day internationals and 69 Twenty20s.“It has been a long journey, but I have enjoyed every bit of it,” Dar said. “I have had the pleasure and honor of umpiring the world over and what I have achieved is something I did not even dream of when I started in the profession.”Dar was the first Pakistani umpire to be part of the elite panel and stood in the finals of the T20 World Cups in 2010 and 2012. He officiated in five 50-over World Cups and seven T20 World Cups.He was named the best umpire in the world for three successive years from 2009-11.ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice lauded Dar's contribution.“Consistently elite performances over such a long period saw him enjoy enormous respect across all involved in international cricket,” Allardice said.Raza has stood in seven tests, 41 ODIs and 72 T20s.Holdstock has officiated in five tests, 42 ODIs and 48 T20s.Both umpires officiated in the last two men’s T20 World Cups in the United Arab Emirates and Australia.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837845,UFC 286: Usman prepares to redeem himself against Edwards,"It was a crosshead kick that ended Kamaru Usman’s long reign as champion and made Leon Edwards a UFC star.Edwards certainly will never forget it.And he believes Usman might never get over it.“He’s what now, 35, 36 years old?” Edwards said of his storied welterweight rival. “Coming off a knockout and fighting the same guy who’s just knocked him out. Let’s see how he comes back.”We’re about to find out.The two are meeting again Saturday — for the third time, and more than seven years after their first fight — as the headliners at UFC 286 at the O2 Arena in London.It’s a homecoming for Edwards, the champion.It’s a shot at redemption for Usman, in the rare position as the challenger.Dropped by a kick to the head and neck in the fifth round in Salt Lake City in August, Usman — otherwise known as the “Nigerian Nightmare” — saw his run of 15 straight victories come to an end. One more win would have tied an all-time UFC record for a guy seen at the time as the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world.The big question now, seven months later, is what has he got? It’s one that Edwards is asking out loud.“What does he change?” the Jamaican-born Brit said in an interview with BT Sport, which is broadcasting the fight in Britain. “The way he fought me last is the way he fights.“I can’t see him in the space of five, six months now being a totally different fighter. I just can’t see it happening.”Usman is aware his ability to recover from a first loss in nine years is being questioned by Edwards.His response?“It’s warranted when you speak about ordinary things and ordinary people,” Usman said this week in London. ""When something like that — that trauma — happens, most people are going to be disturbed about it. But that’s when you're speaking about ordinary people.“Leon Edwards and I both know that I am not ordinary. I’m extraordinary.”Indeed, underestimating Usman is a dangerous game. Especially since he beat Edwards in the first fight of this trilogy in 2015 and was controlling the second — in UFC 278 — before the unexpected knockout blow from his rival, who become Britain’s second UFC champion and extended a winning run that stretches to May 2016.That’s some strong pedigree on show Saturday, wrapping up a card that includes a fight between Justin Gaethje and Rafael Fiziev in the lightweight category.It promises to be an emotional night for Edwards, who will be fighting almost three years to the day since a contest against Tyron Woodley in the same venue had to be called off amid the onset on the coronavirus pandemic.Now he returns as a champion, hungry for only his second bout in nearly two years and believing Usman won’t be able to deal with a first fight in someone else’s back yard.“This is my hometown show,” Edwards said. “I’ve never lost in the U.K. I use the crowd as energy. I just can’t see how he goes out there and defeats me.”Unsurprisingly, Usman feels differently.“Yes of course I could have waited and said let’s do it in Vegas or something like that but it was the perfect opportunity to come here,” he said. “It just adds to the story.”And he feels energized being the challenger for a change.“When you start to just defend, defend, defend, it does kind of make you get lackadaisical,” Edwards said. ""It just gets repetitive. But this one, immediately I found it on the ride to that hospital after (UFC) 278.“I got presented with the opportunity to be able to fall as a champion and rise again. And I think that’s the biggest thing for me.”___Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837846,"Ohtani leads Japan over Italy 9-3, into WBC semifinals","TOKYO (AP) — Japan manager Hideki Kuriyama still gets a special tingle watching Shohei Ohtani. It's been that way since Kuriyama managed the two-way star with the Hokkaido Ham-Fighters.“When we see Shohei playing, not only the players but also the Japanese baseball fans, all the nation is feeling something extra,” Kuriyama said through a translator after Ohtani led Japan over Italy 9-3 on Thursday night to put the Samurai Warriors in their fifth straight World Baseball Classis semifinal.Ohtani pitched shutout ball into the fifth inning and sparked a four-run third with a bunt single.“These kind of moments, this is how I feel the sense of Ohtani,” Kuriyama said. ""This is Shohei. This is Shohei. When he plays a must-win game like tonight, we see who Shohei is.”Boston’s Masataka Yoshida homered and drove in the go-ahead run with a grounder, giving him a tournament-leading 10 RBIs. Kazuma Okamoto hit a three-run homer for Japan, which has outscored opponents 47-11 in five games and is batting .313.Japan travels to Miami for a semifinal on Monday against Puerto Rico or Mexico. Cuba plays the other semifinal against the United States or Venezuela.Pitching before an adoring crowd of 41,723 at the Tokyo Dome, Ohtani threw his fastest pitch since he joined the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, striking out Vinnie Pasquantino on a 102 mph fastball in the second. That topped a 101.4 mph pitch that struck out Houston’s Kyle Tucker last Sept. 10.Ohtani (2-0) allowed two runs and four hits in 4 2/3 innings with five strikeouts and a walk and went 1 for 4 with a walk at the plate. He is hitting .438 (7 for 16) with a home run, three doubles and eight RBIs along with a 2.08 ERA, 10 strikeouts and one walk on the mound. Ohtani would be available on four days’ rest to pitch in a possible final on Tuesday -- 4 1/2 days, counting the time difference.Ohtani stretched his tournament scoreless streak to 8 2/3 innings before the fifth, when Dominic Fletcher hit a soft bases-loaded single into right with two outs on Ohtani’s 71st and final pitch — nine short of the limit. Ohtani had hit Ben DeLuzio with a pitch with one out, allowed a single to David Fletcher, retired Sal Frelick on a flyout and hit Nicky Lopez with a pitch.“In the fourth and fifth innings I struggled a bit, but until then I had good rhythm and I pitched well, I think,"" Ohtani said.Ohtani also mentioned his special relationship with Kuriyama, who encouraged him to continue as a two-way player.“This is such a special moment for me,” Ohtani said, referring to Kuriyama in the Japanese style of Kuriyama-san. “When I played for Kuriyama-san for the Fighter, I learned a lot. Yes, he is someone who taught me how to play well.”Hiromi Itoh relieved and retired Miles Mastrobuoni on a flyout as Yoshida slammed into the left field wall while making the catch.Japan is the only nation to reach the semifinals of all five WBCs, winning the first two tournaments in 2006 and 2009. The Samurai Warriors were knocked out by Puerto Rico in 2013 and the U.S. in 2017.Italy, managed by Mike Piazza, advanced past the first round for the first time since 2013. Dominic Fletcher, an Arizona prospect, drove in all three of Italy’s runs and had the team’s first home run of the tournament, a solo shot in the eighth off Yu Darvish.""Against a very good team, you have to be exceptional,"" Piazza said. ""And obviously tonight we weren’t, We didn’t throw the ball well tonight. We needed our pitchers to have a very good game.”Italy pitchers walked eight.“You’re not going to beat at team like Japan with eight walks,” Piazza said.Japan went ahead in a four-run third.Kensue Kondoh walked with one out against Tampa Bay minor leaguer Joe LaSorsa (0-1), and Ohtani bunted down the third base line for a single as LaSorsa threw wildly for an error that left runners at the corners. Yoshida’s groundout put Japan ahead, Munetaka Murakami walked and Okamoto homered.Murakami, a two-time Central League MVP, hit an RBI double in the fifth and Kazuma Okamoto followed with a two-run double off Vinny Nittoli that opened a 7-2 lead.Yoshida homered in the seventh against San Francisco prospect Joey Marciano and Sosuke Genda added an RBI single. ___Follow Japan-based AP sports writer Stephen Wade on Twitter at http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837847,Inter switches focus to Serie A after European advancement,"MILAN (AP) — For the first time in 17 years, three Italian teams reached the Champions League quarterfinals. Now they will have to focus on ensuring they qualify for next season’s competition in one of the tightest races for the top four in Serie A.Napoli, Inter Milan and AC Milan have all reached the final eight of Europe’s top club competition in a sort of redemption for Italian soccer after the national team again didn’t qualify for the World Cup.However, only Napoli seems assured of playing in the Champions League next season. The club, which reached the quarterfinals for the first time in its history, has an 18-point lead at the top of Serie A and is 21 points clear of fifth-place Roma.Inter and Milan are second and fourth, respectively, but only three points separate second place from fifth place, with Atalanta also only five points further back.In such a tight race, the teams know they can’t afford any slipups — although all of them dropped points last weekend.Milan has the easiest match on paper this weekend at Udinese, while Roma visits third-place Lazio in the capital derby.Inter hosts Juventus in the derby d’Italia on Sunday, knowing that the Bianconeri could also be thrown into the mix for the Champions League spots.Inter drew 0-0 at Porto on Tuesday to progress 1-0 on aggregate and also relieve a lot of the pressure on coach Simone Inzaghi after mixed results in the league. The Nerazzurri have won only two of their past five league matches, losing at Spezia and Bologna and drawing at Sampdoria.“We know we’ve dropped too many points in the league. We’ve lacked consistency, especially against some of the smaller sides recently,” Inter defender Matteo Darmian said after Tuesday’s match. “Tonight, however, should give us a boost going forward. We’ll celebrate today but, from tomorrow, we’ll be fully focused on Sunday because it’s another important game.”Juventus was hit with a massive 15-point penalty for false accounting at the beginning of the year but has recovered from that to win all but one of its six league matches since the start of February.The Bianconeri are currently seventh but are appealing against the penalty and if they get those points back they would be three ahead of Inter.“As for this moment, I always tell the lads that what they’re doing is important,” Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. “On the field, we are second, and it’s not a small thing, it’s a sign of maturity, and we have to keep up the work.”It will be the first of three times in a month that Inter and Juventus meet. They also play each other in the two-legged Italian Cup semifinals. Juventus beat Inter 2-0 in their first league match this season.Before this weekend’s matches kick off, Napoli and the Milan teams will know their opponents in the next round of the Champions League. There are no further restrictions on teams from the same country facing each other so the two Milan sides could be pitted against each other, just like they were in the 2005 quarterfinals.Milan advanced that time and went on to reach the final in Istanbul, where it lost on penalties to Liverpool after leading 3-0 at halftime.This year’s final will be held in that same stadium in Turkey.“We are happy to have got here and we want to continue, we’re not going to be satisfied,” Inter CEO Giuseppe Marotta told Gazzetta dello Sport, turning his attention to a potential Champions League matchup. “The derby would be thrilling, emotional, appealing. Everyone would talk about it, it would get exposure worldwide. In Milan, you wouldn’t talk about anything else.“So it would be even better if this derby would be played in Istanbul in the final. That would really be historic. I’d really like to tell Milan, ‘We’ll see you in the final.’”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837849,Military chief says US will defend Indo-Pacific freedoms,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — United States Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. John Aquilino said Thursday that Washington does not seek to contain China, nor seek conflicts in the region, but it would take action to support the region against coercion and bullying by authoritarian regimes.Speaking at a lecture in Singapore, Aquilino said the era of globalization has evolved into one of “renewed great power competition” where the security environment influences economics, trade and investment.“My concern is that this foundation of this rules-based international order … is under direct assault by authoritarian regimes,” he said, without naming any nations, though he noted recent actions by China to “grab a foothold” in the Solomon Islands.A security alliance between China and the Solomon Islands a year ago sent shudders throughout the South Pacific, with many worried it could set off a large-scale military buildup.Aquilino also addressed China's protests over U.S. vessels and aircraft in the Taiwan Strait, where Beijing has renewed its threats against Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.While the U.S. is not seeking conflicts nor supporting Taiwan’s independence, he said the military will continue to “fly, sail and operate” in the region to uphold the navigational rights and freedom of all nations.“Revisionist powers seek to disrupt and displace the current system in ways that benefit themselves, and at the expense of all others. They use coercion, intimidation to achieve their objectives and they justify their action under a theory of 'might equals right,'” he said.“They make illegal excessive territorial claims not based on anything other than revisionist history. They empower law enforcement entities to harass nations operating legally within their own exclusive economic zones. They break formal commitments. They ignore international legal rulings. They avoid requirements delivered under the U.N. Charter,” he said, in a reference to aggressive Chinese actions in the South China Sea and rising Chinese incursions into Taiwanese air defense zones.Aquilino said China has a role to play in the world if it adheres to the rules-based order, especially in regards to North Korea.In 2022 alone, Pyongyang launched 70 missiles, which Aquilino called the most provocative action in history. He noted that earlier Thursday, North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile hours before the leaders of South Korea and Japan were to meet at a Tokyo summit.Pyongyang's actions have threatened South Korea and Japan and it has “developed the capabilities to threaten the United States as well,"" he said.“It is destabilizing, it's unpredictable, it's continuing, it's not slowing down. The potential for the People's Republic of China to help to dissuade the DPRK from executing these events would be helpful,” Aquilino added, using the official names of China and North Korea.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837851,Populist Farmer Citizen Movement wins big in Dutch election,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A new powerhouse of Dutch right-wing populism took political center stage Thursday after winning its first provincial elections, a victory that was seen as a resounding rebuke to Prime Minister Mark Rutte's ruling four-party coalition.With counting of ballots from Wednesday's vote wrapping up, the Farmer Citizen Movement — known by its Dutch acronym BBB — was predicted to win 15 seats in the 75-seat upper house of the Dutch national parliament, level with the bloc formed by left-of center Labor and Green parties. The provincial lawmakers elected in Wednesday's vote choose national senators at the end of May.Losses suffered by members of Rutte's coalition weaken the government but could also strengthen their resolve to sit out their four-year term in office that ends in 2025 rather than face an early national election. They also will compound problems for Rutte in his attempts to drastically slash pollution from the country's agriculture, industry and transport sectors to protect vulnerable natural habitats.Victories in provinces across the nation of nearly 18 million for a party whose leader Caroline van der Plas is its only national lawmaker underscore a deep-rooted resentment of mainstream politics in the Netherlands that spreads far beyond the party's farming power base. With the count nearing completion, the BBB was forecast to become the biggest party in every province except the central province of Utrecht.“We are all normal people and all the people who voted for us are normal citizens,” Van der Plas said in a victory speech.“Normally, if people no longer trust the government, they stay home,"" she added. ""Today they showed they don't want to stay at home — they want their voices to be heard.”The party that traditionally has represented many farmers and conservative rural voters, the Christian Democrats, which is one of the four coalition parties, was one of the big losers in the vote Wednesday.Mid-term elections for the Netherlands' 12 provincial legislatures are often used by voters to register their anger at sitting governments, but the success can be fleeting as fickle populist voters shift their allegiances. Four years ago, the far-right populist Forum for Democracy won the biggest share of the vote, but on Wednesday it was decimated.Van der Plas describes her party as ""social right wing,"" with its initial focus on the future of farmers and rural communities now broadened to make it appealing to a far wider electorate. Political analyst Andre Krouwel of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam calls it “folksy nationalism.”Rutte, who came to power in 2010 and is the Netherlands' longest-serving leader, is a political survivor who is adept at forging alliances to push through his policies in the splintered Dutch political landscape.But Wednesday's result will make life in the senate — where his coalition already didn't have a majority — even tougher. With most votes counted, the BBB was projected to win 16 seats in the upper house and a combination of Labor and the Greens had 15. Rutte will face a choice of working with a left-leaning bloc that is seeking more ambition in environmental policies, or with the BBB that aims to soften policies aimed at cutting nitrate pollution.“There is a choice in the senate — left or right,"" Greens leader Jesse Klaver said.The governing coalition wants to cut emissions of pollutants, predominantly nitrogen oxide and ammonia, by 50% nationwide by 2030. Ministers call the proposal an “unavoidable transition” that aims to improve air, land and water quality.European Commission for Climate Action Frans Timmermans congratulated Van der Plas and her party on an “incredible result” and said she would now have to show how she can achieve her goals.“Let’s hope we can find solutions that benefit our natural environment and that give perspective to farmers, especially young farmers, who are looking for a sustainable future,” he said.The plans have sparked mass protests by farmers in recent years, including blocking supermarket distribution centers with tractors and torching hay bales alongside highways. At farms across the nation, the Dutch flag hangs upside down as a sign of protest.Some farmers took to Twitter on Thursday to say that they are now hanging the flag the right way up again following BBB's victory.The BBB party's popularity soared amid the protests. It was formed in 2019 and won 1% of the votes in the national election in 2021, with Van der Plas, a former agricultural journalist, becoming a national lawmaker and growing in popularity with her down-to-earth image. After her election in 2021, she was driven to the Dutch parliament in The Hague in a tractor.Van der Plas told Dutch broadcaster NOS on Thursday that the vote was about more than the farm pollution issue.“Nitrate is a symbol for dissatisfaction in the country,” she said, adding that many of her voters “feel unheard, unseen” by politicians in The Hague.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837902,Sonko court appearance sparks unrest in Senegal's capital,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Authorities forcibly removed Senegalese opposition leader Ousmane Sonko from his car Thursday and escorted him to a court appearance, blocking his supporters from following him and sparking unrest in parts of the capital.Police fired tear gas in several parts of Dakar to disperse protesters on the third day of demonstrations in support of Sonko, who finished third in the last presidential election and is seen as a leading contender in next year's vote.Some protesters set fire to buses belonging to Senegal's national public transport company and targeted French shops. Unrest also was reported in the city of Thies, 68 kilometers (42 miles) east of the capital, as well as in the southern towns of Ziguinchor and Bignona and in Saint-Louis in the country's north.Sonko maintains his legal troubles are part of an effort by President Macky Sall’s government to derail his candidacy in the 2024 election. The opposition figure has urged Sall to say publicly that he will not seek a third term in office.“The face of Senegal is the dictatorship of Macky with police repression,” Sonko told journalists Thursday afternoon.Earlier in the day, a convoy of opposition supporters spent more than a hour making its way between Sonko's home and the courthouse, where he was to appear in connection with a civil lawsuit against him by Senegal's tourism minister for alleged defamation.Once in court, Sonko asked to see a doctor saying he had been mishandled by police when they forced him out of his car. Judge Pape Mouhamed Diop postponed the hearing until March 30.In a separate matter, Sonko is also facing rape charges after a female massage salon employee came forward and accused him of assault. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and would be barred from running for president. No date is set for this trial.Thursday marks the second time in a month that Senegalese authorities have forcibly removed Sonko from his vehicle, saying his movements caused disruption. In mid-February, police smashed the window of his car so they could open the door and force him out.In 2021, days of deadly protests erupted after Sonko was arrested for disturbing public order while on his way to the courthouse for a scheduled appearance in the rape case. At least 13 people died during the worst violence to rock Senegal in years.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837908,European Union official praises Serbia's migration moves,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — The European Union's top security official on Thursday praised Serbia's handling of migration through the country, which lies at the heart of the Balkan route into Europe and borders several EU member nations.EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson also thanked Serbia, a candidate country for EU membership, for moving to align the country's visa policies with those of the EU. Johansson visited Serbia’s border with Hungary and planned to meet with top government officials.“My visit here today is to show the European Union’s commitment to strengthen our partnership with Serbia, to support Serbia,"" she said.A day earlier, Serbian authorities rounded up nearly 700 migrants in various regions in the country and moved them to reception centers. Photos released by police showed abandoned makeshift tents and people standing in groups.Authorities carried out several such raids in the past months, saying the aim was to combat people smuggling and to enhance security.Serbian Interior Minister Bratislav Gasic said authorities prevented 881 illegal crossings so far this year at the border with Hungary, where Serbian police officers patrol jointly with teams from Frontex, the EU's border agency.Hungary erected barbed wire fence along the border with Serbia in 2016 after more than 1 million people refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants entered Europe. Many people seeking to reach Europe without authorization pay smugglers thousands of euros (dollars) to take them on often dangerous journeys.A new cooperation deal between the EU and Serbia will allow Frontex to join Serbian police patrols on the country’s borders with non-EU member countries, such as North Macedonia and Bosnia, Johansson said.Serbia pledged to boost border enforcement after Hungary and Austria warned last year that more asylum-seekers and migrants were coming through the Balkans. Under pressure, Serbia also started requiring visas for citizens of countries such as Tunisia or Burundi, who had turned up in EU nations as asylum-seekers after entering Serbia freely.“I would like to publicly thank Serbian authorities,"" Johansson said. “This has … led (to a) significant reduction of irregular migratory flow to the EU, and I look forward to this process being completed.”Migrants typically enter Serbia from North Macedonia or Bulgaria before moving on toward Hungary, Romania or Croatia, which are EU members. Most refugees come from Syria or Afghanistan, followed by people from other countries in the Middle East, Asia or Africa.In the past several months, Serbian authorities claimed to have dismantled a number of smuggling gangs in border areas. Police reported finding drugs and weapons during raids.___Follow AP's migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837910,Seeking Alzheimer's clues from few who escape genetic fate,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Doug Whitney inherited the same gene mutation that gave Alzheimer’s disease to his mother, brother and generations of other relatives by the unusually young age of 50.Yet he’s a healthy 73, his mind still sharp. Somehow, the Washington man escaped his genetic fate.So did a woman in Colombia who dodged her own family’s similar Alzheimer’s destiny for nearly three decades.To scientists, these rare “escapees” didn’t just get lucky. They offer an unprecedented opportunity to learn how the body may naturally resist Alzheimer’s.“It’s unique individuals oftentimes that really provide us with breakthroughs,” said Dr. Eric McDade of Washington University in St. Louis, where Whitney’s DNA is being scoured for answers.The hope: If researchers could uncover and mimic whatever protects these escapees, they might develop better treatments — even preventive therapies — not only for families plagued by inherited Alzheimer’s but for everyone.“We are just learning about this approach to the disease,” said neuropsychologist Yakeel Quiroz of Massachusetts General Hospital, who helped study the Colombian woman. “One person can actually change the world -- as in her case, how much we have learned from her.”Quiroz’s team has a pretty good idea what protected Aliria Piedrahita de Villegas -- an additional genetic oddity that apparently countered the damage from her family Alzheimer’s mutation. But testing showed Whitney doesn’t have that protective factor so something else must be shielding his brain.Now scientists are on the lookout for even more Alzheimer’s escapees — people who may have simply assumed they didn’t inherit their family’s mutation because they’re healthy long after the age their loved ones always get sick.“They just think it’s kind of luck of the draw and it may in fact be that they’re resilient,” said McDade, a researcher with a Washington University network that tracks about 600 members of multiple affected families — including Whitney, the escapee.“I guess that made me pretty special. And they started poking and prodding and doing extra testing on me,” the Port Orchard, Washington, man said. “I told them, you know, I’m here for whatever you need.”Answers can’t come quickly enough for Whitney’s son Brian, who also inherited the devastating family gene. He's reached the fateful age of 50 without symptoms but knows that’s no guarantee.“I liken my genetics to being a murder mystery,” said Brian Whitney, who volunteers for Washington University studies that include testing an experimental preventive drug. “Our literal bodies of evidence are what they need to crack the case.”_____More than 6 million Americans, and an estimated 55 million people worldwide, have Alzheimer’s. Simply getting older is the main risk -- it’s usually a disease of people over age 65.Less than 1% of Alzheimer’s is caused by inheriting a single copy of a particular mutated gene. Children of an affected parent have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the family Alzheimer’s gene. If they do, they’re almost guaranteed to get sick at about the same age as their parent did.That near certainty allows scientists to study these families and learn critical information about how Alzheimer’s forms. It’s now clear that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms — a potential window to intervene. Among the culprits, sticky amyloid starts building up, followed by neuron-killing tau tangles.What happens instead in the brains of the resilient?“That’s why I’m here,” said Doug Whitney, who for years has given samples of blood and spinal fluid and undergone brain scans and cognitive exams, in the hunt for clues. “It's so important that people in my situation come forward.”Whitney’s grandparents had 14 children and 10 of them developed early-onset Alzheimer’s. The first red flag for his mother: Thanksgiving 1971, when she forgot the pumpkin pie recipe she’d always made from memory.“Five years later she was gone,""' Whitney said.Back then doctors didn’t know much about Alzheimer’s. It wasn’t until the 1990s that separate research teams proved three different genes, when mutated, can each cause this uniquely inherited form of the disease. They each speed abnormal amyloid buildup.Doug Whitney's family could only watch and worry as his 50th birthday came and went. His older brother had started showing symptoms at 48. (Some other siblings later were tested and didn't inherit the gene although two still don't know.)“We went through about 10 years when the kids would call home their first question was, ‘How’s Dad?’” his wife Ione Whitney recalled. “By the time he turned 60 we kind of went, wow, we beat the coin toss.”But not the way he’d hoped. In 2010, urged by a cousin, Whitney joined the St. Louis research. He also agreed to a genetic test he'd expected to provide final reassurance that his children wouldn’t face the same worry — only to learn he’d inherited the family mutation after all.“He kind of got leveled by that result,” Brian Whitney said.While Brian inherited the family gene, his sister Karen didn’t — but she, too, is part of the same study, in the healthy comparison group.___U.S. researchers aren’t the only ones on the trail of answers. In South America, scientists are tracking a huge extended family in Colombia that shares a similar Alzheimer’s-causing variant. Carriers of this mutated gene start showing memory problems in their early 40s.In contrast, one family member — Piedrahita de Villegas — was deemed to have “extreme resistance,” with no cognitive symptoms until her 70s. Researchers flew the woman to Quiroz’s lab in Boston for brain scans. And when she died at 77 of melanoma with only mild signs of dementia, her brain was donated to Colombia's University of Antioquia for closer examination.Her brain was jampacked with Alzheimer’s trademark amyloid plaques. But researchers found very little tau — and weirdly, it wasn't in the brain's memory hub but in a very different region.Clearly something affected how tau formed and where. ""The thing that we don’t know for sure is why,” Quiroz said.DNA offered a suspect: An ultra-rare mutation on an unrelated gene.That APOE gene comes in different varieties, including a version notorious for raising people’s risk of traditional old-age Alzheimer’s and another that’s linked to lower risk. Normally the APOE3 version that Piedrahita de Villegas carried makes no difference for dementia.But remarkably, both copies of her APOE3 gene were altered by the rare “Christchurch” mutation — and researchers think that blocked toxic tau.To start proving it, Quiroz’s team used preserved cells from Piedrahita de Villegas and another Colombian patient to grow some cerebral tissue in lab dishes. Cells given the Christchurch mutation developed less tau.“We still have more work to do but we’re getting closer to understanding the mechanism,"" Quiroz said.That research already has implications for a field that’s long considered fighting amyloid the key step to treating Alzheimer’s.Instead, maybe “we just need to block what’s downstream of it,” said Dr. Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging.And since Whitney, the Washington man, doesn’t have that extra mutation, “there may be multiple pathways for escape,” Hodes added.In St. Louis, researchers are checking out another clue: Maybe something special about Whitney’s immune system is protecting his brain.The findings also are fueling a search for more escapees to compare. The Washington University team recently began studying one who's unrelated to Whitney. In Colombia, Quiroz said researchers are looking into a few more possible escapees.___That search for answers isn’t just work for scientists. Whitney’s son Brian estimates he spends about 25 days each year undergoing different health checks and procedures, many of them far from his Manson, Washington, home, as part of Alzheimer's research.That includes every two weeks, getting hooked up to a pump that administers an experimental amyloid-fighting drug. He also gets regular brain scans to check for side effects.Living with the uncertainty is tough, and he sometimes has nightmares about Alzheimer's. He tries to follow what he now knows was his parents’ mantra: “Make the best of life till 50 and anything after that is a bonus.”He makes lots of time to go fishing and camping with daughter Emily, now 12, who hasn’t yet been told about the family gene. He hopes there will be some answers by the time she's an adult and can consider testing.“When I have a bad day and decide maybe I should not continue (the research), I think of her and then that all vanishes,"" he said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837911,"Japan, UK, Italy push joint fighter jet development by 2035","Japan, Britain and Italy reaffirmed their commitment Thursday to push joint development of a next-generation fighter jet as a centerpiece of their increasingly close defense ties in the face of growing threat from China, Russia and North Korea.In December, Japan announced a joint next-generation fighter jet development with the U.K. and Italy as it looks to expand defense cooperation beyond its traditional ally, the United States.The nations agreed to merge their earlier individual plans for development of next-generation planes — Japan's Mitsubishi F-X to succeed the retiring F-2s developed with the United States, and Britain’s Tempest, a successor to the Eurofighter Typhoon — to produce the new combat aircraft.On Thursday, Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada and his British and Italian counterparts, Ben Wallace and Guido Crosetto, confirmed their commitment to achieve the fighter jet deployment in 2035.The deal will give Japan greater support in countering China’s growing assertiveness and allow Britain a bigger presence in the Indo-Pacific region.Hamada said the joint fighter jet development is significant because it brings together technological advantages of the three countries to develop the advanced next-generation fighter and its necessary cutting-edge technology.Wallace and Crosetto said the security in Europe and Asia is inseparable. The environment in the Indo-Pacific is critical for Britain and Italy as well, according to the Japanese Defense Ministry. The two ministers stressed the importance of cooperation between them and with Japan, which is increasingly considered an important defense partner.The ministers also sat with industry representatives of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, BAE Systems and Leonardo, to exchange views while confirming a united effort between the governments and industries to meet the deployment goal, the Japanese defense ministry said.The new aircraft will be a multi-role stealth fighter superior to the F-35 and the Eurofighter, with advanced sensors and networking. The warplane is expected to replace 94 F-2s in Japan, 144 Eurofighters in the U.K. and 94 Eurofighters in Italy, Japanese officials have said.To counter growing threats from North Korea and China, Japan has been expanding its defense partnerships with countries in Europe, Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific, including Australia.Japan released an upgraded national security strategy in December that doubles the country’s defense spending in five years and acquires long-range cruise missiles to increase strike capability — a break from its postwar self-defense-only principle.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837912,"Foreign policy of Brazil’s Lula takes shape, irking the West","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil’s new President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has so far shown little concern about defying consensus in the West on foreign policy -- even when it comes to dealing with authoritarian governments.In recent weeks, Lula’s Brazil sent a delegation to Venezuela, refused to sign a UN resolution condemning Nicaragua’s human rights abuses, allowed Iranian warships to dock in Rio de Janeiro and flatly refused to send weapons to Ukraine, at war with Russia.These decisions have raised eyebrows in the U.S. and Europe, but experts said Lula is reactivating Brazil’s decades-old principle of non-alignment to carve out a policy that best safeguards its interests in an increasingly multi-polar world.Brazil’s foreign policy is based on its 1988 constitution, which establishes non-intervention, self-determination, international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as guiding principles.That involves “talking to all states at all times without making moral judgements, while respecting certain red lines,” said Feliciano Guimarães, a political scientist at the think tank Brazilian Center for International Relations. Lula’s red lines are not yet clear, he added.Last week a delegation from Brazil headed by Celso Amorim, a special advisor to the presidency and former foreign minister, went to Venezuela in the first high-level official visit in years. Diplomatic relations with the neighboring nation were severed under Lula's predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Venezuela's leftist president Nicolás Maduro is accused of trampling freedom of speech and persecuting political opponents.Amorim’s team met with both Maduro and the opposition. Maduro posted pictures of the meeting with Amorim on Twitter and praised the “pleasant encounter.”Brazil intends to promote democracy in Venezuela and push for greater transparency in elections, which is why the delegation met with both sides, according to an official at the foreign ministry who was not authorized to speak publicly.Brazil’s representatives at the United Nations in early March declined to sign a Human Rights Council declaration condemning Daniel Ortega’s regime in Nicaragua. Ortega’s government has cracked down hard on dissent, and last month deported and moved to strip Nicaraguan nationality from more than 200 dissidents -- drawing international rebuke over what was deemed a throwback and a form of banishment.In an interview with Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo, published March 10, Brazil’s Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said the declaration was not signed due to “differences in language and approach.” Vieira pointed to Brazil’s historical position of seeking dialogue first.But the controversy prompted the Brazilian government to later highlight that it was “extremely concerned” about reported human rights violations in Nicaragua and offer to welcome political refugees who have had their nationality stripped.Lula made diplomacy a priority during his previous presidency from 2003 to 2010, and Brazil was widely respected on the international stage. The BRICS group composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa was established in 2006.Lula and Amorim held talks with U.S. presidents and senior Iranian officials in an attempt to build peace, negotiating alongside Turkey to slow Iran’s uranium enrichment. The efforts ultimately failed, and Iran continued enriching uranium.Lula is seeking to reinsert Brazil on the global stage after Bolsonaro, who showed little interest in international affairs beyond asserting his affinity for other right-wing nationalists such as Israel’s Benyamin Netanyahu and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. He reserved special adulation for former U.S. President Donald Trump.Bolsonaro’s trips abroad were few and far between. Lula quickly showed a different tack, heading to Argentina in the first month of his presidency to meet with his counterpart, Alberto Fernández.The returning president also wants to create of a group of countries, possibly including India, China and Indonesia, to mediate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said Moscow was studying Lula’s proposal, according to Russia’s Tass news agency in February. He also shared that proposal with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a March 2 video call.But Lula’s refusal to send weapons to the invaded country has aggravated the West.“Lula’s government is applying the same principle of autonomy as during his first terms, but the global scenario has changed,” said political scientist Leonardo Paz from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank.The West’s tensions with Russia and China are sharper. But Russia is a key supplier of fertilizer to Brazil’s soybean plantations, and its exports have become dependent on China.China surpassed the U.S. as Brazil’s main trading partner in 2009. Their economic relationship has since only strengthened. Between 2007 and 2020, China invested US$66.1 billion in Brazil, according to the Brazil-China Business Council.“Brazil needs a strategy that allows it to maneuver. The principle of non-alignment allows it to have channels open with all states to protect itself,” Guimarães said.Brazil showed its will to pursue a foreign policy independent of the US and European countries when it allowed two Iranian warships to dock, Guimarães added.The move prompted rebukes from the US and Israel. “Hosting Iranian naval vessels sends the wrong message,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a briefing on March 9.She added: “But Brazil is a sovereign country and they are allowed to make their decision on how they’re going to engage with another country.”Another sign of Lula's budding foreign policy came this week with the announcement that as of Oct. 1 Brazil will reinstitute the requirement that citizens of the U.S. and three other nations obtain tourist visas, which Bolsonaro had scrapped even as the four countries continued demanding visas from Brazilians.Bolsonaro's decision had represented “a break with the pattern of Brazilian migration policy, historically based on the principles of reciprocity and equal treatment,” the foreign ministry said in a statement Monday.___Bridi reported from Brasilia.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837913,Jen Psaki enters TV's weekend fray with show starting Sunday,"NEW YORK (AP) — Seven months into her new television career, it's clear that Jen Psaki didn't sign with MSNBC to just dabble in the media.The former White House press secretary was up early Monday to appear on the 6 a.m. Eastern hour of “Morning Joe” and spoke to Lawrence O'Donnell on “Last Word” 16 hours later. She taped an appearance on Stephen Colbert's “Late Show” on CBS in between.She's got a new show to promote — her Sunday series “Inside with Jen Psaki” premieres this weekend — yet that doesn't fully explain the busy schedule.“When I look at Jen and her potential, she's absolutely a big part of our future,” said MSNBC President Rashida Jones. “You've seen that already.”The network is banking on Psaki and her popularity with MSNBC's liberal audience. She's already taken a seat at the anchor desk on big events like midterm election night and her former boss' State of the Union address, and makes frequent appearances on day-to-day shows.She will write a regular column for the network's morning newsletter and is developing a yet-to-be-described show for the Peacock streaming service.Given that she reached the apex of her previous profession, there seems less chance she'll turn into one of those figures that jumps back and forth between politics and the media.Psaki, who was spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department from 2013-2015 and was Barack Obama's last White House communications director before serving President Joe Biden, said she considers herself retired from the world of political and government communications.“I'm not looking in the rearview mirror,” she said.She's been concentrating on learning new skills, like reading a TelePrompter. Her previous jobs showed she was comfortable talking on camera; Jones has been watching carefully to see if she can fruitfully move a conversation along as an interviewer.Skill at filibustering is less valued in her new profession.“I've also been learning how to keep track of time,” Psaki said, “which sounds like a funny thing, but it turns out you can't just keep talking because they'll cut you off and have to end the show.”Her new program, which will air at noon Eastern time, puts Psaki in the company of long-running Sunday public affairs shows like “Meet the Press” or “Face the Nation.”There's an expectation in that territory that you'll have guests that can be pushed to produce news, not just the commentary that clogs many cable news hours.“I think it will be a place where people will want to come and make news,” Jones said. “Jen has a way about her where people want to have a conversation with her and I think it will become a destination, not only for the top guests and newsmakers, but also for our audience.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams will be the first “Inside” guest on Weekend Routine, what Psaki plans as a regular feature to get to know a newsmaker in a less formal setting. She rides the subway with him and he makes them a smoothie in Gracie Mansion, along with answering questions about politics, immigration and crime.In a future episode, she goes hunting for vinyl records with 26-year-old U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida.Another planned segment, Don't Freak Out, has Psaki using her policy experience to explain why some stories aren't as big as they seem. “There's often a view that everything is a five-alarm fire, and it's not,” she said.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are also guests on her first show.To make herself a true player in Sunday morning journalism, Psaki will need more than Democrats to appear. Psaki said she hopes her background explaining national security issues will make Republicans who want to talk about those issues comfortable on her show, for example.She won't just interview people she agrees with “because I don't think that's very interesting,” she said.Despite standing at a White House lectern defending President Joe Biden, Psaki said she understands that's no longer her role now that she's at MSNBC.“I have made it clear when I think some things could have been handled better,” she said. “I'm not going to shy away from that. I'm also not going to shy away from the fact that I was proud to work for President Biden, proud to work for President Obama and Secretary (John) Kerry.”",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837918,Tanzania's first female president on visit to South Africa,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan, on a state visit to South Africa, has urged more security cooperation and trade between the two countries.Hassan, Tanzania’s first female leader, met South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the capital Pretoria on Thursday where her delegation of Cabinet ministers discussed trade opportunities and possible agreements with their South African counterparts.This is Hassan’s first official visit to South Africa since she became president of Tanzania following the death of her predecessor John Magufuli in 2021.“We have agreed to enhance our cooperation in the areas of trade and investment considering that South Africa is among the main sources of direct foreign investment in Tanzania,” said Hassan. She added that tourism and manufacturing are the leading sectors for investment.Ramaphosa said trade volumes between Tanzania and South Africa continued to increase but could be improved further.“A key aspect of our bilateral cooperation is the promotion of trade and investment between our two countries,"" said Ramaphosa. “President Hassan and I will be joining the South Africa-Tanzania Business Forum later today, which brings together business people from our respective countries.”He said among the industries under discussion at the business forum are agriculture and agro-processing, oil and gas, mining and infrastructure development.The two leaders also noted their countries’ long-standing relations stretching back to the anti-colonial struggle.Many South African anti-apartheid activists, who fled the country under persecution from the repressive white-minority government or to join the African National Congress’s underground armed movement, found refuge and received military training in Tanzania.Among global challenges, the leaders noted the effect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on African nations, including the interruption of the supply of agriculture-related products such as fertilisers which have exacerbated the continent's food security situation problems.Hassan is set to host United States Vice President Kamala Harris when she visits Africa at the end of March as the U.S. continues its outreach to African countries.Harris’s trip to Africa follows visits by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, first lady Jill Biden and the current trip of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. All have encouraged stronger U.S. ties with African nations in the face of competition from China and Russia.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837919,Brothers Khéphren and Marcus Thuram are both in France squad,"PARIS (AP) — Brothers Khéphren and Marcus Thuram were called up by France coach Didier Deschamps on Thursday for upcoming European Championship qualifiers against the Netherlands and Ireland.They are the sons of former France defender Lilian Thuram, who played alongside Deschamps when France won the World Cup in 1998 and the European Championship in 2000.It is the second time Deschamps has selected brothers in his squad, with Lucas and Théo Hernandez playing for France at the World Cup in Qatar last year, along with forward Marcus Thuram.Marcus Thuram is the elder brother of the 21-year-old midfielder Khéphren, who was called up for the first time after impressing with French club Nice this season.France hosts the Netherlands at Stade de France on March 24 and plays Ireland in Dublin three days later.France lost the 2022 World Cup final on penalty kicks following a 3-3 draw with Argentina, which beat the Netherlands on penalties in a tense quarterfinal match.Veteran goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and central defender Raphaël Varane, who both won the World Cup in 2018, retired from the national team after the loss to Argentina.Deschamps is rebuilding his squad somewhat, and called up Lens goalkeeper Brice Samba and Chelsea center back Wesley Fofana for the first time.With Lloris now retired, Deschamps must choose a new captain with Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappé among the leading contenders. Mbappé became only the second player to score a hat trick in a World Cup final when France lost to Argentina.Deschamps refused to answer any questions about Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema, who as expected was not in the squad following a rift between them.Benzema left the World Cup in Qatar with a leg injury. He has since disputed the version of events given by Deschamps in a newspaper interview with cryptic messages and emojis online.“I don't look at social networks,” Deschamps said, adding that he would not comment further on Benzema.___France Squad:Goalkeepers: Mike Maignan (AC Milan), Alphonse Areola (West Ham), Brice Samba (Lens)Defenders: Théo Hernandez (AC Milan), Jules Koundé (Barcelona), Benjamin Pavard (Bayern Munich), Wesley Fofana (Chelsea), Dayot Upamecano (Bayern Munich), Eduardo Camavinga (Real Madrid), William Saliba (Arsenal), Ibrahima Konaté (Liverpool)Midfielders: Adrien Rabiot (Juventus), Aurélien Tchouaméni (Real Madrid), Youssouf Fofana (Monaco), Khéphren Thuram (Nice), Jordan Veretout (Marseille)Forwards: Kylian Mbappé (Paris Saint-Germain), Olivier Giroud (AC Milan), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid), Moussa Diaby (Bayer Leverkusen), Randal Kolo Muani (Eintracht Frankfurt), Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich), Marcus Thuram (Borussia Mönchengladbach)___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837920,Toney gets England call-up as potential gambling ban looms,"With a possible suspension looming for apparently breaching multiple gambling rules, Ivan Toney was called up by England for its upcoming European Championship qualifiers as a reward for being the third-leading scorer in the Premier League.It is the second time the Brentford striker has been summoned by England. The first was ahead of Nations League qualifiers in September but he didn't get onto the field and failed to make the squad for the World Cup a few weeks later.Toney has scored 16 league goals for Brentford this season — only Erling Haaland and England striker Harry Kane have more — but his future is clouded after being charged with a total of 262 breaches of the Football Association’s gambling laws, dating back to 2017.Sections of the British media reported this month that Toney has admitted to the majority of the breaches and was facing a lengthy spell out of the game. That led to Toney criticizing the FA about the process behind his impending disciplinary hearing and over what he perceives to be potential lapses of confidentiality as he prepares to argue his case.The issue hasn't stopped England coach Gareth Southgate from selecting Toney as one of six forwards in a 25-man squad ahead of Euro 2024 qualifiers against Italy and Ukraine.“The fact is, he is available for his club,” Southgate said about the selection of Toney. “There hasn’t been a trial as yet or any judgment so I don’t know on what basis we wouldn’t pick him.”They are England's first games since the national team lost to France the World Cup quarterfinals in December.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

It was transformed into a church in 609, called the Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs, and Mass is regularly celebrated there.Under the new plan, visitors under 25 years of age will be charged 2 euros. Entrance will be free to Rome residents, minors, people attending Mass and personnel of the basilica, among others.No date was given for the introduction of the fee, as officials work out technical details. Currently, entrance is free and reservations are required on weekends and public holidays.___This story has been edited to delete incorrect numbers of visitors to the Pantheon and Coliseum.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837922,7 deputies charged with murder in the death of Irvo Otieno,"DINWIDDIE, Va. (AP) — Video from a state mental hospital shows a Black Virginia man who was handcuffed and shackled being pinned to the ground by seven deputies who are now facing second-degree murder charges in his death, according to relatives of the man and their attorneys who viewed the footage Thursday. Three people employed by the hospital have also been charged.Speaking at a news conference shortly after watching the video with a local prosecutor, the family and attorneys condemned the brutal treatment they said Irvo Otieno, 28, was subjected to, first at a local jail and then at the state hospital where authorities say he died March 6 during the admission process.They called on the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in the case, saying Otieno's constitutional rights were clearly violated.“What I saw today was heartbreaking, America. It was disturbing. It was traumatic. My son was tortured,"" said Otieno's mother, Caroline Ouko.Otieno's case marks the latest example of a Black man's in-custody death that has law enforcement under scrutiny. It follows the the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year and comes nearly three years after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.Ben Crump, who represented Floyd's family and is now working with Otieno's, quickly drew a comparison.“It is truly shocking that nearly three years after the brutal killing of George Floyd by police, another family is grieving a loved one who allegedly died in nearly the exact same manner — being pinned down by police for 12 agonizing minutes,"" Crump said in a statement.Mark Krudys, another attorney for Otieno's family, said at the news conference that the video showed all seven of the deputies now facing charges pushing down on Otieno, who was in handcuffs and leg irons.“You can see that they’re putting their back into it. Every part of his body is being pushed down with absolute brutality,"" he said.Ten people so far have been charged with second-degree murder in Otieno's death. The seven Henrico County Sheriff's deputies were charged Tuesday and additional charges were announced Thursday against three people who were employed by the hospital.The footage the family watched Thursday has not been publicly released. But Dinwiddie County Commonwealth’s Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill also described it in court Wednesday, saying at the first hearing for the deputies that Otieno was smothered to death, local news outlets reported.Baskervill said Otieno did not appear combative and was sitting in a chair before being pulled to the ground by the officers, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.She announced Thursday in a news release the additional charges against the hospital employees: Darian M. Blackwell, 23, of Petersburg; Wavie L. Jones, 34, of Chesterfield; and Sadarius D. Williams, 27, of North Dinwiddie. They were being held without bond, and it wasn’t immediately clear if they had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. A spokeswoman for the state police said she didn’t know if they had obtained counsel, and none were listed in court records. The news release did not say what role they are alleged to have had in Otieno's death.Additional charges and arrests are pending, Baskervill said.Otieno, who was a child when his family emigrated from Kenya and grew up in suburban Richmond, had a history of mental health struggles and was experiencing mental distress at the time of his initial encounter with law enforcement earlier this month, his family and their attorneys said.That set off a chain of events that led to him spending several days in custody before authorities say he died March 6 as he was being admitted to Central State Hospital south of Richmond.Krudys said the footage from the hospital also showed a lack of urgency to help Otieno after the deputies determined ""that he was lifeless and not breathing.”Otieno was a deeply loved young man, an aspiring musician who had been a well-known high school athlete, Krudys said.“There is goodness in his music and that's all I'm left with now — he's gone,” Ouko said at the news conference while clutching a framed photo of her son.“I cannot be at his wedding. I’ll never see a grandchild ... because someone refused to help him. No one stood up to stop what was going on,” she said.Otieno was first taken into custody March 3, according to a timeline provided by Henrico County Police, a separate agency from the sheriff's office.The police department said in a news release that officers encountered Otieno while responding to a report of a possible burglary in suburban Richmond, and that based on his behavior, they put him under an emergency custody order and took him to a local hospital for evaluation.According to Krudys, Otieno was experiencing a mental health crisis and a neighbor called police over concerns about him gathering lawn lights from a yard. He said Otieno's mother tried to de-escalate the initial response from a crowd of police officers and said the family supported him being taken to a hospital for treatment.But while he was at the hospital, police said he “became physically assaultive toward officers, who arrested him” and took him to a local jail that is managed by the Henrico Sheriff’s Office, where he was served with several charges.While Otieno was in jail, he was denied access to needed medications, the family attorneys said. The family also viewed video from that facility on Thursday, which they said showed Otieno was subjected to further brutality by unidentified officers.Crump said he was pepper sprayed, and Krudys said the video showed officers on March 6 charging into his cell, which was covered in feces, as Otieno was naked and handcuffed. The video shows officers carrying an “almost lifeless” Otieno out by his arms and legs “like an animal” to a vehicle to be transported to the state hospital.“My son was treated like a dog, worse than a dog,"" Ouko said.Shannon Taylor, the commonwealth’s attorney for Henrico County, said in a statement Thursday that she’s conducting a review of what happened in the jail that day, and she pledged to release her findings. The Henrico sheriff declined comment beyond a statement released earlier in the week.Around 4 p.m. on March 6, employees of the sheriff's office arrived at Central State Hospital to admit Otieno, according to Baskervill. It was not until 7:28 p.m. that evening that state police were called to investigate his death, she said.In court Wednesday, a defense attorney suggested that two medical injections Otieno received may have played a role in his death, which Baskervill disputed, the Times-Dispatch reported.The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has not released its final determination on how Otieno died.Two of the deputies were released on bond, according to court records and local media. The others remained in custody, with hearings set for next week.Edward Nickel, an attorney for Deputy Bradley Disse, one of the defendants who was released, said in an email Thursday that Disse has served “honorably” during a 20-year career with the sheriff's department.“He is looking forward to his opportunity to try this case and for the full truth to be shared in court and ultimately vindicated,” Nickel said in an email.The Associated Press sent emails and other inquiries and left messages Thursday attempting to reach attorneys listed in court records for the other deputies.The Henrico Fraternal Order of Police-Lodge 4 stood by the deputies in a statement posted to social media on Tuesday, urging against a rush to judgment and stressing that the charges are yet to go through the rigors of the legal system.News outlets, including AP, have sought video of the altercation. Officials are withholding it, citing the pending investigation. Crump said Thursday the family believes the public should see the footage.“How do we build trust unless we have transparency, and then we have accountability?” he said.___Associated Press reporter Ben Finley in Norfolk contributed to this report.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837923,Titans release OLB Bud Dupree after 7 sacks in 2 years,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Tennessee Titans released outside linebacker Bud Dupree two years into a five-year contract, parting ways with the big free agent they acquired in 2021 to boost their pass rush, the team announced Thursday.The Titans announced Thursday afternoon that wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine signed a one-year deal and defensive lineman Naquan Jones signed his tender as an exclusive rights free agent.Dupree signed a contract worth up to $82.5 million contract in March 2021 after spending his first six seasons with Pittsburgh. The Titans signed Dupree despite the 6-foot-4, 269-pound linebacker tearing an ACL in early December 2020.He was waived Wednesday night. Dupree becomes the latest veteran cut by Tennessee's new general manager Ran Carthon, joining three-time Pro Bowl left tackle Taylor Lewan, wide receiver Robert Woods, center Ben Jones, kicker Randy Bullock and linebacker Zach Cunningham.Dupree had been due the second-highest base salary on the Titans' roster at $17 million, along with a bonus of $3.2 million. He was set to count $20.2 million against the cap, according to Spotrac.com.With a dead cap hit of $10.8 million, the Titans get a cap savings of only $9.35 million.The linebacker started the 2021 season opener, but struggled coming off the torn ACL. He had one sack in his first seven games and wound up on injured reserve with a hip injury. Dupree started only six of the 11 games he played in 2021, and he played in only 11 games in 2022.Dupree, who had 39 1/2 sacks in Pittsburgh, finished with only seven sacks over 22 games with Tennessee.Westbrook-Ikhine joined the Titans as an undrafted free agent out of Indiana in 2020. He has started 21 of 47 games and has 66 catches for 906 yards and seven touchdowns for his career.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837947,Officials say 21 workers killed at coal mine in Colombia,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Rescue operations at a coal mine in central Colombia that collapsed earlier this week ended Thursday and officials said the accident had left 21 workers dead.The mine near the town of Sutatausa collapsed late Tuesday following an explosion that blocked several of its entrances. Rescue teams worked nonstop for more than 30 hours to find survivors and retrieve bodies.Nicolás García, the governor of Cundinamarca province, said nine workers survived the accident and had been released from hospital, while the relatives of miners who were killed were receiving psychological support. Officials said all of the workers who were at the mine at the time of the accident had been accounted for.Colombian Minister of Mines Irene Velez said Thursday that the explosion was caused by methane inside the mine. She said the complex would remain closed until officials investigate how the explosion occurred.Mining accidents are common in Colombia, particularly in coal and gold mines. Last year 117 accidents were registered at mines throughout the country by the National Mining Agency, which says that 146 workers were killed in those incidents.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837948,Russia OKs alternative civil service for mobilized believer,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A court in Russia on Thursday affirmed the right of a man mobilized to fight in Ukraine to perform an alternative form of civil service due to his stated religious beliefs, setting a precedent that could persuade more reluctant draftees to try to get out of military service.The Leningrad Regional Court upheld a ruling of a lower court that deemed the drafting of Pavel Mushumansky unlawful and said he was entitled to fulfill his duty in another way, Mushumansky’s lawyer, Alexander Peredruk, said.Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a call-up of army reservists in September. Although officials said 300,000 men were drafted as planned, the mobilization also spurred resistance. Tens of thousands of men fled the country, and some of those who stayed ignored their summons.Others contested enlistment in the courts, including by claiming a right to alternative service, which entails taking up a paying job at state-run institutions or organizations. Those opting for alternative service often work in hospitals, care homes or post offices.Peredruk told The Associated Press in a phone interview that Thursday's ruling was the first of its kind since the mobilization began amid Moscow's increasingly bogged-down military operation in Ukraine.The publicly known attempts by other draftees to opt for alternative civil service failed, even though the right to be assigned to civil labor if military service goes against a person's beliefs is guaranteed under the Russian Constitution.Enlistment officials and courts argued that only regular conscripts were eligible for substitute service and that Russia does not have a law allowing such an option during a mobilization.Mushumansky, an evangelical Christian from Gatchina, a city southwest of St. Petersburg, contested the decision to call him up on the grounds of his religious beliefs, Peredruk said. According to media reports, he was allowed to carry out alternative civil service in 2019 instead of a mandatory stint in the military as a conscript and worked for almost two years in a psychiatric care home.Last year, he received a call-up summons just days after Putin announced a “partial mobilization."" Mushumansky went to the enlistment office to apply for the alternative service but was turned down and assigned to a military unit.While challenging the decision in court, he refused to wear a uniform or to obey orders from his commanders.In November, a court in Gatchina sided with Mushumansky, but enlistment officials appealed the ruling. The regional court's Thursday decision takes immediate effect, according to Peredruk.The lawyer hailed the ruling as not only an important one for his client, but also as an important example of Russian courts “making the right decisions from the point of the view of the constitution” and being “guided correctly by the norms of the law.”“The key question was, what to do if there is no law (outlining alternative military service during mobilization)?” Peredruk said. “The courts (in Mushumansky's case) gave an absolutely correct response: in this case, you implement the Constitution.”The court ruling comes amid growing fears of a second mobilization. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having plans for one, but rights advocates and media outlets in Russia reported this week that men in several dozen regions were being served summons to either go to an enlistment office to update their personal records or to take part in military training.Russian authorities declared the call-up completed in late October. However, some Russian lawyers and rights groups pointed out that Putin’s decree ordering it remained in effect until the president issues another decree, formally ending the mobilization and invalidating the previous document.Reporters have asked Putin whether he would do so, and the Russian leader promised to “consult with the lawyers.” The Kremlin later acknowledged the decree still stood but said call-up efforts have ceased.",2023/3/17,,World

Its LauncherOne rockets are launched from the air from modified Virgin passenger planes, allowing the company to operate more flexibly than using fixed launch sites.In January, a mission by Virgin Orbit to launch the first satellites into orbit from Europe failed after its rocket’s upper stage prematurely shut down. The failure was a disappointment for Virgin Orbit and British space officials, who had high hopes that the launch, which took off from Cornwall in southwest England, would mark the beginning of more commercial opportunities for the U.K. space industry.The company said last month that an investigation found that its rocket's fuel filter had become dislodged, causing an engine to become overheated and other components to malfunction. The nine small satellites it carried fell back to Earth and landed in the Atlantic Ocean.""Our investigation is nearly complete and our next production rocket with the needed modification incorporated is in final stages of integration and test,"" Virgin Orbit said in its statement Thursday.The company has said that its next launch will take place from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California for a commercial customer. It hasn't provided a date.Virgin Orbit has completed four successful satellite launches so far from California for a mix of commercial and U.S. government defense uses. Other than the U.K., it also has ambitions to expand its operations to mainland Europe and South Korea.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837950,Stephen Sondheim's last musical finds a New York City stage,"NEW YORK (AP) — The late Stephen Sondheim's last stage musical — an adaptation of two films by Spanish surrealist director Luis Buñuel — will be given an off-Broadway stage this year, offering theatergoers a chance to see a new work by musical theater’s most venerated composer.“Here We Are” — once known as “Square One” — will begin performances this September at The Shed’s Griffin Theater with a book by David Ives, best known for the play “Venus in Fur.” Joe Mantello, who helmed “Wicked” and Sondheim's “Assassins,” will direct.The show — based on the films “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” and “The Exterminating Angel” — was initially workshopped in 2016 with plans for a production at The Public Theater, which did not happen.The two source films have a connective tissue: In “The Exterminating Angel,” a group of guests arrive for a dinner party and cannot leave, while ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” is about guests who constantly arrive for dinner but are never able to eat.Ticket information and casting will be announced soon.Sondheim, who died in 2021, influenced several generations of songwriters, particularly with such landmark musicals as “Company,” “Follies” and “Sweeney Todd.”Six of Sondheim’s musicals won Tony Awards for best score, and he also received a Pulitzer Prize (“Sunday in the Park”), an Academy Award (for the song “Sooner or Later” from the film “Dick Tracy”), five Olivier Awards and the Presidential Medal of Honor. In 2008, he received a Tony Award for lifetime achievement.His last new musical to be produced was “Road Show,” which reunited Sondheim and writer John Weidman and spent years being worked on. This tale of the Mizner brothers, who embarked on get-rich schemes in the early part of the 20th century, finally made it to the Public Theater in 2008 with poor reviews after going through several different titles, directors and casts.Several Sondheim musicals have been mounted on Broadway since the master's death, including a Tony-award winning revival of “Company” and a current revival of his “Sweeney Todd,” starring Josh Groban.___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/3/17,,World

The search teams there were still looking for one missing person.In Adiyaman, two people drowned after a container home sheltering a family of earthquake survivors was washed away by surging waters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837966,France bypasses parliament to force through pension reform,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday has decided to force through his controversial pension reform without calling a vote in parliament, using a constitutional power enabling the government to bypass lawmakers.The decision was made just a few minutes before the vote was scheduled, because the government had no guarantee that the bill would command a majority at the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament.""We cannot bet on the future of our pensions,"" French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne told parliament as she invoked article 49.3 of the French constitution, to jeers from the left-wing opposition, who also loudly sang the French national anthem the Marseillaise in protest.Article 49.3 of the constitution allows the French government to pass a draft law by decree, effectively bypassing lawmakers. The risky move has the potential to trigger a quick no-confidence motion in Macron's government.Earlier Thursday, the Senate adopted the bill in a 193-114 vote, a tally that was largely expected since the conservative majority of the upper house of parliament favors raising the retirement age.Macron's alliance lost its parliamentary majority last year, forcing the government to count on conservative lawmakers to pass the bill. Leftists and far-right lawmakers are strongly opposed and conservatives are divided, which made the outcome unpredictable.The pension reform bill, seeking among other things to raise the standard retirement age from 62 to 64, is a flagship policy for President Macron.He tried and failed to implement similar reforms in his first term, eventually abandoning the plan altogether amid the COVID pandemic.Macron's government argues the changes are necessary to keep one of western Europe's most generous pension systems solvent.The plans have prompted mass strikes and demonstrations.dh/msh (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/3/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837967,"Celebrating Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the free-thinker","The Würzburg Mozart Festival's artistic director, Evelyn Meining, wanted to focus the 2022 edition on innovative and boundary-pushing elements. This inspired the festival motto: ""All in one: The freethinker Mozart,"" featured in this episode of DW Festival Concert.Mozart's music was both fascinating and provocative. It's well known, for instance, that he took many liberties when composing his music. But he transgressed boundaries outside of his compositions, as well.It was said he lacked respect for authority and that this made it hard for him to find a position as a court musician. So it may well have been against his own desires that he became one of the first composers of his generation to work independently of a court. A free spirit, who blazed his own musical trail and defied social conventions.The same holds true for much of the music of 20th century composer Igor Stravinsky. He was groundbreaking and he also drew on musical tradition, such as in the ""Concerto in D,"" also know as the ""Basel Concerto."" In this piece for string orchestra, Stravinsky used typical Baroque rhythms and dance forms.In this episode, we'll listen to Andrew Manze conducting the Bamberg Symphony performing Igor Stravinsky's Concerto in D, at the opening concert of the 2022 Würzburg Mozart Festival on May 21.Stravinsky wrote his Concerto in D in 1946 on commission from the conductor and patron Paul Sacher, who wanted a piece to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his Basel Chamber Orchestra. Sacher, a Swiss millionaire, commissioned around 250 pieces from contemporary composers over the course of his lifetime. In the 1980s, in a spectacular move, he acquired Stravinsky's entire estate.When Sacher came to Stravinsky with the commission request, the composer answered that he would only accept if the piece were no longer than 10 to12 minutes. To him, this was a matter of artistic freedom, as he himself said:  ""My freedom thus consists in my moving about within the narrow frame that I have assigned myself for each one of my undertakings.""In contrast to Stravinsky, other composers want as few restrictions as possible while composing. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one example.Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 often sounds relatively easy to play, but it's actually quite complex and profound. It's said that Mozart's father worried a great deal about whether his son's music would be well received by the average concertgoer.Würzburg festival director Evelyn Meining tells us more: ""Mozart's father, Leopold, reprimanded him over this piano concerto. He said he shouldn't compose such complicated pieces that flaunted his musical sophistication. ""Nowadays, Mozart's composition style is hardly ever described as too complicated or difficult, even though it was often labeled so in its time. Instead, these terms are applied to today's contemporary classical music.It's this idea that conductor Andrew Manze wanted to emphasize in the Bamberg Symphony's performance of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23, which featured Korean pianist Seong-Jin Cho as soloist.Next, we move on to a piece by German composer Isabel Mundry, whose work ""Traces des Moments,"" or ""traces of moments"" featured in the concert. She wrote the quintet for clarinet, accordion, violin, viola and cello in 2000.For conductor Andrew Manze, it was important that the concert program also include the freethinking composer Joseph Haydn, who was an important role model for Mozart. The conductor particularly wanted to perform Hadyn's Symphony No. 91 in E-flat major. Haydn wrote the piece in France, but it does not belong to his well-known series called the Paris Symphonies and is therefore frequently overlooked.We're going to now turn to the music of a Mozart contemporary: Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges. Born in 1732 in Guadeloupe to a Frenchman and an enslaved Senegalese woman, Bologne is sometimes referred to as the ""Black Mozart"" – a controversial label that critics argue diminish his musical and life achievements.He came to France as a child, where he played violin from an early age and went on to make a name for himself as a conductor. He later joined the Free Masons and led Le Concert Olympique, the largest and most preeminent French orchestra of the era, which performed in the Palais Royal in Paris.It was around this time that Bologne became acquainted with Joseph Haydn and asked him to compose for his orchestra. In 1784, Bologne premiered Haydn's symphonies 82 through 87, which are known as the Paris Symphonies. Bologne was also considered as the potential director of France's Royal Academy of Music, but racism ultimately prevented his appointment.Joseph Bologne wrote a handful of operas, over one hundred piano pieces, sonatas, string quartets, symphonies and violin concertos. He wasn't just musically talented. He was also a famous fencer, a good swimmer and an ice skater who was the talk of Paris society. During the French Revolution, he served as the colonel in the St Georges legion, which at the time, was the only regiment for people of color in all of Europe. In short, he was a pretty incredible and impressive person.His Violin Concerto No. 9 in G major has a beautifully lyrical, slow movement. It's performed by Jonian Ilias Kadesha, who really shines on the piece. Kadesha lives in Berlin, but he was born in Athens to Albanian parents. His father was the concertmaster of the Athens Symphony Orchestra.And that's all for this edition of DW Festival Concert with Cristina Burack.

""That's why we think it's important to keep documenting. We want to rebuild a platform for people to share their views because we believe deliberation can help Hong Kong grow in the way that it should.""Over the past year, several Hong Kong journalists abroad have founded similar media outlets, which share the goal of ensuring access to uncensored information.""We want to provide information to both the audience in Hong Kong as well as the diaspora community across the world,"" Jane Poon, a journalist with decades of experience who co-founded the online media outlet The Points, which covers a wide range of news, including developments in the Hong Kong Legislative Council, told DW. ""We just want to provide an environment like the one we used to have in Hong Kong,"" she added.""If you want to know what's happening in Hong Kong nowadays, the strongest bet is to look at the exile media,"" Steve Vines, a British journalist who spent more than 30 years in Hong Kong and is now director of the Association of Overseas Hong Kong Media Professionals told DW. ""More and more organizations are putting together newscasts and sharing information that is perhaps inaccessible in Hong Kong.""Overseas media outlets face multiple challenges. They have limited resources and personnel.""All of our staff work on a part-time or freelance basis, and that also means we still need full-time jobs on the side to sustain ourselves,"" Chan said. ""It is not easy to juggle all the responsibilities and find time for everyone to work together. Every day is trial and error for us, and we need to accept that we can't work perfectly.""Vines said overseas media outlets were also limited by the fact that they have less access to Hong Kong and because it is difficult to assess the risk to sources on the ground.""Everyone is aware of the limitation, and they are also nervous about compromising the safety of contributors in Hong Kong or China,"" he said, adding that overseas outlets also faced constant accusations of being ""one-sided.""The large-scale clampdown on journalists since the NSL was introduced has created a chilling effect in the city, with prominent figures, including Jimmy Lai, who founded the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, and top editors of the pro-democracy media outlet Stand News, appearing in trials.In 2022, Hong Kong dropped to No. 148 on the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index.Poon from The Points said overseas media outlets did not necessarily need to worry about being directly affected by the NSL, but that people might hesitate to subscribe because they could become targets. Thus, the outlets also often lack funds.""The NSL is a quite powerful measure to limit our sustainability, and, on top of that, as many Hong Kong people have moved to new countries recently, they need to save money for their everyday life,"" she said.In addition to ensuring independent coverage of Hong Kong-related news, Poon said, many of the new overseas outlets consider it part of their mission to preserve Hong Kong culture and language, particularly the mix of Cantonese and Mandarin.""In Hong Kong, the authorities are trying to take away the culture that we cherish,""she said, and they are trying to rewrite history.""Vines said that, in view of the Chinese government clampdown on Uyghur language and culture in Xinjiang since 2016, he would not be surprised if Beijing tried to adopt similar practices in other parts of China deemed ""rebellious.""""At the moment, what people rely on to maintain identity is the diaspora media, which is culturally Hong Kong,"" he said. ""The media doesn't just use Cantonese as a way to communicate. It also uses distinctive Hong Kong slang to express ideas.""For Chan, this is all part of the job: ""Maybe it seems very special now due to changes in Hong Kong and the diminishing space for press freedom, but our work hasn't actually changed much,"" she said. ""We didn't set up Green Bean Media with the intention to achieve huge goals. What we intend to do is to work on stories about Hong Kong, a humble and simple wish.""Edited by: Anne Thomas",2023/3/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837969,French actress Isabelle Huppert turns 70,"She has appeared in nearly 150 film and TV productions, displaying her versatility through a wide range of characters. Even though she has also acted in comedies, Isabelle Huppert is arguably most renowned for portraying cold women who behave in unexpected ways.In her long career, she has appeared in front of the camera for many of the great masters of cinema. Some critics rave about her as ""one of the best actresses in the world."" At the 72nd Berlin Film Festival in 2022, her achievement was appropriately honored: she received the Honorary Golden Bear for lifetime achievement.Now at 70, she is still making films. Her latest film, ""Mon Crime,"" a tragicomedy by filmmaker Francois Ozon, is currently showing in French cinemas.Huppert was born into success in Paris on March 16, 1953. Her parents — a mother who taught English and a father, an entrepreneur — were well-off. Although her father was of Jewish heritage, Isabelle and her four older siblings received a Catholic education. The fine arts had a natural place in their home.Huppert began attending her first acting classes at the age of 14, and was later admitted to the Conservatoire National Superieur d'Art Dramatique in Paris.By 18, she was in her first movie. At 23, she became an international movie star.Despite achieving stardom early in her career, she would never claim to have been lucky. ""Luck does not just fall miraculously from the sky,"" she once said in an interview with the women's magazine ""Brigitte."" She rather believes that everyone can create the conditions of their happiness.Huppert is relentless, and appears to be continuing to create the conditions she likes. She has a considerable body of work, and has been starring in two to three films a year for decades. Five titles are listed for release in 2022.Her trademark roles are extraordinary women marked by tragedy and surrounded by mystery.Her choices in roles and collaborations with some of the most renowned directors in the world, such as Michael Haneke (""The Piano Teacher"") and Claude Chabrol (""Violette Noziere""), have earned her a reputation as an ""intellectual actress.""This is however, inaccurate, she said in an interview with ""Zeit Magazine,"" because her films — even if they could be seen as intellectual — do not say anything about her. She rather sees herself as a ""tool"" of the directors, following their instructions exactly, with hardly any improvisation.Huppert expresses the moods and mental state of her characters with precision and great sensitivity. Her seemingly expressionless face and sparing facial expressions have become something of a trademark.Fiction has a tendency to inflate things, she told ""The Financial Times"" in July 2017. ""But when I look at people on the street, I find that most of them are pretty empty in their eyes. I have to do even less,"" she said. To observe, she has been taught, you have to take away, not add something.But her acting style, one of reduction, has meant that audiences and critics often view Huppert as unapproachable, cold. It's an image that does not do justice to the Frenchwoman, who is just 1.5 meters (4'9"") tall.She has been in a relationship with writer, producer and director Ronald Chammah since 1982; the couple have three children.Art and photography are among Huppert's passions. In her home, she collects photos and books. ""I want to hold tight to the positive memories from my life,"" she said.Huppert has appeared in around 140 films since 1972.She has found herself repeatedly working with some directors: Haneke, Paul Verhoeven, the late Chabrol and Bob Wilson.Working with them, she can inhabit extreme characters — ""survivors who can be victims and rebels simultaneously,"" the actor once said. ""My films give these women a voice. Because even though they live on the edges of society, they are there: women who live brutal lives. It's a brutality that they themselves never sought out,"" Huppert told ""Zeit Magazine.""Her portrayals in these challenging roles have already earned her numerous awards, including the most important ones in the film industry: the French Cesar, the European Film Award, Berlin's Silver Bear, Cannes' Best Actor Award and the Golden Globe. The statues decorate Huppert's home. All that is missing is the Oscar, an award for which she was nominated for the first time with ""Elle"" (2017), directed by Verhoeven.Of her acting capabilities, she said she has ""unlimited self-confidence.""""I never doubt. I have absolutely no fear,"" she told ""The Financial Times."" ""There are so many other areas where I am not that ... Crossing the street, meeting people ... Everything that's vital. But acting, nothing can intimidate me. Acting is never an obstacle. I do it without thinking. It's like eating or drinking.""Now, as she is crowned in Berlin for a lifetime of continuous success, one might ask: What more can Huppert hope to accomplish?As she told ""Brigitte"" magazine, sometimes, she does feel ""this slight meaningless phase of lazy exhaustion,"" though if she were to quit, she wouldn't know who to hand in her resignation to. She sometimes fantasizes about what she'd do instead. ""Clearly, though, I am in opposition to this daydream.""Update: This profile of Isabelle Huppert was originally written in German and updated on March 16, 2023, to commemorate the actor's 70th birthday.",2023/3/16,,

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said ""nothing is off the table"" after Zelenksyy asked for the jets.In Paris, Zelenskyy said: ""The sooner Ukraine gets long-range heavy weaponry, the sooner our pilots get planes, the sooner this Russian aggression will end and we can return to peace in Europe.""At the end of his trip in Brussels, Zelenskyy said decisions had been made in both London and Paris, where he met French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. No major announcements were made by the European Union leaders themselves either.Having secured pledges of hundreds of modern battle tanks, Ukraine has made no secret of the fact that it would like to receive modern fighter jets — such as the US-made F-16s because of their destructive power and global availability.Washington has not made any comments on whether it would give the fighter jets to Ukraine or allow other countries to re-export their own F-16 aircrafts.rm/rc (AP, Reuters)",2023/3/16,,

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as each was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Earlier, Edmonton Police Chief Dale McFee said the two officers were fatally shot when they arrived at an apartment building on a domestic dispute call around 12:47 a.m. He said there was no indication the officers were able to return fire.McFee said other officers sent to the apartment then found the young man dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He had said the shooter and woman were related without saying how or giving the suspect's age.The chief said the woman was in a life-threatening condition when taken to a hospital but was later listed in serious but stable condition.McFee identified the deceased officers as Travis Jordan, 35, who had been with the Edmonton force for 8 1/2 years, and Brett Ryan, 30, an officer for 5 1/2 years.“I can’t tell you how devastated we are with their loss,” McFee said.Ryan is being remembered as a pillar of the community and a longtime youth league hockey referee.Darcy Carter, with the Spruce Grove Minor Hockey Association, said the officer and his wife were expecting a child.Ryan was a paramedic before he became a police officer, and was passionate about his work in the police, Carter said. “That’s something that I’ll never forget … just his face lighting up when he talked about his job.”Jordan was remembered for his kindness.Jessica Shmigelsky said she was driving to work after a heavy spring snowfall in 2020 and Jordan pulled her over because her snow brush wasn't working. But instead of giving her a ticket, he cleaned off her ca, she said.“He did his job, and he did more than what his job really entailed,” Shmigelsky said.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his condolences and support to the officers' loved ones and colleagues.“Every day, police officers put themselves in harm’s way to keep people safe. The news that two ⁦‪Edmonton police‬⁩ officers have been killed in the line of duty reminds us of that reality,” Trudeau wrote.The killings are the first for the Edmonton Police Service since 2015, when Constable Daniel Woodall, a hate crimes investigator, was shot numerous times while using a battering ram to enter a residence. Another officer, Sgt. Jason Harley, was struck by a round that penetrated his body armor but survived.Before that, Constable Ezio Faraone was shot to death while responding to an armed robbery in 1990.",2023/3/17,,World

The identity of the fourth was not immediately known.Amateur video taken by people in Jenin appeared to show a crowd of Palestinians surrounding a car that people suspected carried undercover Israeli troops. In a video posted on social media, a crowd of people surround a car and hurl objects at it. Several gunshots ring out and the crowd starts to scatter. Another clip appeared to show Israeli military vehicles towing the car away.The army said that soldiers and armed gunmen traded fire, and that soldiers came under attack from stones. It reported no injuries to army personnel.Thursday’s deaths bring the number of Palestinians killed since the start of the year to 83 as Israel has stepped up arrest raids in the West Bank in response to a series of attacks last spring. Palestinian attacks against Israelis have killed 14 people in 2023.According to an Associated Press tally, about half of the Palestinians killed this year were affiliated with militant groups. Israel says most of the dead were militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions, some in their early teens, and others not involved in confrontations, including three men over 60, have also been killed.The current round of violence is one of the worst between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank in years. It began a year ago after a series of Palestinian attacks against Israelis that triggered near-nightly Israeli raids in the West Bank.Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in 2022, making it the deadliest year in those areas since 2004, according to the leading Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Palestinian attacks against Israelis during that same time killed 30 people.Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.

(AP) — A Kentucky university has agreed to a settlement of more than $14 million over the death of a student wrestler hours after practice, the school announced.The settlement over the death of junior Grant Brace, 20, of Louisville, Tennessee, includes an agreement for the University of the Cumberlands to participate in a heat-illness training program and to help raise awareness of heat-related injuries, the university said Wednesday in a statement.Brace's death on August 31, 2020 from heat stroke after he begged for water and was refused “was tragic and entirely avoidable,” news outlets reported, citing the lawsuit.Brace was diagnosed with narcolepsy and ADHD and was prescribed Adderall which requires maintaining hydration, according to the lawsuit.He died during the wrestling team's first training day of the season. After practice, the team had to sprint multiple times up and down a steep hill and Brace completed several before sitting down from exhaustion. The then-coach threatened to kick Brace off the wrestling team, so he ran up the hill again and was later heard saying “I’m done. I can’t do this anymore,” the lawsuit said.He begged for water and his condition continued to deteriorate, but the coaches didn't provide water or contact the trainer or emergency medical personnel, according to the lawsuit. Brace left and tried to drink from an outdoor water fountain that was not working. He also tried to get into a building but could not, and he collapsed. About 45 minutes later, the coaches found him dead with his hands clenched in the grass and dirt, according to the suit.The university said in a statement that it believed it could defend the claims asserted in the lawsuit, but the legal process would have been long and costly.“The University made the decision to settle the case now in a manner it hopes will respect the Brace family’s tremendous loss,” the statement said.It said the safety of students and athletes is a top priority and it ""welcomes the opportunity to work with the Brace family’s consultant to ensure it is providing the safest environment possible for student-athletes in all sports.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837974,"EU moves on clean technology: Subsidies up, free market down","BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union presented plans Thursday to fundamentally revamp its policies on promoting green technologies and dealing with critical raw materials, imposing limits on imports from countries like China while unleashing subsidies and other financial incentives to ramp up home production.The plans by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, are essential in moving toward a climate neutral economy, while also increasing the bloc's strategic independence in a shifting world of geopolitical alliances.To achieve its clean technology and strategic goals, the EU is making a major economic turn away from the decades of preaching the hands-off free-market economic gospel where any public policy input was considered meddling reminiscent of a bygone age. Now, the plans again call for accommodating state aid, a guiding hand, and financial incentives as key ingredients to move from a fossil fuel to a green economy.“The one mistake I think we’ve made — and the one mistake which would be old-fashioned industry politics — would be to have no industry politics. And that’s what we had for too long in Europe, thinking that the market would take care of everything itself,” said EU Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans.And eying China's state-managed economy, he said that Beijing has taken the lead in the green and clean tech sectors that will dominate the global economy. Now, the EU gets 98% of its rare earth materials and 93% of magnesium from China. “We now understand that the strategic choices China made a decade ago are now coming home to roost. And we also have to make our own strategic decisions now for the decades to come.”The lynchpin in the proposal is a commitment to produce at least 40% of the clean tech needed by 2030 in the 27-nation bloc, while at the same time ensuring that not more than 65% of consumption of any strategic raw material comes from a single third country — in practice, often China.On top of that, the plan foresees that financial incentives from member states will be welcomed much more and get faster approval. “It’s not old-fashioned. It’s what you need to do when you’re in the middle of an industrial revolution.”Standing besides Timmermans, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton could only say: “music to my ears.”The EU's move also comes after the $375 billion U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of last summer, when President Biden pushed through an incentives-laden and America-first clean energy law. After months of vehement protests on measures that would keep out EU products, the bloc has accepted a truce and Thursday's plans for the Net Zero Industry Act and the Critical Raw Materials Act underscored that joining with a similar program was better than being beaten by it.“I don’t agree at all on the fact that we lost the subsidy race,” said Breton. “This is why I said we are in motion ... And I believe this is what we did today.” The plans still need to be approved by the EU’s 27 member states and the parliament, a process that is set to take many months, perhaps over a year.The stakes are massive. The EU estimates that by the end of the decade the clean technology global market will be worth 600 billion euros a year. Also that the deployment of renewables will quadruple by 2050, the use of heat pumps will increase 6-fold by 2050, and that production of electric vehicles will increase 15-fold.Because state aid and many incentives come from the member states themselves and the EU has to approve them through relaxed regulation, the plans did not present exact overall estimates.At a geopolitical level, the stakes are no less great, and this is where the Critical Raw Materials Act comes in. Overall, these are used in anything from solar panels to heat pumps and electric cars.With incentives, the EU Commission wants by the end of the decade that at least 10% of the consumption of strategic raw materials is locally mined and at least 40% locally processed.At the same time as seeking to disengage from Chinese dependency by putting quotas on imports, the EU is seeking to build up a select Critical Raw Materials Club of alliances, with the likes of the United States and Canada, to further cement the Western bloc in an increasingly unstable global environment.""We’re strengthening our cooperation with reliable trading partners globally to reduce the EU’s current dependencies on just one or a few countries,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837977,Scholz voices concern on Israel overhaul as Netanyahu visits,"BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz voiced concern about the Israeli government's planned overhaul of the country's judicial system as he hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, offering praise for efforts by Israel's president to seek a “broad basic consensus.”Netanyahu met with German leaders in Berlin the day after Israeli President Isaac Herzog unveiled a compromise proposal for overhauling the legal system, an approach that Netanyahu rejected.Lower-level German officials already had voiced concern about the Israeli government's plan, which would allow parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions and give Netanyahu's parliamentary coalition the final say over all judicial appointments.Germany is a close ally of Israel in Europe and has tended to refrain from strong public criticism of its government.“As close friends of Israel with shared democratic values, we are following this debate very closely, and I cannot hide the fact that we’re following it with great concern,” Scholz said at a news conference alongside Netanyahu. “The independence of the judiciary is a precious democratic asset. We agree on that.”“It is good and valuable that President Herzog talked to a large of actors in society in order to counter a further polarization of Israel,” Scholz said. “Allow me to add that I think this search for a broad basic consensus is right and important.”Of Herzog's suggestion, Scholz said: “As friends of Israel, we would like the last word not to have to have been spoken on this proposal.”Netanyahu showed no sign of being swayed. “Israel was, is and will remain a liberal society,” he said.The prime minister argued that appeals for discussions with the Israeli opposition were “met with complete refusal” and that “there is a desire to reach a moment of crisis, perhaps a governmental breakdown, a search for new elections.”""If that continues, that's regrettable, but we will do whatever we think is the right thing to achieve something that corrects the imbalance that exists today between the branches of government and yet, at the same time, could over time be accepted as the best solution for Israel in line with my principles of keeping Israel a liberal, balanced democracy,” Netanyahu said.The leader of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, met Netanyahu himself earlier Thursday. Schuster said he voiced concern to the prime minister that “his government is increasingly dividing Israeli society and is squandering confidence in democratic Israel,” German news agency dpa reported.Around 500 Israelis protested at Berlin’s landmark Brandenburg Gate, waving Israeli flags, singing and holding up banners against Netanyahu's visit.“He is destroying our democracy for the sake of staying out of jail,” Nasich Philip, a project manager in construction who moved to Berlin nine years ago, said. ""He is sacrificing the whole country to protect himself and his family.”Germany and Israel share concerns about Iran's nuclear activities. Netanyahu has threatened military action against Iran’s nuclear program as it enriches uranium closer to weapons-grade levels.Germany is one of the world powers that entered a 2015 deal with Tehran to address concern about Iran's nuclear ambitions. The agreement unraveled after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States.“The Jewish state will do everything necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, period,” Netanyahu said, without giving details.“Our hope is that we will ultimately succeed in preventing this with a diplomatic solution,” Scholz said.___Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837978,Thai police to get mental health checks after fatal standoff,"BANGKOK (AP) — Police in Thailand will be subject to random checks of their physical and mental health, officials said Thursday, after a 27-hour standoff in which a senior officer holed up and fired a gun into the air until he was subdued by fellow officers.Police Lt. Col. Kitikarn Sangbun died in a hospital Wednesday night of multiple gunshot wounds sustained during the standoff at his home on the fringes of the capital Bangkok, said police Col. Rangsan Sornsing, superintendent of the police station in the Sai Mai neighborhood where the standoff took place.Kitikarn had been suffering from mental health issues and stress in his work and personal life, police said, without elaborating.Thai media reported that the police Inspector General's Office has ordered random health checks be carried out on officers nationwide to help avoid similar situations. Members of the public are also encouraged to report cases where they are concerned about officers' mental health.Kitikarn had holed himself up in his home Tuesday when fellow officers came to take him for psychiatric treatment, said deputy national police chief Gen. Torsak Sukvimol and other officials. He fired into the air and in the direction of police who arrived at the scene.Police evacuated and cordoned off the surrounding area as they tried several methods to apprehend him. In addition to initially using tear gas and stun guns in an effort to evacuate him, a junior officer sang for Kitikarn in an attempt to calm him down, intermittently asking him to turn himself in.But as the confrontation escalated, shots were exchanged between Kitikarn and the officers besieging him.Video of the end of the confrontation released by the police showed Kitikarn, clad in shorts and a T-shirt and clutching a carving knife in his left hand, smashing through a second-story window and leaping down into a small, cluttered backyard. He lay dazed for several seconds until police in full tactical gear rushed out from the house’s back door, seizing him roughly.Torsak said an autopsy performed Thursday showed that Kitikarn had suffered six gunshot wounds and died from blood loss.Torsak and other senior police officers expressed regret that the situation turned deadly, saying that police used real bullets only after exhausting other means to get the situation under control.Thailand’s deadliest massacre took place in October when a former police officer shot and slashed to death 36 people at a daycare center. The country’s previous worst mass killing involved a disgruntled soldier who opened fire in and around a mall in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima in 2020, killing 29 people and holding off security forces for some 16 hours before eventually being killed by them.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837979,Iranians facing economic crisis find little New Year's cheer,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's bazaars are packed ahead of the Persian New Year next week, but there's little holiday cheer as customers survey the soaring prices of meat and holiday treats, wondering if they can afford either. Others are there to sell goods on the sidewalks to make ends meet.Crippling Western sanctions, on top of decades of economic mismanagement, have plunged the country into a severe crisis. Iran's currency, the rial, recently dropped to a record low, essentially wiping out people's life savings and making even some basic goods unaffordable.Months of anti-government protests failed to unseat the ruling clerics and prompted a violent crackdown that further dashed hopes of any return to the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which lifted sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear program.As they bid farewell to a trying year, Iranians have little expectation that the next will be better.“People are out on streets, they are shopping, but nobody is happy in their hearts,” said Azar, a 58-year-old housewife. “I have nothing to do (with politics) but I can perceive this feeling completely. I understand this when looking at the faces of our kids, our young people.”She and other Iranians gave their first names only out of fear of retribution.Reza used to work as a day laborer but had to stop because of an injury. Now the 33-year-old sells clothes on the sidewalk. “I became a vendor out of frustration,” he said. ""I work in hot and cold weather outdoors because I have to.”“This year, the market is not good at all,"" he said. ""We were hoping the final days of the year would be better.”The rial plunged to an all-time low of 600,000 to the dollar last month, down from 32,000 to the dollar when the nuclear agreement was signed.Then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in 2018 and restored heavy sanctions, including on Iran's vital oil industry. Iran responded by openly exceeding the deal's restrictions on uranium enrichment and is now closer than ever to being able to build a nuclear weapon if it chooses to do so.Its decision to supply armed drones for Russia's war on Ukraine, and Iran's crackdown on protests, sparked by the death of a young woman in the custody of morality police in September, has further estranged it from the West. Talks on restoring the 2015 deal hit an impasse last summer.A strange wave of suspected poisonings in girls' schools across the country has added to the sense of crisis. Nearly four months after the first incidents were reported, it remains unclear who might be behind them or even what chemical — if any — was used. Iranian officials have suggested that at least some of the reported incidents are the result of mass hysteria.A Chinese-brokered agreement last week to restore diplomatic relations with regional rival Saudi Arabia led to hopes for a broader rapprochement with wealthy Arab states in the Persian Gulf that have long viewed Iran with suspicion. But the deal is unlikely to provide any immediate relief from Iran's economic woes.Iranian officials acknowledge an inflation rate of between 40% and 50%, but some economists believe the real rate is even higher. That makes nuts, candy and other staples for the New Year holiday, known as Nowruz, unaffordable for the growing ranks of low-income Iranians.Iranian authorities have blamed the crisis on the war in Ukraine, global inflation and a “currency war” waged by the country's enemies.But Iran's financial crisis began long before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and it isn't just the sanctions that are dragging the economy down.Iran's clerically-overseen government and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard have long had an outsized role in the economy, squeezing out the private sector and hindering growth. The country is heavily dependent on oil exports, reduced to a trickle by the sanctions.“The prices of everything have gone up multiple times, even goods that have nothing to do with the dollar,” Azar, the housewife, said. “Many people can’t really afford this, they are in trouble.""Mahnaz, a retired civil servant, said the fall in the local currency has slashed the pensions that he and others rely on.“Do people gather and celebrate? Everyone has to stay home, they have nothing to spend and they can’t go anywhere. In the past we would travel but now we can’t any longer. Because we don’t have money,” he said.“What can you do with $73 a month?” he asked. ""What can I do? Can I even buy chicken and meat?”",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837981,Ireland keen to seal first Six Nations Grand Slam in Dublin,"Ireland has been talking up England all week.The Irish have restyled their Six Nations rugby finale on Saturday into a Grand Slam party after tearing through Wales, France, Italy and Scotland.Anticipation is heavy of Ireland achieving crowning glory at a sold-out Lansdowne Road. The English have played their part by coming with reputations ravaged by a 53-10 mauling from France at Twickenham just a week ago.Ireland's protagonists don't believe it though. Flanker Peter O'Mahony says he isn't buying talk of a comfortable win. Cian Healy says its silly to think they can do what France did. Jack Conan says there's no easy games with England. Captain Jonathan Sexton calls England dangerous. Coach Andy Farrell adds England has a perfect opportunity to spoil the party.But who are they kidding?It's hard to see Ireland wasting an opportunity four years in the making.Farrell has built on predecessor Joe Schmidt's success by developing depth and creativity, playing more up-tempo and heads up. Ever since their first series win in New Zealand last July, the Irish have been ranked No. 1 and embraced the pressure to hold it. They haven't lost, their winning streak is up to nine tests. In the autumn, Ireland found ways to prevail. In this championship they have shown a ruthless efficiency.Consider the reactions of opposing coaches. Warren Gatland, whose Wales was blitzed in the first half, said, “Their game management was excellent.” After France lost for the first time in two years, Fabien Galthie said, “They play the rugby that people talk about.” Italy pushed Ireland all the way but Kieran Crowley said, “We couldn't see any weaknesses.” And when Scotland was plucked in the second half, Gregor Townsend said, “They showed what a quality side they are.”Grand Slam chances hardly get better than this with home advantage. A huge motivating factor is to be the first Ireland team to secure a Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road.The first Irish Slam in 1948 was completed in Belfast, 2009's in Cardiff, and 2018's in London.Neither has Ireland won the title in the Six Nations era at home, as it goes for its fifth title in this century.With all that is at stake, and all of it wrapped up on St. Patrick's weekend, Ireland has been at pains to say it must play the game and not the occasion. Healy says there's no danger of that with Sexton around.“Johnny has his own standards and all of us strive to get to those standards, and we get absolutely torn into when we don't. But we try,” Healy says.The match marks the 60th and last Six Nations appearance for Sexton (and probably Healy), who is retiring after the Rugby World Cup this year.Sexton is certain to receive an extra big cheer after his first points in the match, which will make him the highest point-scorer in championship history, breaking a tie with predecessor Ronan O'Gara.“It's more about the team this week,” Sexton says. “I'd never be able to live with myself if you don't turn up and play well. You take the emotion out of it, it's going to be emotional anyway. You're playing England at home with something on the line, so it's always what you've wanted to do and where you wanted to be.”Ireland lost to injury defense ringmaster Garry Ringrose and Lions lock Iain Henderson, and replaced them with Lions center Robbie Henshaw and Ryan Baird. First-choice scrumhalf Jamison Gibson-Park is also back.England's injuries were more of a blow, in losing its best back (Ollie Lawrence) and best forward (Ollie Chessum).To try and repair England's myriad problems in just a week, Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade are at 10-12-13 for the first time since 2019. But it won't matter if the pack doesn't toughen up.“I don't think they'll take us lightly, they'll give us the respect we deserve even off the back of the 50 points,” England prop Ellis Genge says. “Ireland have changed a lot in terms of their psyche. They used to love being an underdog team and now they're No. 1 in the world. They've got to back that up and I think they're a brilliant team. Now we're the underdogs.” ___Lineups:Ireland: Hugo Keenan, Mack Hansen, Robbie Henshaw, Bundee Aki, James Lowe, Jonathan Sexton (captain), Jamison Gibson-Park; Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier, Peter O'Mahony, James Ryan, Ryan Baird, Tadhg Furlong, Dan Sheehan, Andrew Porter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837984,Average long-term US mortgage rates come back down to 6.6%,"The average long-term U.S. mortgage inched back down this week after five straight weeks of increases, good news for homebuyers as the housing market's all-important spring buying season gets underway.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate slid back to 6.60% from 6.73% last week. The average rate a year ago was 4.16%.The average long-term rate hit 7.08% in the fall — a two-decade high — as the Federal Reserve continued to raise its key lending rate in a bid to cool the economy and quash persistent, four-decade high inflation.At its first meeting of 2023 in February, the Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by another 25 basis points, its eighth increase in less than a year. That pushed the central bank’s key rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. Many economists expect at least three more increases before the end of the year, though some have dialed those expectations back due to the recently developing banking crisis.While the Fed’s rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investors’ expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.Treasury yields have tumbled since the collapse of two mid-size U.S. banks, with the 10-year faling to 3.44% Thursday. The 10-year yield reached 5.07% last week, its highest level since 2007.The big rise in mortgage rates during the past year has roughed up the housing market, with sales of existing homes falling for 12 straight months to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years. January’s sales cratered by nearly 37% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported last month.For all of 2022, NAR reported last month that existing U.S. home sales fell 17.8% from 2021, the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since the housing crisis began in 2008.Higher rates can add hundreds of a dollars a month in costs for homebuyers, on top of already high home prices.The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, also edged back down this week to 5.9% from 5.95% last week. It was 3.39% one year ago.——",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837985,Abortion ban injunction upheld by N. Dakota Supreme Court,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The North Dakota Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a state abortion ban will remain blocked while a lawsuit over its constitutionality proceeds.The ban was designed to take effect once the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. But a district judge had put it on hold this summer while the Red River Women’s Clinic (RRWC) pursued a lawsuit arguing the state constitution protected a right to an abortion.“While the regulation of abortion is within the authority of the legislature under the North Dakota Constitution, RRWC has demonstrated likely success on the merits that there is a fundamental right to an abortion in the limited instances of life-saving and health-preserving circumstances, and the statute is not narrowly tailored to satisfy strict scrutiny,” Chief Justice Jon J. Jensen wrote in the ruling.The law — one of many abortion-restricting measures passed by state legislatures in anticipation of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on Roe — includes exceptions to save the life of the mother and in cases of rape or incest. Otherwise, a doctor who performs an abortion would face a felony charge, which abortion rights supporters say could stop doctors from performing abortions even if the mother’s health is at risk.The Red River Women’s Clinic — the state’s only abortion clinic — shut its doors this summer and moved operations a short distance from Fargo to Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion remains legal. But the clinic’s owner is still pursuing the lawsuit.“The court made the right decision and sided with the people of North Dakota today,” clinic director Tammi Kromenaker said in a statement. “Those seeking abortion care know what’s best for themselves and their families and should be able to access such essential services if and when they need it. While I’m heartbroken that we have been forced to close our doors here in Fargo, we will continue to serve the region at our new clinic in Moorhead, Minnesota.”Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley was critical of the ruling. He said in a statement that the state Supreme Court chose “a path of its very own, by holding there is now also an un-defined ‘health’ exception to abortion regulation.""He added, ""Our Supreme Court did this without explicit support from our state Constitution, and without support from legislative enactments in our history of abortion regulation. In so doing, North Dakota’s Supreme Court appears to have taken on the role of a legislative body, a role our constitution does not afford them.”Wrigley noted that state lawmakers are working on legislation “that recrafts North Dakota’s abortion laws, and they will now have the opportunity to enact the will of North Dakotans, aware of the latest North Dakota Supreme Court pronouncement.”He had argued the ban should be enforced while the lawsuit proceeds, saying Burleigh County District Judge Bruce Romanick erred by granting the injunction. Romanick has said that the Red River Women’s Clinic had a “substantial probability” of succeeding in its lawsuit, but also said there’s no “clear and obvious answer” on whether the state constitution conveys a right to abortion.Attorneys for the clinic had argued that Romanick’s decision to block the ban was proper.When Romanick blocked the law from taking effect, he acknowledged that the clinic had moved but noted that doctors and hospitals would still be affected by the statute.Since the U.S. Supreme Court in June overturned Roe v. Wade, the ruling that protected the right to abortion for nearly five decades, abortion restrictions have been up to states and the landscape has shifted quickly.Thirteen states are now enforcing bans on abortion at any point in pregnancy and one more — Georgia — bans it once cardiac activity can be detected, or at about six weeks’ gestation.Getting abortions has become increasingly difficult for women who live in states with bans, in some cases resulting in increased medical complications and in others forcing residents to travel for hours or even days to reach a facility that can provide abortions legally.Courts have put on hold enforcement of abortion bans or deep restrictions in Arizona, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming. Idaho courts have forced the state to allow abortions during medical emergencies.___MacPherson is a former Associated Press writer. Ahmed reported from Minneapolis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837986,Senate takes first step in repealing Iraq War authorizations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate took a first step Thursday toward repealing two measures that give open-ended approval for military action in Iraq, pushing to end that authority as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of the Iraq War.Senators voted 68-27 to move forward on legislation that would repeal the 2002 measure that greenlighted that March 2003 invasion of Iraq and also a 1991 measure that sanctioned the U.S.-led Gulf War to expel Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait. Nineteen Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the repeal.The bipartisan effort comes as lawmakers in both parties are increasingly seeking to claw back congressional powers over U.S. military strikes and deployments, arguing that the war authorizations are no longer necessary and subject to misuse if they are left on the books. President Joe Biden has backed the push, and the White House issued a statement Thursday in support.“Repeal of these authorizations would have no impact on current U.S. military operations and would support this administration’s commitment to a strong and comprehensive relationship with our Iraqi partners,” the White House said.Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Todd Young, R-Ind., said they believe the 68 votes in support send a powerful message to Americans who believe their voice should be heard on matters of war and peace. Kaine and Young have led the push for repeal and have worked for several years on the issue.“It is time for Congress to have its voice heard on these matters, and I believe this will establish a very important precedent moving forward,” Young said.It’s unclear whether leaders in the Republican-controlled House will bring the bill up for a vote, even if it passes the Senate. Forty-nine House Republicans supported the legislation when then-majority Democrats held a vote two years ago, but current House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has opposed it.Senate Republicans are also split on the legislation. While the 19 GOP senators voted for it, opponents argue that the repeal could project weakness to U.S. enemies. They have pointed out that President Donald Trump’s administration cited the 2002 Iraq war resolution as part of its legal justification for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani.The October 2002 votes to give President George W. Bush broad authority for the invasion — coming just a month before the midterm elections that year — became a defining moment for many members of Congress as the country debated whether a military strike was warranted. The U.S. was already at war then in Afghanistan, the country that hosted the al-Qaida plotters responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, something Iraq played no part in.Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat who was in the Senate at the time and voted against the resolution, said on the floor before Thursday’s vote that ""I look back on it, as I’m sure others do, as one of the most important votes that I ever cast.”“The repeal of this authorization of use the use of military force does not mean the United States has become a pacifist nation,” Durbin said. “It means that the United States is going to be a constitutional nation and the premise of our Founding Fathers will be respected.”The Bush administration had drummed up support among members of Congress and Americans for invading Iraq by promoting false intelligence claims about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.After the initial March 2003 invasion, American ground forces quickly discovered that the allegations of nuclear or chemical weapons programs were baseless. But the U.S. overthrow of Iraq’s security forces precipitated a brutal sectarian fight and violent campaigns by Islamic extremist groups in Iraq. Car bombings, assassinations, torture and kidnapping became a part of daily life in Iraq for years.Nearly 5,000 U.S. troops were killed in the war. Iraqi deaths are estimated in the hundreds of thousands.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in the hours before the vote that he was glad that the repeal is a bipartisan effort after the Iraq conflict was the cause of “so much bitterness” in the past.“Americans are tired of endless wars in the Middle East,” Schumer said.The Senate will consider the legislation next week, with possible amendments from both sides.One of the amendments that could be considered would repeal a separate authorization of military force passed immediately after the 2001 attacks. It gave Bush broad authority for the invasion of Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism but did not name one country, instead broadly approving force “against those nations, organizations, or persons” that planned or aided the attacks on the U.S.But there is less support in the Senate and Congress overall for repealing the broader authority. Biden and some lawmakers have supported replacing or revising that authorization in the future, but “not right now,” Kaine said, as it is still used by the military.In its statement of policy, the White House appeared to reference the 2001 authority, saying that Biden “remains committed to working with the Congress to ensure that outdated authorizations for the use of military force are replaced with a narrow and specific framework more appropriate to protecting Americans from modern terrorist threats.”",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838000,FBI: Newspaper editor interfered with police at Capitol riot,"A former top editor of an Orthodox Jewish newspaper in New York City was arrested Thursday on charges that he interfered with police officers who were trying to protect the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot.Elliot Resnick, 39, was chief editor of The Jewish Press when he joined the crowd of Donald Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to an FBI agent's affidavit.Videos show Resnick grabbing and holding the arm of a Capitol police sergeant who was spraying a chemical irritant to prevent rioters from entering the building, the affidavit says. Another officer tried to remove Resnick’s hand from the sergeant’s arm, the agent wrote.The FBI arrested Resnick in New York City on charges including civil disorder and assault of or interference with law enforcement. Clay Kaminsky, an attorney representing Resnick in New York, declined to comment on the charges.The Jewish Press, based in Brooklyn, bills itself as the largest independent weekly Jewish newspaper in the U.S. A statement on its website says it is “known for its editorial feistiness"" and “was politically incorrect long before the phrase was coined.”Politico reported in April 2021 that video showed Resnick inside the Capitol on Jan. 6. Resnick later wrote an article defending the Capitol riot without acknowledging his presence in the building that day, Politico's report noted.At the time, The Jewish Press publisher Naomi Mauer told Politico that the newspaper believed Resnick “acted within the law.” A statement from The Jewish Press editorial board confirmed Resnick was in the Capitol on Jan. 6 and had been “covering the rally and the rest of the day’s terrible events"" for the newspaper.The editorial board wrote, “The Jewish Press does not see why Elliot’s personal views on former President Trump should make him any different from the dozens of other journalists covering the events, including many inside the Capitol building during the riots.”Then-President Trump addressed a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6. The mob that stormed the Capitol disrupted a joint session of Congress that was certifying Joe Biden’s electoral victory.Before the riot, Resnick posted social media messages echoing Trump's baseless claims that Democrats stole the election from him, according to posts cited by the FBI affidavit.Resnick had been a reporter and editor at The Jewish Press since 2006. He left the newspaper in May 2021, before the FBI says it began investigating him.The Jewish Press staff didn’t immediately respond to email and telephone messages seeking comment on Resnick’s arrest.Approximately 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. Several riot defendants have claimed that they were acting as journalists when they joined the mob in entering the Capitol, but prosecutors and judges have routinely rejected those claims.For the past two years, the FBI has been fanning out across the county to arrest Capitol riot suspects. The cases are often based on tips that they received in the first months after the riot.The FBI agent's account of Resnick's actions on Jan. 6 portray him as an active participant in the riot.Video showed Resnick repeatedly gesturing for others to come up stairs toward the Capitol after rioters broke through a line of police officers, the agent's affidavit says.Renick was one of the first rioters to enter the Capitol through the East Rotunda doors, according to the FBI. After entering the building, Resnick joined others in attempting to push open a door that a police officer was trying to keep closed, the FBI said. Another officer who tried to stop Renick was thrown to the ground by a different rioter.Resnick grabbed and pulled other rioters into the Capitol after he failed to open the door, according to the affidavit. It says he spent roughly 50 minutes inside the Capitol before leaving.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838001,"Nurses, paramedics reach pay deal to end England strikes","LONDON (AP) — Unions representing more than a million health care workers in England, including nurses and paramedics — but not doctors — reached a deal Thursday to resolve months of disruptive strikes for higher wages.The announcement came as early-career physicians spent a third day on picket lines and the day after U.K. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt announced a budget that included no additional money for labor groups that have staged crippling strikes amid a punishing cost-of-living crisis and double-digit inflation.Any strike actions will be halted while rank-and-file members vote on whether to accept an offer of a lump sum payment for the current year and a 5% raise next year.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was good deal for National Health Service staff who persevered through the pandemic along with patients and taxpayers. He encouraged other striking unions to come to the bargaining table.“We don’t want disruption for patients, we don’t want disruption for schoolchildren in our classrooms,"" Sunak said during a visit to a London hospital, where he met with nurses. ""Today’s agreement demonstrates we are serious about this and we can find workable solutions.”But the head of the Royal College of Nursing, one of at least five unions supporting the deal, said the pay offer would not have come if nurses hadn't made the difficult decision to go on strike, forcing the government to negotiate.“It is not a panacea, but it is real, tangible progress, and the RCN’s member leaders are asking fellow nursing staff to support what our negotiations have secured,” Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen said.Unite, the largest trade union in the U.K. but with a smaller presence in the health care field, blasted the government for months of “dither and delay” that caused unnecessary pain to staff and patients and said it would would not recommend the deal but let workers vote on it.“It is clear that this government does not hold the interest of workers or the NHS at heart,” Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. “Their behavior and disdain for NHS workers and workers generally is clear from their actions. Britain has a broken economy and workers are paying the price.”Unions argue that wages in the public sector have failed to keep pace with skyrocketing food and energy costs that have left many households struggling to pay their bills.Inflation in the U.K. reached a 40-year high of 11.1% in October before dropping in January to 10.1%.A wave of strikes by train drivers, airport baggage handlers, border staff, driving instructors and postal workers since last summer has created havoc for residents.Firefighters, who canceled a planned strike, and London bus drivers recently reached deals to keep working. But many other professions remain locked in pay disputes. Tens of thousands of teachers, civil servants and workers on the capital's subway system all walked off the job on Wednesday.Some have criticized health care workers for jeopardizing lives, though ambulance crews said they responded to the most urgent calls and emergency rooms were staffed.The health care workers, including midwives and physical therapists, had been in talks since they held what organizers said was the largest strike in the history of the country’s National Health Service last month.The labor actions echo the economic unrest that has rippled across in France, including over the government's plan to increase the retirement age.The U.K.'s lackluster economy is likely to avoid a recession this year, though growth will still shrink. The International Monetary Fund last month said the country would be the only major economy to contract this year, performing even worse than sanctions-hit Russia.It was not immediately clear where the funding for raises would come from because they weren't in the budget Hunt announced Wednesday and The Department of Health and Social Care had recently claimed raises above 3.5% were unaffordable.Health Secretary Steve Barclay said they would look for cost savings and the funding would ultimately be up to the Treasury and would not come at the expense of patients.If the Treasury doesn't provide the additional money, the overburdened public health system could be forced for a second consecutive year to cut spending or positions, said Ben Zaranko of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, an independent think tank that analyzes U.K. government fiscal and economic policies.""There must be a risk that the NHS is asked to make heroic efficiency savings to absorb these costs, struggles to do so, and instead has to be bailed out in 6 months or a year’s time,"" Zaranko said. “That would hardly lend itself to sensible financial planning.”A ratified deal with nurses and others will ease some of the pain on the state-funded public health system, which has been beset by winter viruses, staff shortages and backlogs from the COVID-19 pandemic.The deal only applies to workers in England because Scotland and Wales have semiautonomous governments in charge of health policy.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838002,China Foreign Minister in rare call with Ukraine counterpart,"BEIJING (AP) — In a rare phone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Thursday, China’s foreign minister says Beijing is concerned about the year-old grinding conflict with Russia spinning out of control and urged talks on a political solution with Moscow.Qin Gang told Dmytro Kuleba that China has “always upheld an objective and fair stance on the Ukraine issue, has committed itself to promoting peace and advancing negotiations and calls on the international community to create conditions for peace talks,” China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its website.In 2022, China declared it had a “no-limits” friendship with Russia and has refused to condemn Moscow’s invasion while condemning Western sanctions and accusing NATO and the United States of provoking Russia into military action.China and Ukraine have retained diplomatic ties but their top officials are believed to have had only sporadic contact.Beijing has also accused the West of “fanning the flames” by providing Ukraine with weaponry to fend off the Russian invasion.A Chinese peace proposal for Ukraine issued in February urged a cease-fire and peace talks, drawing praise from Russia but dismissals from the West. U.S. officials have repeatedly accused China of considering the provision of weapons to Russia for use in the war.At a March 7 news conference, Qin insinuated America was undermining efforts for peace in Ukraine in order to extend the conflict for its own benefit, saying, “There seems to be an invisible hand pushing for the protraction and escalation of the conflict and using the Ukraine crisis to serve a certain geopolitical agenda.”The Foreign Ministry made no mention of Qin repeating such remarks to Kuleba or of raising the peace proposal.“We hope that all parties will remain calm, rational and restrained, resume peace talks as soon as possible, and push for a return to the track of political settlement,” Qin was quoted as saying.“China will continue to play a constructive role toward reaching a cease-fire, ending warfare, mitigating the crisis and restoring peace,” he said.Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to visit Russia, possibly as early as next week, although neither side has confirmed any exact dates.",2023/3/17,,World

(AP) — An Oklahoma man has been sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to killing three people, including a woman whose heart was cut from her body, weeks after being released from prison as part of a mass commutation effort.Lawrence Paul Anderson, 44, pleaded guilty Wednesday in Grady County District Court to three counts of murder and single counts of maiming and assault and battery.Anderson was sentenced to life without parole as part of a plea deal in which prosecutor Jason Hicks dropped plans to seek the death penalty at the request of the victims' families.“They don’t want a trial,” Hicks said at a news conference after the sentencing. “They don’t want to sit in a courtroom and listen to all the gory details of what happened to their loved ones.”Investigators said Anderson broke into the home of Andrea Lynn Blankenship, 41, fatally stabbed her and cut out her heart, taking it to the home of his uncle and aunt, Leon Pye and Delsie Pye.Anderson then cooked and tried to serve the heart to the Pyes, then fatally stabbed Leon Pye, 67, and his 4-year-old granddaughter, Kaeos Yates, and wounding his aunt, Delsie Pye, authorities said.During sentencing Delsie Pye, 66, said she is heartbroken that a family member would commit such a crime.Tasha Yates, the mother of Kaeos Yates, cursed Anderson before rushing out of the courtroom.“Who kills a baby ... who does that?” Yates yelled.Anderson was released from prison less than a month before the February 2021 attacks after his 20-year prison sentence for drug-related crimes was commuted by Gov. Kevin Stitt following a recommendation from the state Pardon and Parole Board.A grand jury investigation later found Anderson was wrongly placed on the commutation docket in August 2019 after the board in July 2019 rejected his commutation request, which under board rules require that he wait three years before reapplying.The board later recommended commutation, which was approved by Stitt, following the second request.Delsie Pye and the families of the victims have sued Stitt, the Pardon and Parole Board and others for federal civil rights violations related to Anderson's release.The lawsuit is pending, with all defendants having filed motions to dismiss the action.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838004,How French government's special power to impose a bill works,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron chose on Thursday to shun parliament and impose his unpopular pension reforms via a special constitutional power, the so-called “Article 49.3.”The procedure has been regularly used in the past by different governments. But this time it's drawing a lot of attention and prompting much criticism because of the massive public opposition to the increase in retirement ages.Here's a look at how and why the special power is used.WHAT’S ARTICLE 49.3?Article 49, paragraph 3 of the French Constitution provides that the government can pass a bill without a vote at the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, after a deliberation at a Cabinet meeting.In response, lawmakers can file a no-confidence motion within 24 hours. If the motion gets approval from more than half the seats, the text is rejected and the government must resign.If not, the bill is considered adopted and passes into law. Since the Constitution was established in 1958, only one no-confidence motion was successful, in 1962.HAS THE MEASURE BEEN USED IN THE PAST?The special power has previously been used ten times by current Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne to pass budget bills. President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance lost its majority in legislative elections last year, forcing him into political maneuvering.Many governments used it, mostly since the mid-1970s, for various reasons, including accelerating the adoption of a bill and imposing a measure that did not have the backing of a parliamentary majority.Under Macron’s predecessor, Francois Hollande, Article 49.3 was used amid a power struggle within the then-governing Socialist Party, where a group of dissidents contested two successive bills.PRESIDENTIAL POWERSFrance’s strong presidential powers are a legacy from Gen. Charles de Gaulle’s desire to have a stable political system throughout the Fifth Republic he established in 1958, after the post-World War II period experienced successive short-lived, inefficient governments.It’s the prime minister, appointed by the president, who is accountable to the parliament.Article 49.3 allows the government’s views to take precedence over the legislative power. Yet critics denounce it as a brutal procedure, detrimental to the democratic debate. Recent opinion polls have also shown that a majority of the French are opposed to the procedure.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838005,Researchers document 55 more white sharks in Cape Cod waters,"The scientific nonprofit that tracks the white shark population in Cape Cod waters identified 55 sharks never before documented in the area during its most recent research season, but experts say that's no reason for tourists who flock to the vacation hotpsot every summer to be afraid of going in the water.The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has now has documented more than 600 of the apex predators since it began monitoring the population in 2014, staff scientist Megan Winton said Wednesday. Many of the sharks return to the area year after year to feed on the abundant seals that call Cape Cod home.Scientists during last year’s research trips from mid-June until early November documented the return of 63 sharks that had previously been spotted in the area, the nonprofit announced this month.Don't worry. Identifying more sharks does not mean there are more of them out there and does not mean a greater risk to the public.“It’s not necessarily indicative of there being more sharks off of Cape Cod,"" Winton said. “What we've seen the last couple years in terms of activity and sightings has been par for the course of what we’ve been seeing for the past several years.”The fear that people have about white sharks because of the 1975 movie “Jaws” — about a massive great white terrorizing a New England resort town — and two shark attacks off Cape Cod in 2018, one of them fatal, is largely misplaced, Winton said.“It’s important for people to keep in mind that white sharks are not the monsters they are portrayed to be in the media,"" she said. “They’re not lurking off our beaches. Humans are not on the menu.”Cape Cod is the only known white shark aggregation site in the northwest Atlantic, and because they tend to stick close to shore as they hunt for seals, the area has become a goldmine of information for researchers, she said.The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy scientists, in collaboration with other researchers, have been able to find out more about the sharks’ lifecycle, growth rates, the risks they face in the open ocean, and travel patterns as they swim thousands of miles up and down the eastern coast of the U.S. and Canada.For example, a shark first documented off Cape Cod in 2017 was caught and tagged off Hilton Head, South Carolina, in 2021 and during that time had grown three feet, the conservancy said.The researchers capture underwater images of the sharks using a camera on a painter’s pole. Sharks that have never been documented before are given a name, often based on unique markings. The images and information are entered on the conservancy’s publicly-available shark database.Koala, a 9-foot male first spotted last year, has a marking that looks like a koala’s face. Quack, a 9-foot female first documented in 2018, has a marking that resembles a duck. Some are named after local sports stars, including Brady and Big Papi.The public should use the information from the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy to educate themselves about sharks so they can make informed choices while on the water.“Giving folks open access to their shark catalog is a great educational tool for the public,” said Greg Skomal, the state Division of Marine Fisheries shark expert who works closely with the conservancy.“People identify with individual animals,” he said. “It's one thing to talk about a species; it’s another to talk about an individual within that species. People can look at this catalog and they can get a sense of how to use our coastal areas.”",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838009,"Hungary pressures EU by delaying Finland, Sweden NATO vote","BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Sweden and Finland dropped their longstanding military neutrality and quickly signaled their intentions to join NATO, in a striking sign of how powerful Europe's security fears had become in the shadow of Moscow's war.But nearly a year after the Nordic countries officially applied to join the military alliance, their admission remains unresolved because two of the 30 NATO members — Turkey and Hungary — still haven't approved their bids.Although Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly raised specific objections to the countries — especially Sweden — joining NATO, Hungary's populist prime minister, Viktor Orban, has long signaled that his country's support for expansion and has repeatedly promised its parliament would soon vote to ratify.“We have already confirmed to both Finland and Sweden that Hungary supports"" their NATO bids, Orban said at a meeting of Central European prime ministers last November. “The Swedes and the Finns have not lost a single minute of membership because of Hungary, and Hungary will certainly give them the support they need to join.”But a succession of delays by Hungary's government — and its shifting justifications in explaining them — have caused frustration and worry in Sweden, Finland and beyond, and raised questions over what Hungary hopes to achieve through them.Daniel Hegedus, an analyst and fellow for Central Europe at the German Marshall Fund, a think tank that seeks to promote cooperation between North America and the European Union, said that at the heart of Hungary's intransigence on NATO expansion is its desire to exert leverage on the EU, which has frozen billions in funds to Budapest over corruption and rule-of-law concerns.Hungary's hope, Hegedus said, “is that by playing with this postponement of the voting, they can push the Swedes and the Finns to support a potential release of the Hungarian funds in April, or at least make these countries not vocally critical.”The EU, which includes 21 NATO countries, has for years accused Orban's government of cracking down on media freedom and LGBTQ rights, overseeing an entrenched culture of official corruption and co-opting state institutions to serve the interests of the governing Fidesz party.Orban has also been accused of maintaining an unduly close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and of failing to break with him even after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.In a resolution in the European Parliament last year, EU lawmakers declared that Hungary had become “a hybrid regime of electoral autocracy"" under Orban's nationalist government, and that its undermining of the bloc’s democratic values had taken it out of the community of democracies.Such persistent condemnation from both liberal and conservative European politicians, and the EU's insistence that Hungary carry out a lengthy raft of deep reforms in order to gain access to the billions in suspended funds, has led Orban's government to strike back by threatening to block parts of the EU's sanctions against Russia, vetoing an 18 billion euro ($ 19.1 billion) aid package to Ukraine and holding up the vote on NATO accession, Hegedus said.“The one single reason that Hungary was sanctioned due to corruption and EU funds were suspended ... was Hungary’s geopolitical positioning, its continuous blockade vis-a-vis support to Ukraine and especially the Hungarian position related to the Ukrainian aid package,” he said. “And instead of coming to the conclusion that this geopolitical positioning and blockade policy was alienating even their closest allies, they just go further down this road.”In a further sign that frozen EU funds to Budapest played a role in Hungary withholding its NATO ratification vote, the Hungarian parliament sent a delegation of lawmakers to Stockholm and Helsinki early in March to resolve “political disputes” that Orban said had raised doubts among some Hungarian lawmakers about whether to support the Nordic nations’ applications.“It’s not right for (Sweden and Finland) to ask us to take them on board while they’re spreading blatant lies about Hungary, about the rule of law in Hungary, about democracy, about life here,” Orban said in a radio interview last month. “Can anyone want to be our ally in a military system while they’re shamelessly spreading lies about Hungary?”While the Hungarian delegation later signaled it was supportive of the NATO accession bids, Hungary's parliament this month postponed a ratification vote twice in two weeks, and has not given a firm date on when the vote might take place.Though Orban and his government may hope to win concessions from the EU by dragging out the NATO vote, they have likely “overplayed their hand,” as the patience and trust of Hungary's allies begins to wear thin, Hegedus said.""I think no one will ever trust this Hungarian government anymore,"" he said. “Hungary was treated as a NATO and EU ally whose government can be ultimately trusted because it’s one of us. Now, I think this perception is gone. Hungary will be treated differently because all of the partners know that trust is the last thing they can afford vis-a-vis Orban.”Still, he said, Hungary's parliament is likely to finally vote to ratify Sweden's and Finland's NATO applications “in the next couple of weeks or months,” especially if Turkey's government votes to ratify Finland's bid as it is expected to do.“The Hungarian position is unsustainable if the Turkish position changes, and being the last country agreeing to the NATO accession of the ... duo would be very damaging for the Hungarian government,” he said.___Follow Justin Spike on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jspikebudapest",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838010,Tennessee eyes 18+ gun-carry age with court or Capitol deal,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Two years after Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee led the charge to allow residents 21 and older to carry handguns in public without a permit, younger adults could soon have the same privilege, with or without the governor's signoff.A gun rights group sued after the law was passed in 2021, arguing that the age limit should be lower. Then late last year, the state's top lawyer moved to negotiate a settlement rather than defend the law, citing last year's U.S. Supreme Court ruling expanding gun rights. In January, Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti proposed a deal that would allow 18- to 20-year-olds to carry handguns publicly.A judge put the arrangement on hold for a 30-day period that ends Friday. What will happen then is unclear. Conflicting opinions on the settlement within the state are a reflection of a broader U.S. political divide over who should be allowed to have guns — a debate that rages on against a backdrop of continual headlines about deadly mass shootings.“It strikes me as a little bit unusual (for Tennessee) to settle at this point, rather than wait for a decision” on the lawsuit, said Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law at Duke University’s law school.In its June 2022 decision, which followed a series of mass shootings, the U.S. Supreme court ruled that Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense. As part of that ruling, the justices said lower-court judges reviewing state gun laws should only consider whether those statutes are consistent with the country’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation,” not whether they enhance public safety or serve other public interests. The standard has spurred sometimes-conflicting decisions as lower court judges struggle to figure out how to apply it.Two months after the high court's decision, a federal judge struck down a law in Texas barring adults under 21 from carrying a handgun — and the state’s attorney general dropped an appeal. In contrast, a federal circuit appeals court upheld a law in Florida that bars 18- to 20-year-olds from buying — but not possessing — guns.Skrmetti’s proposed settlement concludes that Tennessee's current age range violates the U.S. Constitution’s 2nd and 14th Amendments.“To restore the rights of an entire community of folks in Tennessee is a great win for us,” Bill Sack, director of legal operations for the Firearms Policy Coalition, said when the deal was struck in January. The coalition, which filed the lawsuit in 2021, is a national nonprofit organization that advocates for the right to bear arms in the U.S.For their part, Republican lawmakers in Tennessee are considering lowering the age limit themselves so the attorney general's proposal isn't just mandated on them through the court system. Legislation to do so passed the House, but not the Senate last year.Lee proposed the 21-and-up permitless carry law. Now, his administration is sending some mixed signals on dropping the age. The governor told reporters last month that he thinks the current law works well.Two days before that, the lobbyist for his Department of Safety, Elizabeth Stroecker, told a legislative committee that reducing the age limit to 18 “is actually something we would be comfortable with” and something the department is “working on through pending litigation.” During a legislative meeting last year, however, Stroeker expressed concerns that dropping the carry age could spur some states to stop recognizing Tennessee’s carry permits. A spokesperson for the safety department declined to answer if that's still a concern.Lee also has said he needs to speak with Skrmetti about the proposed court settlement. The governor's office has since declined to say whether he did so.The previous attorney general, Herbert Slatery, had defended the law limiting permitless carry to 21 and older, but acknowledged in a filing last year that the Supreme Court case could affect the lawsuit.Tennessee is the only state with an attorney general picked by its Supreme Court, a setup praised by proponents as creating independence from politics. But critics argue that the position has become increasingly politicized.Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Nashville attorney, contends that Skrmetti “breached his duty to zealously represent the state.”“He essentially assumed his new office, and then proceeded to roll over and wave a white flag on a lawsuit that essentially allows a radical gun group to rewrite state law from the judicial branch,” Clemmons said.Tennessee has made it a point to pass gun-friendly laws. Gun owners seeking permits must go through training and receive a background check —but the permits themselves became optional with the 2021 law. In addition, 18- to 20-year-olds can already own handguns, they just generally can't carry them publicly — with or without a permit. Young adults with military backgrounds may do so, however.Public housing agencies in Tennessee, meanwhile, cannot write leases that bar tenants from having guns in their homes, under a state appeals panel's decision last year that was also influenced by the Supreme Court decision. Gun rights advocates have also sued to block limitations on when people can carry guns in public parks, recreational centers and similar places.As Skrmetti's court settlement hangs in the balance, a bill is moving through the legislature that would not only lower the public-carry age limit, but also expand permitless carry to assault rifles and other long guns.Top law enforcement officials oppose that change, saying it will create public panic, erode progress in police de-escalation training and put officers in dangerous situations.“If we increase the number and types of firearms that are being carried, and potentially left unsecured, then we’re also opening up that opportunity for those guns to fall into the hands of the criminal element, which is where they have been falling,” said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David Rausch.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838012,Ready for Love: Rodgers' exit would mean new era for Packers,"Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst valued Jordan Love’s potential enough three years ago to trade up in the draft and select him in the first round, catching the Hall of Fame-caliber quarterback already on Green Bay’s roster by surprise.Love finally has a chance to show he was worth the gamble.Four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers said Wednesday on “The Pat McAfee Show” on YouTube and SiriusXM that he intends to play for the New York Jets in the 2023 season and is waiting for the Packers to trade him. Assuming that move is made, Love will take over as Green Bay’s starting quarterback.“We’re excited about him,” Gutekunst said Feb. 28 during the NFL scouting combine. “I think I’ve expressed to a lot of people that he needs to play. That’s the next step in his progression.”Love’s two predecessors set quite the standard.The Packers have had three decades of Hall of Fame-caliber quarterback production from Brett Favre and Rodgers, who won a combined seven MVP awards during their time in Green Bay.Love has spent the past three seasons backing up Rodgers, just as Rodgers took over after backing up Favre for three seasons. Rodgers said during his “Pat McAfee Show” appearance that he got the impression the Packers wanted to move on from him and make Love the starter.“Jordan’s going to be a great player,” Rodgers said. “He’s a ... great kid. He had a really good year this year, getting better on the look team. He’s got a bright future in front of him.”Love has made only one career start, a 13-7 loss at Kansas City in 2021. His other most notable appearances came in the second half of a meaningless 2021 regular-season finale at Detroit and in relief of an injured Rodgers at Philadelphia last fall.He has gone 50 of 83 for 606 yards with three touchdown passes and three interceptions since the Packers selected him out of Utah State with the 26th overall pick in the 2020 draft.“I have complete confidence in his ability but also just his approach,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said at the end of last season. “It’s been fun to watch him mature as a football player, as a man, over the course of these last three years. Just the way he walks around the building, his approach, his urgency, his fundamentals, everything that goes into being a quarterback, I think we’ve seen significant growth from him.”It’s difficult to analyze Love’s performances because of the circumstances surrounding many of them.Love didn’t realize he’d be starting at Kansas City until Rodgers discovered the Wednesday before the game he had tested positive for COVID-19. He threw two interceptions and one touchdown pass in the second half of a meaningless 2021 regular-season finale against Detroit when the Packers rested many starters because they already had clinched the NFC's top seed.His best outing came last season when he went 6 of 9 for 113 yards and a touchdown in relief of an injured Rodgers in a 40-33 loss at Philadelphia. The Eagles led 37-23 in the fourth quarter when Love entered the game, which impacted how they defended.“I’d say I just feel more comfortable, more confident, just seeing things a little bit more clean and faster,” Love said four days after the Eagles game.Love’s job could be particularly difficult if the Packers don’t add more playmakers.Green Bay has a quality offensive line and one of the NFL’s top running back tandems in Aaron Jones and A.J. Dillon, both capable pass catchers. The Packers drafted three wideouts last season, with Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs combining to score 12 touchdowns as rookies.But they could lack veteran receivers and tight ends.Allen Lazard, who had 60 catches for 788 yards last season, is an unrestricted free agent who tweeted out a farewell to Green Bay on Wednesday. Wide receiver Randall Cobb and tight ends Robert Tonyan and Marcedes Lewis also are free agents.Love will have to draw on everything he picked up the past three seasons while backing up Rodgers. In his news conference after the Packers’ season finale, Rodgers was asked about Love’s readiness to take over in case the four-time MVP retired or got traded.“You don’t know you’re ready until you’re in that position,” Rodgers said at the time. “I remember the day I was sleeping in San Diego and woke up to 50 text messages that Brett had retired. Then the emotions hit you. ‘Oh, man, now I’m the guy.’ But you’ve still got to go out there and find your stride with leadership and withstand the first year of different defenses throwing things at you and all the pressure that comes with everything.“But I think he’s done a nice job of improving, working on the little things, done a nice job at practice. I think he’s got a chance to have a long future in the league.” ___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838013,"Adam Brody talks 'Shazam,' playing Leighton Meester's enemy","LONDON (AP) — For Adam Brody, donning the padded superhero suit in “Shazam!” and its sequel is a dream come true.“I always wanted to play a superhero. I grew up reading comics,” the actor recalled in a recent interview. “I wanted to just be in something of that size and scale too, to be on a set that big, to be in outfits that take that long to kind of make and put on.""He described “Shazam! Fury of the Gods,” out Friday, as “just a real full-scale Cecil B. DeMille-sized movie.”The film revolves around a group of foster siblings who juggle being teenagers and adult superheroes. Brody plays the adult version of a geeky and awkward character, but the actor reveals he was a “beach bum” in high school.“I was kind of a jock, actually,” smiles Brody. “In any way that surfers are jocks.”During those teenage years, before leaving his hometown in San Diego, California, Brody worked at a Blockbuster video rental store. Add that to his decadeslong long acting career and you could say the 43-year-old is kind of a movie expert.“I have opinions, but you know, I’m not a Tarantino. I don’t have encyclopedic knowledge of all films,” he’s quick to specify. though.In the last few years, his movie knowledge has expanded into child-friendly territory. Brody has two children with his wife, actor Leighton Meester.“As many good ones as you think there are, there’s not enough. So hard to come by,” says Brody about kids’ movies, which he says is “where values and the lessons really come into play and you want to ideally make sure what they’re viewing is nutritious.”While Brody's filmography does not include any children’s movies at the moment, he says it’s a category he would like to try.“I’m a fan of all genres. There’s not a genre I wouldn’t do or want to do, but I look for cleverness in the writing and potentially depth, too and a voice, a strong POV — point of view,"" he says.He further explains he looks for intelligent scripts that put out something positive into the world and don’t “glorify anything too negative.”“It doesn’t all have to be a life lesson,"" he says. ""But the smarter the project is, probably the less it does. You know, I think a lot of the bad stuff that Hollywood puts out is unconscious more than conscious and the deeper someone’s thinking about their work, probably the more positive or enlightening it can be.”Last summer, Brody wrapped filming on a reimagining of the famous 1994 thriller “The River Wild,” originally starring Meryl Streep and David Strathairn as a couple on a rafting trip gone wrong.“You know, we still got a river involved,"" he says. ""And it’s similarly a hostage situation on the river and a race to get to Canada but that’s sort of where the similarities end. It’s new characters.”This time around the story is about two siblings, played by Taran Killam and Meester, embarking on a trip with an old friend (Brody), who will soon reveal a dangerous side. The film is due out later this year.This is not the first time Brody has worked with his wife — Killam, Meester and Brody played three points of a love triangle in the sitcom “Single Parents” just three years ago — but the script made him think twice.“This one was interesting because we’re antagonists. And so, I’m chasing her for a fair amount of the movie, chasing her and worse,"" Brody says. ""And I was worried initially, and it wasn’t something I was looking to do exactly. We want to work together but we weren’t like dying to play enemies.”“I had a little concern that, like, ‘What if we take this home with us? What if it feels too bad to look at her in this way?’"" he continues. ""But your adrenaline’s up on set, and it worked fine.”He says it was the “most demanding” project he has ever worked on, as an actor and as a parent.“The hardest part in a way, was because Leighton and I were sort of in every scene, normally we’re not working at the exact same time, so we brought our kids,"" but he nonetheless characterized it as ""a great adventure for the whole family.”In fact, Brody shares that he wouldn’t be surprised if his children caught the acting bug as well: “It’s a fun job.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838014,Floods fill some of California's summer strawberry fields,"As river water gushed through a broken levee, thousands of people in a California farming town were forced to evacuate as their homes were flooded and businesses destroyed.Yet another potential casualty of the powerful rainstorms that drenched coastal California: hundreds of acres of fresh strawberries slated for America's supermarket shelves this summer.Industry experts estimate about a fifth of strawberry farms in the Watsonville and Salinas areas have been flooded since the levee ruptured late Friday about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco and another river overflowed. It's too soon to know whether the berry plants can be recovered, but the longer they remain underwater the more challenging it can get, said Jeff Cardinale, a spokesperson for the California Strawberry Commission.“When the water recedes, what does the field look like — if it is even a field anymore?” Cardinale said. “It could just be a muddy mess where there is nothing left.”For years, California's farmers have been plagued by drought and battles over water as key sources have run dry. But so far this winter, the nation's most populous state — and a key source of food for the nation — has been battered by 11 atmospheric rivers as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions in the mountains.Many communities have been coping with intense rainstorms and flooding, including the unincorporated community of Pajaro, known for its strawberry crop. The nearby Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week's rains and the levee — built in the 1940s to provide flood protection and a known risk for decades — ruptured, forcing the evacuation of more than 8,000 people from the largely Latino farmworker community.Farmworkers have seen their hours reduced or slashed entirely due to the storms, said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for United Farm Workers. The most critical issue, he said, is helping those in the community of Pajaro rebuild.The overwhelming majority of U.S.-grown strawberries come from California, with farms in different regions of the state harvesting the berries at distinct times of the year. About a third of the state's strawberry acreage is in the Watsonville and Salinas areas, according to the commission.Peter Navarro grows strawberries, raspberries and blackberries on a farm by the Pajaro River. He said he was fortunate his fields weren't flooded by the levee rupture, but still expects his crop to be delayed several weeks due to the rainy, cold weather.After planting berries last year, Navarro said he and other farmers were concerned about water sources drying up due to prolonged drought.“When it started raining, we were elated, happy, saying, ‘This is what we need, a rainy season,’” Navarro said. “We certainly were not expecting all these atmospheric rivers. It just overwhelmed us — and overwhelmed the river.”Other crops are also affected by the deluge in the Pajaro Valley, such as lettuce and other greens. Some vegetables had already been planted, but many hadn't, and might see delays in planting due to the storms, said Norm Groot, executive director of the Monterey County Farm Bureau.“Right now, I think everyone's out trying to save the farm, so to speak,” Groot said, adding more rain was forecast for the weekend.Monterey County is home to Pajaro and the crop-rich Salinas Valley, and has more than 360,000 farmed acres, said Juan Hidalgo, the county's agricultural commissioner. The county estimates the farm sector was hit by $324 million in losses from January storms, and strawberries, raspberries and greens will likely be affected by this one, he said.But, he added, many acres of farmland won't be, and consumers may not feel the impact of the storms. “We're still going to have a lot of production,” he said.A challenge for strawberry growers is the plants are already in the ground. Soren Bjorn, president of Driscoll's of the Americas, said the company works with a network of independent growers to package, ship and sell strawberries. In the Pajaro Valley, farmers did their planting last fall so the berries would hit stores during the summertime when it's too hot to grow the fruits further south, he said.Right now, farmers can’t even access the fields, because roads are covered in water. But with about 900 acres (364 hectares) under water in the Pajaro Valley and another 600 acres (243 hectares) flooded in nearby Salinas, Bjorn said the potential impact is significant, especially as farmers not only face the challenge of mud-soaked plants but also damaged equipment.In the peak of the summer, Bjorn said most of the strawberries in the country come from this region.“It’s too soon to know the full impact of this,” he said. “There is no way we are going to get what we had planned for.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838015,Dafoe's 'Inside' asks how art helps us escape isolation,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Willem Dafoe has said that, for him, the process of making a movie always eclipses the finished product.But after more than 130 film credits, the 67-year-old actor has finally found a project whose final form is on par with the experience of creating it.“When I watch this movie, I say, ‘Okay, I feel like I’m there again,’” he said. “Although there’s lots of stuff that we had invented that gets cut out, it feels like the making of it.”That assertion is impressive, given how much “Inside,” Vasilis Katsoupis’ fiction directorial debut, asked of its lead and virtually only actor.“It really required a lot of different states and different approaches, I would say. But it was great fun,” Dafoe recalled.Set entirely inside a single apartment and with no foils for Dafoe’s character to rely on, “Inside” is completely dependent on his performance, which is so compelling you forget he is the only person on screen for the better part of 100 minutes.It follows an art thief named Nemo (Dafoe) who gets trapped inside a collector's apartment during a botched heist. Nemo is pushed to his limits, braving extreme temperatures, flooding and limited access to food and water, all within the confines of a luxury Manhattan apartment.Despite the physical and psychological toll that Nemo suffers throughout the film, Dafoe said he was able to distance himself from his character’s tribulations.“You’re going to some maybe dramatic places or some difficult places, but you’re also enjoying the interplay with the other people,” he said. “You’ve got the camera, you’ve got the film language behind you, so you’re playing with these things.”More than just a psychological thriller, “Inside” considers the ways in which art rescues humans in modern society from an isolated existence — a way out from being trapped inside of ourselves. Through his meditations on William Blake’s “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” Nemo discerns that liberation can only be attained through creation.For Dafoe, the philosophical exploration of the human relationship to art was not as apparent in the script, but “really came out in the doing of it,” the actor recalled, reflecting on the ways he found beauty in making art pieces for the film.“That was so enjoyable. You lose yourself in those things. You don’t necessarily know what they’re for, but they feel so useful and so healthy and so necessary,” he said.Despite his prolific career, Dafoe said “Inside” allowed the Oscar-nominated actor to flaunt chops he rarely gets to display.“There are certain things that are purely physical, and you don’t always get to do these scenes with no dialogue,” he said. “Meditative sections that you’re really by yourself and there’s nothing to accomplish.”And while the specifics of the plot of “Inside,” which wrapped filming in June 2021, may not ostensibly feel universal, almost everyone on this side of the coronavirus pandemic will relate to the film’s scant human interactions, vague conception of time and claustrophobic cinematography.“Inside” hits theaters March 17.",2023/3/17,,World

The soft, white metal is a vital component in the batteries used to power electric vehicles (EVs), mobile phones, and computers and has become a highly sought-after element in the global race towards decarbonization.Pankaj Srivastava, a professor of geology at the University of Jammu, told DW that the discovery of lithium in India was a promising development that could help the country become more self-reliant.""As the world shifts towards renewable energy, electric cars are becoming increasingly important, and the demand for lithium-ion batteries is growing,"" he said. ""By finding a domestic source of lithium, Indiacould potentially reduce its dependence on imports and boost its economy.""""From solar energy to Mission Hydrogen to EVs, we need to take these initiatives to the next level for energy independence,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared last year on India's Independence Day last August.The discovery of 5.9 million tons puts India on the map as having the fifth-largest reservoir of this precious metal.A senior officer at the region's Geology and Mining Department told DW that the lithium found in Salal was also the purest found so far, as it is graded at 500 parts per million (PPM) compared to the normal grade of 220 parts per million (PPM) found in other deposits.""It will be interesting to see how this discovery will impact the global lithium market and the production of lithium-ion batteries that are used in various electronic devices,"" he said.In Salal itself, there were ""mixed feelings of fear and joy,"" village head Pritam Singh told DW. ""The whole village will be displaced because of the lithium extraction, and we will lose our ancestral homes, but there is a hope that it will bring jobs to our unemployed youth and prosperity to our village.""""I am excited that our village, which has never got the attention of past governments, will contribute to the economy of our country,"" said retired Indian Army soldier Romel Singh. ""It is painful to lose our ancestral village, but we are ready to make this sacrifice for the prosperous future of our kids,"" he said. ""It will bring more jobs and improve our living standards.""Critics of the lithium mining project fear that the groundwater crisis will be exacerbated given the huge amounts of water needed to extract lithium.Vaibhav Rakwal, 25, a local lawyer, expressed surprise that surveyors had failed to take into account that a major river flowed under the foothills of the mountain where the lithium has been discovered. ""If the mountain sinks just a few centimeters, it will change the course of the Chenab River and flood the whole area,"" he warned.""It won't bring any economic opportunities to local people but will certainly trigger an ecological disaster and potential shortage of drinking water,"" he said.""What worries me is the water crisis and pollution it can trigger,"" agreed Pragasho Devi, 56. ""We are already facing a shortage of drinking water and if they start mining, we won't have enough water for us, for our livestock.""Most of Salal's 10,000 inhabitants make a living from agriculture and cattle farming.""Our days in Salal are counted,"" Devi continued. ""We have cared for these fields like our own children. What is the use of this lithium if we have to leave behind our ancestral houses? It is a tragedy.""Devi had intended to build a house for her elder son so that he could live separately with his family but she had to abandon her plans when she found out that the authorities wanted to relocate them elsewhere.There has already been displacement in the area due to other infrastructure projects in the area.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838023,Dutch farmers' party wins big in provincial elections,"A populist party founded only four years ago is set to emerge as the biggest party in Dutch provinicial elections for the upper house of parliament on Thursday, after riding a wave of protests by angry farmers.The Boer-Burger Beweging (BBB), or Farmer-Citizen Movement, is projected to win 16 or 17 seats in the 75-seat upper house of the Dutch national parliament.The party gained popularity as Dutch farmers' protests ramped up in recent years, also gaining some global support, including from former US President Donald Trump and other right-wing or populist figures.The farmers have been demonstrating against Prime Minister Mark Rutte's ruling coalition's plans to cut nitrogen emissions by slashing livestock numbers and possibly closing farms.The four parties in the center-right ruling coalition were dealt significant losses. Combined, they are projected to have under a third of the Senate seats.""This is not the victory we had hoped for,"" Rutte, who has served as prime minister since 2010, said after the initial forecasts.The co-ruling Christian Democratic party is seen as one of the biggest losers in this election, losing almost half of its seats. The party has traditionally represented many farmers and conservative rural voters.The Labor party (PvdA) and the Greens (GroenLinks) are likely to win 15 seats combined, according to the preliminary results.The results force Rutte's coalition to choose to either work with a left-leaning leaning bloc with environmental ambitions, or with the BBB. The latter is aiming to soften policies regarding cutting nitrate pollution.""There is a choice in the senate — left or right,"" said Greens leader Jesse Klaver.Despite its small land mass, the Netherlands is one of Europe's most prolific agricultural producers and exporters.Headlines about a ""historic lesson"" and a ""reckoning with the Rutte government"" covered Dutch newspapers on Thursday.The BBB has tapped into populist sentiments and resentment toward mainstream politics, appealing to voters who felt ignored by Rutte's government.""Normally, if people no longer trust the government, they stay home,"" BBB leader Caroline van der Plas said in a victory speech. ""Today they showed they don't want to stay at home — they want their voices to be heard.""But turnout only appeared to have risen slightly. Nearly 58% of eligible voters cast their vote on Wednesday, compared to 56% in 2019, according to Dutch broadcaster NOS.Midterm elections are typically seen as a chance for voters to express anger at the ruling coalition in the Netherlands, and fringe parties have enjoyed short-lived successes at them in the past.Four years ago, the populist Forum for Democracy (FVD) won the biggest share of the election, but it suffered major losses in Wednesday's vote, and was projected to hold just 2 seats in the upper house.The Dutch government is seeking to reduce the country's emissions of pollutants, mostly nitrogen oxide and ammonia, by 50% by 2030.Farmers say the government's plans, including reducing livestock numbers by a third and possibly the ""expropriation"" of farms, are unfairly targeting them compared to sectors such as industry and transport.""Let's hope we can find solutions that benefit our natural environment and that give perspective to farmers, especially young farmers, who are looking for a sustainable future,"" said Frans Timmermans, the EU's climate chief, as he congratulated the BBB on an ""incredible result.""Van der Plas says Wednesday's vote was about more than the farm pollution issue.""Nitrate is a symbol for dissatisfaction in the country,"" she told NOS on Thursday, adding that many BBB voters ""feel unheard, unseen"" by politicians in The Hague.fb/mh (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/3/16,,

Gladbach is 10th, just ahead of Bremen on goal difference, and will remember its 5-1 loss to Bremen the last time the teams met. It was Bremen’s biggest win this season.FRANCELyon hosts Nantes in a league match three weeks before the teams meet again in the French Cup semifinals. Alexandre Lacazette scored two late goals for mid-table Lyon to salvage a 3-3 draw at Lyon last Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838037,Mets' Díaz expected to miss season with torn patellar tendon,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — New York Mets closer Edwin Díaz has a torn patellar tendon and is expected to miss the entire season after hurting his right knee while celebrating a victory in the World Baseball Classic.The Mets announced Thursday night that Díaz had surgery earlier in the day. Without going into specifics, general manager Billy Eppler said Thursday afternoon that a general timeline for recovery from this type of injury is about eight months.“There are instances where athletes have come back earlier, more around the six-month mark,” Eppler told reporters. “But those are a little bit more of the exception than the rule.”The Mets said Díaz is expected to begin a formal rehab program in about a week.Díaz, who turns 29 next week, retired the side in order in the ninth inning of a 5-2 victory over the Dominican Republic on Wednesday night that sent Puerto Rico to the World Baseball Classic quarterfinals. As Díaz and his teammates jumped together in the infield, the right-hander collapsed and reached for his right leg. He was taken off the field in a wheelchair.“Edwin Díaz is a great human being and a fierce competitor,” Mets owner Steve Cohen tweeted. “All of us at the Mets are shaken but determined to sustain our quest for a great season. We wish Edwin a speedy recovery.”Eppler said he spoke to Díaz several times and noted the star reliever was in “great spirits.”“He’s a resilient human being,” Eppler said. “That’s why he is the closer he is. The dude doesn’t get rattled.”The Mets re-signed Díaz to a five-year, $102 million contract — the largest ever for a closer — after he produced a spectacular 2022 season. All player contracts are covered by insurance through the WBC that spans the length of time the player is out with an injury sustained during the tournament.Díaz went 3-1 with a 1.31 ERA and 32 saves in 35 opportunities while striking out 118 batters in 62 innings last season. He made his second All-Star appearance and finished ninth in NL Cy Young Award voting.Mets manager Buck Showalter has some relievers on the roster with closing experience as the team tries to replace Díaz.David Robertson has 157 career saves, including 20 last season when he pitched for the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies. Adam Ottavino has 33 career saves. Brooks Raley had six saves for the Tampa Bay Rays last season.“My plan coming here was to throw whenever Buck called on me and asked me to go pitch,” Robertson told reporters. “It doesn't matter to me when I pitch in a game, whether it’s the fifth through the ninth. If I’m asked to cover the ninth, I’ll do my best.”Eppler didn't have details on exactly what caused the injury during the WBC postgame celebration but said torn patellar tendons happen more often in other sports.“It's an injury that's actually really common in the NBA and NFL,” Eppler said. “When you get excessive load put on your knee, it can happen.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838038,El Salvador's congress extends anti-gang crackdown,"El Salvador’s congress has voted to approve yet another extension of emergency rules allowing police to round up suspected members of street gangs.The vote late Wednesday was widely expected, and marks the 12th such one-month extension granted to President Nayib Bukele since the measure was first approved on March 27, 2022.The crackdown has resulted in over 65,000 arrests and thousands of alleged rights abuses, but remains popular in a country where gangs once demanded protection payments with impunity.Opinion polls suggest that about 9 out of 10 Salvadorans approve of the government's anti-crime strategy.The extension came on the same day the government sent 2,000 more suspects to a huge new prison built especially for gang members Wednesday, and the justice minister vowed that “they will never return” to the streets.The government announced the mass inmate transfer with a slickly produced video posted on social media. It showed prisoners forced to run barefoot and handcuffed down stairways and over bare ground, clad only in regulation white shorts. They were then forced to sit with their legs locked in closely clumped groups in cells.In his Twitter account Thursday, Bukele mocked social media comments about the prisoners being paraded shoeless and shirtless during the prison transfer.“What, are the saying the darned dictatorship didn’t give the prisoners tuxedos? Shoeless? Right now we’ll take money away from the children’s hospitals to buy them shoes! What brand do you think they would like?” Bukele wrote.Gustavo Villatoro, the government’s minister for justice and peace, said Wednesday the suspected gang members would never return to the streets, even though about 57,000 of those arrested are still awaiting formal charges or a trial.“They are never going to return to the communities, the neighborhoods, the barrios, the cities of our beloved El Salvador,” Villatoro said.Only about 3,500 people swept up in the crackdown have been released so far.Human rights groups say that there have been many instances of prisoner abuses and that innocent people have been swept up in police raids.The local rights group Cristosal documented 3,344 cases of human rights abuses in the first 11 months of the state of emergency. Most of the abuses involved arbitrary arrest; relatives claim young men are rounded up based on their appearance, or because they live in low-income neighborhoods.There have also been complaints about inadequate medical treatment in prisons.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838039,Moldovan lawmakers approve divisive national language bill,"CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovan lawmakers on Thursday voted in favor of a divisive bill that will replace references to the country’s official national language from Moldovan to Romanian in the Constitution and in legislation.The bill was initiated by Moldova’s ruling pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity, PAS, and will change references to “Moldovan language”, “mother tongue” and “state language” with “Romanian language.” This has sparked a debate with social, political, and geopolitical overtones.The vote Thursday was the second and final one. All 57 lawmakers present from PAS, which holds 63 of the legislature's 101 seats, voted in favor as did one unaffiliated lawmaker. The opposition Communists and Socialists bloc, which hold 31 seats, and 6 lawmakers from the Russia-friendly Shor Party, mostly boycotted the vote.While those in favor of the official linguistic changes see them as an important step for the European Union candidate to distance itself from its Soviet past and historic ties to Moscow, others see it as an attack on the national Moldovan identity by pro-Western officials. The opposition has also expressed concerns about the procedural changes of the bill.During the parliamentary session Thursday, some members of the Communists and Socialists bloc brandished a large banner that read: “The people are sovereign, PAS is a tyrant,” and “Moldova. Moldovans. Moldovan,” in reference to the current Constitution.The opposition parties may challenge the outcome at the country's Constitutional Court, said Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University.“Pro-Russian forces in Moldova and the Kremlin … have always challenged the notion that the majority population is ethnically Romanian and speaks Romanian,” he told The Associated Press, adding that “to these forces, conceding that point would erode Moldovan statehood and ties with Russia.”“I think the contention over this bill reveals that the language issue remains controversial in a society that is profoundly divided along geopolitical lines,” he added.The large majority of Moldova’s 2.6 million people speak Romanian as their first language, and the rest speak Russian.Moldova was part of Romania until World War II, when it was annexed by the Soviet Union and Russian became the official language. During following half-century, Romanian was preserved in Moldovan villages. It became the national language again in 1989.After the first bill reading passed earlier this month, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova reacted by calling it “an anti-Russian resolution.”Since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, Moldova has faced a protracted series of crises and has sought to forge closer ties with its Western partners, much to the ire of Moscow. Last June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.___Stephen McGrath reported from Kidderminster, England.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838040,Top court ruling unleashes permit upheaval in Puerto Rico,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A ruling by Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court has thrown into limbo hundreds of thousands of business and construction permits issued by a U.S. territory already struggling to attract investors amid an economic crisis.Government officials on Thursday sought to quell anxieties over fallout from the ruling, which upholds the decision of an appeals court that voids a document from 2020 that regulates land use and the granting of permits on the island.The ruling released Wednesday prompted the government to take the unprecedented step of temporarily suspending access to the website where people apply for permits. While access was restored Thursday, confusion still reigned as people began to question whether they’re allowed to operate a new business they opened, keep a new deck they built or start from scratch and obtain new permits if they were in mid-construction of a hospital or other buildings.“This puts our weak economy at risk,” said Luis Vega Ramos, general secretary of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party.On Thursday, Manuel Cidre, secretary of the Department of Economic Development and Commerce, issued a statement saying people can continue to apply for permits as usual, noting that the document voided by the island’s Supreme Court would remain in effect “until all legal remedies are exhausted.”Environmental attorney Verónica González confirmed that the current land-use plan would remain in effect until the Supreme Court’s decision is final, adding that the government has two opportunities to appeal. However, she noted that anyone can now go to court and claim that a permit issued for a certain business or construction project is illegal given the ruling.“Uncertainty is always going to create problems,” she said.Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said Thursday that he would request the island's Supreme Court reconsider its decision.The situation led officials to announce the resignation of María Cintrón, auxiliary secretary of the Permit Management Office, which falls under Cidre’s department.On Wednesday, Cintrón had announced that she suspended the website for permit applications out of caution and to protect the transparency and certainty of the process, saying, “we recognize this is a complex issue that cannot be taken lightly.”Gabriel Rodríguez, a previous president of Puerto Rico’s Planning Society, blamed the current situation on recent administrations he said are pursuing a public policy that promotes economic development and a simplified permit process above a former land-use plan that aims to protect certain areas for historic, environmental or agronomic reasons.Pierluisi said his administration has been working on a new regulation based on public input: “My administration will always ensure that we have a current regulatory framework that allows and facilitates the socio-economic development that we all want.”It is the third time Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court invalidates the current document that governs land use and permits on the island.“This has turned into mission impossible,” González, the attorney, said of the government’s insistence to use the land-use plan. “This is the third strike.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838041,"Military moves to cut suicides, but defers action on guns","WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a number of improvements in access to mental health care on Thursday to reduce suicides in the military, but held off on endorsing more controversial recommendations to restrict gun and ammunition purchases by young troops, sending them to another panel for study.An independent committee in late February recommended that the Defense Department implement a series of gun safety measures, including waiting periods for the purchase of firearms and ammunition by service members on military property and raising the minimum age for service members to buy guns and ammunition to 25.In a memo released Thursday, Austin called for the establishment of a suicide prevention working group to “assess the advisability and feasibility” of recommendations made by the initial study committee — which would include the gun measures. He also asked for cost estimates and a description of any “barriers” to implementing other changes, and set a deadline of June 2 for that report. At no point did he specifically refer to the gun proposals or mention gun safety.His orders reflect increasing concerns about suicides in the military, despite more than a decade of programs and other efforts to prevent them and spur greater intervention by commanders, friends and family members. But his omission of any gun safety and control measures underscores the likelihood that they would face staunch resistance, particularly in Congress, where such legislation has struggled in recent years.The more immediate changes address broader access to care.To more quickly provide help for troops who may be struggling, Austin directed the Pentagon to hire more behavioral health specialists and implement a scheduling system for appointments where patients receive multiple health care visits weekly when they first seek care.He also ordered military primary care health clinics to screen for unhealthy levels of alcohol use, make unhealthy alcohol use treatment easier to receive and make sure that mental health care is available through service members' primary care as well.“The mental health support available for our teammates must be comprehensive and easy to access,” Austin said in the memo.Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters in a briefing Thursday that Austin's orders involved areas where the department already has the authority to take immediate steps.“While we recognize that suicide has no single cause, and that no single preventative action, treatment or cure will eliminate suicide altogether, we will exhaust every effort to promote the wellness, health and morale of our total force,” Ryder said.The initial study committee recommended that the department require anyone living in military housing to register all privately owned firearms. In addition, the panel said the department should restrict the possession and storage of privately owned firearms in military barracks and dorms.Confirming findings in annual suicide reports, the panel noted that about 66% of all active-duty military suicides —- and more than 70% of those by National Guard and Reserve members — are done with firearms. It said reducing access to guns could prevent some deaths.Craig Bryan, a clinical psychologist and member of the Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee, said the department should slow down troops’ access to guns — specifically those bought in stores on bases — so people under stress can survive periods of high risk.He likened the expanded gun safety measures to requirements that the department puts on motorcycle usage — such as mandated helmets — that are often more strict than some state laws. Asked how likely such changes would be, Bryan said he believes troops are more receptive to such limits than civilians may be.___The national suicide and crisis lifeline is available by calling or texting 988.

Wu has said she wants Boston to participate in a new pilot program included in the 2022 law. Under that program, 10 cities and towns will be allowed to require fossil fuel-free new construction, as long as each community first meets the 10% affordable housing target set by state law and also exempts life sciences labs and health care facilities from the all-electric requirements.Participating cities and towns are expected to be announced later in the year.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838045,Pitino again a hot commodity at 70 and with checkered past,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — It's a March Madness tradition as predictable as a 12-5 upset.A successful coach at a small school enters the NCAA Tournament with speculation swirling about being a candidate at a more glamorous school, forcing that coach to dodge questions about his future before the most important games of the season.The twist this year? That coach is a 70-year-old, two-time national champion whose Hall of Fame four-decade career has been sprinkled with scandal.“You're not hired by the internet,” Iona coach Rick Pitino said. “My players, it’s not a distraction for them at all. I’ve always taken it as a compliment throughout all the years that if somebody else is interested in you, very thankful for that, but I never pay attention to it.”Pitino has the Gaels in the tournament as champions of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference for the second time in his three seasons at the private Catholic school in New Rochelle, just north of New York City.Iona, a 13 seed, faces fourth-seeded Connecticut from the Big East on Friday in the first round of the West Region. As much as Pitino tries to keep the focus on the Gaels, it seems likely that his time at the school is winding down and he is going to land one more high-profile gig — St. John's? Georgetown? Texas Tech? — before he calls it quits.Or rather, if he calls it quits.“Well, I know when he told me he was going to retire at 60 that he was full of crap,” recently retired Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim told The Associated Press. “He’ll coach until he’s 80 if he can. He loves coaching. We all love it to some extent, but I think he loves it probably more than anybody else.""In 34 full seasons as a college head coach, he has led each of the five schools he has coached to the NCAA Tournament, won national championships at Kentucky and Louisville, and has a .741 winning percentage.He had two stints in the NBA, one with the New York Knicks, and another with the Boston Celtics that didn't produce a playoff appearance. But in college, Pitino has had just one losing season.“Probably the best basketball coach I’ve seen or gone up against,” said Boeheim, who hired Pitino as an assistant at Syracuse in 1976.Pitino is back in play for the big schools after being exonerated for NCAA recruiting violations committed by Louisville under his watch and revealed by an FBI investigation into college basketball corruption.A few days before this season started, the NCAA's outside arm of enforcement, the Independent Accountability Resolutions Process, announced it had found “no violation by (Pitino) occurred given that he demonstrated he promoted an atmosphere of compliance.""Iona and Pitino celebrated the ruling, but it's not the only blemish on his resume.The 2013 NCAA championship won Pitino won at Louisville was later vacated after an investigation found an assistant coach paid escorts and exotic dancers to entertain players and recruits in campus dorms.There were also personal improprieties revealed during a criminal case against a woman who was found guilt of trying to extort Pitino.Before Pitino could serve his five-game suspension for the earlier NCAA case, he was fired by Louisville in 2017 when his program was implicated in the FBI case.“He did have a couple of things, yeah,” Boeheim said. “That’s not a lot when you look at more than 40 years.”New Mexico coach Richard Pitino, Rick's son and former assistant, said that as the leader of a program, his father was accountable for the actions of those who worked for him.“He was held responsible. If people are still outraged by it, I would just tell them they need to move on. Because it wasn’t like he didn’t go through a lot,” Richard Pitino told the AP. “You know he was fired. He ended up having to coach out of this country for two years. He then goes and takes Iona, which he was fortunate to get.”After a season out of coaching and two coaching in Greece, Iona took a calculated risk in hiring Pitino when his reputation was tarnished, banking on him not being punished for allegations related to the FBI investigation.While Iona was vindicated, it also became apparent quickly that it would be difficult for the school to keep its coach.“We’re aware he might go,” Iona President Seamus Carey told The New York Post earlier this week.Pitino said he hopes he can coach for 12 more years.“But I’ll take six or seven,” he said.Pitino, dressed in a roomy all-white sweatsuit, looked spry Thursday as he coached his team at practice in MVP Arena.There was no doubt who was in charge as he called out directions at midcourt, and then jumped into the lane a couple of times to play defense against players driving to the basket.“He loves basketball a lot, he even says it in practice a lot: ‘I’ll die for basketball. I want to die on a basketball court,’"" Iona guard Berrick JeanLouis said with a smile. “He talks crazy about it.”The Gaels missed out on the NCAA Tournament last year after finishing first in the MAAC during the regular season. They were upset in the conference tournament and MAAC champ Saint Peter's went on to have magical run in March Madness as a 15 seed.“I have felt more pressure at Iona than any other time, Kentucky, Louisville, the Knicks, Celtics,” Pitino said. “I feel so much pressure with these three (conference tournament) games you have to win to get in the (NCAA) tournament.”Richard Pitino said he does not know what his father's next move will be, but he is aware of Rick's frustration with being in what is traditionally a one-NCAA-bid conference.“That part of it I think is certainly the reason why maybe he would be open to something else,” Richard Pitino said.The St. John's or Georgetown jobs would bring Rick Pitino back into the Big East, where he led Providence to one of the most memorable Final Four runs in tournament history back in 1987, and where he won that national title with Louisville.“Whoever hires him, they’ll be successful within two years. At the most,” Boeheim said. “That’s like a guarantee.”There is a Providence link between Pitino and St. John's right now.St. John's President, the Rev. Brian Shanley, was previously at the Rhode Island school, where he contributed to a revival of the basketball program that included investments in facilities and the hiring of coach Ed Cooley.Pitino said Shanley tried to lure him back to Providence when he was at Louisville.“I spoke to Ed Cooley the other day, said (Shanley's) a superstar,” Pitino said.Pitino talked about how good he has it at Iona, where he has a president and athletic director who provide all the support he needs and four starters expected back next season.Is he up for another rebuild?“It’s going to take a special place,"" he said, ""for me to consider leaving.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838047,Big banks create $30B rescue package for First Republic,"NEW YORK (AP) — Eleven of the biggest U.S. banks Thursday announced a $30 billion rescue package for First Republic Bank in an effort to prevent it from becoming the third to fail in less than a week and head off a broader banking crisis.San Francisco-based First Republic serves a similar clientele as Silicon Valley Bank, which failed last week after depositors withdrew about $40 billion in a matter of hours. New York's Signature Bank was shuttered on Sunday. It appears that First Republic, which had deposits totaling $176.4 billion as of Dec. 31, was facing similar issues.The group of banks behind the rescue package confirmed that other unnamed banks had seen large withdrawals of uninsured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits up $250,000 for individual accounts.Republic's shares dropped more than 60% Monday, even after the bank said it had secured additional funding from JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve.The rescue package brought back memories of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks collectively came to the aid of weaker banks in the early days of the crisis. Banks then bought each other in hurried deals in order to keep the crisis from spreading further.The $30 billion in uninsured deposits is seen as a vote of confidence in First Republic, whose banking franchise before the past week was often the envy of the industry. The bank catered to wealthy clients, many of them billionaires, and offered them generous financial terms. The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg got a mortgage through First Republic.First Republic shares had been down as much 36% earlier Thursday, but rallied after reports the rescue package was in the works. The stock closed up 10%.As part of the aid package, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have agreed to each put $5 billion in uninsured deposits into First Republic. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will deposit $2.5 billion each into the bank. The remaining $5 billion would consist of $1 billion contributions from BNY Mellon, State Street, PNC Bank, Truist and US Bank.“The actions of America's largest banks reflect their confidence in the country's banking system,” the banks said in a statement.Notably the banks came to the rescue of one of their competitors, while Silicon Valley Bank failed because its closest and most loyal customers — venture capitalists and start ups — fled the bank at the first sign of trouble.“We are deploying our financial strength and liquidity into the larger system, where it is needed the most,” the banks said.The nation's banking regulators also issued a statement praising the rescue package.“This show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in a joint statement.The $30 billion bet on First Republic is seen as a bulwark against future bank runs. The shares of many midsized banks were hit hard this week as investors feared depositors would withdraw their cash and run to the nation's biggest banks.Over the weekend the federal government, determined to restore public confidence in the banking system, moved to protect all the banks' deposits, even those that exceeded the FDIC’s $250,000 limit per individual account. While the banking crisis started with Silicon Valley Bank, regulators told reporters earlier this week that it became necessary for the government to backstop the banking system because it appeared more runs were possible.",2023/3/17,,World

Food serves as the roux of the podcast, while the impact the establishments have had on their communities and adds the shrimp, sausage and potatoes.“Coming out of Black History Month, going into Women’s (History) Month, I felt it was really necessary to share this, that we know our Black stories are not monolithic,” said Samuelsson, who was born in a hut in Ethiopia but raised in Sweden after his birth mother died during a tuberculosis epidemic in the early '70s. “I always feel like when you enter a restaurant, you’re entering a piece of American history ... that’s really what we want to capture in ‘Seat at the Table.' It’s beyond the food — it’s really the people that make it so special.”Samuelsson spoke with The Associated Press about his mission to elevate women and people of color, selecting restaurants for the podcast and diversity in the culinary world. Answers may have been edited for clarity and brevity.AP: You’ve mentioned your goal is to elevate women and talented, diverse people. Why is that part of your mission?SAMUELSSON: As a Black chef that has privileges and a platform, it’s very important to me that I’m setting the standard and creating jobs for other Black culinarians … One of the reasons why we always have open kitchens is the staff knows they’re on a stage but also so the customer can see who cooks and works for them in the dining room. Same thing with Hav & Mar where our mission is to uplift women of color in leadership.AP: How did you choose the restaurants?SAMUELSSON: I didn’t by myself. It was a constant back-and-forth with my partner in this, Jonathan Waxman. … He didn’t just read about these chefs, he came up with these chefs. But he knew these stories, and we would never gotten as close to these incredible stories without Jonathan’s work.(Chef) Thomas Keller doesn’t do a lot of interviews, but he talked to Jonathan. And that’s why that story about The French Laundry is so unique. And Charles’ (Pham) story, that’s a story about the Vietnam War and how a true immigrant tale starts and how a restaurant maybe was not the way that they thought they would be in business, but it became a way of living for him and his family.AP: What commonalities do you share with the chefs featured in the podcast?SAMUELSSON: The desire that you want to share your narrative. ... I share that piece with Charles, of course, being an immigrant, feeling the love for America is sometimes misunderstood also.Leah Chase (of Dooky Chase) has always been my mentor and somebody I admire so much. But I feel, also, Alberta Wright and Jezebel — I was a kid growing up right across the street from Jezebel in Hell’s Kitchen in New York City. And I know if I wouldn’t have met Ms. Leah Chase, I wouldn’t have met Alberta Wright, I would’ve never created the Red Rooster or Have & Mar, my restaurant here in Manhattan. … I owe a lot to that generation of incredible Black women.AP: How would you rate the culinary world when it comes to diversity?SAMUELSSON: Food is part of society ... so we’re improving. We got a ways to go. And part of doing this doc with Audible was to really acknowledge how much labor, how much incredible Black restaurants that were in America that never got acknowledged.America’s history in terms of diversity is very complicated. But it’s heading — through a lot of work by effort, by a lot of people — in a better direction. I’m a firm believer in that, even if you (have to) to work at it every day, we’re heading towards a better experience as people. And it’s important because as diversity goes in America, the world is looking at America. So, it’s very, very important to get these small wins because the rest of the world is taking note. As a Black person growing up outside of America, I know this firsthand.___Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at: @GaryGHamilton on all his social media platforms.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838049,Bid opens to fire SC comptroller for $3.5B accounting error,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina lawmakers angry over a $3.5 billion accounting blunder by the state's comptroller general began efforts Thursday to sack the official, a day after demanding he quit or be fired.Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom told senators last month he had unintentionally exaggerated the state’s cash position by $3.5 billion by overstating the amount the state had sent to colleges and universities for a decade. He has signaled he won't resign.The error wasn’t in actual cash, but in the way the state reports its balance sheets. It could affect South Carolina’s credit rating and has eroded confidence that a large number of lawmakers in the Republican-dominated state had in Eckstrom.A resolution introduced Thursday seeks a two-thirds vote from the House and the Senate to trigger a state constitutional provision that says the governor should remove Eckstrom for “willful neglect of duty.”The constitution allows Eckstrom a hearing in his own defense, although the exact procedure isn’t clear. Several senators couldn’t remember this process being used since it was added to the constitution more than 50 years ago.A certified public accountant, Eckstrom, 74, has spent 20 years as comptroller general and before that four years as state treasurer.“At least for a decade we know that he has signed his name, Richard Eckstrom, CPA, on our state's closing financial document and every year he has been wrong,"" said Republican Sen. Larry Grooms, who is sponsoring the resolution.Grooms said the legislature needs to act because Eckstrom isn't doing ""the honorable thing"" and resigning.Thirty-eight of 46 senators signed on to sponsor the proposal. Just 30 are needed for the two-thirds threshold to pass. In the House, the resolution needs 83 of 124 votes.Grooms said he expects once Eckstrom is dealt with the Senate will take up other matters his subcommittee recommended like dismantling his agency and sending its duties to other offices.The error started as a $12 million coding error in 2007 and was compounded when the state switched accounting systems in 2011, Eckstrom told senators at hearings in the past few weeks.State cash transferred to colleges and universities was being double counted and auditors said Eckstrom ignored repeated warnings about the problem. They said he waited five years to conduct a full review of accounts that eventually assisted in uncovering the problem about a year ago.Eckstrom responded to the Senate report with a statement Wednesday saying he isn't quitting. He said his office worked tirelessly to find and then fix the problem which it first started cropping up in 2013. The problem wasn't reported to lawmakers or others in the government until months ago.Eckstrom said he would support a constitutional amendment making his job appointed by the governor instead of elected, but in the meantime “I will not be distracted by anyone from the work ahead of us, work voters elected me to do during this term.”Eckstrom has run unopposed by anyone in the past two elections and last had a challenger in the Republican primary in 2010.Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said last week that Eckstrom should be held accountable by voters and not impeached.The resolution requires a lower level of wrongdoing of willful neglect of duty, where impeachment requires “serious crimes or serious misconduct"" according to the constitution.McMaster's office said Thursday that this week's events had not changed his mind.Exactly what happens next isn't known. The constitution allows Eckstrom a hearing if he wishes.“We're consulting ... right now to ensure we do the correct procedures,"" Grooms said. ""He'll have an opportunity to rebut.”",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838051,Irish star Olivia Miles out rest of season with knee injury,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Notre Dame point guard Olivia Miles will miss the remainder of the season with an undisclosed injury to her right knee.The Fighting Irish (25-5) are a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament and will host No. 14 Southern Utah (23-9) on Friday. No. 11 Mississippi State faces sixth-seed Creighton in the other game.Miles suffered the injury in a 68-65 win over Louisville in the regular-season finale and sat out the ACC Tournament. She will undergo surgery next week.The second-team Associated Press All-American led Notre Dame to the ACC regular season title. She averaged 14.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 2.1 steals.“The current timetable for her return is that we hope that she will be back for the summer in order to participate for the workouts,” coach Niele Ivey said. “My focus now is on this team, excited for this opportunity to play here back in South Bend, a team that has overcome a lot of adversity.”Notre Dame also lost starting guard Dara Mabrey to a right knee injury against Virginia on Jan. 22. She was the team’s leading 3-point shooter at the time and secondary ball handler.“We have two injured players and two injured starters that would die to be on the court, so you’re playing for a lot more than yourself,” Ivey said. “This team is a very close unit team. They play for each other, they have great chemistry and they’re an incredible group to work with.”Ivey will employ a “point guard by committee” with guards Sonia Citron, KK Bransford and Jenna Brown. Citron leads Notre Dame with 14.7 points, along with 5.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists.“Her confidence is high,” Ivey said. “It’s something that we’ve adjusted to the last couple of weeks. If you see the Louisville game, after Olivia went down, Sonia took over that role.”The winner of the Notre Dame-Southern Utah game faces the winner of Mississippi State and Creighton. The Bluejays were the surprise of last year’s tournament reaching the Elite Eight.They are poised for another deep run in this NCAA Tournament with six of the team’s top seven scorers returning. That includes Lauren Jensen, who leads the team in 2022-23 with 15.9 points per game.Flanery leads the more experienced team but still feels vulnerable heading into the Blue Jay’s clash with the Bulldogs.“It’s been tough for us to prepare because we didn’t know our opponent,” Flanery said. “There were some common threads between Illinois and Mississippi State, so we used the week to look at things they had in common that maybe would help us.”STOPPING CARTERFlanery’s biggest concern is how his undersized rotation matches up with Bulldog center Jessika Carter, who leads her team with 15.0 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game.“She’s 6-5 and a really good player, and we’re 6-1 at the tallest,” Flanery said, “so we’re going to have to do a good job there.”SHORT PREP TIMEMississippi State is in a similar situation coming off of an emotional win over Illinois. The Bulldogs will have one practice to prepare, but coach Sam Purcell believes that could an advantage.His team lost five of eight contests to start the year before Purcell adjusted his approach.“I was over coaching this team,” coach Sam Purcell said. “I’ve got great players who are enjoying basketball, and sometimes if you have those two ingredients, don’t mess that up. Don’t overthink it. Let these young women go out and do what they do best. They’ll figure it out.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-polland https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838052,UN envoy: Wide resistance to Myanmar military's repression,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Widespread popular resistance to brutal repression by Myanmar’s military shows no sign of abating across much of the country, and with both sides intent on winning by force “there is no prospect for a negotiated settlement,” the U.N. special envoy to the conflict-wracked nation said Thursday.In a grim assessment, Noeleen Heyzer told the 193-member U.N. General Assembly that the impact of the military’s February 2021 takeover of the country has been “devastating,” with violence continuing “at an alarming scale.”She pointed to the military’s intensified use of force since its extension of the state of emergency on Feb. 1, including bombings, burning of civilian infrastructure“and other grave human rights violations to maintain its grip on power.” She said the regime’s “four cuts” strategy – blocking access to food, funds, information and recruits – also continues to target civilians as collective punishment.Myanmar for five decades had languished under strict military rule, but the generals then loosened their grip and in 2015 Aung San Suu Kyi rose to lead an elected civilian government. Following the military's ouster of the government two years ago, the junta moved to violently suppress public opposition to the takeover. Some experts now consider the situation in Myanmar to be a civil war in which the army has conducted major offensives against widespread armed resistance.Heyzer said the generation that benefited from the country’s opening up after 2015, especially young people, “is now disillusioned, facing chronic hardship and many feeling they have no choice but to take up arms to fight military rule.”She said heavy fighting has spread to new areas, putting more lives at risk and complicating operations to deliver humanitarian assistance. She said 17.6 million people now require assistance.Heyzer said she and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have made clear that with people unable to “freely exercise their political rights without fear or intimidation,” elections called by the military for later this year only risk exacerbating the violence.“There is no public trust in the regime, whose interest is seen as consolidating its control by making a transition from emergency rule to a longer-term military-backed government,” she said.Heyzer said it’s critical that Myanmar’s future is decided by its people through a Myanmar-led process reflecting all voices, and she stressed that “sustainable solutions for the Rohingya people must be built into the design of a peaceful, inclusive and democratic Myanmar.”More than 1 million Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar over several decades, including about 740,000 who crossed the border starting in August 2017 when the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown. International courts are considering whether that crackdown was genocide.Heyzer thanked Bangladesh and said she heeded its message that the current situation is not sustainable, But she told the assembly that the return of the Rohingya “cannot be the mere act of closing camps or moving people” but must ensure durable solutions for their safety and well-being.She said the Rohingya made clear during her visit last year that they want to be included in decisions on their future, and their current exclusion “has entrenched their marginalization.” She appealed for $125 million to avoid a cut in rations to the Rohingya refugees this month.Heyzer and Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, whose country chairs the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, briefed the U.N. Security Council on Monday behind closed doors.The U.N. envoy said she discussed with Marsudi “the urgency of concrete progress” on ASEAN’s five-point consensus on restoring peace in Myanmar adopted in April 2021. Myanmar agreed to the steps but has not implemented them.The consensus calls for stopping violence, constructive dialogue with all parties, appointment of an ASEAN special envoy as mediator, humanitarian aid and the mediator’s visit to Myanmar including a meeting with now imprisoned leader Suu Kyi.Heyzer said she and the Indonesian minister also discussed the possibility of a regional framework to protect the Rohingya and all other refugees from Myanmar.With no prospects now for a negotiated settlement, the U.N. envoy was asked by reporters afterward what the next step is diplomatically.""We cannot give up,"" she said, stressing that her engagement with all parties will continue in order to understand their bottom line and red lines as well as with countries that have leverage on the different players.""At the end of the day, what we want is a movement towards a more just and a more democratic union of Myanmar for all,"" Heyzer said.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838053,"Georgia's Jalen Carter gets 1-year probation, $1,000 fine","ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter was given 12 months' probation and a $1,000 fine on Thursday after pleading no contest to misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and racing related to a crash that killed Bulldogs offensive lineman Devin Willock and a recruiting staff member.Projected as one of the top players in next month’s NFL draft, Carter was sentenced in Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court, according to a statement from attorney Kim T. Stephens. Carter also must complete 50 hours of community service and a state-approved defensive driving course, and his driving privileges have been suspended for 120 days.The state can't bring additional charges against Carter, the statement said, adding that Carter entered the pleas “in order to resolve this matter in the most efficient manner possible.”Athens-Clarke County Solicitor General Will Fleenor said in a statement that law enforcement evaluated whether more serious charges were needed. Talks between his office, the district attorney’s office and the prosecuting attorneys’ council determined the traffic offenses were appropriate.The Athens-Clarke County Police Department had issued an arrest warrant for Carter on March 1, alleging that he raced his 2021 Jeep Trackhawk against a 2021 Ford Expedition driven by recruiting staffer Chandler LeCroy on Jan. 15. LeCroy, 24, and Willock died in the crash, which happened hours Georgia celebrated its second consecutive national championship with a parade and ceremony.Stephens’ statement said Carter's actions did not cause the accident and that he would have faced more serious charges if the investigation had determined otherwise. The statement also said Carter remained on the scene of the accident and returned even after being told he could leave to answer additional questions.Carter was not under the influence of alcohol or any other illegal substance, the statement added.“Mr. Carter continues to grieve the loss of his friends and continues to pray for their families, as well as for continued healing for injured friends,"" the statement said.Carter worked out at Georgia's pro day on Wednesday, but appeared to suffer from cramps and left without speaking to the media.___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 Sign up for the AP Top 25 newsletter here: https://link.apnews.com/join/6nr/morning-wire-newsletter-footer-internal-ads",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838054,Proposal to ban abortions at six weeks advances in Florida,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A proposal to ban abortions at six weeks in Florida received overwhelming approval from a state House committee Thursday with Democrats acknowledging there was nothing they could do to stop it from eventually becoming law.The proposal is moving along while a ban on abortions at 15 weeks — signed into law by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last year — is still facing a legal challenge. The new proposal would only take effect if the current law is upheld and would make it a crime to provide an abortion past six weeks’ gestational age.“It’s a bill that recognizes the importance and value of the life of innocent, unborn human beings,” said Republican Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka said of her proposal. “The bill that’s before you is not solely a reflection of my personal beliefs, but a result of listening in an attempt to build consensus around a policy that supports life.""The measure could give DeSantis, who is widely expected to run for president, additional fodder to woo conservative voters. The governor has indicated he will back the proposed ban.There would be an exception to save the life of the woman and exceptions in the case of pregnancy caused by rape or incest until 15 weeks of pregnancy. In those cases, the woman would have to provide documentation such as a medical record, restraining order or police report.Opponents said that by the time a woman finds out she's pregnant, it's either too late to get an abortion or there's too little time to arrange one, especially for victims of rape and incest. They said trying to obtain an abortion will be even more difficult for women in rural areas with limited health care.“This bill is too restrictive. The amount of paperwork that a woman has to go through to show that they are raped is retraumatizing,” said Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman, adding most rapes aren't reported.But she also recognized that Republicans will get what they want.""You are going to have the votes, you have a supermajority. There will essentially be an outright abortion ban in the state of Florida,” she said. “I can do math.”The House bill has one more committee stop before being heard by the full chamber. A similar Senate bill has been assigned to two committees and will be heard for the first time next week. The House and Senate leaders have expressed support for the legislation.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838056,No. 13 seed Furman hands UVA its latest early March exit,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Kihei Clark sat in the locker room watching video on his phone, trying to figure out how Virginia could have avoided another early exit from the NCAA Tournament.Five years to the day after losing as a No. 1 seed to 16th-seeded UMBC, the Cavaliers were eliminated in the first round as the higher-seeded team again Thursday — this time, falling 68-67 to 13th-seeded Furman.Virginia hasn’t won an NCAA Tournament game since its 2019 triumph over Texas Tech for the title. Clark’s bad pass was intercepted by Garrett Hien in the closing seconds, leading to a wide-open 3-pointer that JP Pegues sank without hesitation.Clark starred as a freshman on Virginia’s 2019 national title-winning team. His long career with the Cavaliers had a much more unsatisfying conclusion.So, what would he have done differently?“Call timeout, maybe could have threw it to Armaan (Franklin) on the right wing maybe,” Clark said. “He was open. Couldn’t see. It was a good trap.”Coach Tony Bennett wasn't surprised Clark patiently answered questions from reporters.“This is part of the game. I’ve used this line before, but when you step between the lines, you take the good and you take the hard with it. You try to handle them both with dignity and respect,” Bennett said.“I’ve loved coaching him in his career. He had the most amazing assist to get us to a Final Four. We would not be in this spot without him, all the success,"" Bennett added. ""He’s had an unbelievable career. You always look to that last moment, and there’s so many what-ifs and who knows.”Making their first trip to the NCAA Tournament in 43 years, the Paladins (28-7) advanced to the second round in the South Region, where they will play fifth-seeded San Diego State (28-6) on Saturday. The Aztecs held off No. 12 seed Charleston 63-57.“All year we’ve been saying that this team just knows how to win. ... It’s an unbelievable moment,” Furman coach Bob Richey said.“This game is — interesting might be the word I’d use,” Bennett said. “You feel like, we got it, we got it, and then all of a sudden in a moment’s notice, it changes at the end. That’s tough.”Furman earned its first tournament berth since 1980 by beating Chattanooga for the Southern Conference title, capping a season-long quest to redeem itself after losing the league’s automatic berth to the Mocs in overtime on a 35-foot buzzer-beater last year.“I couldn’t help but go back when I saw the shot in the air to a year ago. It’s just a reminder, like we said it all year, count on joy, and you don’t know timing of things. ... This team has persevered, and they did it today,” Richey said. “It’s a microcosm of what they learned, and they just keep reliving the lesson and keep finding ways.”In the aftermath of last year's disappointment, Jalen Slawson and his best friend, Mike Bothwell, both decided to return for their fifth seasons with the Paladins. Slawson took over the game when Bothwell fouled out with just over six minutes remaining, scoring nine consecutive points to turn a 54-48 deficit into Furman's first lead of the game, 57-54, with 5:02 to go.Slawson, the Southern Conference player of the year, finished with 19 points, 10 rebounds and four assists.“I told Mike that we weren’t going to let today be his last time putting a jersey on, and I know if roles were reversed, the same thing would have happened,” Slawson said. “It didn’t have to just be me. But the game was up there for the taking, and these guys told me they believed in me and told me I was being a little bit passive, told me to be a little bit more aggressive.”The winning shot was Pegues’ only 3 of the game.“As soon as I saw it go into Garrett Hien’s hands, I was like, I want the ball. I feel like those are moments I’ve created my whole life, and I feel like I’m built for,” Pegues said. “I had full belief that it was going in, and it did.”Reece Beekman’s deep 3-pointer at the buzzer bounced off the rim and Virginia (25-8) was eliminated in the first round as the higher-seeded team for the third time in its past four NCAA tournaments. The Cavaliers were also a No. 4 seed two years ago, when they were beaten by 13th-seeded Ohio.Kadin Shedrick led the Cavaliers with 15 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks. Beekman scored 14 and Isaac McKneely added 12.Marcus Foster scored 14 points and Pegues and Bothwell both finished with 11 for Furman.WHAT'S GOING ONPegues' shot sent shock waves throughout the tournament.Gradey Dick was shooting free throws late in the first half in Des Moines, Iowa, when the crowd roared, startling the Kansas freshman. Fans were reacting to the final seconds of the Furman-Virginia game being shown on the center-court video board. Dick made the first free throw, turned around and looked up at the video board to see what the commotion was about, and then sank the second. Another loud roar went up when time expired on the Furman upset, but it didn’t disrupt Kansas' win over Howard because the teams were in a timeout.UP NEXTFurman: The Paladins made six appearances in the tourney between 1971 and 1980. Their only other victory came against South Carolina in 1974. Slawson doesn't see any reason why the Southern Conference champions can't win again.“This team has done a great job making history all year,” Slawson said, “so you know, Saturday is going to be another chance to make history.”___AP Sports Writer Eric Olson in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838057,Man United bidders get a closer look ahead of potential sale,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Bidders are getting a closer look at Manchester United as the potential sale of one of the biggest soccer clubs in the world gathers pace.Representatives of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani toured United's famed Old Trafford stadium and Carrington training base on Thursday as part of a series of meetings with contenders bidding to buy out current owners the Glazer family.The latest step in the process comes after indicative offers for the Premier League club were made last month via U.S. merchant bank Raine Group, which is handling what could be the biggest-ever sale of a sports team.Sheikh Jassim, the chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank and son of a former Qatari prime minister, is aiming to take 100 percent ownership of United. He did not travel to Manchester for meetings with club executives but sent advisers including Shahzad Shahbaz, who is the president of the Nine Two Foundation set up to complete the takeover.Another bidder, INEOS owner Jim Ratcliffe, will tour United on Friday.No other contenders have publicly declared their intention to buy United.Ratcliffe has submitted a bid for majority ownership.It is still not certain the Glazers will cede total control of the club the Americans have owned since 2005.Much will depend on how high the bidding goes, with figures of up to $6 billion estimated.That is about twice as much as Premier League rival Chelsea sold for last year when it was bought by a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.Raine also handled that sale.The Glazers, who also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, announced in November that they were open to selling United as they explored “strategic alternatives.”“It is a phenomenal asset with a tremendously loyal following all around the world,” said Christopher Zook, chairman and chief investment officer of CAZ Investments, which has extensive experience in sports investments. “It is truly a worldwide brand. There are very few assets on the planet that carry that kind of recognition. So yes buying that asset would be a fantastic thing to do at the right price.”That price remains a source of debate and the lack of public declarations of interest could reflect the limited number of viable candidates able to fund a takeover.By comparison, a host of would-be buyers came forward for Chelsea, including Chicago Cubs owner the Ricketts family, Boston Celtics part-owner Steve Pagliuca and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson. There were also British-based bids and rumored interest from Saudi Arabia.Chelsea eventually sold for just over $3 billion with a commitment to invest a further $2 billion.Prospective new owners of United would likely need to invest extensively in the stadium, which could include a rebuild at an estimated cost of around $1 billion.The tours held this week should give buyers a further indication of how high to pitch their next bids, which could be made within the next 10 days.Sheikh Jassim has said he will look to “invest in the football teams, the training center, the stadium and wider infrastructure.""His bid will also be debt free.Ratcliffe said he would take “fan-centered approach” to ownership, adding that he is ""focusing on winning the Champions League.”The statements from both bidders will chime with United fans who have had to watch rivals Manchester City and Liverpool dominate English soccer in recent years.Many supporters are also desperate to drive out the Glazers, who have been subject to numerous protests during their ownership.Qatari-based ownership would offer the potential to rival the richest clubs in the world such as Abu Dhabi-backed City and Paris Saint-Germain, which also has Qatari owners.Billionaire Ratcliffe, meanwhile, is one of the richest people in Britain and a childhood United fan. Sheikh Jassim is also a longtime United fan.Zook believes, even at a premium, United remains an attractive prospect.“It’s a scarce asset. That’s one of the things as an investor in professional sport, there’s not that many of them,” he said. ""There is a good chance the buyer is going to look at what it can be, as opposed to what it is today, because of the fact that it does have an older stadium and a fanbase it’s not exactly been on the best terms with.“If you were able to really engage the fanbase,"" he continued, ""get a new stadium, get a lot more sponsorship, you could change the revenue model quite dramatically of that business, which would mean it would be worth more than what just a financial buyer would say it is today.”British businessman Martin Broughton fronted a consortium that tried to buy Chelsea last year. He also believes the potential to increase United's value, based on its enormous fanbase, could get the Glazers a top price.“There is a market there which is currently being tapped by the Googles, Facebooks, Instagrams of this world, which ought to be tapped by the clubs,” he said. ""It is a big market that’s worth a lot of money and it could change the valuation of the business.“It’s not an easy thing to do. I think it could be done. Then you could make the case that the value at 6 billion could be good value.”___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

Ana Basaldua Ruiz, a combat engineer who spent 15 months with the 1st Cavalry Division, died on Monday. Officials at the military instillation 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Dallas did not release further information about Basaldua Ruiz or the circumstances surrounding her death. They said in a statement that her family would be provided with support and “all releasable information.”Fort Hood was the site of the 2020 killing of Vanessa Guillén.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838060,Pope sought to lose 'as little as possible' in London deal,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis gave clear indications to get out of a disastrous London real estate deal by saying the Vatican must “start over and lose as little money as possible,"" an exit strategy that eventually involved paying off a broker 15 million euros, the Holy See’s No. 3 official told a court Thursday.Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, the “substitute” in the secretariat of state, was the highest-ranking witness to be questioned by defense attorneys for 10 people on trial for alleged financial crimes involving the London property and related dealings. His testimony was eagerly sought by the defense, given that he oversaw the final phase of the London deal in 2018-2019 as well as the negotiations with the broker, Gianluigi Torzi.Prosecutors have accused Torzi of extorting the Holy See for the 15 million euros in exchange for ownership of the building, charges he denies. The nine other defendants have similarly denied wrongdoing.The crux of the London case rests on the passage of ownership of the London property to Torzi’s Gutt SA fund at the end of 2018 after the Vatican decided to prematurely exit another fund that had invested in it.Pena Parra accused Torzi of deceiving the Vatican but he also identified his onetime deputy, Archbishop Alberto Perlasca, of having entered into the deal with Torzi without any approval or authority to sign contracts.By the time Pena Parra first learned of the deal Nov. 22, 2018, Perlasca had already signed the contracts giving Torzi effective control of the property in the form of the 1,000 voting shares in Gutt, while the Vatican held 30,000 non-voting shares. The lawyer Perlasca engaged assured the Vatican the deal was in its interests, but the lawyer turned out to have ties to Torzi, Pena Parra said.At a Dec. 22, 2018 meeting with the pope and two people external to the Vatican who had looked at the contracts, Pena Parra realized the Vatican had been duped and had acquired “empty boxes.”Francis, he said, gave clear, general instructions how he wanted the disaster resolved: “Start over and lose as little money as possible,” Pena Parra quoted Francis as saying. “I realized that it was all a deception.”Over the ensuing six months, Pena Parra and a team negotiated an exit strategy with Torzi after ruling out “riskier” legal action against him. After initially hoping to pay a maximum of 3 million euros, the Vatican received a proposal from Torzi's lawyers for 25 million euros, reduced to 15 million, Pena Parra told the court.“For me it was profoundly painful that we had to pay 15 million euros for this, but it was the only possibility,” he said. “We were forced into it. Torzi had all the power and we couldn’t do anything about it.”“It really was a Via Crucis,” he said, referring to Christ’s final moments before his crucifixion.Perlasca was initially a prime suspect in the investigation, but flipped in August 2020, started cooperating with prosecutors and became their star witness. He was never charged and is considered an injured party in the case.The investigation was triggered after Pena Parra sought a 150 million euro loan from the Vatican bank to extinguish the mortgage on the property, considering the 1 million euro monthly mortgage payment too onerous. Initially the bank, known as IOR, agreed but by July 2019 refused and reported the whole deal as suspicious to Vatican prosecutors.Pena Parra was still bitter with the bank Thursday, claiming the Holy See lost some six months in needless mortgage payments, since he quickly secured the loan from another Vatican office after the IOR delivered its negative verdict.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838062,Sabres preach patience to a young squad in playoff race,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Sabres captain Kyle Okposo is one of the oldest players on one of the NHL’s youngest teams, and takes care to present a patient front in the midst of a late-season playoff push.Though Okposo would like nothing more than to end a league-worst 11-year playoff drought, the soon-to-be 35-year-old understands there are lessons to be learned and steps that can’t be skipped.Before the Sabres embarked on their current three-game trip, Okposo said the team was close.“And if you were to say before the year we would be in this spot, most people would have laughed,” he added. “So we’re getting there. We just have to keep pushing and we have to continue to know that what we’re doing works, and we cannot become impatient with the results.”It's a challenge for a team on which the majority of players are experiencing an NHL playoff race for the first time.“It’s a different pressure than last year,” Okposo said, referring to how a team that was already out of contention closed the season on a 14-7-3 run. “Last year, we were trying to build something. So how do you continue to build, and how do you continue to handle the pressure?""The results so far have been mixed, and reflective of a team featuring three rookies and seven players born in 2000 or later. Plus, just eight players have been in the playoffs for a combined 218 playoff games, led by Alex Tuch's 66 appearances with with Vegas.At 33-28-6, Buffalo is on the fringes of the playoff race — 11th in the Eastern Conference standings with 72 points, and six out of wild-card contention with 15 games remaining.On the bright side, with three more wins, the Sabres will have the most since 2011-12, which is the last time the team finished with more regulation wins than losses (39-32-11).The telltale signs of youth have been apparent on Buffalo's 2-5-2 record in its past nine games.On Monday, the Sabres rallied from a 2-0 deficit to beat Toronto 4-3. On Wednesday, they squandered a 4-2 lead in the final 10 minutes of regulation in a 5-4 shootout loss at Washington.The low point was a 3-2 loss at the New York Islanders — decided on a goal the Sabres questioned for being kicked in, when the puck banked in off Hudson Fasching's shin. The frustrations carried over into a 10-4 drubbing at home to Dallas two days later.Following the loss, coach Don Granato joked he couldn’t bench everyone, while shifting the focus ahead by saying “something good has to come of this.”“Everybody makes mistakes, and the faster you learn, the better,” he said. “Tonight has to be one of those unfortunate negative outcomes, a bad memory, that makes you better.”Buffalo responded Saturday with one of its most efficient defensive outings in a 2-1 shootout loss to the New York Rangers.General manager Kevyn Adams is being careful in balancing long-term development and short-term success for a franchise that has too often faltered when attempting to rush its process during an 11-year stretch in which Buffalo has finished with the NHL’s worst record four times. That included the pandemic-shortened 2021 season, during which Adams launched his vision by purging the veteran core of his roster.Though the team has shown signs of growth, Adams felt it important to stick to his plan by mostly standing pat at the trade deadline last month, with the exception of acquiring forward Jordan Greenway from Minnesota.“What I want to see our guys do is just go and just be themselves, play fearlessly,” Adams said. “I know what it takes to win in this league, and I know we have it. Now I just want to believe in these guys and let them do it.”Adams never promised there wouldn’t be bumps in the road, and his players understand that.“I’m not saying we’re going to win right now, but we’re learning and it’s been taking time, as it should” defenseman Rasmus Dahlin said. “It takes time, but when you kind of understand what it takes, it’s a lot of fun. But we’re still on the learning path, and we’re not done yet.”___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838063,New Hampshire Senate passes GOP-backed parents' rights bill,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A “parents’ bill of rights” that critics say is designed to target transgender youth passed New Hampshire's Republican-led Senate on Thursday.Much of the debate among lawmakers focused on provisions to require school officials, when asked by parents, to disclose that a child is using a different name or being referred to as being a different gender.Supporters said the bill would strengthen family relationships, while opponents argued it violates the constitutional right to privacy and the state’s anti-discrimination laws.Many states with Republican-controlled legislatures have enacted similar measures, fueled by some parents’ frustration with schools that boiled over during the coronavirus pandemic. And in the U.S. House, a parents' rights bill was the first legislation that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy formally announced — fulfilling a major part of last year's GOP campaign platform.New Hampshire Sen. Donovan Fenton, a Democrat from Keene, said the bill approved Thursday “will further drive the transphobic and homophobic narrative that has begun to infiltrate our state from national interest groups.”“The attacks and targeting of the LGBTQ+ community has increased across the country, and New Hampshire is no exception to that,” he said.The state Senate bill was approved 14-10 along party lines and now goes to the 400-member House, which has a razor-thin Republican majority.“We must value and support the loving relationships that exist in our New Hampshire families,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican. “Senate Bill 272 stands up for truth, for love, for family.”Bradford Republican Sen. Dan Innis, who is gay, said if a student is “visibly transitioning at school or is visibly gay,” parents should hear that from teachers, not gossipy neighbors.“I think this bill will create a situation where it’s less likely that a student will be outed by his or her peers, and more likely that it will happen in a way that supports that child,” he said. “I can tell you at age 13, I, too, was very confused, and parental support would have been very helpful.”But Democrats pushed back, questioning who determines what is “visibly gay.”“That is not the job of the teacher to determine for the individual. That’s information for the individual to reveal or not reveal, when they are ready and when they are comfortable,” said Sen. Becky Whitley, a Hopkinton Democrat. “Who gets to decide when someone is moving towards a different gender based on clothes, or just likes pink?”The New Hampshire House, which is considering its own parental rights legislation, killed a similar bill last year after Republican Gov. Chris Sununu promised to veto it. He hasn’t taken a position on the new bills.The House had been set to vote Thursday on a bill that would require multi-stall bathrooms and locker rooms in public K-12 schools to be same-sex, but it was tabled over concerns about building codes.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838064,"Chiefs announce signings of OT Taylor, DE Omenihu to deals","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs wasted little time filling two enormous holes on their Super Bowl-winning roster.After reaching agreements earlier in the week, the Chiefs announced the signings Thursday of offensive tackle Jawaan Taylor and defensive end Charles Omenihu. Taylor is expected to replace Orlando Brown Jr., who agreed to a deal elsewhere in free agency, and Omenihu is expected to help replace Frank Clark, who was released in a move to create salary cap space.“There was a good amount of teams involved,” Taylor said, “but once free agency opened up, my agent told me about the possibility of the Chiefs wanting me. It's a great opportunity and I couldn't pass it up.”The 25-year-old Taylor, who played almost exclusively right tackle in Jacksonville but will likely move to the left side in Kansas City, agreed to a four-year, $80 million deal with $60 million guaranteed, a person familiar with the terms told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the terms were not disclosed.Omenihu, who is also 25, signed a two-year, $16 million deal, a person with knowledge of the deal also told the AP.The Chiefs were tight on salary cap space after the season — a big reason they released Clark and were unable to sign wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who instead agreed to a deal with New England. But they were able to free up some extra space on Wednesday night when they converted part of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' $34.4 million roster bonus into a signing bonus spread over the next four years, which freed up nearly $10 million in space for the current offseason.Mahomes will hope that Taylor can continue the breakthrough he began to experience last season.The second-round pick of the Jaguars in the 2019 draft gave up a league-leading 40 sacks his first three seasons. But Taylor only allowed six sacks while protecting Trevor Lawrence last season, which ended with a divisional-round loss to Kansas City, and produced one of the lowest pressure rates among offensive tackles in the league.It's not guaranteed that Taylor will end up at right tackle, though that's the expectation. The Chiefs also have a hole on the right side after Andrew Wylie joined Washington, but that position is typically easier — and cheaper — to fill. The Chiefs have an in-house candidate with Lucas Niang and could also address that need through next month's draft.“Left tackle, right tackle, it's just a flip of the hips, honestly,” Taylor said. “If you're athletic enough, trust your feet, have good coaching and I think they have that here, I think the transition will be pretty good.”Omenihu was a fifth-round pick of the Texans in 2019 but was traded after two-plus seasons of mediocre production to San Francisco in November 2021. He proceed to have a career-best 4 1/2 sacks for the 49ers last season.“I think I'm a guy that can play the run on first and second down, play over tight ends, and I can rush on the edge if you need me to,” Omenihu said. “I think versatiltiy is what I bring to the table, a guy that's going to play hard.”Omenihu arrives in Kansas City amid some off-the-field trouble. He was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in January, though no charges have been filed, after his girlfriend accused him of pushing her to the ground.Chiefs general manager Brett Veach has been a whiz when it comes to plugging holes through the draft, and while their first pick isn't until No. 31 overall, they have 11 total to further address defensive end, offensive tackle and wide receiver.Last year, the Chiefs used one of their first-round picks on George Karlaftis, and he blossomed into a game-changing pass rusher who totaled six sacks. The previous year, they used a second-round pick on Creed Humphrey and a sixth-rounder on guard Trey Smith, both of whom have joined Joe Thuney in forming a dominant interior offensive line.“You always try to stick to just the best player,” Veach said, ""because it's a game of attrition. You can sit there and think that you’re deep at a position — I remember a few years ago we thought we were really deep at defensive line and within the first three or four weeks we lost three of them. So, you always want to make sure you take the best player.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838065,Why TikTok's security risks keep raising fears,"TikTok is once again fending off claims that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would share user data from its popular video-sharing app with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.China’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday accused the United States itself of spreading disinformation about TikTok's potential security risks following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. — part of the Treasury Department — was threatening a U.S. ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stake.So are the data security risks real? And should users be worried that the TikTok app will be wiped off their phones?Here’s what to know:WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT TIKTOK?Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share TikTok user data — such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers — with China’s authoritarian government.A law implemented by China in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it, like other social media companies, collects.Concerns around TikTok were heightened in December when ByteDance said it fired four employees who accessed data on two journalists from Buzzfeed News and The Financial Times while attempting to track down the source of a leaked report about the company.HOW IS THE U.S. RESPONDING?White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby declined to comment when asked Thursday to address the Chinese foreign ministry's comments about TikTok, citing the review being conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment.Kirby also could not confirm that the administration sent TikTok a letter warning that the U.S. government may ban the application if its Chinese owners don’t sell its stake but added, “we have legitimate national security concerns with respect to data integrity that we need to observe.”In 2020, then-President Donald Trump and his administration sought to force ByteDance to sell off its U.S. assets and ban TikTok from app stores. Courts blocked the effort, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders but ordered an in-depth study of the issue. A planned sale of TikTok’s U.S. assets was also shelved as the Biden administration negotiated a deal with TikTok that would address some of the national security concerns.In Congress, U.S. Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran, a Democrat and a Republican, wrote a letter in February to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging the Committee on Foreign Investment panel, which she chairs, to “swiftly conclude its investigation and impose strict structural restrictions” between TikTok's American operations and ByteDance, including potentially separating the companies.At the same time, lawmakers have introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration's authority to enact a national ban on TikTok. The White House has already backed a Senate proposal that has bipartisan support.HOW HAS TIKTOK ALREADY BEEN RESTRICTED?On Thursday, British authorities said they are banning TikTok on government-issued phones on security grounds, following similar moves by the European Union’s executive branch, which temporarily banned TikTok from employee phones. Denmark and Canada have also announced efforts to block it on government-issued phones.Last month, the White House said it would give U.S. federal agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. Congress, the U.S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states had already banned the app.WHAT DOES TIKTOK SAY?TikTok spokesperson Maureen Shanahan said the company was already answering security concerns through “transparent, U.S.-based protection of U.S. user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification.”In June, TikTok said it would route all data from U.S. users to servers controlled by Oracle, the Silicon Valley company it chose as its U.S. tech partner in 2020 in an effort to avoid a nationwide ban. But it is storing backups of the data in its own servers in the U.S. and Singapore. The company said it expects to delete U.S. user data from its own servers, but it has not provided a timeline as to when that would occur.TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is set to testify next week before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the company’s privacy and data-security practices, as well as its relationship with the Chinese government.Meanwhile, TikTok’s parent company ByteDance has been trying to position itself as more of an international company -- and less of a Chinese company that was founded in Beijing in 2012 by its current chief executive Liang Rubo and others.Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice president of policy in Europe, said in a Tweet Thursday that ByteDance “is not a Chinese company.” Bertram said its ownership consists of 60% by global investors, 20% employees and 20% founders. Its leaders are based in cities like Singapore, New York, Beijing and other metropolitan areas.ARE THE SECURITY RISKS LEGITIMATE?It depends on who you ask.Some tech privacy advocates say while the potential abuse of privacy by the Chinese government is concerning, other tech companies have data-harvesting business practices that also exploit user information.“If policy makers want to protect Americans from surveillance, they should advocate for a basic privacy law that bans all companies from collecting so much sensitive data about us in the first place, rather than engaging in what amounts to xenophobic showboating that does exactly nothing to protect anyone,” said Evan Greer, director of the nonprofit advocacy group Fight for the Future.Karim Farhat, a researcher with the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Tech, said a TikTok sale would be “completely irrelevant to any of the alleged ‘national security’ threats” and go against “every free market principle and norm” of the state department’s internet freedom principles.Others say there is legitimate reason for concern.People who use TikTok might think they’re not doing anything that would be of interest to a foreign government, but that’s not always the case, said Anton Dahbura, executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. Important information about the United States is not strictly limited to nuclear power plants or military facilities; it extends to other sectors, such as food processing, the finance industry and universities, Dahbura said.IS THERE PRECEDENCE FOR BANNING TECH COMPANIES?Last year, the U.S. banned the sale of communications equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, citing risks to national security. But banning the sale of items could be more easily done than banning an app, which is accessed through the web.Such a move might also go to the courts on grounds that it might violate the First Amendment as some civil liberties groups have argued.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838066,South Carolina's star quintet ready for one last NCAA run,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina’s “Freshies” are ready for one last dance.The Gamecocks’ incomparable quintet of players — led by All-American Aliyah Boston and leading scorer Zia Cooke — arrived to enormous promise in 2019-20 and have more than lived up to those expectations with three regular-season Southeastern Conference titles, three league tournament crowns, two Final Fours and last year’s national championship.“I think we’ve build such a great bond, ‘The Freshies’ group,” Boston said Thursday. “To be on the last go-round with them, it’s just, like, super fun.”Undefeated South Carolina (32-0) will start defending its NCAA crown Friday against No. 16 seed Norfolk State (26-6). Eighth-seeded South Florida (26-6) plays No. 9 seed Marquette (21-10) to open the day in Columbia.South Carolina coach Dawn Staley lured four of the country's top 11 players in 2019, even coming off a down year — for her, anyway — finishing second in the SEC and getting knocked out in the Sweet 16.Boston, the 6-foot-5 force who’s the reigning AP player of the year, was third overall in that incoming 2019 class, right in front of her future teammate Cooke. Forward Laeticia Amihere was 10th overall and Brea Beal, the Gamecocks’ defensive stopper, was 11th.Olivia Thompson, from nearby Lexington, is the fifth “Freshie.”Together, they’ve piled up team and individual accomplishments, a haul that could’ve been even greater had their freshman season not ended without an NCAA Tournament due to COVID-19. That season, the Gamecocks were on a 26-game win streak after sweeping the SEC regular-season and tournament titles.Perhaps just as important, Beal said, the crew stayed throughout to achieve what they have.“You don’t really have situations like this where a group comes in from a class and they all stick together to the end,” said Beal, the SEC’s co-defensive player of the year alongside Boston.There were valleys along with the peaks, Beal said, but the way the quintet encouraged one another and held each other up was essential to the bond they built.“It was just amazing,” Beal said. “Everybody can see that.”BACK AGAINSouth Florida is back in the NCAA Tournament — at the same first-round site as a year ago.The Bulls were seeded ninth in the 2022 event and fell to eighth-seeded Miami at Colonial Life Arena, South Carolina’s home arena. This time, South Florida is seeded eighth and opens against No. 9 seed Marquette.“I was like, here we go again,” South Florida leading scorer Elena Tsineke said.The hope this time is to advance, even though that would mean a matchup against South Carolina on Sunday.“My takeaway from last year was we didn’t come ready the way we should have, so this year is just kind of different,” said Dulcy Fankam Mendjiadeu, a fifth-year senior. “We’re kind of approaching it in a different way.”KEY POINTSouth Carolina point guard Kierra Fletcher missed her team’s SEC Tournament title win because of an injured left ankle. She’s progressed nicely since then and expects to play Friday.“I’m feeling good,” Fletcher said.The Georgia Tech grad transfer started 29 of the Gamecocks 32 games this season and brought a steadiness to the team in the absence of last year’s starter Destanni Henderson.CRAZED CAMPUSMarquette coach Megan Duffy said it’s been a giddy time on campus for Golden Eagles fans with both the men’s and women’s basketball teams in the NCAA Tournament at the same time.It’s just the seventh time that’s happened.The men are seeded second in the East Region and will start play Friday against Vermont a short time after Duffy’s team should wrap its game against South Florida.“I think the energy on campus at Marquette right now is the best and the highest since I’ve been around,” said Duffy, in her fourth season.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838067,Cyprus to speed up repairs to high-rises amid quake worries,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cypriot authorities will spend more than 100 million euros ($106 million) to repair dozens of dilapidated high-rise housing units built decades ago for refugees from the island's 1974 Turkish invasion, officials said Thursday.Interior Minister Constantinos Ioannou said the plan foresees immediate repairs or complete reconstruction of 43 buildings deemed to be most at risk. He spoke after a meeting with lawmakers, engineers, municipal officials and representatives of thousands of displaced persons.Repairs will eventually be carried out to 315 other apartment buildings erected in the immediate aftermath of the invasion, which was triggered by a coup aimed at union with Greece and has left the island divided along ethnic lines.The buildings were among dozens of housing estates hastily constructed throughout the southern part of the island to shelter 160,000 Greek Cypriots who fled their homes amid fighting in the north where the Turkish army invaded.Renovations have been carried out in many of these buildings. But last month’s powerful earthquake in Turkey that killed more than 48,000 people stirred up concerns in Cyprus that repairs weren’t moving quickly enough to ensure they could withstand earthquakes.Ioannou said tenants will be temporarily housed elsewhere until repairs are completed. Funding will come from the government and work will proceed without the red tape and other complications that have previously delayed such repairs.Ioannou said building owners will choose from a list of pre-approved civil engineers who will determine whether the structure will have to be completely rebuilt or needs lesser work.“They themselves will decide, taking into account the amount of funds that will be allotted to them,” the minister said.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838068,Biden climate legacy tested by backlash over Willow project,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When Elise Joshi was at the White House last year, her eyes welled with happy tears as President Joe Biden hosted thousands of supporters to celebrate groundbreaking legislation targeting climate change.“In that moment, I felt a lot of hope that the administration was listening to us,"" said Joshi, a California college student who is a leader of Gen-Z for Change, a coalition of young activists on social media.Now Joshi is planning to return to Washington, but for a very different reason. She's outraged that administration officials approved the Willow project, a large-scale oil drilling proposal in Alaska, and she's organizing demonstrations with compatriots from around the country.Joshi's pivot underscores the political fallout that Biden is facing over Willow and the tension between honoring his promises on climate change and the nation's energy needs.The president made fighting global warming a central part of his agenda, and White House officials are quick to defend efforts to put the United States on track for steep emissions reductions in the coming years.But the decision on Willow has alienated supporters, particularly young activists predisposed to skepticism about compromise and incrementalism, at the same time Biden is planning to announce his campaign for reelection.“There is disappointment. There is anger. There is frustration,"" said Lori Lodes, the executive director of Climate Power, an environmental advocacy group aligned with the administration.But, she added, “what’s happened on climate in the past year is nothing short of revolutionary,"" including hundreds of billions of financial incentives for clean energy in last year's legislation, and Republicans have refused to confront the problem of global warming.When it comes to the 2024 election, “I don’t really think there’s a choice,"" Lodes said. ""If you care about the climate, there’s not a choice.”White House officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, acknowledged the indignation over Willow, which became a focal point for activism in recent weeks. They emphasized that ConocoPhillips has held leases in that area of Alaska for decades, strengthening the company's legal right to drill.“The president kept his word where he can by law,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday, adding that Biden “has done more on climate change than any other president in history.” Environmental groups already have sued in a renewed effort to block Willow.Regulators focused on paring down the project's footprint during the approval process. The final decision includes three drill sites, down from the originally proposed five, and the company relinquished about 68,000 acres of other leases as part of the deal.Administration officials also paired the announcement with a conservation plan that bars drilling in 3 million acres of the Arctic Ocean and seeks new rules on 13 million acres of Alaska land.While the White House said the legal issues largely drove the Willow decision, there were other factors at work.Gas prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine, a reminder of how global energy markets can become weaponized in times of conflict. Biden responded by urging companies to produce more oil in the United States. Willow could generate 180,000 barrels a day once it becomes operational in the coming years.More pressure came from the Alaska congressional delegation, which includes two Republican senators and one Democratic representative. Sen. Dan Sullivan told Fox News that he pressed Biden on how he could justify blocking Willow when the administration also lifted sanctions to allow oil imports from Venezuela, which Sullivan called “one of the most polluting places to produce oil anywhere in the world.”“They never have an answer to that question,” he said. ""I think that was part of the calculus here.”White House officials said the Willow project won't prevent the U.S. from meeting Biden's ambitious goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and a recent government study said the country will be able to produce 80% of its electricity without fossil fuels by 2030.But there's been outrage on social media, sometimes drowning out the administration's own message.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s video explaining the Willow decision was viewed more than 100,000 times on Twitter as of Thursday afternoon.But Joshi's post on TikTok, which described Biden as having “just slapped young people in the face,” was viewed more than 860,000 times.A TikTok video by environmentalist Alex Haraus was viewed more than 270,000 times.“What the hell man?” he said, directly addressing Biden. “You approved Willow. The one thing that millions of people wrote in asking you not to do over the last three weeks?”Near the end, Haraus said, “The youth vote is not a given if they keep doing things like this.""Christy Goldfuss, the chief policy impact officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the problem for Biden is that other efforts to reduce emissions, such as raising vehicle mileage standards, have not received the same attention as Willow.“We’ve seen time and time again that the public has not absorbed the enormity of what Biden has done on climate so far,"" she said. ""This is a very high profile project, and he is suffering from a lack of enthusiasm. If he indeed announces that he’s going to run for reelection, that enthusiasm is the foundation for the energy that he needs to win.”Since taking office, Biden canceled a permit for the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, effectively ending the project, and he has placed more land off-limits to development.Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, said some environmentalists were already frustrated by Biden’s decisions to allow other oil projects, such as the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Line 3 project in the Upper Midwest.“These are open wounds, and (Willow’s approval) just adds to it,” she said.A majority of Democratic voters in the 2022 election across age groups said they were “very” concerned about the effects of climate change on their communities, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the midterm electorate.In an Associated Press-NORC poll from February, most Democrats said they approved of the way Biden is handling his job as president in general and how he’s handling climate change specifically. But the youngest Democrats, ages 18 through 34, were less favorable on both marks.White House officials said there's inevitable friction with activists, who always push for more urgent measures. But they said the goal was to keep the largest tent possible when it comes to climate change, including labor unions, environmental groups and others key players.Biden has not spoken publicly about the Willow decision, which was announced as Washington was racing to prevent a nationwide financial crisis after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.He sat down last week with Kal Penn, an actor who worked in the White House under President Barack Obama, for an interview that aired on Comedy Central's “The Daily Show.”Penn noted that with Biden responsible for screening oil projects, then “what would you say to those young people who want you to continue to be their champion but might not think that you’re going far enough or fast enough on climate?”Biden said “it’s a matter of transitioning, but it’s not like you can cut everything off immediately.”Penn responded by saying “you obviously understand the existential threat that young people feel when it comes to climate.”The interview aired on Monday night, several hours after the Willow decision was announced. Penn revisited the topic in his show on Tuesday night, playing a clip of Biden's campaign promise of “no more drilling on federal lands, period — period, period period.""Penn amended Biden's promise — “period, period, period, comma” — as he talked about the drilling project, and the audience booed.Biden will have another chance to make the case for his record when he hosts a conservation summit at the Interior Department on Tuesday.Outside the building will be activists demanding that he stop Willow.“I did not think this is how these events would unfold,” Joshi said. “It’s a little sad.”___Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838070,Serb leader says he won't sign anything during Kosovo talks,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Thursday he won’t “sign anything” during upcoming European Union-mediated talks with Kosovo's leader that are intended as another attempt to defuse decades of tensions between the two Balkan wartime foes.International officials are hoping for progress on Saturday when Vucic meets neighboring Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti in the North Macedonian lakeside resort of Ohrid.Solving the long-standing problem between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo has gained importance as the war rages in Ukraine and fears mount that Russia could attempt to stir instability in the volatile region where it holds historic influence.Last month, Vucic and Kurti met in Brussels and reached a tentative agreement on a 11-point EU plant to normalize relations between the two neighbors following the 1998-99 war and Kosovo’s declaration of independence in 2008.But after pressure from Serbia’s increasingly vocal far-right groups, Serbia’s populist leader Vucic appeared to backtrack, pledging he would never recognize Kosovo as an independent state or allow it to join the United Nations.“When someone signs something, I will sign it, and the people will decide on that,” Vucic told reporters Thursday. “As for signing something (in Ohrid), I’m not planning anything.”EU and U.S. mediators say the Ohrid meeting will focus on how to implement the tentative agreement that calls for the two countries to maintain good neighborly relations, recognize each other’s official documents and national symbols, and would see Belgrade allow Pristina to seek membership in the EU and U.N.Tensions have simmered between Serbia and Kosovo, whose independence is recognized by many Western countries, but is opposed by Belgrade with the backing of Russia and China. EU-brokered talks have made little headway in recent years.Serbia has maintained close ties to its traditional Slavic ally Russia despite the war in Ukraine, partly because of Moscow’s opposition to Kosovo’s independence.Vucic said Thursday that for now, Serbia won’t join EU sanctions against Russia for its aggression in Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838071,Kansas anti-ESG push slowed by debate over private investors,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Republican lawmakers pushing to prevent Kansas from investing its funds using socially and environmentally conscious principles disagree about also imposing rules for investment managers handling private funds, complicating their efforts to thwart what they see as “woke” investing.Committees in the Kansas House and Senate this week approved competing versions of anti-ESG legislation, and the two chambers could debate them as early as next week. ESG stands for environmental, social and governance and those considerations have become more prominent in investing in recent years, sparking a nationwide backlash from conservative Republicans.The Kansas Senate's version of the anti-ESG measure would require private money managers to get their clients' written consent before investing their funds along ESG principles. The House bill contains no such provision.The issue of requiring managers of private funds to disclose their ESG activities to clients or to get clients' verbal or written consent to use them appears to be the last major sticking point among Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature. They've already backed off the toughest version of the anti-ESG legislation because of opposition from powerful business groups, and have rewritten both bills to prevent projected investment losses of $3.6 billion over 10 years for the pension fund for Kansas teachers and government workers.A desire to thwart ESG investing has some Republicans breaking with the party's longstanding aversion to tougher business regulations.“We have labels on our food,” said state Rep. Michael Murphy, a Republican from rural south-central Kansas who backed the strongest anti-ESG legislation. “We could look at it and say, ‘Well, I don’t want that, and I’ll take this over here.' It allows you to make that choice, and that's all this is.”Supporters of ESG principles argue that they're not about investment managers boycotting industries such as oil production. Instead, they encourage being more comprehensive about assessing investment risks, such as whether concerns about climate change make green energy more attractive and fossil fuels less so. They also argue that Republicans have turned ESG into a culture war issue to keep the GOP's conservative base riled up.In Kansas, Democrats argue that anti-ESG legislation is unnecessary because state law already requires its managers to work to get the maximum investment returns possible. They also worry that even if the final legislation focuses on the investment of state funds, its provisions will be broad enough to handcuff cities and counties if, for example, they want to purchase energy from green sources.“It's going to cause problems,” said Kansas City-area Rep. Rui Xu, the top Democrat on the House committee that handled the anti-ESG legislation.Utah's Republican state treasurer recently told a GOP gathering that ESG “opens the door to authoritarianism” and is “Satan's plan.” On Thursday, 19 GOP governors, including Ron DeSantis of Florida and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, issued a joint statement calling ESG a ""direct threat to the American economy, individual economic freedom, and our way of life.”In Kansas, newly elected GOP Attorney General Kris Kobach and Republican State Treasurer Steven Johnson back anti-ESG measures, but they've argued that allowing the investment of state funds using ESG principles threatens to reduce the state's investment returns. Kobach has argued for an informed consent requirement for private money managers as a consumer protection measure.But state Rep. Nick Hoheisel, a Wichita Republican who chairs the House committee that handled anti-ESG legislation, said its GOP members don't want to impose new mandates on private businesses.“We have enough mandates on businesses already,” Hoheisel said after the committee approved its bill. “In fact, we need to go back and start repealing some mandates on businesses.”___Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna",2023/3/17,,World

(AP) — The Seattle Seahawks are bringing back the same quarterback combo from last season and addressed one of their needs on the offensive line.Seattle reached agreement with quarterback Drew Lock and offensive lineman Evan Brown on one-year contracts on Thursday. Seattle general manager John Schneider confirmed the agreements during his weekly radio show on KIRO-AM.Seattle also announced the signings of defensive linemen Dre'Mont Jones and Jarran Reed that had been agreed to earlier this week.Lock's return keeps continuity in Seattle's quarterback room after the Seahawks signed Geno Smith to a new contract earlier this month. Lock was part of Seattle's return in the trade that sent Russell Wilson to Denver last offseason. Lock was in competition with Smith for the starting job into training camp, but was never able to overtake Smith and earn a starting opportunity.Still, the Seahawks raved about Lock's preparation and their belief in him if he had been called upon during the season.“He was great. You know, both those guys were awesome with pushing each other and then the support that they showed,” Schneider said.Lock started 21 games during his three seasons in Denver, but hasn't played in a regular-season game since the end of the 2021 season.Schneider said Brown was being signed to be a center for the Seahawks, which will fill a need. Brown started 24 games over the past two seasons with Detroit at both center and guard. But center was a position where the Seahawks had to find an answer after Austin Blythe, Seattle’s starting center last season, retired after the season.Brown has the versatility to play guard, but Seattle did re-sign guard Phil Haynes, who split time with veteran Gabe Jackson last season. Brown also spent time with Miami, the New York Giants and Cleveland before finding a chance at consistent playing time with the Lions.The line of scrimmage was going to be an offseason priority for Seattle and that’s been the case in the early stages of free agency with the signings of Jones and Reed, and the agreement with Brown.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838073,University agrees to $14M settlement in wrestler's death,"WILLIAMSBURG, Ky. (AP) — A Kentucky university has agreed to a settlement of more than $14 million over the death of a student wrestler hours after practice, the school announced.The settlement over the death of junior Grant Brace, 20, of Louisville, Tennessee, includes an agreement for the University of the Cumberlands to participate in a heat-illness training program and to help raise awareness of heat-related injuries, the university said Wednesday in a statement.Brace’s death on August 31, 2020 from heat stroke after he begged for water and was refused “was tragic and entirely avoidable,” news outlets reported, citing the lawsuit.Brace was diagnosed with narcolepsy and ADHD and was prescribed Adderall which requires maintaining hydration, according to the lawsuit.He died during the wrestling team’s first training day of the season. After practice, the team had to sprint multiple times up and down a steep hill and Brace completed several before sitting down from exhaustion. The then-coach threatened to kick Brace off the wrestling team, so he ran up the hill again and was later heard saying “I’m done. I can’t do this anymore,” the lawsuit said.He begged for water and his condition continued to deteriorate, but the coaches didn’t provide water or contact the trainer or emergency medical personnel, according to the lawsuit. Brace left and tried to drink from an outdoor water fountain that was not working. He also tried to get into a building but could not, and he collapsed. About 45 minutes later, the coaches found him dead with his hands clenched in the grass and dirt, according to the suit.The university said in a statement that it believed it could defend the claims asserted in the lawsuit, but the legal process would have been long and costly.“The University made the decision to settle the case now in a manner it hopes will respect the Brace family’s tremendous loss,” the statement said.It said the safety of students and athletes is a top priority and it “welcomes the opportunity to work with the Brace family’s consultant to ensure it is providing the safest environment possible for student-athletes in all sports.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838074,NFL player armed in shooting but fired no shots: prosecutor,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon was armed with a legal weapon when a teenage boy was shot near the player's home earlier this month but he did not fire the gun or do anything illegal, authorities said Thursday as they announced the indictments of Mixon's sister and her boyfriend.Lamonte Brewer, whom authorities have identified as the shooter, remained at large Thursday, while Shalonda Mixon was apprehended Thursday afternoon by the Southern Ohio Fugitive Apprehension Strike Team, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported, citing U.S. Marshals supervisor Charles Sanso.Brewer fired several shots and is charged with felonious assault, tampering with evidence and two weapons counts, Prosecutor Melissa Powers said at a news conference Thursday. Shalonda Mixon is charged with tampering with evidence and obstructing justice. Brewer faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all counts, while Shalonda Mixon faces up to four years. It was not known if either had an attorney to speak for themJoe Mixon owns his gun legally and faces no charges, Powers said.The March 6 shooting happened as several juveniles were playing dart wars, where teams shoot at each other with foam dart guns, Powers said. She added that Joe Mixon had been receiving death threats and was concerned when he heard people were running around nearby with weapons. She said the running back was in the yard with Brewer when the shots rang out, but Brewer — armed with a Zastava pistol, which resembles an AK-47 and fires the same round — acted independently.Surveillance footage from Joe Mixon’s home captured the shooting and also showed Shalonda Mixon collecting shell casings from the yard before she and Brewer left the home, Powers said. She said Brewer and others should have been able to tell that the numerous youths playing the dart wars game were carrying toy weapons.The shooting victim, a 16-year-old boy, was hit by at least one shot and was treated at a hospital. He has since been released.Mixon’s agent, Peter Schaffer, said in a prepared statement Thursday that the prosecutor’s finding that the player did nothing wrong “is the conclusion we expected based on the facts that clearly show Joe is innocent.”Schaffer said his client had returned home from California on the day of the shooting and — due to the threats — became concerned that night when he saw “a number of vehicles” had pulled up at his house and blocked the street. He also saw one person with what appeared to be “a long gun” and went outside to try to determine what was going on, not to confront anyone.No one responded to a message left Thursday with the Bengals.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838076,Two Baltimore police officers indicted on unrelated charges,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Two veteran Baltimore police officers are facing criminal indictments stemming from separate and unrelated allegations, city officials said Thursday.One officer is accused of sexual harassment and the other allegedly got drunk and belligerent at a Baltimore bar, assaulted two women and pulled a gun while refusing to pay his tab. State’s Attorney Ivan Bates, who took office as Baltimore’s top prosecutor in January, announced the indictments during a news conference Thursday afternoon.After winning a Democratic primary last year, Bates replacedMarilyn Mosby, who frequently touted her reputation as a progressive prosecutor and gained national recognition after bringing criminal charges against the officers involved in Freddie Gray’s 2015 death in Baltimore police custody. She lost reelection after being indicted on federal perjury charges.While promising to roll back some of Mosby’s more progressive policies, Bates has simultaneously pledged to support ongoing police reform efforts. However, he recently declined to prosecute an officer who fatally shot a fleeing teenage driver last year. The decision, which has drawn criticism from activists, was at odds with an investigative report from state prosecutors who also reviewed the case.In announcing the indictments Thursday, Bates pledged to further transparency and accountability for law enforcement officers.“The allegations in these cases are unacceptable for anyone in our city, but especially for our law enforcement officers,” Bates said in a statement Thursday. “Such actions further erode public trust in the badge and do an incredible disservice to the majority of men and women at the Baltimore Police Department who protect and serve our city with integrity.”Larry Worsley has been held without bail since his arrest last week in the off-duty bar incident, court records show. He faces assault, theft and firearm charges.According to the indictment against him, Worsley went out to a Baltimore bar called Tequila Sunset earlier this month, ordered three drinks, became noticeably drunk and started assaulting a woman who was with him. After being told to leave the premises, Worsley tried to exit without paying his $42 tab, then grabbed another woman and pulled a gun on a bar employee, the indictment alleges.Prosecutors say Worsley dragged the woman outside, but she was able to drive away without him by jumping in a car and locking the doors. Worsley left on foot and police found him several blocks away from the bar.An attorney for Worsley is not yet listed in online court records.Worsley joined the Baltimore Police Department in 2003 and made an annual salary of about $103,000 in the 2021 fiscal year, the latest for which city payroll records are available.The other indicted officer is Walter Wilson, who faces one count of misconduct in office after body-camera footage showed him groping his female colleague while responding to a call about a person found dead in October 2021, according to prosecutors.Wilson and the other officer were standing on a porch near the scene discussing the death when Wilson placed his hand on the woman’s shoulder and turned her around so her back was facing him, the indictment says. He then ran his hand down her back and over her buttocks multiple times, according to the indictment. His body-camera recorded the interaction.The female officer, who had no relationship with Wilson other than working on the same squad, didn’t consent to being touched, felt violated and considered it harassment, the indictment says.Two days later, Wilson made an inappropriate comment to another officer about the woman’s body, according to prosecutors. After taking a week of sick leave, the woman reported Wilson to internal investigators and asked to be reassigned to a different police district.Wilson joined the department in 2000 and his annual 2021 salary was about $91,000. His case isn’t listed in online court records and it wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf.Bates said he presented both cases to a grand jury, which returned the indictments.",2023/3/17,,World

(AP) — Missouri used a second-half scoring spurt from Kobe Brown to win its first NCAA Tournament game in 13 years, beating Utah State 76-65 on Thursday.Brown hit three 3-pointers in a span of just over three minutes to fuel a 13-2 run that turned a two-point deficit into a 62-53 lead.“He’s our MVP. I can tell you that,” coach Dennis Gates said. “Ultimately when he started making some shots in that second half, he immediately made eye contact. He said he’s here. I said, ‘Yes, you are. We can see.’”The seventh-seeded Tigers (25-9) held on from there, stopping a six-game tournament skid with their first win since beating Clemson in the first round in 2010.Missouri advanced to play 15th-seeded Princeton in the second round of the South Region. The Tigers upset No. 2 seed Arizona 59-55.The 10th-seeded Aggies (26-9) have dropped their last 10 tournament games since beating Ohio State in the first round in 2001. The loss was also the 11th straight for a Mountain West team in the NCAAs.“It’s really, really, really, really, really hard to win in college basketball,” coach Ryan Odom said. “These guys did it. They won enough to get an at-large bid here. Even though we didn’t get what we wanted in terms of advancing in the tournament, the guys did what they have done all year and that’s continue to fight regardless of the circumstances.”The game was close until Brown and D'Moi Hodge took it over midway through the second half by scoring 20 straight points for the Tigers.“We don’t blink,” Brown said. “We felt them getting the momentum, but we couldn’t show that. If we would have showed that, things would have went a lot different.”Brown started the stretch with a dunk, followed by three straight 3s. Hodge took over from there by hitting twice from long range around a dunk of his own.Hodge scored 23 points for the Tigers. Brown had 19.Taylor Funk scored 16 to lead Utah State and Steven Ashworth added 12. The Aggies shot 4 for 24 from 3-point range.“There has to be some credit given to Missouri, their style of defense, what they like to do to teams,” Ashworth said. “At times, even if you’re getting open looks in those situations, you can be a little rushed into those shots. I think the first half we had a little bit of that. At the same time it was we just weren’t hitting the shots we normally make.”The Aggies got off to a sloppy start with six turnovers in the first six minutes but still only trailed 35-31 at the half despite missing all 11 attempts from 3-point range.They missed their first two from long range in the second half before Ashworth finally made a 3-pointer.BIG PICTUREUtah State: The frustration for the Aggies was evident when they got called for a bench technical when one of the reserves argued a no-call midway through the second half. Odom heatedly argued the call before getting restrained by an assistant. Nick Honor missed both free throws for Missouri.Missouri: The Tigers played without team captain Tre Gomillion, who injured his groin during the SEC tournament. If he is able to return next round, that would provide a big boost.UP NEXTThe Tigers will be looking to advance past the first weekend of the tournament for the first time since 2009 when they went to the Elite Eight.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

That is much farther apart than planes in several recent close calls.In its preliminary report, the safety board did not state a cause for the Feb. 16 incident, but it said it formed a group to investigate air traffic controller actions. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and the Federal Aviation Administration, which hires and trains controllers, are taking part in the investigation, the NTSB said.The early findings came a day after officials from the NTSB, the FAA, airlines and airline unions met outside Washington, D.C., for a “safety summit.""According to an FAA readout of summit sessions that were closed to the public and press, a group that discussed air traffic recommended closer examination of data to find the causes and solutions for planes being on or near the same runway at the same time. The FAA said it asked industry to find technology to help air traffic controllers track equipment on the ground.The NTSB is investigating six recent events involving conflicting runway use. The board did not start any similar investigations in 2022 and only two in 2021, according to a spokesman.Overall runway incursions, as they are called, are lower in the last six months than the same period last year, according to FAA figures, but those include the vast majority of incidents that are deemed low- or no-risk.In Sarasota, a controller cleared the American Airlines flight to land on runway 14 when the plane was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the airport. When it was about 3 miles (5 kilometers) out, the controller cleared the Air Canada Rouge plane to take off from the same runway.The American crew elected to cancel their landing, turn to the right and return to land.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838081,Florida aims to revoke hotel's liquor license for drag show,"MIAMI (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration is moving to revoke the liquor license of a Miami hotel that hosted a Christmas drag show, a crackdown that comes as the Republican governor looks to shore up his conservative credentials ahead of an expected 2024 presidential bid.The state’s Department of Business and Professional Regulation filed an administrative complaint earlier this week against the Hyatt Regency Miami for hosting the Christmas-themed show. It alleged that the performance was “sexually explicit"" and that children were present for the “lewd, vulgar and indecent” display.The Hyatt Regency Miami said the programming and ticketing at the venue were managed by a third party and the hotel’s role was to serve food and beverages. Amir Blattner, the hotel’s general manager, said the liquor license remains active as the complaint is being reviewed.The producers of the drag show didn’t immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press seeking comment Thursday.DeSantis has filed similar complaints against other venues hosting drag shows in the past. He is known for his aggressive defense of conservative causes and has marketed his administration as a blueprint for strong Republican leadership as he considers a challenge to former President Donald Trump in 2024.The complaint says the state warned the hotel ahead of the Dec. 27 performance to stop children from attending, but the hotel only made it a recommendation and allowed minors who went with adults, the complaint says. It also alleged that performers simulated sex acts and exposed “prosthetic female breasts.""DeSantis has championed other landmark conservative priorities that his critics have dismissed as anti-LGBTQ, including a law that bans instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.“Governor DeSantis stands up for the innocence of children in the classroom and throughout Florida,” the Republican governor’s office said in a statement regarding the hotel’s liquor license.On Tuesday, Florida Republicans advanced a measure that expands on the controversial law that critics dubbed the “Don't Say Gay” bill. The new bill would bar school lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity through the eighth grade. It would also ban school requirements on use of pronouns that don't correspond to the person’s sex at birth.Another bill would restrict venues from allowing children to attend drag shows if they have sexual content.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838082,"Paris Hilton is ready to reclaim her story, share ups, downs","Paris Hilton is adding her voice to the chorus of women speaking out to reclaim their narrative from the media and the public.This week she released “Paris: The Memoir,” sharing what it was like for her growing up a Hilton — being sent away to programs for troubled teens but finding mental and physical abuse, a leaked sex tape, the crafting of a party girl image and high-pitched voice and co-starring in a reality show, “The Simple Life,” with Nicole Richie.In 2020, Hilton released a YouTube documentary “This is Paris,'' addressing her experiences at the schools. “That was the first time that I really became vulnerable and real and shared my story and what I went through,” said Hilton.Today, Hilton is involved in advocacy work and has welcomed a son with husband Carter Reum.In an interview with The Associated Press, Hilton talks about speaking out, slowing down and what she thinks of being called a socialite.Answers may have been edited for brevity and clarity.——-AP: You're one of quite a few women who have taken control of their story in recent years. Was there anyone who inspired you to do the same or to consider doing this?HILTON: I was at the premiere of Demi Lovato’s documentary a couple of years ago, and I was just so blown away by her honesty and her vulnerability and talking about so many private moments in her life. That really inspired me just to be able to feel free, to be open and to be more honest about what I was going through, because especially in Hollywood, it can be very hard, especially on your mental health. A lot of people go through things, and we all try to project this perfect life, but life isn’t perfect.AP: If you could map out how this book will be received, what would that look like?HILTON: For so long I’ve been misunderstood and underestimated, and there’s just so much more to me than what people think. It all really started off with my documentary, ‘This Is Paris.’ That was the first time that I really became vulnerable and real and shared my story and what I went through.AP: The public knows a lot about your ups and downs, but you shared things in your book like being sexually assaulted and having an abortion. Was that difficult?HILTON: A lot of the things that I put in the book were very hard to write about, a lot of memories that I tried to not think about for so many years. But I think it was important to include them because it’s part of my story. I just know that there’s a lot of women out there who need to hear that story as well.AP: Despite your many hats of being an entrepreneur, a DJ, having 30 fragrances and a billion-dollar business — you still get labeled as a socialite. Does that bother you?HILTON: I don’t really enjoy the term socialite because I feel that there’s just so much more that I do, but I do feel that people are finally now recognizing and seeing me for the businesswoman that I am.AP: How is your advocacy work against programs that allegedly reform so-called bad kids going?HILTON: The past two years, we’ve made so much impact, and I’ve already changed laws in eight states and all the way in Ireland. I’m going back to Washington, D.C., in April to introduce a new bill and we already have bipartisan support. So, I am just praying that everybody does the right thing because there are over 150,000 children being sent to these facilities every single year. It’s a multibillion-dollar industry... I’m not going to stop fighting until change is made.AP: You do write about how it hasn't been easy to communicate with your parents about what happened to you. Have you been able to really discuss this with them?HILTON: My family and I have never been closer, and they had no idea what was happening behind closed doors in these places. They have deceptive marketing. My parents just thought I was going to a normal boarding school, and all the brochures have these pictures of children smiling with rainbows and riding horses. I completely understand now, especially as an adult, just everything. My parents and I have talked about everything, and it’s been extremely healing for us. My mom has been coming with me to Washington, D.C., and is there to support me.AP: You're a new mom! (Hilton's son Phoenix Barron Hilton Reum was born via a surrogate.) Are you dialing it back on all your traveling and business responsibilities?HILTON: I am saying no a lot just because I want to be there for all the moments, so I’m trying to do as much from home as possible, building my podcasting studio there, my recording studio for my music, a photo studio for photoshoots. I try to work from home as much as possible so I can pop in and out of his room because I am just so obsessed with my little baby boy.AP: You also write in your book about how you have ADHD and your husband researched it when you were dating to understand you better.HILTON: He’s just so supportive. And he talks to my ADHD doctor and has just really done so much research. He basically knows more about it than I do and is teaching me these things every single day as well. So that’s been really awesome.AP: Even sharing that you have ADHD will help people feel seen.HILTON: When people can harness it in the right way, it can actually be a superpower. That’s why I think in my career I’ve always been ahead of my time and taking risks and being an innovator and someone who thinks outside the box. I really attribute that to my ADHD. People should watch the movie ‘ The Disruptors,’ to understand more.AP: Last question. In your book you share you have five cellphones. One is dedicated to prank phone calls. Do you have those on you today?HILTON: Yeah. I only have a couple of them here. (Hilton holds up three phones.) I love doing prank phone calls with my mom.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838099,"Alaska volcanoes now pose lower threat, after quakes slow","ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Diminished earthquake activity led authorities Thursday to reduce the warning levels at two volcanoes on an uninhabited island in Alaska’s Aleutian chain because of the decreased potential for eruptions.The Alaska Volcano Observatory lowered the warning level to “Advisory” status from “Watch” for both Tanaga and Takawangha volcanoes on remote Tanaga Island, located about 1,250 miles (2,012 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage.A swarm of earthquakes between March 9 and 11 signaled the increased chance of eruptions. However, since then, the rate and magnitude of quakes have decreased.Several quakes per minute continue to be recorded under Tanaga Island, and the largest recorded in the last day was a magnitude 3.1 between the two volcanoes, separated by about 5 miles (8 kilometers). During the peak, the quakes had magnitudes up to 4.0.No other signs of unrest have been detected, a statement from the observatory said.Tanaga is the middle of three volcanoes on the island, with Takawangha located to the east. A third volcano on the island, Sajaka, is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) to the west of Tanaga, and was not showing any sign of activity.Since the island has no residents or structures, there was little chance of damage from the thick, viscous lava flows in an eruption. However, an ash cloud could pose threats to aircraft, potentially disrupting air travel between North America and Asia, and health problems for communities farther away.The nearest community, Adak, is about 65 miles (104 kilometers) to the east, on a separate island.The last known eruption for Tanaga was in 1914. It erupted twice in the late 1700s and again in 1829.The observatory has said there are no known eruptions of Takawangha or Sajaka. However, field work has indicated that eruptions may have occurred from those volcanoes and misattributed to Tanaga.",2023/3/17,,World

Also, a rioter in Rio Grande do Norte and another one in neighboring Paraiba state were killed in shootouts with police, authorities said.Schools in both states canceled school classes Thursday for fear that school buses might be targeted, and some regular bus services were suspended.Rio Grande do Norte’s public security secretary, Francisco Araújo, said Wednesday that the attacks were being ordered from within the state’s biggest prison, after wardens declined to grant prisoners’ demands for televisions, conjugal visits and electricity.Several Brazilian media outlets also pointed to dire conditions within the prisons, citing a report last year by the Ministry of Human Rights and Citizenship indicating that detainees were subjected to torture, rotten food and unsanitary conditions.The violence continued despite the deployment this week of over 220 national guard troops to the region.Brazil’s Justice Minister Flávio Dino on Wednesday also ordered a new task force to boost security within the prison system to try to stamp out any orchestration of violence from within the prison grounds.",2023/3/17,,World

K.J. Adams Jr. scored 13 points and Dajuan Harris Jr. added 11 points, seven assists and four steals for the Jayhawks (28-7), who will play No. 8 seed Arkansas in the second round on Saturday.Kansas, which has won 16 consecutive first-round games, is aiming to become the first repeat national champion in 16 years.Shy Odom had 15 points and eight rebounds and Steve Settle III added 13 points for the Bison (22-13), who were making the program's first tournament appearance since 1992 in front of Vice President Kamala Harris, a Howard alumna.The Jayhawks started their NCAA-record 33rd consecutive tournament appearance with assistant coach Norm Roberts running the show. The 60-year-old Self, who's in his 20th season at Kansas, had a procedure to treat blocked arteries in his heart last week that prevented him from coaching in the Big 12 Tournament.The Jayhawks lost in the Big 12 title game to Texas, but their 15-6 record in Quadrant 1 games that the NCAA categorizes for selection criteria was unmatched in the country, an impressive season from a new-look team that lost most of its best players from last year.The Jayhawks won the regular-season title in a stacked conference, a testament to Self’s acumen and the versatility of this team led by the Big 12 Player of the Year in Wilson, a rising star in Dick, the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year in point guard Harris, and Texas Tech transfer Kevin McCullar Jr.“The Big 12 prepared us for moments like this and games like this,” forward K.J. Adams Jr. said.The Jayhawks aren’t that deep, but they move and share the ball at a dizzying pace that was ultimately too much for the Bison to keep up with — although they tried.“They played faster than I think even we thought they would,” Roberts said.Howard took the lead five times in the first half, but Kansas always snapped back — often with a well-placed hand in a passing lane for a steal and a fast-break finish. Then there were the alley-oops, with Harris and McCullar each delivering a textbook lob off the drive to Ernest Udeh Jr. for a rim-jarring dunk in the first half. Harris found Adams for one, too.Howard totaled 18 turnovers and missed 15 of 20 shots from 3-point range in the second half.“There was a part of it where I was pretty exhausted, but those are the most fun games when you're going up and down, and anything can happen,” Dick said.Howard's rare appearance on the big stage came exactly five years after UMBC's takedown of Virginia, the only time a No. 16 seed has ever beaten a No. 1. The Bison were the 149th team to try.Coach Kenneth Blakeney, whose team went 4-29 in his first season in 2019-20, brought a confident team. Elijah Hawkins hit an early 3-pointer and pointed a finger to his forearm to signal ice in his veins. Kobe Dickson flexed his right arm after muscling in a layup. The Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference champions just weren't able to match the Jayhawks' speed and athleticism.“Wen you play a team like Kansas, they capitalize on all of our mistakes,” Settle said. “We left a lot of meat on the bone in the first half.”DEEP RECORDDick went 3 for 5 from 3-point range to break the Kansas freshman record for made 3-pointers (82 and counting) in a season, besting Jeff Boschee (1998-99).“He played with great confidence out there,” Wilson said.EYES UPDick was startled by a sudden roar from the crowd a split-second after he swished a free throw late in the first half. What was the big deal? The end of the Furman-Virginia game was on the video board above the court, and the Paladins had just hit a late 3-pointer for the lead. Another cheer followed when No. 13 seed Furman sealed the victory, a less disruptive reaction because it was during timeout.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838104,Guatemala's government arrests another former prosecutor,"GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemala's government arrested former prosecutor Orlando Salvador López on abuse-of-authority charges Thursday, the latest in a series of detentions seen as weakening anti-corruption efforts in the country.López was best known for having brought to trial late dictator José Efraín Ríos Montt in 2013 for genocide committed against Indigenous Guatemalans during the country’s 1960-1996 civil war. Ríos Montt was convicted and sentenced to 80 years, but the verdict was overturned on appeal.López’s arrest, announced Thursday, was the most recent in a series of prosecutions of former prosecutors and investigators by the President Alejandro Giammattei.The public prosecutor's office claims López did work as a notary public and lawyer in 2019 at a time when he was employed as a prosecutor, something that is not allowed in Guatemala.The U.S. government has sharply criticized the weakening of anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala under Giammattei.Some 30 judges, magistrates and prosecutors involved in the investigation or processing of those corruption cases have been forced to flee the country after facing legal action from the current administration.Juan Pappier, the acting deputy director for the Americas at Human Rights Watch, said the arrest of López was a serious affront.“His arrest is part of a pattern of prosecution against prosecutors and judges who investigated corruption and human rights abuses in the country,"" Pappier said.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838105,COVID-19 pill Paxlovid moves closer to full FDA approval,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Pfizer’s COVID-19 pill Paxlovid won another vote of confidence from U.S. health advisers Thursday, clearing the way for its full regulatory approval by the Food and Drug Administration.The medication has been used by millions of Americans since the FDA granted it emergency use authorization in late 2021. The agency has the final say on giving Pfizer's drug full approval and is expected to decide by May.A panel of outside experts voted 16-1 that Paxlovid remains a safe and effective treatment for high-risk adults with COVID-19 who are more likely to face hospitalization and death due to the virus.“We still have many groups that stand to benefit from Paxlovid, including unvaccinated persons, under-vaccinated persons, the elderly and the immuno-compromised,” said Dr. Richard Murphy of the Department of Veterans Affairs.The FDA said using Paxlovid in high-risk patients could prevent 1,500 COVID-19 deaths and 13,000 hospitalizations per week.The panel's positive vote was widely expected, given that Paxlovid has been the go-to treatment against COVID-19, especially since an entire group of antibody drugs has been sidelined as the virus mutated.The U.S. continues reporting about 4,000 deaths and 35,000 hospitalizations weekly, the FDA noted.The agency asked its panel of independent medical experts to address several lingering questions involving Paxlovid, including which people currently benefit from treatment and whether the drug plays a role in cases of COVID-19 rebound.The panel agreed with assessments by both the FDA and Pfizer that found no clear link between the use of Paxlovid and returning symptoms, but said more information is needed from studies and medical records data. High-profile cases drew attention to the issue last year, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden.Between 10% and 16% of patients across multiple Pfizer studies had symptoms return, regardless of whether they’d received Paxlovid or a dummy pill. Such cases “likely reflect natural COVID-19 progression,” the FDA concluded.The federal government has purchased more than 20 million doses of Paxlovid and encouraged health professionals to prescribe it aggressively to help prevent severe COVID-19. But that’s led to concerns of overprescribing and questions of whether some patients are needlessly getting the drug.Pfizer originally studied Paxlovid in the highest-risk COVID-19 patients: unvaccinated adults with other health problems and no evidence of prior coronavirus infection. But that doesn’t reflect the U.S. population today, where an estimated 95% of people have protection from at least one vaccine dose, a prior infection or both.The FDA reviewed Pfizer data showing Paxlovid made no meaningful difference in otherwise healthy adults, whether or not they’d been previously vaccinated.But when FDA teased out data for high-risk adults — regardless of their vaccination or infection history — Paxlovid still showed a significant benefit, reducing the chance of hospitalization or death between 60% and 85%, depending on individual circumstances. Patients in that group included seniors and those with serious health problems, such as diabetes, obesity, lung disease and immune-system disorders.With so many different factors, panelists said prescribing Paxlovid will remain a case-by-case decision.Dr. Sankar Swaminathan of the University of Utah and other panelists stressed the importance of managing potentially dangerous drug interactions between Paxlovid and other commonly used medications.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838106,Jury deliberations to resume Monday in XXXTentacion killing,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Jury deliberations for the trial of three men accused of murdering rising rap star XXXTentacion during a 2018 robbery will resume Monday after the panel finished a seventh day of deliberations Thursday without reaching a verdict.The seven women and five men had asked Circuit Judge Michael Usan if they could have Friday off to take care of personal appointments, and the judge granted the request. Earlier Thursday, jurors had asked to view the defendants’ social media accounts, as well as GPS data or maps to calculate distance between points mentioned in the case. The judge denied those requests, saying the verdict must be based on evidence presented during the trial.Michael Boatwright, 28 and the accused shooter; Dedrick Williams, 26 and the accused ringleader and getaway driver; and Trayvon Newsome, 24 and the alleged second gunman, are charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery. They face mandatory life sentences if convicted. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty.During the monthlong trial, prosecutors tried to link the men to the shooting outside Riva Motorsports in suburban Fort Lauderdale through extensive surveillance video taken inside and outside the store, plus cellphone videos they took of them flashing $100 bills. Prosecutors also had the testimony of a fourth man, Robert Allen, a former friend of the defendants who said he participated in the robbery. He pleaded guilty last year to second-degree murder and awaits sentencing.Defense attorneys have accused Allen of being a liar trying to avoid a life sentence. They also said prosecutors and detectives did a poor investigation that didn’t look at other possible suspects, including the Canadian rap star Drake — he and XXXTentacion had an online feud.XXXTentacion, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, was a platinum-selling rising star who tackled issues including prejudice and depression in his songs. He also drew criticism over bad behavior and multiple arrests, including charges that he severely beat and abused his girlfriend.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838108,Vatican unveils new ethnographic display of Rwanda screens,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican Museums officially reopened its African and American ethnographic collections Thursday by showcasing intricately restored Rwandan raffia screens that were sent by Catholic missionaries to the Vatican for a 1925 exhibit.The display at the Anima Mundi Ethnological Museum featured a scientific presentation of the restoration process as well as the research that preceded it, with consultations with Rwanda’s own ethnographic museum, a UCLA graduate student and Belgium’s Royal Museum for Central Africa. It came as ethnographic museums in Europe and North America are grappling with demands from Indigenous groups and former colonies to return artifacts dating from colonial times.The Rev. Nicola Mappelli, curator of the Anima Mundi museum, declined to comment on calls for restitution of the Vatican’s own ethnographic holdings, saying these were questions for the museum leadership. Speaking to The Associated Press during a visit to the new exhibit, he noted that the Vatican last year returned three mummies to Peru and a human head to Ecuador in 2017.The museum director, Barbara Jatta, didn’t refer to the issue in her remarks at the opening, emphasizing however what she said was the Anima Mundi’s commitment to transparency and “dialogue with different cultures.”She said the unveiling of the Rwandan panels was a moment to celebrate the reopening of the African and American section of the museum as well as the 50th anniversary of the transfer of the entire collection into the Vatican Museums itself.The issue of the Vatican’s ethnographic collection came into the spotlight last year, when Indigenous groups from Canada came to the Vatican to receive an apology from Pope Francis for Canada’s church-run residential school system.Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has said the policy of forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families in a bid to assimilate them into Christian, Canadian society amounted to “cultural genocide.” The First Nations, Metis and Inuit delegations visited the Anima Mundi and were shown several Indigenous items in the collection, and representatives later said they wanted them back, or at the very least to have access to them so Indigenous researchers could study them.The Vatican has long insisted that the basis of its ethnographic collection stemmed from “gifts” to Pope Pius XI, who in 1925 staged a huge exhibit in the Vatican gardens to celebrate the church’s global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized. Catholic missionaries around the globe sent him artifacts, but some researchers today question whether Indigenous peoples were really able to consent to such “gifts” given the power dynamics of the time.The informational labels on the new exhibits emphasize the Vatican's view. The Canada label, for example, reads: “There is a long tradition of gifts sent by the Indigenous peoples of Canada to the popes,” noting that a headdress in the exhibit was given to Francis during his 2022 trip to Canada by Chief Wilton Littlechild.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838109,Patrick Peterson eager to show Steelers he's still elite,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Patrick Peterson knows he's not 23 anymore. Or 28 for that matter.That doesn't mean the newest member of the Pittsburgh Steelers secondary believes he's slowing down.Yes, at 32 the eight-time Pro Bowl cornerback knows he might not be able to track wide receivers nearly a decade younger step-for-step all the time.Yet Peterson believes he can make up for whatever he might have lost in quickness with the wisdom gained from being one of the best players in the league for 12 years and counting.If anything, Peterson — who signed a two-year deal to join Pittsburgh this week — believes there's more to his game than he's been able to show.“I can do it all,” Peterson said Thursday. “I haven't been in the league 13 years because I was good at one thing.""Yes and no.While Peterson has always believed he has the capacity to line up in different spots throughout the defensive backfield, he's spent almost the entirety of his career as a shutdown corner, a commodity in short supply that's made him a very rich man.That may change in Pittsburgh, one of the reasons Peterson was drawn to joining the Steelers.“I want to be able to be in (a) position to continue to help my team, but also be in a position that’s gonna continue to help me be successful,” said Peterson, who had five interceptions and 15 passes defensed last year for Minnesota. “It’s all about putting me in the right position with my teammates and mixing matching coverages to make it hard for opposing offenses.”Peterson joins a secondary that is in need of veteran experience on the outside. Cam Sutton signed a free-agent deal with Detroit earlier in the week. Levi Wallace was OK in a somewhat situational role while Ahkello Witherspoon played in only four games because of an injury for a team that recovered from a slow start to finish 9-8.Peterson, who turns 33 in July, will automatically become the elder statesman of a secondary that includes perennial Pro Bowler Minkah Fitzpatrick. It's a role Peterson is eager to embrace. Maybe because as the oldest of five kids being a leader has come naturally.“No one has to tell me, you know, ‘We think you should help this guy out,’” Peterson said. “What I’ve done so far in my career (is) I feel like I have so much that I can share (with) the next generation. Why would I wanna hold on to that?”Peterson said he nearly came to Pittsburgh as a free agent last year before deciding to sign another one-year deal to remain with the Vikings. This time around, with a friendly nudge from cousin Bryant McFadden, who spent five years playing for Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, Peterson didn't hesitate to join a team he thinks is close to re-emerging as contender.“I wanted to be a part of this pedigree and this, this identity that the Steeler organization brings to the NFL,” Peterson said. “(They're) always competitive. Coach Tomlin is always going to have his team, his guys, in position to win no matter what the circumstances are. For me, being in the latter part of my career, I wanted to be a part of a very storied franchise.”Peterson is the headliner of a free agent class that includes linebackers Cole Holcomb and Elandon Roberts and left guard Nate Herbig. The Steelers also brought back defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi and safety Damontae Kazee.To free up some money to get under the cap, Pittsburgh did release inside linebacker Myles Jack on Thursday. The move creates about $8 million in salary cap relief. Jack played well during his one season with the Steelers. His 104 tackles led the team, though he dealt with injuries late in the season.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838111,Illinois prison guard gets 20 years for inmate beating death,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — A former Illinois state corrections officer was sentenced on Thursday to 20 years in federal prison for his role in the beating death of a prison inmate in May 2018.Alex Banta, 31, of Quincy was “caught up in the culture” of silence surrounding violence against inmates but there was no excuse for his treatment of 65-year-old Larry Earvin at Western Illinois Correctional Center, U.S. District Judge Sue Myerscough said.In a statement to the court, Banta expressed regret and took responsibility for his actions, but corroborated trial testimony that rough treatment of prisoners was not only condoned but expected at the prison in Mount Sterling, 250 miles (400 kilometers) southwest of Chicago.Following a four-week trial, a jury convicted Banta in April 2022 of conspiracy to deprive civil rights, deprivation of civil rights, obstruction of an investigation, falsification of documents and misleading conduct.Trial testimony revealed that Banta and co-defendants Todd Sheffler and Willie Hedden escorted Earvin, handcuffed behind his back, to the segregation unit vestibule where there were no security cameras, threw him so that his head banged into a wall, then kicked, punched and stomped him. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Bass declared that the fatal blow to Earvin came when Banta jumped up and landed on the inmate’s abdomen with both knees.He faced up to life in prison. Myerscough sentenced him to 15 years on the civil rights charges and five years on the other counts, to run consecutively.“You were one of the younger officers caught up in the culture at Western of ‘see no evil’ and ‘snitches get stitches,’ which you learned from your superiors, but it in no way excuses your conduct,"" Myerscough said. “The governor has replaced the warden and implemented other reforms, so hopefully this culture has changed already.”Earvin's beating on May 17, 2018, resulted in 15 broken ribs and abdominal injuries so severe that a portion of his bowel was surgically removed. He died June 26.“What type of person does it take to assault a 65-year-old man who's handcuffed behind his back?"" remarked Earvin's brother Willie Earvin Jr., 74, who testified for the prosecution. ""I'm a Vietnam veteran and we weren't allowed to do that to prisoners.""In his statement to the court before sentencing, Banta, who looked downward during the bulk of the proceedings, noted his apology would mean little to a federal judge who likely heard it repeatedly from defendants before her, but said he regretted his actions and the pain he caused Earvin's family.He said he went to work at Western in 2014 to support his family “but I had no idea how the job was going to change me."" He described an atmosphere where he was instructed from the get-go to look away from indiscretions.“On my first day, during orientation, Internal Affairs (officers) asked the supervisory staff to leave and then started to tell us, ‘Forget what you learned at the academy. We do things differently here,’” Banta said. “'Things will happen that you might need to ignore. If things happen with an inmate, aim for the body and not the face.'""A request for comment was emailed to the Illinois Department of Corrections spokesperson.Earvin, who suffered from mental illness, was serving a six-year term for theft of merchandise under $300 in Cook County and was scheduled for release in September 2018. He also had a rap sheet dating to 1984.But his son, Larry Pippion, 51, questioned why he was locked up for a petty crime when he was mentally ill.“Isn't there another way to get him help instead of just throwing him away?” Pippion asked. Myerscough later called that fact “an indictment of our system.”Other guards at Western that day testified that Earvin, having reported too late for a break in the yard, refused to return to his cell and allegedly became combative. That prompted an “officer in distress” call to which all available officers are required to respond. Dozens did so and then several, including Banta, escorted him to the segregation unit.Sheffler was tried with Banta but the jury that convicted Banta was hung on Sheffler. He was retried last summer and convicted of the same counts as Banta in August. Hedden pleaded guilty in March 2021 to the more serious charges and testified against both Banta and Sheffler.Hedden testified Thursday that he witnessed Banta punch and kick another inmate a few years before the incident with Earvin. On cross-examination, he wouldn't go so far as to say violence against inmates was unstated policy, but he said superiors were aware of it and “it was too prevalent. It happened all too often.”Sheffler is scheduled for sentencing on Monday and Hedden on Wednesday. ___ Follow Political Writer John O’Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838112,NY cannabis agencies sued by medical marijuana providers,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A coalition that includes some of New York's medical marijuana companies sued state cannabis regulators Thursday in an effort to open up licensing to all retail dispensary applicants immediately.The lawsuit, filed in state court in Albany, claims that state cannabis regulators exceeded their legal authority when they opened the initial application pool in August only to people with past pot convictions or their relatives, instead to everyone. The lawsuit names as defendants the state's Cannabis Control Board and Office of Cannabis Management, as well as top officials.Offering first dibs to individuals with past pot convictions or their relatives was an attempt to create opportunities for those who have been most adversely affected by pot policing, which resulted in Black and Latino people being arrested at disproportionately high rates.According to a memo filed with the lawsuit, the regulatory cannabis boards “overstepped their rule-making authority,” and as a result it “indefinitely postponed the licensing of the hundreds of additional dispensaries necessary to satisfy consumer demand and to displace the illicit markets.”The lawsuit comes as New York tries to get its potentially huge legal market into high gear almost two years after it legalized recreational marijuana for adult use. So far, 66 dispensary licenses have been awarded. The state’s fifth store, a dispensary in Ithaca, was set to open on Thursday.The lawsuit was filed by Coalition for Access to Regulated & Safe Cannabis, a trade association that represents licensed registered medical cannabis providers, including Curaleaf, Green Thumb Industries, Acreage Holdings, and Pharmacann. The companies haven't been able to enter the adult use market in the state because of the limited licensing program, a spokesperson for the coalition said.This isn't the first time that the state's cannabis licensing process has been legally challenged. In November, a judge temporarily blocked New York from issuing pot dispensary licenses in Brooklyn and parts of upstate New York after Variscite NY One claimed the state's selection process improperly favors in-state residents over out-of-state residents. That case is ongoing.Meanwhile, unauthorized pot shops and trucks have popped up throughout the state.The lawsuit contends that if licensing had been opened to all applicants, it would have curtailed illicit storefronts and generated enough tax revenue to reinvest in local communities, which are key provisions of the law that legalized recreational marijuana.A spokesperson for the Office of Cannabis Management said he had no comment on the lawsuit.___Maysoon Khan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

In Denver, third-seeded Gonzaga will face No. 14 seed Grand Canyon and No. 6 seed TCU will take on play-in winner and No. 11 seed Arizona State on Friday.VCU got an automatic bid to the tournament by beating Dayton for the Atlantic 10 Conference title.“I feel like that served as a motivator for us the next year because our last game playing was losing the (A10) championship,” Watkins said Thursday, recalling the Rams' 2021 season. “That kind of sat with us for the rest of the year and the rest of the summer just to get back to where we are now.”Rhoades remembers 2021 clearly, despite claims he can't remember two days ago.After practicing for the Oregon game, the team went back to its hotel and took COVID-19 tests. There was one positive, so the team tested again and went back to the 16th floor for a meal. It turned out to be the last supper. The tests results showed a cluster of positives and the team was shut down.While the news was crushing, Rhoades quoted his mother, Mary, and told his team to move on.“We only lost the basketball game,” Rhoades said. “We lost the opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament. Unfortunately, we’re the only team ever to get kicked out of the NCAA Tournament for something that was out of our control. But like I told our guys, we just missed an opportunity to play a basketball game. That’s it. A lot of people lost a lot of other things and a lot worse off than us.”This year's game may be a contrast of styles. VCU likes to play up-tempo. The Gaels, who have four Australians on the roster, play a patient style for coach Randy Bennett.Bennett believes the teams are alike in some ways. They both play good defense and have their guards control the action.“There’s no bums in this thing,” Bennett said. “If you got in this tournament, it’s hard to get in. There’s only 68 out of 350. It’s really hard to get in. We're here, it's next up, one at a time, meal to meal.”The UConn-Iona game might be the headliner in Albany. It pairs a highly talented Big East school led by Danny Hurley against a tough, scrappy long-range shooting team led by the 70-year-old Pitino, who is being wooed by several schools with coaching vacancies.“It’s anybody’s ballgame,” Pitino said. “We’ve got great respect for Connecticut. They’re not a four seed. I think we all know who have watched them, they could go to a Final Four and win a national championship. They’re so deep. They’re so talented. And we’re a pretty good team as well.""Pitino grinned when asked about former President Barack Obama picking Iona to beat UConn in his bracket. He even told his team about it.“I’ve always said that President Obama was one of the most intelligent presidents we’ve ever had, and this lends credence to that,” he said.LOW-PROFILE ZAGSThis is the first time since 2018 that Gonzaga comes into the tournament as something less than a No. 1 seed. The Bulldogs are a No. 3.The main reason was an uncharacteristically slow start coach Mark Few anticipated. The Bulldogs lost three of their first eight games and their 75-game home winning streak ended.One reason nobody at the Kennel panicked much: Of Gonzaga’s five regular-season losses, one came to Purdue, another to Texas and another to Baylor, teams that are seeded first, second and third, respectively, in this year’s event.“I mean, I don’t know that it was Armageddon,” Few said of the early-season slump. “We were just turning the ball over too much, and that’s not usually indicative of our program. That was a real challenge for us.”A home loss to Loyola Marymount in January was a head-scratcher, but the Zags have won 12 of 13 since. Drew Timme, the larger-than-life, mustachioed forward, is averaging 20.9 points and 7.3 rebounds.Gonzaga made it to the national title game as a 1 seed in 2017 and 2021, but lost both times.RAZOR’S EDGEBy the slimmest of margins, Arizona State sneaked into the tournament. Maybe thanks to a game-winning, 60-foot buzzer-beating shot from Desmond Cambridge Jr. that stunned Arizona in late February.Once the 11th-seeded Sun Devils got in, they showed they belonged, routing Nevada 98-73 in a First Four game on Wednesday. The Sun Devils quickly jumped on a plane for the 1,200-mile excursion to Denver to face TCU.That Arizona State made it into the tournament over teams such as Rutgers and Oklahoma State might have come down to Cambridge’s last-second heave. It gave the Sun Devils five quadrant-one wins. Their 5-6 record against quad-one opponents was better than Oklahoma State and Rutgers.Led by coach Jamie Dixon, the Horned Frogs are making back-to-back tournament appearances for the first time since 1953.___AP National Writer Eddie Pells contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838117,March Madness: USC hoping to mimic Dunk City's magical run,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — When it was time for film study this week, Southern California coach Andy Enfield took an unconventional route and dipped into his archives. Before focusing on Michigan State, he showed his players older NCAA Tournament clips.The Trojans got schooled on Dunk City.“Just to get them pumped up to play in this tournament,” Enfield said.It's been 10 years since Enfield's life changed forever when he helped put tiny Florida Gulf Coast University on the map with a magical run through March.A No. 15 seed, the high-flying Eagles stunned No. 2 Georgetown and dunked on San Diego State to make the Sweet 16 before losing to Florida.So while preparing his No. 10 seed Trojans (22-10) for their first-round East Region matchup against the No. 7 seed Spartans (19-12), Enfield relived some of those moments from a 2013 team that defied long odds.“It’s amazing, it’s been 10 years,” he said Thursday before his team's workout in Nationwide Arena. “Dunk City Team was a group of young men that came together that had no clue what they were getting in for. We were a young staff and a brand-new school. I’ve been emailing and texting a lot of the highlights.”Now in his 10th season at USC, Enfield has remained close with many of those FGCU players, some of whom followed him into coaching. Others are still playing overseas while others have become successful businessmen.They share a bond that was born with a pair of upsets as the Eagles grew from double-digit nobodies into one of those feel-good, Cinderella stories that makes the NCAA tourney so unique.“What they did on the basketball court was special, and to do that in March Madness was incredible,” Enfield said. ""So Dunk City will always be remembered. I usually think about it this time more so than June or July when I’m on a golf course.“But what just a special group of young men, and it’s really nice that my family still has a relationship with a lot of those guys.”As for his current team, Enfield believes it has improved more than any other during his tenure in Los Angeles. The season opened with a 74-61 home loss to FGCU — yes, that FGCU — bringing criticism to the 53-year-old Enfield and a team always in UCLA's shadow.But after a 4-3 start, the Trojans won seven straight and finished 14-6 in the Pac-12. USC lost to Arizona State in its first game in the conference tournament, but Enfield likes how his team is playing.On Friday, USC will meet a Michigan State team has grown even closer following the on-campus tragedy when a gunman killed three students and wounded five more.Coach Tom Izzo has the Spartan s in the tournament for the 25th straight season and Enfield isn't expecting any surprises.""They’ll play their style like we will,” he said. “We have strengths and we’ll try to play to our strengths, like Michigan State. It’s very difficult as a coach to say, hey, we’ve been doing something for 31, 32 games and now we’ll do something different because of who we play or now we’re in the postseason.”THE BIG DROUGHTThe Big Ten has this little problem in the NCAA Tournament. It can't win it.The conference hasn't had a national champion since Michigan State in 2000.That's 23 years between titles, but with Purdue, led by 7-foot-4 All-American center Zach Edey as a No. 1 seed and seven other schools in the field, maybe this is the year the league cuts down the nets last.It's not like the Big Ten hasn't been close. One of its schools has finished as national runner-up seven times since 2000. The last to make the title game was Michigan, which lost to Villanova in 2018.Michigan State coach Tom Izzo noted the conference's deep runs over the past two decades while acknowledging its failings.“Why aren’t we winning it?” said Izzo, who has taken eight teams to the Final Four. “It all comes down to matchups at the end. I worry a little bit. I think we beat the hell out of our league this year, each other. That can make you stronger or wear you down. I don’t know.”“But I like the position that some of these Big Ten teams are in.”WHEELER BACK?Kentucky guard Sahvir Wheeler sounds as if he will be available for Friday’s first-round game against Providence after missing more than a month due to injury.Coach John Calipari wasn’t quite as committal.The 5-foot-9 senior has missed nine straight games because of a right ankle issue. He needed a medical procedure on March 1.When asked if he’d be ready for the team's tourney opener, he said: “I believe so.”Calipari was more restrained in his response.“He is trying his hardest and he is doing great stuff,” Calipari said. “But you know, I’ve got to really feel like he is going to be maybe not 100 percent, but he can’t be 80. Not in a game like this.”BUILDING ROSTERSMemphis coach Penny Hardaway has taken a good team that advanced to the second round of the 2022 NCAA Tournament and made it even better with some key transfers.The Tigers finished 26-8 and knocked off top-seeded Houston in the American Athletic Conference with dynamic guard — and SMU transfer — Kendric Davis scoring 31 points in the championship.Hardaway’s lineup is augmented by a handful of other transfers, including guard Keonte Kennedy (UTEP), guard Elijah McCadden (Georgia Southern) and forward Kaodirichi Akobundu-Ehiogu (UT Arlington).Assimilating that many new players and getting them to play with chemistry was a challenge.“I learned that I have supernatural patience,” Hardaway said with a laugh.No. 8 Memphis on Friday faces No. 9 Florida Atlantic, which went 31-3 with the same core of players from last year’s 19-15 team.“We thought we had a chance to make a run at Conference USA, but 31 wins, no, we never envisioned this,"" FAU coach Dusty May said.COOLEY’S STATUSProvidence coach Ed Cooley wasn’t interested in discussing any other college jobs, including whether he or any of his representatives have been in touch with Georgetown.“This is about Kentucky. This is about Providence,” Cooley said. “We’re all going to be linked to jobs if you do a great job. I’ve been fortunate, been blessed. But that’s just speculation. That’s rumors.“Providence plays Kentucky tomorrow … and I can’t tell you how excited I am about that.”KEEP HUNTING, K-STATEKansas State wasn’t expected to be where it is as the East's No. 3 seed.Picked to finish last in the Big 12, the Wildcats rode their underdog mentality to a surprising third-place finish in the conference behind first-year coach Jerome Tang.And the Wildcats (23-9) aren’t changing their approach as they prepare for Friday’s first-round game against Montana State (25-9).“I feel like we still are hunting no matter what the seeding they give us,” guard Markquis Nowell said. “I still feel like we have a lot to prove, including myself. I know this team is hungry.""VERMONT'S ROLLAn NCAA Tournament berth seemed like a long shot for Vermont coach John Becker when his team started 2-7 with seven new players.But here are the No. 15 seed Catamounts after winning 15 straight — the nation’s longest active streak — and arriving in Columbus full of confidence. They play second-seeded Marquette on Friday.Becker said the matchup against Big East Player of the Year Tyler Kolek won’t intimidate his team, which played St. Mary's and Southern California on the road this season.“At the time we’re sitting 2-7, I had wondered if I had worried about losing the guys a little bit in the sense of killing their confidence,” Becker said. “But in hindsight, maybe it (scheduling) did do exactly what we hoped it would, face some adversity and toughen us up.""The moment is not going to be too big for us.”___AP Sports Writers Aaron Beard, Mitch Stacy and Steve Reed contributed.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838118,MLB asks umpires for heightened sticky substance checks,"NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is heightening in-game inspections by umpires for banned grip aides, concerned that use of foreign substances by pitchers increased again as time passed from a crackdown begun in June 2021.“Unfortunately, spin rates began to rise again during the 2022 season and we received reports of continued use of foreign substances on the field,” MLB senior vice president of on-field operations Michael Hill wrote Thursday in a memo.“Umpires have been instructed to increase the frequency and scope of foreign substance checks this year, including randomized checks of fingers (including removal of rings worn on either hand of pitchers), hands, hats, gloves, belts/waistlines, and pants,” Hill said. “Pitchers may be subject to checks before or after innings in which they pitch, and managers may make inspection requests of a pitcher or position player either before or after an at-bat.”Hill sent the memo to owners, CEOs, team presidents, general managers, field managers and all major and minor league players. The memo was first reported by ESPN.“Umpires also will be focused on suspicious behavior by players that suggests the potential use of foreign substances,” Hill wrote. “For example, if an umpire observes a pitcher attempting to wipe off his hands prior to an inspection, the player may be subject to immediate ejection for violating the rules by attempting to conceal a foreign substance.”Word of the crackdown emerged from an owners meeting on June 3, 2021, and heightened checks started that June 21. Four-seam fastballs averaged 2,319 revolutions per minute through that June 2, then dropped to 2,251 for the rest of the season before rising to 2,276 last year, according to Statcast data. Average velocity of four-seam fastballs increased from 93.7 mph in 2021 to 93.9 mph last year.Only two pitchers have been suspended for foreign substances since the checks started. Seattle’s Héctor Santiago was penalized that June 28 and Arizona’s Caleb Smith that Aug. 24, both for 10 games.“A player who possesses or applies foreign substances in violation of the playing rules is subject to immediate ejection from the game and will be suspended automatically,” Hill wrote. “If a player other than the pitcher is found to have applied a foreign substance to the baseball (e.g., the catcher applies a foreign substance to the baseball before throwing it back to the pitcher), both the position player and pitcher will be ejected; however, position players will not be ejected for having a foreign substance on their glove or uniform unless the umpire determines that the player was applying the substance to the ball in order to aid the pitcher.”MLB threatened to be harsher with repeat offenders.“Players who are found to have used a foreign substance following a prior suspension for violating the rule will be subject to more severe, progressive discipline for each subsequent violation,” Hill said.Hill threatened “severe discipline” for club employees who assist players in using banned grip aides.“Clubs will be held accountable for any foreign substances discovered in any club area (e.g., clubhouse, tunnel, dugout, bullpen, etc.),” he wrote. “Each club must inform its clubhouse managers and clubhouse attendants that they are obligated to report to the general manager any foreign substances that are discovered in the clubhouse or other areas of the stadium. Please note that the pitcher’s bag and bullpen bag have been a frequent source identified by the Gameday Compliance Monitors (“GCMs”) as carrying foreign substances.”In an effort to create more uniform ball conditions, MLB made humidors mandatory for ball storage starting last season. Balls must be kept in them for at least 14 days, and Hill said the temperature must be set at 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) with 57% humidity, except for 65% at mile-high Coors Field. Procedures for removing balls for humidors and rubbing them with mud was standardized last June.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838119,Argentines struggle to make ends meet amid 100% inflation,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Jesica Fernández used to join seven family members every weekend for a large beef barbeque. Beef is no longer on the menu, and now they’re more likely to eat spaghetti or chicken wings.In beef-loving Argentina, barbeques nowadays happen only on birthdays or special occasions, Fernández said.Fernández, 31, is among millions of Argentines struggling to make ends meet as the country’s annual inflation rate clocked in at an annual rate of 102.5 percent in February, the first time it has reached triple digits since 1991.She was shopping at a market sponsored by the Lomas de Zamora municipality, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the capital, where businesses offer basic goods at cheaper prices in exchange for the free retail space.“We buy less beef and we buy fewer things. In reality, you can’t give yourself the luxuries that you could before,” Fernández said,The country's Indec statistics agency said this week that consumer prices increased 6.6% in February from the previous month, a higher number than expected, on top of years of double-digit annual inflation over the past decade. Food was among items that increased the most in February, rising 9.8% from January, in part due to a punishing drought that has pushed prices of meat and other goods higher.“The situation is very difficult, and every day it gets worse,” said Daisy Choque Guevara, 42.Mabel Espinosa, 37, was walking around the market with her 10-day old baby, Gael, hoping to find deals to buy enough food for herself, her husband and six children.“The money isn’t enough for anything,” Espinosa said. “Barbeques? Forget about it.”President Alberto Fernández has been struggling to put the brakes on the country’s soaring inflation rate that will undoubtedly be a key issue in the presidential campaign ahead of October elections.Argentines have long suffered large bouts of rising prices, worse than elsewhere, because of the government's penchant for printing money to finance spending. That trend accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic while a sharp depreciation of the local currency also pushed prices higher.President Alberto Fernández’s center-left administration has tried to rein in the spiraling prices through price controls that have largely failed. Much of the opposition says Argentina needs a broader stabilization plan that includes a sharp decrease in spending.“We obviously think the inflation data is bad, very bad, plus it was unexpected,” presidential spokeswoman Gabriela Cerruti said Thursday. “The government remains firmly committed to controlling prices, controlling inflation, reducing inflation, and not allowing prices to continue increasing.”Espinosa, however, is not convinced things will improve, at least in the short term.“I call it resignation, nothing will change … Why get angry?” she said. “Today you get something at one price and tomorrow it will be another price, but it doesn’t matter, you have to pay for it because you need it.”People have to make cuts where they can.“For example, if I could buy two yogurts before, now I can only buy one,” said Roxana Cabrera, 38. “It’s very difficult to buy now, you have to search for prices.”Anything that isn’t absolutely essential is left for a later date.“I was able to buy clothes before, for example, but not anymore,” Cabrera said. “Now I can only buy food.”For some, the choices are even more drastic.“We don’t eat dinner,” said Yanet Nazario, who lives with three of her children and seven grandchildren in an impoverished neighborhood in Buenos Aires. She was buying flour and soap from an improvised stand set up by a cooperative in her neighborhood that sells a few basic goods at lower prices than the stores.“There’s a lot of sacrifice now because the money you make isn’t enough, you have to work a lot more, we have to go to soup kitchens,” Nazario said.The children in the household get dinner from soup kitchens that now limit their food to only young people because overall demand has become so high.“We adults only drink a cup of tea” for dinner, Nazario said. “The next day we'll skip breakfast, and have lunch.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838120,"Poles: Bears in better place after trade, free agency moves","LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — General manager Ryan Poles acknowledged the temptation to wait and see if the Chicago Bears could get more for the No. 1 overall selection in the draft.He couldn't pass up the chance to add a star receiver when the Carolina Panthers offered DJ Moore to go with a haul of picks. That's why he decided it was time to make the big move.“I think at some point, when you feel comfortable with what you're receiving, you pull the trigger,” Poles said Thursday. “Sometimes, you wait too long and things move on. Trades are hard. When you're a part of them and they pop up and you're having those conversations, they're not comfortable conversations when you're moving on from a player. The longer that you're talking about it and thinking about it, you can start to sway a little bit.”The Bears addressed a big need when they agreed to send the No. 1 pick to Carolina for Moore. Besides giving quarterback Justin Fields a top-tier downfield option, they also got the No. 9 and No. 61 overall picks in 2023 plus a first-rounder in 2024 and a second-rounder in 2025.Once free agency started this week, Chicago continued to make moves.The Bears immediately made two additions at linebacker, agreeing Monday to contracts with Buffalo Bills two-time Pro Bowler Tremaine Edmunds (four years, $72 million, $50 million guaranteed) and former Philadelphia Eagle T.J. Edwards (three years, $19.5 million, $12 million guaranteed).The Bears also signed former Tennessee guard Nate Davis (three years, $30 million), Titans defensive end DeMarcus Walker and Seattle running back Travis Homer (two years, $4.5 million).“I thought we did some really good things,” Poles said. “We got better as a football team.”The Bears certainly had room to improve after setting a franchise record for losses. They went a league-worst 3-14 in their first season under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus.But there is a palpable optimism surrounding a franchise with just three playoff appearances since the 2006 team reached the Super Bowl.The Bears still need help on both lines. They attended pro days this week at Northwestern and Georgia, getting looks at Wildcats offensive tackle Peter Skoronski and Bulldogs defensive tackle Jalen Carter — two players who could be available with the No. 9 pick.Things didn't go well for Carter, who was sprawled out on his back apparently suffering from cramps following position drills. He did not participate in other tests, including the 40-yard dash and broad jump.On Thursday, Carter was given 12 months’ probation and a $1,000 fine after pleading no contest to misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and racing related to a crash that killed Bulldogs offensive lineman Devin Willock and a recruiting staff member.Poles said the Bears “aren't really there yet” when it comes to deciding if they would draft Carter. But they plan to interview him at Halas Hall.“Like the combine, it’s a collection of information,"" Poles said. ""We got some there. We got more at the pro day. We’ll bring him in, and talk to him and get to know him even better. Some point in mid-April, we’ll sit down and put it all on the table and see how we want to handle it.”No matter what other moves they make in free agency and who they take in the draft, Poles insisted the Bears are in a better place after the deals they made.He “couldn't be happier” with the draft picks from Carolina. But he was “over the moon” about landing Moore, who had 5,201 yards and 21 touchdown catches in five seasons with the Panthers.Moore was looking forward to working with receivers Darnell Mooney and Chase Claypool not to mention developing a rapport with Fields after seeing a revolving door of quarterbacks in Carolina.“I won’t call that a mess, but (to) come to a better situation with a stable quarterback, the sky’s the limit from there,"" Moore said.He wasn't the only one looking forward to having Fields on his side. Walker said the quarterback was a draw for him, and he came away even more impressed after the two chatted in the team's weight room.“Having a young, talented quarterback who I watched in college and then got to know him and him kinda telling me about myself in the weight room earlier, I'm like OK. That shows his professionalism,” Walker said. “Justin Fields is definitely someone I want to go to battle with.”NOTES: The Bears agreed to a one-year contract with Green Bay TE Robert Tonyan and a two-year deal with Carolina QB P.J. Walker on Thursday. Tonyan had 52 catches for 586 yards in 2020 and tied a franchise record for touchdown receptions by a tight end with 11. The Bears also released backup QB Trevor Siemian and agreed to one-year deals with Las Vegas Raiders defensive lineman Andrew Billings, Carolina RB D’Onta Foreman.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838121,US Secretary of State Blinken visits Niger on Africa tour,"NIAMEY, Niger (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $150 million in direct assistance to Africa's Sahel region Thursday as he visited Niger, seeking to strengthen ties with a country that has so far avoided the recent spate of military coups and Russian mercenaries destabilizing its neighbors.Blinken's visit comes as both Mali and Burkina Faso remain increasingly volatile, each having gone through two military coups a piece since 2020. Both neighbors also have kicked out French troops from their countries and have enlisted Russian military assistance amid the unabating violence wreaked by Islamic extremists.Blinken on Thursday called Niger “a model of resilience, a model of democracy, a model of cooperation” in the region and warned that the expansion of Russian mercenaries in the region would not bode well for the countries embracing them.“It's not just that we know this is going to end badly — we've already seen it,” he said, adding that the shadowy Russian outfit has not provided “an effective response to insecurity"" in the other places where it has operated.“At the same time we've seen countries find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, less independent as a result of the association with Wagner,” Blinken said at a joint news conference held wtih Niger's Foreign Affairs Minister Hassoumi Massoudou. He was referring to the Russian paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group.“So this is not a recipe for success that I think anyone should be looking to. But yes, it is incumbent upon us to demonstrate through this much more comprehensive approach to insecurity that we can actually deliver results,” Blinken said.Over the past decade, Islamic extremists have greatly expanded their reach across the Sahel, the region located just below the Sahara Desert in Africa. Some of the worst violence has taken place in the area where Niger's porous borders meet with Mali and Burkina Faso.Niger has emerged as a key international partner in the region at a time when anti-French sentiment is on the rise in Mali and Burkina Faso. People have openly waved Russian flags in those countries, urging the junta governments to lean more toward Moscow and away from France, the former colonizer.As relations sharply deteriorated with Mali's junta-leader-turned-president, France relocated its troops there to Niger instead after spending nearly a decade trying to help the Malian military combat Islamic extremists. About 1,000 Wagner mercenaries are believed to be operating in Mali, and over the past year they have been accused of human rights violations.Burkina Faso denies recruiting Wagner fighters, though it says Russian instructors will conduct military training after equipment was purchased from Moscow.Blinken traveled to Niger after a two-day stop in Ethiopia, where he said the country needs to make more progress implementing a peace agreement with its northern Tigray region before relations with the U.S. are normalized.___Larson reported from Dakar, Senegal.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838122,"Miller, transfers lead Maryland women in March Madness","COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Brenda Frese used the transfer portal to overhaul her roster.The result is a Maryland team very much to the coach's liking — a group that can press, force turnovers and score.The second-seeded Terrapins open the women's NCAA Tournament on Friday against 15th-seeded Holy Cross, and what they lack in size, they can make up for with skill and athleticism. The winner of that game faces either seventh-seeded Arizona or 10th-seeded West Virginia in the second round.Injuries and inconsistency plagued Maryland in 2021-22, and although the Terps ultimately reached the Sweet 16, a couple significant players transferred out after the season. Angel Reese became a first-team All-American this year at LSU, and Ashley Owusu went to Virginia Tech.Frese reloaded with transfers Abby Meyers (Princeton), Lavender Briggs (Florida), Elisa Pinzan (South Florida) and Brinae Alexander (Vanderbilt). Meyers is the team's second-leading scorer, and Briggs is shooting 44% from 3-point range.“The transfer portal is, you know, a part of our game, and I think you can see over the last couple of years we’ve had a lot of success within the portal,” Frese said. “Our staff does a tremendous job kind of vetting through it. Where we need to know who the kid is and ... whether they fit our style of play. And that’s really important, being able to score the basketball, being able to run, getting out in our transition game, being able to rebound.”Maryland's group of newcomers has provided plenty of support for the team's biggest star, second-team All-American Diamond Miller.“It was kind of like, OK, back to the drawing board,” Miller said. “We got a new group of girls and let’s regroup. I mean, she’s the head coach and gets paid the way she does for situations like this because she knows how to always, like, recover.”Holy Cross (24-8) beat Boston University to win the Patriot League's automatic bid. Preparing for the pressure that Maryland (25-6) applies isn't easy.“You look back to our championship game, and that's how BU came back into the game,"" Holy Cross coach Maureen Magarity said. ""We were able to break the press, but then how we got into our offense, we really kind of didn't really get into a flow in that second half.”ARIZONA VS. WEST VIRGINIAArizona is just two years removed from an appearance in the national title game. A No. 7 seed this year will make another March Madness run like that difficult.The Wildcats enter their matchup with West Virginia on a three-game losing streak, although the good news for Arizona (21-9) is that it has had a couple weeks off to reset since its exit from the Pac-12 Tournament.“I think it was good for us,"" coach Adia Barnes said. “When you’re rolling, it’s not ideal because then you are on a roll and then you have to wait. I think for us, just from my experience, it’s been good. So we’ll see.”Arizona forward Esmery Martinez, who has started 30 games in 2022-23, played her previous three seasons at West Virginia.“She’s back on East Coast time, so it’s something familiar for her,” Arizona teammate Jade Loville said. “I think that’s just, you know, even better for her. She kind of gets to see some familiar faces. It’s exciting to play against old teammates, so I think she’s excited to get out there and see some of her friends.”West Virginia (19-11) is in its first season under coach Dawn Plitzuweit, who took South Dakota to the Sweet 16 last year.“When you can really score and you’re an offensively efficient team, you can make up for a lot of things. We don’t have as much of a margin for error because we are not that high-powered offensive team yet,” Plitzuweit said. “Maybe tomorrow it’ll all change. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? Reality is probably not, that that’s who we’re going to become by tomorrow. So for us, we have to be really good at competing on every possession.”___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838123,"Business Highlights: Bank rescue package, TikTok concerns","___Big banks create $30B rescue package for First RepublicNEW YORK (AP) — Eleven of the biggest banks in the country announced a $30 billion rescue package for First Republic Bank on Thursday, in an effort to stop the California-based bank from becoming the third bank to fail in less than a week. Shares of First Republic had fallen sharply this week, dropping 60% on Monday alone. For the package, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo would each put $5 billion in uninsured deposits into First Republic. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs would deposit $2.5 billion each. The remaining $5 billion would come from five other banks.___Experts, banks look for ideas to stop next bank failureWASHINGTON (AP) — The warning signs were all there. Silicon Valley Bank was expanding at a breakneck pace and pursuing wildly risky investments in the bond market. The vast majority of its deposits were uninsured by the federal government, leaving its customers exposed to a crisis. None of this was a secret. Yet bank supervisors at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the state of California did nothing as the bank rolled over the cliff. The search for causes and culprits – and solutions — is refocusing attention on a 2018 federal law that rolled back tough bank regulations put in place after the 2008-2009 financial crisis and, perhaps even more, on the way regulators wrote the rules that put that law in place.___Why TikTok’s security risks keep raising fearsChina is accusing the U.S. of spreading disinformation amid reports the Biden administration is calling for TikTok’s Chinese owners to sell their stakes in the company. The statements from China’s Foreign Ministry is yet another response to efforts being made in the U.S. to restrict the app’s influence. TikTok has long been dogged by criticism that it would give user data — such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers — to the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it collects.___Yellen tells Congress US banking system ‘remains sound’WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is telling Congress and the nation that the U.S. banking system remains sound. Yellen is the first Biden administration official to face lawmakers over the decision to protect uninsured money at two failed regional banks in California and New York, which some are calling a bank “bailout.” Yellen testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, a week after the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. Yellen said the government took “forceful actions to strengthen public confidence” in the banking system. Yellen says she can reassure committee members the banking system is steady and Americans “can feel confident” their deposits “will be there when they need them.”___Credit Suisse shares soar after central bank offers lifelineGENEVA (AP) — Credit Suisse shares surged after the Swiss central bank agreed to loan the bank up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) to bolster confidence in the country’s second-biggest lender following the collapse of two U.S. banks. Credit Suisse announced the agreement before the Swiss stock market opened, sending shares up as much as 33%. That was a massive turnaround from a day earlier, when news that the bank’s biggest shareholder would not inject more money into Credit Suisse sent its shares tumbling 30%. The plunge in price dragged down other European banks and deepened concerns about the international financial system.___Europe’s central bank backs big rate hike despite bank chaosFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has carried through with a large interest rate increase, brushing aside predictions it might dial back as U.S. bank collapses and troubles at Credit Suisse feed fears about the impact of higher rates on the global banking system. The ECB hiked rates by half a percentage point Thursday, underlining its determination to fight high inflation. In a statement, the bank called the banking sector in the 20 countries using the euro currency “resilient,” with strong finances. It says it’s “monitoring current market tensions closely and stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area.”___Stocks rally after battered First Republic gets a lifelineNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks rallied after a group of big banks offered a lifeline to the bank that investors had zeroed in on in their hunt for the next victim in the industry’s struggles. The S&P 500 jumped 1.8% Thursday, erasing earlier losses following reports that First Republic Bank could get help or sell itself to another bank. This week has been a whirlwind for markets on worries about banks that may be bending under the weight of the fastest set of hikes to interest rates in decades. Treasury yields also strengthened in a sign of increased confidence from the bond market.___Microsoft adds AI tools to Office apps like Outlook, WordNEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft is infusing artificial intelligence tools into its Office software, including Word, Excel and Outlook emails. The company says the new feature, named Copilot, is a processing engine that will allow users to do things like summarize long emails, draft stories in Word and animate slides in PowerPoint. It will also add a chat function called Business Chat, which takes commands from users. The announcement came two days after OpenAI rolled out its latest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4.

Microsoft rival Google has also been integrating generative AI tools into its own Workspace applications.___Average long-term US mortgage rates come back down to 6.6%NEW YORK (AP) — The average long-term U.S. mortgage inched back down this week after five straight weeks of increases, good news for homebuyers as the housing market’s all-important spring buying season gets underway. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate slid back to 6.60% from 6.73% last week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838124,"GOP congressmen: Halt offshore wind, probe whale deaths","WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) — Republican congressmen called Thursday for a halt to all offshore wind power projects amid a spate of whale deaths on the U.S. East Coast in what was likely the beginning of an expected investigation by the GOP-controlled House into the Biden administration's clean energy plans.Reps. Jeff Van Drew and Christopher Smith, of New Jersey; Andy Harris, of Maryland; and Scott Perry, of Pennsylvania, held a hearing on the boardwalk in Wildwood near where New Jersey has authorized three offshore wind farms, with more to come.The hearing came as 29 whales have died on the East Coast since Dec. 1.Opponents of offshore wind, elected officials — most of them Republicans — and several community groups say they believe that preparatory work on the ocean floor has been responsible for the whale deaths, even though three federal and one state agency say there is no evidence that the two are related.Van Drew said that because President Joe Biden, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and offshore wind companies ""refuse to share the facts with Americans, Congress must do its job.”Smith, who represents parts of the Jersey Shore, was among those calling for a pause on wind farm preparation until the U.S. Government Accountability Office can investigate the “sufficiency of the environmental review processes for offshore wind projects.”“They all say there's no evidence,” Smith said. “You're not even looking!”Harris used the theoretical example of a dog spooked by fireworks that runs into a creek and drowns. A veterinarian would say the dog's cause of death was drowning. But Harris said the true cause of death would be the noise that prompted it to run into the creek.And Perry said, “I get that the administration wants to rush this forward. But this is our country, and we're in charge here. Look: The lights are on right now, without these turbines out in the ocean.”Lauren Gaches, a spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said there is no evidence “to support speculation” that noise resulting from offshore wind site work is killing whales, adding the agency will continue to study the matter.About half of the 29 recorded dead whales were determined to have been struck by ships or entangled in fishing gear, Gaches' agency said.Environmental and pro-wind groups who were not invited to testify at the hearing issued statements supporting offshore wind and decrying falsehoods that Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said are being spread by “long-time opponents to offshore wind and irresponsible news outlets who have blamed these deaths on the offshore wind industry without any evidence.”“Disinformation shouldn’t dictate policy,"" he said. ""The evidence is clear: There’s no link between offshore wind and recent tragic whale strandings.”Most established environmental groups in New Jersey support offshore wind and say climate change spurred by the continued burning of fossil fuels is the real threat to whales and other marine life.“Unlike what Van Drew and others would like you to believe, clean, renewable energy — like wind power in New Jersey — offers an unmissable opportunity to end our dependence on polluters for power,” said Anjuli Ramos-Busot, New Jersey director of the Sierra Club. ""Our dependence on fossil fuels for power, not renewables, put wildlife and coastal communities at risk.”The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection joined this week the growing list of government agencies that have found no link between offshore wind preparation and whale deaths.“Facts matter, and based on them, there is no reason to conclude that recent whale mortality in New Jersey is attributable to offshore wind-related activities,” said Shawn LaTourette, the state environmental protection commissioner.Van Drew cited a recent letter from a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management scientist to the agency warning of dangers to whales from offshore wind.“This is their own scientist warning BOEM that offshore wind will severely impact the whales, yet they moved ahead and completely ignored the few people in their group who would tell the truth,” VanDrew said.Gaches, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesperson, said her agency and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management “recognize this development must be undertaken responsibly.""___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838125,Potent offense powering Utah's historic season,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah is hungry to take a historic season one step further. The No. 2 seed Utes have a powerful enough offense to make big things happen in March.Utah boasts the nation’s fourth best scoring team, averaging 83.5 points on 48.5% shooting per game, and ranks in the top 10 nationally in five major statistical categories. That efficient and potent attack helped the Utes clinch a share of their first Pac-12 title with a victory over Stanford in their regular season finale.“It was just a moment where we proved to ourselves that we could really just do what we put our mind to, because that was one of our biggest goals starting the season out, and we accomplished that,” junior forward Alissa Pili said.Utah (25-4) will put its offense to the test in the first round against No. 15 seed Gardner-Webb (29-4) on Friday. Seventh-seeded North Carolina State (20-11) faces No. 10 seed Princeton (23-5) in the other first-round game in Salt Lake City.Pili helped spearhead Utah’s evolution into Pac-12 co-champion with her dominance around the basket. The USC transfer led the league in scoring (20.3 ppg) and field goal percentage (58.5%). Pili's unique blend of athleticism has made guarding her a nightmare for opposing defenses.“She would have made a heck of a football player,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said. “She’s powerful like that but she’s incredibly graceful and explosive. So it’s just a matchup nightmare for opposing teams.”The Utes suffered an unexpected loss to Washington State in the Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinals while playing without injured point guard Issy Palmer. A two-week layoff has given Palmer time to rehabilitate, and she will likely play on Friday.“The rest time has been critical to get her back,"" Roberts said. “We’ll see how the next 24 hours go, but we anticipate her (being) back.”DIAMOND AILINGNorth Carolina State will be without leading scorer Diamond Johnson on Friday. Johnson missed the ACC Tournament with a lingering ankle injury and still isn’t close to full strength. She said on Instagram that she won't be playing this weekend.“To my family, friends and fans i appreciate all the ongoing support that you’ve had for myself and my teammates on the court through this season. I will not be playing in the ncaa tournament this weekend and wanted to let everyone know,” she wrote. “i have been rehabbing my injury and taking it week by week, although it hasn’t been easy my support system has helped me get to this point both mentally and physically. We aren’t done yet. I will be on the sidelines supporting my team and coaches as always! Thank you all for your forever support!”Johnson missed seven games during the regular season while dealing with her ankle and hasn’t played for the Wolfpack since mid-February. The sophomore guard has appeared in 22 games this season and is averaging 12.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game.Without Johnson, North Carolina State will need to find other avenues for generating offense. The shorthanded Wolfpack still feel confident in their ability to bounce back from an early exit in the ACC Tournament.“We learned a lot about ourselves and the team, even from the coaches,” center Camille Hobby said. “So we just kind of go forward from how we feel as players and just keep going. It’s the only option we have at this point.”STREAKING TIGERSFor the second straight season, Princeton enters the NCAA Tournament with a double-digit win streak. The Tigers rattled off 15 straight victories to bounce back from 0-2 start in Ivy League play to claim the league’s autobid and earn a 10 seed.Last season, Princeton knocked out six-seeded Kentucky in the first round as an 11-seed. The Tigers could be equally dangerous this time around behind a stingy defense. Princeton ranked as the Ivy League’s top scoring defense while limiting opponents to 52.5 points and 37.1% shooting during the regular season.Ellie Mitchell powers the defense with 11.0 rebounds and 2.4 steals per contest.BULLDOGS HAVE BITEGardner-Webb enters Friday’s contest against Utah with a 21-game winning streak. The Bulldogs posted an 18-0 record against Big South Conference opponents this season.Much like the Utes, Gardner-Webb boasts a potent offense. Four players average double figures – led by Jhessyka Williams with 19.0 points per game – and the Bulldogs tallied 76.7 points per contest during the regular season. ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

Binnington left his crease and went after Hartman right after giving up the Wild's fifth goal of the night.Minnesota goalie Marc-Andre Fleury skated the length of the ice to confront the unmasked Binnington, but the two were separated by officials and Binnington was sent off the ice.Binnington will forfeit $64,864.86 under the NHL collective bargaining agreement based on his average annual salary. The money goes to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund.Binnington is 22-24-5 with a 3.39 goals-against average.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838127,Michigan adds LGBTQ protections to anti-discrimination law,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation Thursday codifying LGBTQ protections into the state's civil rights law, permanently outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in the state.The legislation follows a state Supreme Court ruling last year that the Michigan’s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which outlaws discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and education on the basis of sex, extended to sexual orientation as well.Whitmer’s signature Thursday ensures that the high court’s ruling cannot be reversed in the future and goes one step further in extending protections to include gender identity or expression. It comes at a time, Whitmer said, when there's a “nationwide assault on our LGBTQ-plus community, especially our trans neighbors, family and friends.”“There are state legislatures across this country dedicating themselves to legalizing discrimination,” Whitmer said. “In Michigan, we will keep expanding freedoms and getting things done on the issues that actually make a difference in people’s lives.”Democrats took full control of the state government this year for the first time in 40 years and have worked quickly to undo decades of Republican measures. The Michigan Legislature advanced a repeal of the state's “right-to-work” law earlier this week. On Thursday, the Senate passed an 11-bill gun safety package.Michigan was previously one of 29 states that did not have laws explicitly protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, according to the gay rights group the Human Rights Campaign, and Michigan Democrats made it a top priority this year after seeing the effort blocked by Republicans for years.The Michigan House and Senate passed the LGBTQ protections earlier this month with the large majority of Republicans voting in opposition, claiming that it could infringe on religious groups’ rights.The bill's sponsor, Jeremy Moss, the state's first openly gay state senator, said Thursday that amending the state's civil rights act to include LGBTQ protections has been 40 years in the making. “This baton has been passed from generation to generation,” he said.The Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act also prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status and marital status.Former Republican Rep. Mel Larsen, who helped author the civil rights act alongside Democratic Rep. Daisy Elliott in 1976, attended the bill signing in Lansing and said the “original intent, and the intent still, is that every citizen of Michigan has the right to be protected under the Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act.”The anti-discrimination legislation also comes at a time when advocates for LGBTQ rights say Republican-led states across the country are trying to erase the legal existence of people who are trans and to restrict the expression of those who are nonbinary, gender-fluid or who perform in drag.Earlier this month, Tennessee became the first state to severely limit drag show performances as other Republican-led states consider similar measures. An increasing number of states have also banned, or are considering banning, gender-affirming medical care for young people.",2023/3/17,,World

Your sister is the head coach at Georgia. You’ll be getting tickets. You’ll be fine.’”The Seattle Regional 4 games on Friday — featuring second-seed Iowa against No. 15 seed Southeastern Louisiana and seventh-seed Florida State vs. No. 10 seed Georgia — were gone within a hour after going on sale Monday morning.It's the star power of the Hawkeyes, who have played in front of sold-out crowds at home and large road crowds drawn by an offense that averages a nation-best 87.5 points, led by guard Caitlin Clark.“I think maybe we’ve gotten kind of used to our fans being as incredible as they are,"" said Clark, an Associated Press first-team All-American who is third in the nation in scoring at 27 points per game. ""I think it just shows the excitement in our community about women’s basketball and that’s the excitement that it could be like all around the country.""Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said that she's been surprised by Clark's reception as they traveled this season.“What has been surprising to me is when we go on the road and when I see, in Maryland, girls with signs, 'I’m from Massachusetts and I came here to see you play. “We were at Nebraska and there's a sign, ‘I’m your biggest fan in North Dakota.'""People are traveling miles to see this team and to see Caitlin play.”A total of 14,382 tickets were sold for the weekend, matching last year's total for the two NCAA sessions in Iowa City — the highest attendance for the tournament outside of the Final Four.The Hawkeyes (26-6) want to avoid what happened last season, when they were eliminated in the second round by 10th seed Creighton.“I feel like that’s kind of been the story for us all year long — people want to beat the Iowa Hawkeyes,” Clark said. “They’re going to come in and give you your best game every single time. We really understand that we’ve experienced that all year, so it shouldn’t be anything that we’re afraid of by any means.”Southeastern Louisiana (21-9) is making its first NCAA Tournament appearance after winning the Southland Conference regular-season and tournament titles.“We've played in big environments,” coach Ayla Guzzardo said. “Now, this is going to be a bigger environment, a way bigger stage. Playing Caitlin Clark is going to be fun for them. They're not necessarily star-struck.”Friday's first game features a Florida State team that will be playing with just eight players for the rest of the tournament.The Seminoles (23-9), who had just 10 players on the roster all season, will be without freshman guard Ta'Niya Latson and sophomore guard O'Mariah Gordon, who are out with season-ending injuries.Latson was an honorable-mention AP All-American along with ACC Rookie of the Year and a first-team all-conference selection. She averaged 21.3 points and 4.5 rebounds this season.""Fortunately or unfortunately, we’ve been in this situation before throughout the season,"" Florida State coach Brooke Wyckoff said. “We’ve been down to eight players at certain times. So that’s one of the things that I love about our group, is that we only have 10, but I’ve always felt we’re deep.Latson missed the Seminoles' loss to Wake Forest in the ACC tournament because of an undisclosed injury. Gordon, who played in 30 games and started twice this season, averaged 6.9 points and 2.0 rebounds.“Ta'Niya is a talented scorer and all-around player, but stylistically in our approach to the game — which is to get out and run, attack the basket, find open shooters — that won’t change in terms of what we do,"" Wyckoff said.Georgia (21-11) has won six of its last eight games, with its only losses coming to ranked teams South Carolina and LSU.The Bulldogs are looking forward to the atmosphere of the sellout crowd.“When the lights come up, I believe that’s when the best players come out,” forward Javyn Nicholson said. “That’s when the stars come out, and I think we’re going to be out.”___https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838129,Mississippi governor OKs longer postpartum Medicaid coverage,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation Thursday to solidify a full year of Medicaid coverage for women after they give birth, saying it's part of a “new pro-life agenda” to help mothers now that abortion access is restricted.Mississippi usually allows two months of postpartum Medicaid coverage. The state has allowed a full year of the coverage since the COVID-19 public health emergency started in 2020, although many patients have said the state did little to let them know postpartum coverage continued after the usual two months.With national public health emergency set to expire in May, Mississippi officials intensified their debate over committing to a full year of postpartum benefits. Reeves is seeking reelection, and Democrats hammered him for his long refusal to support the extension.The governor endorsed the idea Feb. 26, even though he said he had not seen financial information he wanted to justify the roughly $7 million annual cost to the state.The new law Reeves signed takes effect July 1.“I believe continuing to offer care for new moms for up to 12 months after the birth of their baby is the right thing to do,” Reeves said in a statement Thursday. ”This is one more thing we can do to tip the scales in favor of life.”The U.S. Supreme Court used a Mississippi case last year to overturn its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling and upend abortion rights nationwide. Several days later, Mississippi enacted a 2007 law that says abortion is legal only if the pregnant woman’s life is in danger or if a pregnancy is caused by a rape reported to law enforcement.Mississippi health officials have predicted the state could see an increase of 5,000 births per year because of abortion restrictions.In more than a half-dozen states, Republican officials who previously resisted extending postpartum Medicaid coverage are now embracing it as part of their anti-abortion agenda.Medicaid pays for about 60% of births in Mississippi, one of the poorest states in the U.S.As governor since January 2020 and during two previous terms as lieutenant governor, Reeves has resisted efforts to expand the scope of Medicaid and other government programs. He has not publicly changed his opposition to a broader expansion of Medicaid coverage to working people with low-wage jobs that don’t provide private insurance.Mississippi is one of 11 states that have not approved that broader expansion. That list could be whittled to 10 states, as North Carolina is working on expansion.____Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twitter at http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838130,Iowa lawmakers send school bathroom bill to governor,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Transgender students won't be allowed to use a public school restroom in Iowa that aligns with their gender identity under a bill that Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds was expected to sign into law after it got final legislative approval Thursday.The bill received support only from Republicans, who argued it was needed to protect children who might feel uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a student whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. Opponents countered that the bill was unnecessary and could lead to harassment against transgender students.The House approved the measure 57-39, with five Republicans joining the 34 Democrats present in opposing the proposal. The vote came a week after the Senate approved the bill.Republican Rep. Steven Holt said the bill “applies to everyone equally.” Holt said children have long used different restrooms based on biological and physiological characteristics and this tradition should continue.“I do understand and empathize with a child that may not feel comfortable using the bathroom of their biological sex. Accommodations should be made when possible to keep that child comfortable as they change or use the restroom,"" Holt said. ""However, that cannot be done or should not be done at the expense of the privacy and safety of our daughters.”Democrats responded that there was no history of transgender students bothering other students in restrooms and that a new requirement would put trans children in danger.“All students deserve a safe school environment,” said Democratic Rep. Jennifer Konfrst. “Forcing transgender students into restrooms that don't match their gender identity puts their safety at risk.”The group Iowa Safe Schools, which advocates for LGBTQ students, said that since gender identity was added to the Iowa Civil Rights Act in 2007, there had been no documented incidents of transgender people acting inappropriately in restrooms.""This bill is a solution to an imaginary problem, all for the sake of bullying trans children,” Becky Tayler, the group's executive director, said in a statement.Iowa is among several states with Republican leadership that have passed similar legislation.On Wednesday, lawmakers approved such a bill in Arkansas and sent it to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee also have passed laws with similar restroom restrictions.Reynolds, who has been supportive of measures that limit the teaching of transgender topics in schools and restrict trans girls' participation in sports, is expected to sign the bill. Another bill approved last week that awaits the governor's signature would prohibit doctors from providing gender-affirming medical care, including puberty blockers and gender-affirming surgeries.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838131,Heinicke says he signed with Falcons to be Ridder's backup,"ATLANTA (AP) — Desmond Ridder's status as the Atlanta Falcons' starting quarterback was confirmed by his new backup, Taylor Heinicke, on Thursday.Heinicke signed his two-year contract with the Falcons believed to be worth up to $20 million on Thursday and then said his job will be to support Ridder, who started the final four games of the 2022 season as a rookie.That was a surprise to anyone who assumed Heinicke, who has 25 career starts in five seasons with Houston, Carolina and Washington, would compete with Ridder for the starting job.When asked his mindset going into the 2023 season with Ridder as the returning starter, Heinicke said “Try to be the best backup I can to him. Try to help him in any way I can.”Heinicke said his backup role was made clear to him by the Falcons, eliminating any perception of a competition at the position in training camp.“Yeah, they drafted him high last year for a reason,” Heinicke said of Ridder, who was a third-round draft pick from Cincinnati. “They believe in him for a reason. He showed some good film last year. Again, if something unfortunate happens to him I’ll be ready to go.""Heinicke, 30, will provide experience the Falcons lacked at quarterback after releasing Marcus Mariota on Feb. 28. Mariota opened the 2022 season as the starter before Ridder posted a 2-2 record in the final four games to cap a 7-10 season.Ridder completed 63.5% of his passes for 708 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also rushed for 64 yards while being sacked nine times.Heinicke started 24 games the past two seasons for the Washington Commanders. He said he was close to re-signing with Washington before being won over by a more attractive offer from Atlanta.Heinicke, who was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, and played at Collins Hills High School in suburban Atlanta, said he was influenced by the family draw to Atlanta even though it was difficult to leave Washington.“It was very tough,” he said. “I feel like that’s a home for me. I’ve got a lot of great relationships there. I’ve got a lot of great memories there. They gave me my second chance at football and there’s a lot of special people there. I’m going from one home to another so it’s a pretty easy process but I’d be lying to you not to say I was a little heartbroken to leave those people up there.”By committing to Ridder as the starter and signing Heinicke, the Falcons saved salary cap space to build their roster as they hope to end a streak of five consecutive losing seasons. The team also officially signed safety Jessie Bates III to a $64 million, four-year contract and linebacker Kaden Elliss to a three-year contract on Thursday.The Falcons also have added defensive lineman David Onyemata, who played with Elliss in New Orleans, to a three-year deal while re-signing Pro Bowl guard Chris Lindstrom, right tackle Kaleb McGary, outside linebacker Lorenzo Carter and fullback Keith Smith.Bates said he “checked in” with Onyemata and Elliss “and really figure out who each other were” as the three discussed their new roles in Atlanta.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World

The Musketeers (25-9) are back in the tourney for the first time since 2018 as the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region.“He made it known that this isn’t going to be a rebuilding year,” Musketeers guard Adam Kunkel said of Miller's arrival on campus in 2021. “(He said) that we’re going to hit the ground running — and that’s what we’ve done.”Miller spent five years with Xavier from 2004-09, reaching the Sweet 16 twice and the Elite Eight once before moving on to Arizona, where he spent 12 seasons before departing amid the scrutiny of a 2017 FBI investigation over shady recruiting practices.Arizona assistant coaches were penalized, but Miller escaped unscathed.However, due to Arizona's self-imposed sanctions and a drop-off in recruiting, Miller hasn't been to the NCAA Tournament since 2018.“Sometimes when you are away from the NCAA Tournament, you miss it and learn how special it is to be here,” Miller said. “Being a 3 seed and returning back I think is something that means a lot to all of our players.”The Musketeers have persevered this season despite losing leading scorer Zach Freemantle, who went down with a season-ending foot injury in late January. Still, Xavier won five of its final six games.“When you lose somebody like that, you don’t really know how it’s going to go,” Miller said. “And I think the testament for us is we’ve been able to overcome that injury as well, which I give a lot of credit to our players.”Xavier faces Atlantic Sun Conference champion Kennesaw State (26-8) on Friday. Making their first March Madness appearance, the Owls are 12 1/2-point underdogs, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.“We’re technically an underdog on paper, but we don’t see ourselves as an underdog,” Kennesaw State guard Chris Youngblood said.THEY HAVE A HISTORYKent State faces No. 4 seed Indiana in the Midwest Region in Albany, New York, on Friday, and Golden Flashes coach Rob Senderoff has a history with the Hoosiers.It’s not the best.Senderoff was an assistant under then-Indiana coach Kelvin Sampson from 2006-08. Sampson and Senderoff were both sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations related to impermissible contact with recruits during their time with the Hoosiers and the program was hit with probation.Senderoff landed at Kent State as an assistant, and the school kept him on even after the NCAA hit him with a three-year show cause order.He rose to head coach in 2011 and has been one of the most successful coaches in the Mid-American Conference since.Senderoff was asked about what went wrong at Indiana on Thursday and declined to dig into the past.“Respectfully, I’d be happy to talk to you about it at some other time, but I really feel like the tournament, wasting that time on me, is really not where I want to go today,” he said.Indiana won NCAA Tournaments under Bobby Knight in the 1970s and ’80s, but has been unable to regain superpower status for the last few decades. Tom Crean followed Sampson and Indiana made the NCAA Tournament four times in nine seasons. Archie Miller followed with four seasons and no NCAA appearances.Former IU player and NBA coach Mike Woodson seems to have the Hoosiers pointed in the right direction.Indiana won a First Four game before losing in the first round of last year’s NCAA Tournament. Now the Hoosiers are back with bigger aspirations.“Yes, expectations are high, and I knew that coming in,” Woodson said. “Hell, I played here. They should be high, and it’s OK. Indiana is a big-time program. It’s been that way for years. I’m just trying to get them back on top, man. That’s all I care about.”Indiana and Kent State have some NCAA Tournament history, too. The Flashes beat the Hoosiers in the first round of the 2001 tournament. The very next year, they met again in a regional final and Indiana beat Kent State to reach its most recent Final Four appearance.OMIER BACK AT PRACTICEMiami leading rebounder Norchad Omier, nursing a sprained ankle, practiced with the team Thursday in Albany, New York, but his status for the fifth-seeded Hurricanes’ first-round game against Drake is still uncertain.Omier was injured in the Atlantic Coast Conference semifinals against Duke on Friday night. He participated in a workout that was open to media and fans Thursday that is not the most strenuous test for players. Omier took jumpers and even threw down a dunk.“His impact is always huge. He’s got the biggest personality you could ever imagine. His energy on and off the court, his relationship with his teammates and our community is sensational,” Miami coach Jim Larranga said before practice.“If he’s good, we’re good. If he’s not, we’ll know it, and we’ll make the adjustment.”The 6-foot-7 third-year sophomore averages 13.6 points and a team-high 9.7 rebounds. He was an All-ACC second-team pick by The Associated Press.“Norchad is obviously day by day, but we have time to prepare without him, versus Duke we didn’t,” Miami’s Jordan Miller said. ” Obviously we’d love to have him.”Norchad is an inside force on both ends for a team that otherwise operates mostly from the wings and perimeter.“He brings some physicality,” Drake coach Darian DeVries said. “The rebounding, he’s elite at. Like I said, they’re still a really good team whether he plays or not, but he does bring a dimension that is really good for them.”UNFINISHED BUSINESSNo. 11 seed Pitt (21-13) returns to Greensboro Coliseum on Friday looking to address what Panthers guard Greg Elliott called “unfinished business"" from eight days ago when they lost on the same court to Duke in the ACC Tournament quarterfinals.“We didn’t win the tournament like we had hopes to do,” Elliott said.Pitt beat Mississippi State on Tuesday in a First Four game for for its first NCAA Tournament win since 2014.The Panthers made eight 3-pointers in the first half against a team that ranked in the top 10 in the country in defense. Now they will face No. 6 seed Iowa State (19-13), a team that finished 182nd in the country in 3-point defense.“We’re going to need to be highly disruptive because we know that they can really get it going from long range,"" Cyclones coach T.J. Otzelberger said.Iowa State struggled down the stretch, losing nine of its final 13 games while playing a brutal Big 12 schedule loaded with Top 25 teams.“We play in the best league in America, and it’s a credit to our opponents,” Otzelberger said. “We know every night out feels like a heavyweight fight. A lot of humility playing in our league that you have got to have and a short-term memory.”___AP Sports Writers Ralph Russo and Tom Canavan in Albany, New York, contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

(AP) — Alabama buried Texas A&M-Corpus Christi under an early 3-point onslaught, launching the NCAA Tournament's top seed to a 96-75 first-round romp on Thursday even with star freshman Brandon Miller going scoreless.The Crimson Tide (30-5) set aside their off-court distractions and buried 10 first-half 3s in a predictably easy win over the 16th-seeded Islanders (24-11) at Legacy Arena, less than an hour from campus.Miller, the 6-foot-9 All-American who has been beset by questions about his presence at the scene of a fatal shooting, sat out the final 14 minutes and missed all five field goal attempts while dealing with a groin injury. His previous low was eight points against Houston on Dec. 10.“We’re making shots at a pretty high level,"" Alabama coach Nate Oats said. ""It’s nice to put up 96 without Brandon scoring any of them. He’s been nursing a groin injury. We want to play him limited minutes and were able to keep him under 20.”Of course, none of the starters played more than 21 minutes, resting up for the next round.“It doesn’t really matter how much I score. I think our whole team are just winners,” Miller said. “The final score at the end of the game, that’s what we care about.”Miller hasn't been accused of any crime in the shooting, which led to capital murder charges against then-teammate Darius Miles and another man.Alabama coasted after leading 54-34 by the half and advanced to play eighth-seeded Maryland on Saturday in the South Region.Nick Pringle, a junior college transfer who came in averaging 3 points per game, scored 17 and had a season-high 13 rebounds. Mark Sears made three 3s in a 58-second span of the first half and scored 15 points. Jahvon Quinerly scored 13 and Nimari Burnett had 11.Noah Clowney scored all 10 of his points in the first five-plus minutes, including three 3s.Trevian Tennyson led the Islanders with 20 points. Isaach Mushula scored 16 and Owen Dease 14. The Islanders have never beaten a ranked team.Coach Steve Lutz has lifted the Islanders to two straight NCAA Tournaments since taking over a team that had gone 5-19 the year before his arrival.The Islanders were without Terrion Murdix (left knee injury), the Southland League defensive player of the year.“They should be very, very proud of themselves,” Lutz said.His team did muster an 8-0 flurry early in the second half to cut the deficit to 13 points. But the momentum didn't last.“They’re a great team. They answered back,” Tennyson said. “They have a chance to win the national title.”BIG PICTURETexas A&M-Corpus Christi: Advanced with its first tourney win in a play-in game against Southeast Missouri State. Was only outscored 42-41 in the second half.Alabama: Made 8 of 11 3s early and 15 of 33 (45.5%) overall. Got to play in an arena full of crimson-and-white against an overmatched opponent.“When we came out of the tunnel, I had chills,"" Sears said. ""Just seeing all the love we had.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838134,NZ 155-2 when bad light ends Day 1 of 2nd test vs Sri Lanka,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Rain delayed the start and bad light hastened the finish on the first day of the second cricket between New Zealand and Sri Lanka on Friday.In the 48 overs that were bowled in between, New Zealand reached 155-2 after being sent in. Devon Conway made 78 and gave the New Zealand innings solidity in an 87-run opening stand with Tom Latham (21).Kane Williamson was 26 not out when bad light brought and end to the day’s play 45 minutes before scheduled stumps. Henry Nicholls, battling a form slump, was 18 not out.Heavy rain overnight continued into the morning and prevented any play before lunch Friday. When the covers finally came off, a bright green pitch was revealed and Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne was delighted to send New Zealand in when he won the toss.But looks can be deceiving. The pitch didn’t help Sri Lanka’s three seamers as Karunaratne expected: still soft, it was relatively slow and the bounce was not threatening. With no further rain, the pitch might be harder and better on the second day.Conway and Latham were watchful at the start. Taking time to get the measure of the pitch, they scored only 20 from the first nine overs.The batsmen looked under no threat, until Latham who had taken his 21 runs from 73 balls, finally hit out but lofted the ball directly to Prabath Jayasuriya coming off the fence at backward square.Conway reached his eighth half century from 69 balls, scoring steadily. By tea New Zealand was 109-1 and Conway had hit all 12 of the boundaries in the innings by that stage.He looked set and immovable when he came down the pitch to an innocuous delivery from Dhananjaha de Silva, was caught halfway between defense and a forceful shot and popped the ball back to the bowler. He was out in similar style in the second innings of the first test at Christchurch.“As we said earlier in the day, it is certainly green,” Conway said. “It wasn’t too bad out there.“There was a little bit of tennis ball bounce early with the new ball. But when we got through that period scoring became a bit easier. When they hit that hard length, top of the stumps and started to nibble it a bit they asked some tough questions. It was nice to get a couple of bad balls and put them away.”New Zealand leads the two-match series after winning the first test by two wickets with a single off the last ball on the fifth day. Williamson ran the winning run with Neil Wagner and was 121 not out.Williamson continued that form Friday with a careful innings which had lasted 102 minutes by stumps.Nicholls had batted 55 minutes and was working hard to work his way out of a lengthy slump. He made 2 and 20 in the first test against Sri Lanka and 70 runs at 17.5 in New Zealand’s previous two-test series against England. His last innings of 50 or more came 10 tests ago, against South Africa in February 2022.Wagner was not in the team for the second test. He played the last day of the Christchurch test with a hamstring and a bulging disc in his back. His place was taken in Wellington by Doug Bracewell, who is playing his first test since 2016.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

Cavalli is undergoing Tommy John surgery.“Edwin Díaz is a great human being and a fierce competitor,” Mets owner Steve Cohen tweeted. “All of us at the Mets are shaken but determined to sustain our quest for a great season. We wish Edwin a speedy recovery.”Mets general manager Billy Eppler said the recovery timetable for a patellar tendon generally is around eight months.“There are instances where athletes have come back earlier, more around the six-month mark,” Eppler told reporters. “But those are a little bit more of the exception than the rule.”Díaz signed a five-year, $102 million contract — the largest ever for a closer — after going 3-1 with a 1.31 ERA and 32 saves in 35 opportunities while striking out 118 batters in 62 innings last season.While Díaz is a two-time All-Star, Cavalli is just beginning his major league career as one of the Nationals’ brightest prospects.Now he’s hit a roadblock that will delay his progress.Cavalli exited a spring training start against the Mets after 2 2/3 innings on Tuesday.“While Cade will not pitch in 2023, he continues to be a very important part of our franchise’s future and we look forward to having him back on the mound,” Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said in a statement. “We will provide an update on his surgery when it is available.”These injuries represented two of the latest and most serious setbacks involving pitchers in a spring that’s been full of them.The Arizona Diamondbacks are expecting Mark Melancon and Corbin Martin to open the season on the injured list. The Mets announced earlier this week that José Quintana will be out until at least July with a stress fracture in his rib. Texas Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said this week that Jake Odorizzi won’t be ready for the season opener due to arm fatigue. ___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838136,Regulators monitor tritium leak at Minnesota nuclear plant,"ST.. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota regulators said Thursday they're monitoring the cleanup of a leak of 400,000 gallons of radioactive water from Xcel Energy's Monticello nuclear power plant, and the company said there's no danger to the public.“Xcel Energy took swift action to contain the leak to the plant site, which poses no health and safety risk to the local community or the environment,” the Minneapolis-based utility said in a statement.While Xcel reported the leak of water containing tritium to state and federal authorities in late November, the spill had not been made public before Thursday. State officials said they waited to get more information before going public with it.“We knew there was a presence of tritium in one monitoring well, however Xcel had not yet identified the source of the leak and its location,” Minnesota Pollution Control Agency spokesman Michael Rafferty said.“Now that we have all the information about where the leak occurred, how much was released into groundwater, and that contaminated groundwater had moved beyond the original location, we are sharing this information,"" he said, adding the water remains contained on Xcel's property and poses no immediate public health risk.The company said it notified the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the state on Nov. 22, the day after it confirmed the leak, which came from a pipe between two buildings. Since then, it has been pumping groundwater, storing and processing the contaminated water, which contains tritium levels below federal thresholds.“Ongoing monitoring from over two dozen on-site monitoring wells confirms that the leaked water is fully contained on-site and has not been detected beyond the facility or in any local drinking water,” the Xcel Energy statement said.When asked why Xcel Energy didn't notify the public earlier, the company said: “We understand the importance of quickly informing the communities we serve if a situation poses an immediate threat to health and safety. In this case, there was no such threat."" The company said it focused on investigating the situation, containing the affected water and figuring out next steps.The Monticello plant is about 35 miles (55 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, upstream from the city on the Mississippi River.Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that occurs naturally in the environment and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the NRC. A person who drank water from a spill would get only a low dose, the NRC says.The NRC says tritium spills happen from time to time at nuclear plants, but that it has repeatedly determined that they've either remained limited to the plant property or involved such low offsite levels that they didn't affect public health or safety. Xcel reported a small tritium leak at Monticello in 2009.Xcel said it has recovered about 25% of the spilled tritium so far, that recovery efforts will continue and that it will install a permanent solution this spring.“While this leak does not pose a risk to the public or the environment, we take this very seriously and are working to safely address the situation,” Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy–Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, said in the statement. “We continue to gather and treat all potentially affected water while regularly monitoring nearby groundwater sources.”Xcel Energy is considering building above-ground storage tanks to store the contaminated water it recovers, and is considering options for the treatment, reuse, or final disposal of the collected tritium and water. State regulators will review the options the company selects, the MPCA said.Japan is preparing to release a massive amount of treated radioactive wastewater into the sea from the the triple reactor meltdowns 12 years ago at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The water contains tritium and other radioactive contaminants.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838137,San Diego State tops Charleston 63-57 in NCAA tourney,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Matt Bradley's last NCAA Tournament game essentially ended with him bobbling the ball out of bounds, a costly turnover against Creigton in an overtime loss last year.There was zero chance he was going to do it again.Bradley scored 17 points and made play after play down the stretch, including hitting two free throws in the final minute, and No. 5 seed San Diego State held on to beat 12th-seeded College of Charleston 63-57 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday.The victory was a measure of redemption for Bradley, whose mistake last year proved costly in the three-point loss.“I'm just thinking positive things,” said Bradley, who insisted he had no flashbacks to the gaffe. “I'm looking at the bench and everybody trusts me now. Nobody side-eying. I think I have full trust in my teammates and in my coaches on making that free throw, so it felt really good.”The senior provided pivotal plays in this one, helping the Aztecs (28-6) win their first game in the Big Dance since 2015. They ended a four-game losing streak in the tournament and snapped an 11-game skid for the Mountain West Conference.“Everybody makes us aware of (the losing streak),” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “The thing that you can’t lose sight of is every team and every season is different. You know, there is no history.“This team is creating its own history right now. ... We're not worried about past failures or successes. We’re only focused on the moment, and that’s how you win games.”The Cougars (31-4) lost for the first time in six weeks and have not won an NCAA tournament game since 1997.San Diego State advanced to face 13th-seeded Furman in the South Region at the Amway Center on Saturday. The Paladins used a late steal and 3-pointer to stun No. 4 seed Virginia four years to the day since the Cavaliers became the first and only No. 1 seed to lose in the opening round.Charleston looked to provide another upset in Orlando, but coach Pat Kelsey’s scrappy team simply couldn’t do enough down the stretch.San Diego State did.Bradley scored on a driving layup coming out of a timeout with 2:37 to play, breaking a tie and ending a nearly 3-minute scoring drought for the Aztecs. Micah Parrish followed with a huge 3-pointer, giving them a little breathing room in the final minutes.Charleston looked like it might be able to rally, but Jaylon Scott was called for a foul as Bradley shot a 3. He hit two of three from the charity stripe to essentially seal it.Ante Brzovic led Charleston with 12 points and eight rebounds. Ryan Larson added 11 points, and seventh-year senior Dalton Bolon finished his college career with 10 points.“These seniors, although they played their last game in a Charleston uniform, they're going to leave a legacy that's going to last decades,” Kelsey said.Bradley, one of four senior starters for San Diego State, chipped in seven rebounds and four assists.“We understand how important it is to close out games because in March Madness anybody can win,” Bradley said. “Ranking doesn't matter. Nothing matters. The hardest team is going to win, and that's what we did.”BIG PICTURECharleston: The Cougars had three graduate-senior starters who carried them to the tournament, and Kelsey will probably turn to the transfer portal to find replacements. The one glaring weakness against San Diego State was a post presence as the team got outscored by 12 points in the paint.San Diego State: The Aztecs salvaged what looked to be another rough start for the Mountain West. Nevada lost in a play-in game Wednesday night to extend the league’s losing skid to double digits, and Utah State made it 11 straight with a loss to Missouri early Thursday. But the conference champs stepped up and got the league back in the win column.UP NEXTCharleston gets to work rebuilding a senior-laden roster.

But even in limited at-bats in the Cactus League, he's hit four homers, which was tied for the spring lead through Wednesday's games.Conforto signed a two-year, $36 million contract with the Giants in the offseason. This spring is a reminder of how good the former New York Mets star can be when healthy. He was an All-Star in 2017, hit a career-high 33 homers in 2019 and batted .322 during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.Conforto hasn't played a regular-season game since Oct. 3, 2021, when he was with the Mets.Here are a few more standouts during MLB's spring training games in Arizona and Florida:Corey Kluber, Red Sox, RHP: The two-time AL Cy Young winner has been impressive so far this spring, with a 2.13 ERA and 14 strikeouts over 12 2/3 innings. Kluber was one of the game's most dominant and durable pitchers from 2014 to 2018 before injuries derailed his career. He missed most of 2019 and 2020 before playing for the Yankees in 2021 and the Rays in 2022. He signed a $10 million, one-year deal with the Red Sox in the offseason.Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks, OF: The 23-year-old opens the year as one of the favorites to win the NL Rookie of the Year. He was impressive in a 32-game cameo last year and has followed that up with nine hits in his first 26 spring at-bats, including three doubles, two triples, seven walks and two stolen bases. The D-backs signed Carroll to an $111 million, eight-year deal last weekend that should keep him with the team through 2030.Spencer Strider, Braves, RHP: The hard-throwing 24-year-old finished second in the NL Rookie of the Year voting last season behind teammate Michael Harris after striking out 202 batters in just 131 2/3 innings. He looks strong again this spring with 17 strikeouts over 12 innings and a 2.25 ERA.Bo Bichette, Blue Jays, SS: The 2021 All-Star has grown into a cornerstone for Toronto's lineup after two consecutive seasons leading the AL in hits. He's been in midseason form during Grapefruit League play in Florida, with 12 hits in his first 31 at-bats (.387), including two doubles and two homers.Jeffrey Springs, Rays, LHP: The 30-year-old emerged as one of the Rays' top pitchers last season with a 2.46 ERA in 135 1/3 innings. That success doesn't look like a fluke during Grapefruit League play this spring: He hasn't allowed a run over 9 2/3 innings and has struck out 16.Triston Casas, Red Sox, 1B: The 23-year-old looks like he's locked down the starting first base job this spring with 13 hits in his first 34 spring at-bats, including two homers. The 2018 first-round pick flashed plenty of power in limited playing time last season, hitting five homers in 76 at-bats.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838139,"NC State looks for another surprise, 40 years later","DENVER (AP) — If you let the video run long enough — past the Lorenzo Charles dunk and past Jim Valvano looking for someone to hug — you'll see a teenage kid with, in his words, “a bad sweater and bad hair” running on the floor of The Pit, just happy to be part of the madness.That kid was Boo Corrigan, who is now the athletic director at North Carolina State. Forty years ago, Corrigan was there to see the Wolfpack finish one of college basketball's most electric and unexpected runs, win the national title and officially embed the word “Cinderella” into the NCAA Tournament playbook.On Friday, the Wolfpack (23-10) will be underdogs again — 11 seeds facing No. 6 Creighton (21-12) in the first round in the South Region.“You’ve got to dream,” said Corrigan, who made that trip to Albuquerque thanks to his father, Gene, who at the time was the athletic director at Notre Dame and the chair of the NCAA selection committee. “If you look at our backcourt and the other pieces we have, when we’re good, we’re pretty good.""Back in 1983, NC State also was pretty good, but struggling as the season wound down.Those were the days of the 52-team bracket and limited chances for an at-large bid. Valvano took the Wolfpack on a 10-game winning streak, which included a championship at the ACC Tournament that put them in the Big Dance. Six wins later, NC State was cutting down nets after beating heavily favored Houston and Valvano was looking for someone to hug.Earlier this season, some members of the history-making '83 team — including Sydney Lowe, Thurl Bailey, Valvano's wife, Pam Valvano Strasser, and his grandson, Rocco — returned to campus to celebrate the anniversary.“We told them, ‘You guys changed the tournament,’” Corrigan said. “They were the Cardiac Pack, the lower seed that keeps finding ways to win close games. They were a team that did it against all odds.”In a fortuitous twist, one of the first things the Wolfpack saw when they entered the arena in Denver was the number of former N.C. State great David Thompson hanging from the rafters.Thompson led the Wolfpack to their first title, in 1974, to break a string of seven straight titles for John Wooden and UCLA. The NBA's Nuggets retired Thompson's number to honor his high-flying, seven-year career in Denver.“We're one of those few schools that have two national championships,” coach Kevin Keats said. “And both those teams are very special to us. That '83 team — they really came from nowhere.'""SEALING THE DEALAs the recruiting process heated up, one of the most sought-after high school players in the country, Keyonte George, pretty much knew where he would end up. All doubt was set aside when Baylor was cutting down nets at the end of the tournament two years ago.George picked the Bears (22-10), who open this year's tournament as a No. 3 seed with a game against UC Santa Barbara (27-7) set for Friday.“I kind of knew where I wanted to be, and that put the icing on the cake,” George said of Baylor's title, won in the bubble in Indianapolis in 2021.George has averaged 15.8 points and was named the Big 12 Freshman of the Year. He has meshed well with Adam Flagler and L.J. Cryer, a pair of guards from the title team who also average double figures this year.There's a decent chance George will be gone from college after his single season at Baylor. There's also a good chance the one-and-done rule could come to an end by next year's draft, meaning many players will be able to bypass college completely on their way to the NBA.“If some kids have the opportunity to do that, and they feel like they have what it takes, then you can’t hold them back,” George said. “But me personally, I love the college scene.”MERFELD’S MOMENTThe details remain fuzzy for Creighton assistant Steve Merfeld. After all, the moment occurred 22 years ago and he was in such a euphoric state.To be transported back, though, all he has to do is flip on the tournament this time of year. Merfeld was the head coach at Hampton in 2001 when his 15th-seeded squad stunned No. 2 Iowa State, 58-57. It remains one of the biggest opening-round upsets in tournament history. Immediately after the buzzer, Merfeld was picked up by one of his players, David Johnson, and famously kicked his feet in celebration.“The only recollection I have is (Johnson) saying, ‘I’ve got you, Coach. I’ve got you, Coach,’” recalled Merfeld, whose Bluejays take on North Carolina State on Friday. “It was fun while it lasted. It’s March Madness. That’s what’s great about this time of the year.”Back then, Hampton was the fourth No. 15 seed to knock off a two seed. It’s now happened in each of the last two years, with Oral Roberts beating Ohio State in 2021 and Saint Peter’s knocking off Kentucky last season.“It’s the same” magic, Merfeld said. “I mean, it’s the tournament. Nobody’s working today or tomorrow. They’re all at some bar or in Las Vegas, wherever, watching these games, enjoying the moments.”He pointed to the television in the Creighton locker room, where No. 13 Furman had just finished beating fourth-seeded Virginia.“Like that,” said Merfeld, who has been an assistant under coach Greg McDermott since 2010. “That’s what it’s all about.”___AP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838140,Travel logistics can be tricky amid March Madness whirlwind,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Holy Cross found out Sunday it would face second-seeded Maryland in the women's NCAA Tournament.Then the more immediate challenge began — figuring out how to travel there.The Crusaders eventually arrived following a lengthy bus ride Wednesday, one of a handful of teams to face logistical challenges during March Madness this week. Charleston's men's team arranged for a chartered flight to its game because the trip was too short for an NCAA-funded one. Grand Canyon arrived for its men's game in Denver, but luggage was delayed.The San Diego State men had their charter delayed for a more prestigious reason.“Restricted airspace around Air Force One,” coach Brian Dutcher said.Charleston played San Diego State in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday. The South Carolina school is about 380 miles from Orlando, just below the 400-mile threshold at which the NCAA would pay for a chartered flight. So Charleston paid for its own flight — and the Cougars had a little more incentive to win.The plan was to return by bus if they lost in the first round. If they advanced to Saturday, there would be time to arrange a chartered flight home. Charleston lost to San Diego State 63-57.Holy Cross is located in Worcester, Massachusetts, about 390 miles from College Park. The threshold for a chartered flight used to be 350 miles, but the NCAA changed its policy for both men’s and women’s basketball this year to match up with other Division I sports. Schools have the option to charter flights if they wish at the school’s expense. The threshold remains 350 miles for the regionals and Final Four.For Holy Cross, there was also the matter of a nor’easter that affected New England this week.“The travel piece was a huge question mark, obviously finding out that we couldn't charter by a couple miles,” Crusaders coach Maureen Magarity said. “Figuring out the buses, the impending snowstorm, there's a lot of moving parts. I'm just so grateful to our staff and our administration to help figure all that out for us.”For Holy Cross, a Patriot League school, taking the bus isn't all that unusual.“It was a lot of fun on the bus,” guard Addisyn Cross said. “We played some games, so we made it a fun experience.”The Lopes of Grand Canyon found themselves in a bind Wednesday when they arrived in Denver but their gear didn’t make it. So they borrowed equipment from Regis University in Denver and used scout jerseys provided by Baylor.Baylor coach Scott Drew was all too willing to assist his little brother, Bryce, the coach of Grand Canyon. The brothers' teams just so happen to be playing at the same site, but in different regionals.“We charge them by the hour,” Scott Drew cracked. “Whatever we can do to help.”Just a minor hiccup, Bryce Drew explained, as the Lopes get set to play third-seeded Gonzaga on Friday.“We’re all ready to go and shoes and jerseys and practice gear is all delivered,” he said.For San Diego State, the delay was brief, and Dutcher didn't seem like he was about to lodge a major complaint with the White House.“Charters, as much as they sound like they’re going to get you here early, they usually get you here when they get you here,” he said. “We left San Diego at 5:00, landed at 12:00 or 12:30. Like I said, I wasn’t joking, I was eating chicken wings at 2:00 a.m. They were good. They tasted really good, and we were happy to have them, and we’re happy to be here.”___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25___AP Basketball Writer Doug Feinberg and AP Sports Writers Pat Graham and Mark Long contributed to this report.",2023/3/17,,World

(AP) — The Patriots added some depth on the offensive line with the signing of tackle Calvin Anderson on Thursday.The team also released veteran quarterback Brian Hoyer, ending his third stint in New England.It's a bit of a homecoming for Anderson. The 26-year-old spent the past four seasons in Denver, but originally signed as a rookie free agent with the Patriots in 2019 before being released. He was briefly with the Jets before being signed by Denver, where he appeared in 41 games with 12 starts.Anderson has experience on both the left and right side of the line and could be a candidate to earn a starting spot with Isaiah Wynn's status up in the air as an unsigned free agent.The 37-year-old Hoyer also signed as an undrafted free agent with the Patriots in 2009 and spent his first three seasons in New England. He returned near the end of the 2017 season and was on the roster throughout the 2018 season. He returned for his most recent stint in 2020.His 14 NFL seasons have also included stops in Arizona (2012), Pittsburgh (2012), Cleveland (2013-14), Houston (2015), Chicago (2016), San Francisco (2017) and Indianapolis (2019).Hoyer made a total of 30 starts in New England, including two starts. Overall, he's appeared in 76 regular-season games with 40 starts, completing 902 of 1,518 passes for 10,688 yards, 53 touchdowns and 35 interceptions.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838153,The AP Interview: Gov. Wes Moore reflects on first 2 months,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Thursday he's aiming for “the most full assault on child poverty” to ever happen in Maryland during his first legislative session, touching on a wide variety of topics in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press.The governor, a Democrat, spoke about concerns in the banking industry after the second and third largest bank failures in U.S. history, his support for President Joe Biden, his thoughts on reparations for slavery, expanding the use of electric vehicles and police reform during the interview, among other topics.Two months into his tenure, Moore, who is Maryland's first Black chief executive and the third Black governor ever elected in the nation, noted the historical nature of his landslide November victory. He said his portrait will look “a little bit different” than the ones of white governors on the walls inside Maryland's Capitol.“I received more individual votes for governor than anyone else on these walls,"" Moore, a Democrat, said. ""But I also know that Marylanders didn’t vote for me because they wanted me to make history. They voted for me because they believed in our vision.”His proposal to extend and expand tax credits for low-income residents is moving forward in the Democratic-controlled Legislature. His push for accelerating a minimum wage increase to $15 an hour also is advancing but so far without a provision he proposed to create automatic increases in future years to adjust for inflation.Here's what the governor had to say some key issues facing the nation and the state he is governing:BANKINGIn the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, Moore, who is a former investment banker, said Maryland has not had any significant impacts. He said a big reason for that partially was the swift movements of the federal government to be able to ensure that the depositors were not hurt and were covered.“You have to make sure that you have supports for your small regional banks,” Moore said. “The second thing, though, is we want to make sure that the depositors are not the ones being hurt by all this.”PRESIDENT BIDENMoore said he's excited about the partnership that the state of Maryland has right now with the White House and Biden.“I want that partnership to continue,” Moore said. “And I’m not only supporting President Biden’s reelection; I plan on helping however I can.”REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERYAs the city of San Francisco considers how to address the thorny question of how to atone for centuries of slavery and systemic racism, Moore said he understands why people continue to debate the issue “because the consequences that we saw from the transatlantic slave trade still continue to be real in people’s lives now.”“I also know that we have to move now to be able to address the issues of housing insecurity and food insecurity, the racial wealth gap, the educational disparities — the things that we know right now we can get done,"" Moore said. ""We have an obligation to move with a sense of urgency, so we don’t continue watching how families who have often times historically have been disadvantaged continue to be disadvantaged by policies that we still continue to put in place.""ABORTIONMoore has stood in full support with Democrats in the legislature to enshrine abortion rights in the Maryland Constitution and other measures to protect abortion rights in the state.“As long as I'm governor, Maryland will be a safe haven for abortion rights,” Moore said.ELECTRIC CARSThe governor announced this week that Maryland will move forward with requiring all new vehicles sold in the state to be electric by 2035, as California has decided.“Is it going to be hard? Yes. Is it bold? Yes. Will Maryland get it done? Absolutely, we will,” Moore said. “And it means we are going to focus on things like the electrification of the grid, so we actually have the infrastructure in place to be able to manage it.”POLICE REFORMMoore said he supports an expansion of police reform laws approved two years ago in Maryland. Part of those reforms requires the Maryland attorney general to investigate police-involved deaths but leaves local prosecutors with the decision to prosecute. Legislation advancing in Maryland would give the attorney general the authority to independently prosecute officers.CHILD SEX ABUSEThe governor said he supports legislation advancing in the state Senate to end the statute of limitations on bringing a civil lawsuit against a public or private entity for child sex abuse.“I support the bill, because I believe that in order for us to actually truly be able to work towards making it right for that individual and for that victim, that we have to make sure that there are laws that are responsive to the fact that that pain still continues to endure,” Moore said.FBI HEADQUARTERSMoore, who met with the General Services Administration last week on Maryland’s intense competition with Virginia to be the location for a new FBI headquarters, said he’s confident the administration will listen to concerns raised by him and members of the state’s congressional delegation that the evaluation process has been unfair to Maryland. Maryland officials contend the Virginia location is more costly and will take longer than either of two Maryland sites under consideration.REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACYMoore emphasized that he has already appointed the most diverse Cabinet of secretaries to ever lead state agencies in Maryland.“I think Maryland is on America’s mind right now, because I think what we’re able to do inside of the state of Maryland and show that democracy can be not just participatory, but inclusive,” Moore said. “And that’s what makes it strong.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838154,Fed lent $300B in emergency funds to banks in the past week,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Cash-short banks have borrowed about $300 billion from the Federal Reserve in the past week, the central bank announced Thursday.Nearly half the money — $143 billion — went to holding companies for two major banks that failed over the past week, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, triggering widespread alarm in financial markets. The Fed did not identify the banks that received the other half of the funding or say how many of them did so.The holding companies for the two failed banks were set up by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has taken over both banks. The money they borrowed was used to pay their uninsured depositors, with bonds owned by both banks posted as collateral. The FDIC has guaranteed the repayment of the loans, the Fed said.The figures provide a first glimpse of the scale of the Fed's assistance to the financial sector after the two banks collapsed this past weekend.The rest of the money was borrowed by banks seeking to raise cash — likely, at least in part, to pay off depositors who tried to withdraw their money. Many mega banks, such as Bank of America, have reported receiving inflows of funds from smaller banks since the bank failures last weekend.An additional $153 billion in borrowing from the Fed over the past week came through a longstanding program called the “discount window""; it amounted to a record level for that program. Banks can borrow from the discount window for up to 90 days. Typically in a given week, only about $4 billion to $5 billion is borrowed through this program.The Fed has lent an additional $11.9 billion from a new lending facility it announced on Sunday. The new program enables banks to raise cash and pay any depositors who withdraw money.Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in research note that the Fed's assistance is, so far, about half what it was during the financial crisis 15 years ago.“But it is still a big number,” he said. “The glass half-empty view is that banks need a lot of money. The glass half-full take is that the system is working as intended.”The past week's emergency lending from the Fed seeks to address a leading cause of the collapse of the two banks: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank owned billions of dollars of seemingly safe Treasury and other bonds that paid low interest rates.Over the past year, as the Fed steadily raised its benchmark interest rate, yields on longer-term Treasurys and other bonds rose. That, in turn, reduced the value of the lower-yielding Treasurys that the banks held.As a result, the banks couldn't raise enough cash from the sale of their Treasurys to pay the many depositors who were trying to withdraw their money from the banks. It amounted to a classic bank run.The Fed's lending programs, particularly the new facility it unveiled Sunday, enable financial institutions to post bonds as collateral and borrow against them, rather than having to sell them.For its new lending facility, the Fed said it has received $15.9 billion in collateral, more than the $11.9 billion it has lent. Banks sometimes provide the Fed collateral before borrowing. That suggests that additional lending is under way.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838155,Stanford regroups for NCAAs after Pac-12 disappointment,"STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Laughter and good-natured screams echoed off the walls of Stanford's locker room Thursday morning with NCAA Tournament preparation in full swing.You'd never know these were the same women who made an early exit from the Pac-12 Tournament a week ago, bounced by UCLA.Shaken, Stanford needed a serious heart-to-heart to find that joy again. The players and the coaching staff sat together in a circle after dinner at the hotel in Las Vegas and talked about accountability and what would be needed from everybody to make another special March run.Then, they came home to the Bay Area and met again, players-only this time.“Obviously the Pac-12 Tournament didn't end the way we wanted it to but we've had a great week of practice and we're a completely different team than we were a week ago,” senior Hannah Jump said. “We're completely ready to bounce back and just have fun, play with a smile, and just play with joy.”Top-seeded Stanford (28-5) will open its NCAA quest Friday with a matchup against 16th-seeded Sacred Heart (19-13), which beat Southern 57-47 in a First Four game Wednesday night for its first NCAA win in school history.Despite the disappointment at the conference tournament, Hall of Fame Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer considers the rest that her players received as key benefit. She sensed they were spent during that full team meeting.“What came through, the message from the team was that they’re close and they are committed to each other, and that’s where you want them to be, that they’re going to work hard, that they want to play, play hard,” VanDerveer said. ""What I saw more than anything was just, we need a break. I saw this with our Olympic team, maybe people feeling some pressure. I’m just like, 'Let’s just take a break, get away from it, and just say, all right, now we’re coming back with the tournament.'""In Friday night’s second game of the Seattle Region at Maples Pavilion, eighth-seeded Ole Miss (23-8) faces No. 9 seed Gonzaga (28-4). The two coaches are plenty familiar with each other: Lisa Fortier was a Zags assistant when fifth-year Ole Miss coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin served on the Portland staff.""As soon as the matchup got announced, I shot her a text and I said, 'Just super proud of you and what you all have done,'"" McPhee-McCuin said. “So I think that first and foremost, there is an incredible amount of respect that we have for Gonzaga and what they have accomplished.”Gonzaga's Brynna Maxwell has the second-highest 3-point shooting percentage in the nation at 49.43%, while Ole Miss features one of the top perimeter defenses.The Zags, runner-up to second-seeded Portland in the West Coast Conference Tournament, earned their sixth consecutive NCAA Tournament berth under Fortier and are a ninth seed for a second straight year. Gonzaga beat No. 8 Nebraska last March to reach the second round before losing to top-seeded Louisville on its home floor.Ole Miss lost 80-51 to No. 1 South Carolina in the SEC Tournament, and has faced Pac-12 power Utah. The Rebels are led by Angel Baker’s averages of 15.1 points and 5.5 rebounds.The team traveled from Oxford, Mississippi, to its coach’s homeland in The Bahamas, and this trip west marks the program’s third straight year in postseason play.“We’re just getting started,” McPhee-McCuin said.Sacred Heart (19-13), from Fairfield, Connecticut, celebrated Wednesday night, then was in the film room first thing Thursday, ready to keep proving people wrong after a 2-9 start to this season.“Obviously this is the biggest team we've ever played against,” said Pioneers coach Jessica Mannetti, whose team must contend with Cameron Brink and her 111 blocks this season.Still, Mannetti reminded her team that a No. 16 seed has pulled off an improbable victory in the first round before: Just so happens that was Harvard stunning Stanford right here 25 years ago.“She said it was Stanford,” freshman Ny’Ceara Pryor said, “But why not Sacred Heart.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

(AP) — Mitch Henderson’s victory leap that punctuated Princeton’s famed upset over UCLA in 1996 has become an iconic moment. There is a picture of the joyous jump at the school’s practice facility that serves as a constant reminder of what’s possible.Now Henderson’s current players have authored one of their own.Ryan Langborg lifted Princeton to its first lead with 2:03 to play and the Tigers used a late-game run to earn their first NCAA Tournament win in 25 years, topping No. 2 seed Arizona 59-55 on Thursday.“Pretty surreal feeling,” guard Matt Allocco said. “To beat a great team like that on this stage is a pretty special feeling. But also I can’t say I’m surprised. This team has been so good all year, so gritty. On paper, it’s going to look like a big upset. But we believe in each other and we think we’re a really good team. When we’re at our best, then I think we can beat anybody in the country.”The 15th-seeded Tigers (22-9) scored the final nine points, holding the Pac-12 Tournament champion scoreless over the final 4:43.Tosan Evbuomwan scored 15 points in Princeton's first tournament victory since beating UNLV in 1998 when Henderson was a player for the Tigers.Henderson also played on the 1996 team that beat defending champion UCLA in the school's final tournament under coach Pete Carril, who died in August. This victory fittingly came in Sacramento, where Carril spent time as an NBA assistant after retiring as Tigers coach.“He would be very proud of the group,” Henderson said. “He wouldn’t want any attention to be brought other than what these guys did. They played to win. We knew we had to keep the game low possessions.”Princeton advanced to play seventh-seeded Missouri in the second round of the South Region. The Tigers beat Utah State 76-65.Azuolas Tubelis scored 21 points for the Wildcats (28-7), who haven't won a tournament game in consecutive years since 2014-15.It marked the third straight year and 11th time overall that a No. 15 seed won a first-round game. Arizona is the only school to be on the wrong end of one of those upsets twice, also losing to Steve Nash and Santa Clara in 1993.“If you want to be a great player, you want to be a great coach, we all got to learn from this,'” coach Tommy Lloyd said. “We got to go back and figure out what happened and understand the value of being up 10 to 12 points with 10 minutes to go, putting the hammer on people, not letting people get back in the game.”The Wildcats seemed in control of this one when Oumar Ballo's basket put them up 10 with eight minutes left.But the Tigers responded with seven straight points, capped by a second-chance 3-pointer from Blake Peters that made it 51-48 with about six minutes left.They closed the game with a 9-0 run — just like they did in their most memorable tournament win against UCLA in 1996.Keeshawn Kellman started the spurt with a putback dunk before Langborg hit a jumper and then a layup to give the Tigers the lead.The Wildcats then missed all five shots down the stretch and Princeton put it away at the foul line. Langborg also blocked Courtney Ramey's shot with 50 seconds left and the Tigers protecting a one-point lead.“When I blocked it I saw the whole crowd erupt,” he said. “My teammates were all locked in with each other and it was kind of that moment where you know, like, ‘Wow we can really do this. We’re going to do this and nothing’s going to stop us.’”Ramey, who hit a game-winning shot in the Pac-12 Tournament, missed a contested 3-pointer with 14 seconds left that could have tied the game. Kerr Kriisa also missed from long range after an offensive rebound, sending Princeton into an early celebration.LET THEM PLAYThe game featured just 12 free throws, with four coming after intentional fouls by Arizona late in the game. The Wildcats went to the line seven times despite a big size advantage with Tubelis and Bello.“You go inside over and over and over again, and you shoot seven free throws. I mean, I don’t know if they’re fouls or not. They must not have been because obviously they didn’t get called,” Lloyd said. “When the game is reffed like that, it makes it tough.”BIG PICTUREPrinceton: The Tigers gave the Ivy League its first tournament win since 2016 when Yale beat Baylor. The conference had been one-and-done the last four trips, having missed the 2021 edition because of COVID-19.Arizona: The Wildcats got little help offensively outside of Tubelis and Ballo, who combined for 35 points.

Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, walked in a few minutes later.“You played hard. You played to the very last second.

So you keep playing with chin up and shoulders back because you showed the world who Bison are.”Harris, who graduated in 1986 from the historically Black university in the nation's capital, said she has heard alumni all over the world talking about their pride in the team.“So I know you may not be feeling great right now, OK, but know who you are,” Harris said. “You are excellence. You are hard work. You are powerful, and you are winners.""The players were subdued after the end of their season but still able to recognize the significance of meeting Harris.“It’s amazing to know we have people of such power that are affiliated with us and supporting us at the same time,” freshman forward Shy Odom said.When Harris was shown on the video board during the game, the boos — Kansas and Iowa are Republican-leaning states, after all — outweighed the applause.Wearing their Black History Month jerseys with green trim and a red script “The Mecca” on the front — in reference to Howard’s nickname as the country’s most prominent historically Black university — the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference champion Bison took the court with plenty of confidence.“I just love how they have grown as people and have become better men over the course of this season,” coach Kenny Blakeney said. “That’s a victory no one can take away from us. I’m thrilled that we were able to represent Howard University in a classy way that honored so many people before us.”This was just the third NCAA Tournament appearance in program history for Howard.“We have had a lot of games on national TV,"" Blakeney said, ""but certainly being in the NCAA Tournament there are more eyes and visibility on you, which is amazing because we have a chance to talk about our university as one of the greatest on the face of this planet.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838159,Report scrutinizes US efforts to rebuild post-quake Haiti,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The U.S. Agency for International Development built only half of eight major projects meant to help Haiti recover from a devastating 2010 earthquake, a federal audit report said Thursday.The U.S. Government Accountability Office also found that most of the agency’s projects were delayed, had to be scaled back or turned out to be more expensive than planned.The report is the newest one to scrutinize how billions of dollars were spent to help Haiti in the aftermath of the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that the Haitian government estimates killed some 300,000 people.USAID projects to rehabilitate rural roads, expand a power plant at an industrial park and build a $4.2 million port in northern Haiti were canceled. In addition, only about 900 out of 4,000 planned homes were built, given unanticipated high costs, the audit found.“Pursuing overly ambitious plans resulted in delays, cost increases, reduced scopes, canceled activities and a costly redesign,” the 93-page report said.The report said USAID did not completely or consistently track or assess the results of infrastructure projects.The agency also failed to analyze the effectiveness of its efforts to develop Haiti’s National Police through training, equipment and technical assistance, the report said. But it added that political instability, violence and civil unrest hampered efforts to help a police force that is overwhelmed by powerful gangs that control more than half of the capital of Port-au-Prince.The report said USAID build a $74 million power plant and improved 24 health and public facilities as part of a continuing $89 million health infrastructure program.The audit also found that USAID improved local tax systems, increased HIV testing and related services and helped farmers access agricultural markets and negotiate better prices for their products via a mobile communications system.Overall, USAID spent $2 billion helping Haiti rebuild and develop in the fiscal years 2010 to 2020, the audit said.“These activities have been critical to supporting Haiti after a series of devastating catastrophes and setbacks, but their effectiveness is not fully known,” the report said.USAID said it has taken steps to make improvements, including awarding a new contract to collect and analyze data to scrutinize current and past efforts.The office of Haiti's prime minister did not return a message asking for comment on the report's findings.Haiti is still trying to recover from the 2010 earthquake as well as a magnitude 7.2 quake that struck in August 2021, killing more than 2,200 people and damaging more than 130,000 buildings.",2023/3/17,,World

Caproni in Manhattan should reverse her recent decision finding that some claims by NFL coach Brian Flores can go to trial.Flores, the new defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, sued the league and three teams last year, saying the NFL was “rife with racism,” particularly in its hiring and promotion of Black coaches.Caproni ruled on March 1 that discrimination claims by two other Black coaches, Steve Wilks and Ray Horton, must go to arbitration. She let claims Flores made against the Miami Dolphins go to arbitration. Flores made some of his most sensational claims against the team that fired him early last year after he led the Dolphins to a 24-25 record over three years.Earlier this week, lawyers for the coaches asked her to reverse portions of that ruling allowing arbitration, saying that proceedings in which NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell would likely serve as the arbiter would set a dangerous precedent for businesses nationwide that will be motivated to emulate the NFL's unfair arbitration practices.In papers signed by attorney Loretta E. Lynch — a former U.S. attorney general — the NFL, the Denver Broncos, the Houston Texans and the New York Giants asked that the judge change her mind and force all of the claims made by Flores into arbitration.“We do so only because we believe that the Court inadvertently overlooked important controlling authorities on two separate issues that were not previously briefed by the parties, leading to two clear errors of law that, if corrected, might reasonably be expected to alter the Court’s conclusion,” the NFL and its teams asserted.In her decision two weeks ago, Caproni said the claims made by Flores had shined “an unflattering spotlight on the employment practices of National Football League” teams.“Although the clear majority of professional football players are Black, only a tiny percentage of coaches are Black,” she wrote.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838161,14-year-old boy arrested in Mexico for murder of 8,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican authorities have arrested a 14-year-old boy nicknamed “El Chapito” for the drug-related killing of eight people near Mexico City, the federal Public Safety Department said Thursday.The boy allegedly rode up on a motorcycle and opened fire on a family in the low-income Mexico City suburb of Chimalhuacan. Another man was also arrested in the Jan. 22 killings, and seven other members of the gang were arrested on drug charges.The victims were holding a party at their house at the time of the attack, which also left five adults and two children wounded. It was reportedly a birthday party.The boy’s name was not released, but his nickname — “Little Chapo” — is an apparent reference to imprisoned drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.The motive in the killings has not been made public, but drug gangs in Mexico frequently dabble in kidnapping and contract killing. They also kill rivals selling drugs on their territory, or people who who them money.Mexico is no stranger to child killers.In 2010, soldiers detained a 14-year-old boy nicknamed “El Ponchis” who claimed he was kidnapped at age 11 and forced to work for the Cartel of the South Pacific, a branch of the splintered Beltran Leyva gang. He said he had participated in at least four decapitations.After his arrest, the boy, who authorities identified only by his first name, Edgar, told reporters that he was drugged and threatened into committing the crimes.Also Thursday, prosecutors in the northern border state of Sonora said they had arrested a woman linked to as many as nine murders in the border city of Mexicali.The state prosecutors' office said that the woman had outstanding warrants for two killings, but that she had been named in seven other homicide investigations. The office did not say what the possible motives might be in those killings.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838162,What's next for Alaska's Willow oil project? AP explains,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The Biden administration's approval earlier this week of the largest new oil project in years on Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope was immediately met by lawsuits seeking to stop the Willow project.Lawsuits filed by environmental groups and an Alaska Native organization seek to overturn Monday's approval of three drill sites and up to 199 total wells for the ConocoPhillips Alaska project. The lawsuits allege the U.S. government failed to adequately consider alternatives to greenlighting development.WHAT IS THE WILLOW PROJECT?The 30-year project could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day. That is significant because Alaska's economic fortunes are tied to the boom-and-bust cycles of oil. The flow of oil through the trans-Alaska pipeline is a fraction of what it was at its height in the late 1980s.Willow also is currently the largest proposed oil project on federal lands.WHERE IS WILLOW?Willow is on Alaska's remote North Slope, about 600 miles (966 kilometers) north of Anchorage.It is in something called the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which was originally set aside a century ago as an emergency oil supply for the U.S. Navy. The area has been overseen by the U.S. Interior Department since the 1970s, and there has been debate over where development should occur. The Biden administration last year limited oil and gas leasing to just over half of the federal lands in the nearly 23-million-acre reserve.Alaska Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan has repeatedly argued it should be expected that oil and gas is developed in the reserve, emphasizing the name — petroleum reserve.But environmentalists say the vast region is home to an array of wildlife, such as polar bears and brown bears, muskox, caribou and millions of migratory birds. They say the Interior secretary must act to protect and conserve wildlife and other resources in the reserve when oil and gas activities occur.WHY IS WILLOW CONTROVERSIAL?Environmental groups see the approval of the Willow project as a betrayal of President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign promises to end new oil and gas drilling on federal lands. They say it is out of step with Biden's goals to cut carbon emissions and move to clean energy.Using the oil Willow would produce over 30 years would emit roughly as much greenhouse gases as the combined emissions from 1.7 million passenger cars over the same time period. White House officials said the project won’t prevent the U.S. from meeting Biden’s goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Many Alaska Natives say they support the Willow project because it will bring jobs and money to their communities. But some are opposed, concerned about effects on health, the climate and caribou.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland opposed Willow as a New Mexico congresswoman before becoming Interior secretary. She said this week that Willow is a “difficult and complex issue” involving leases issued by prior administrations and that the Biden administration focused on reducing the project's footprint and impacts on people and wildlife.The approval of Willow also called for ConocoPhillips Alaska to relinquish rights to about 68,000 acres of existing leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?ConocoPhillips Alaska has signaled it is ready to move forward. The company says it wants to immediately begin gravel road construction work.However, lawsuits to stop the project are pending in federal court in Alaska and could delay activities.",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838168,"Poyer chooses friends, familiarity in re-signing with Bills","ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Upon weighing his options, including a brief flirtation with retirement, safety Jordan Poyer ultimately chose friendship and familiarity in deciding to re-sign with the Buffalo Bills.Even if it meant having to continue paying New York taxes, which are among the highest in NFL markets.Addressing reporters Thursday upon signing his two-year contract, Poyer laughed about the stir he created upon complaining about the state’s tax rate during a recent podcast episode.“I mean, sorry I said it. I said the truth,” Poyer said. “But that had nothing to do with my decision on whether or not I was going to come here or leave. I didn’t want to leave. I’m home now, and this is where I’m going to finish my career.”Poyer returns for an 11th NFL season and seventh in Buffalo, where he’s been a six-year starter, was selected as an All-Pro in 2021 and earned his first Pro Bowl nod last season, while being part of one of the league’s top safety tandems, playing alongside Micah Hyde.And it was a conversation he had with Hyde when the two signed with Buffalo hours apart in free agency in 2017, that also hit home for Poyer.“It was like, 'Bro, we are going to turn this city around and we’re going to give this city a championship,’” Poyer recalled. “That’s been our goal since we got here and it hasn’t changed.”In saying he fielded offers from numerous teams, Poyer cited far more numerous reasons that led him to stay.There’s the unfinished business and the bitter taste Poyer had after the Bills season ended with a thud in a 27-10 loss to Cincinnati in the divisional round of the playoffs. There’s the opportunity to continue playing with Hyde, who returns after missing a majority of last season with a neck injury. There’s Poyer’s familiarity with the playbook, the coaches and the fanbase.And not lost on Poyer was how much he invested personally into last season by playing through an assortment of injuries, including choosing to make the 14-hour drive to play a game at Kansas City in October after being prevented from flying because of the aftereffects of a punctured lung.“Last year was probably the hardest year I’ve probably ever had to go through mentally and physically,” Poyer said. “But at the same time I wouldn’t have changed it at all. I feel like I’m a better man and a better player because of it.”Poyer’s re-signing with the Bills was hardly a guarantee. He had previously expressed being unhappy with the team in failing to extend his contract last spring. And it was uncertain if Bills had enough salary cap room to afford him once the signing period began.“I’m an eternal optimist, so until I hear they’re gone, I’m going to be looking at ways to get the guys back that belong here,” general manager Brandon Beane said after reaching the deal with Poyer a day earlier.Beane gave re-signing the player a 50-50 chance after Tuesday, after several high-profile safeties reached agreements with other teams leaving Poyer still on the market.Beane projects the Bills having about $9 million in salary cap space still available, after also signing offensive lineman Connor McGovern, receiver Deonte Harty and quarterback Kyle Allen, who will take over as Josh Allen's backup to replace Case Keenum's departure in free agency.Buffalo stands to lose several free agents, including starting middle linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, who has signed with Chicago. Beane acknowledged the Bills lacked the cap space to re-sign Edmunds.In other matters:— Beane said safety Damar Hamlin continues “trending in the right direction” to be cleared to resume playing after he went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in a game at Cincinnati on Jan. 2. Beane said, Hamlin has one more medical checkup scheduled for next month.— WR Isaiah McKenzie's future with the team is uncertain, with Beane acknowledging the sixth-year player could be cut to save salary cap space before he’s due a roster bonus.— Kyle Allen revealed he was roommates with Bills starter Josh Allen (no relation) when the two attended a pre-draft quarterback camp in 2018.“Well, he took the master room with the best shower and then there’s three of us sharing one bathroom and another shower. Pretty selfish roommate I’d say,"" Kyle said with a laugh. While Josh Allen was selected by Buffalo with the No. 7 pick, Kyle Allen broke into the league that year as an undrafted free agent with Carolina. He has a 7-12 career record, with stops in Washington and, last year, in Houston.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838170,"California will remake San Quentin prison, emphasizing rehab","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The infamous state prison on San Francisco Bay that has been home to the largest death row population in the United States will be transformed into a lockup where less-dangerous prisoners will receive education, training and rehabilitation, California officials announced Thursday.The inmates serving death sentences at San Quentin State Prison will be moved elsewhere in the California penitentiary system, Gov. Gavin Newsom's office announced, and it will be renamed the San Quentin Rehabilitation Center. Most of California's nearly 700 inmates facing such sentences are imprisoned at the facility, though some have already been moved.“Today, we take the next step in our pursuit of true rehabilitation, justice, and safer communities through this evidenced-backed investment, creating a new model for safety and justice — the California Model — that will lead the nation,” Newsom said in a statement.The governor planned a visit Friday to San Quentin, which is also the California location where prisoners were once executed, though none have been put to death since 2006. Newsom announced a moratorium on executions in 2019 and dismantled the prison's gas chamber, and in 2022 he announced plans to begin transferring inmates sentenced to death to other prisons.Full details of the plan were not immediately made public, though officials said the facility would concentrate on “education, rehabilitation and breaking cycles of crime.” Newsom was expected to share more during his visit, the second stop on a four-day policy tour that he's doing in lieu of a traditional State of the State address this year.Newsom's office cited as a model Norway’s approach to incarceration, which focuses on preparing people to return to society, as inspiration for the program. Oregon and North Dakota have also taken inspiration from the Scandinavian country's policies.In maximum-security Norwegian prisons, cells often look more like dorm rooms with additional furniture such as chairs, desks, even TVs, and prisoners have kitchen access and activities like basketball. The nation has a low recidivism rate.At the overhauled San Quentin, vocational training programs would set people up to land good-paying jobs as plumbers, electricians or truck drivers after they're released, Newsom told the Los Angeles Times.A group made up public safety experts, crime victims and formerly incarcerated people will advise the state on the transformation. Newsom is allocating $20 million to launch the plan.Republican Assemblymember Tom Lackey expressed criticism of Newsom's criminal justice priorities, saying the governor and state Democratic lawmakers should spend more time focusing their efforts on supporting the victims of crime.“Communities win when we have rehabilitative efforts, but yet, how about victims?” Lackey said. “Have we rehabilitated them?”Meanwhile Taina Vargas, executive director of Initiate Justice Action, an advocacy group based in Los Angeles, said she is pleased the state is moving toward rehabilitating incarcerated people but more drastic changes are needed to transform the criminal justice system that imprisons so many people.“Over the long term, I think we want to prevent people from going to prison in the first place, which means that we want to offer more opportunities for high paying jobs in the community,” she said.California voters upheld the death penalty in 2016 and voted to speed up executions. Newsom’s decision to halt them in one of his first major acts as governor drew swift pushback from critics including district attorneys who said he was ignoring the voters.But Californians have also supported easing certain criminal penalties in an attempt to reduce mass incarceration as part of a more recent movement away from tough-on-crime policies that once dominated the state.San Quentin is California’s oldest correctional institution, housing one maximum-security cell block, a medium-security dorm and a minimum-security firehouse.Inmates on death row will not have their sentences changed, but they will be transferred to other facilities, according to Newsom’s office. Today there are 668 inmates serving death sentences in California, almost all of them men, according to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.The prison has housed high-profile criminals such as cult leader Charles Manson, convicted murderers and serial killers, and was the site of violent uprisings in the 1960s and 1970s.But the prison in upscale Marin County north of San Francisco has also been home to some of the most innovative inmate programs in the country, reflecting the politically liberal beliefs of the Bay Area.Among other such programs, San Quentin houses Mount Tamalpais College, the first accredited junior college in the country based entirely behind bars. The school offers inmates classes in literature, astronomy, U.S. government and others to earn an Associate of Arts degree.The college’s $5 million annual budget is funded by private donations with volunteer faculty from top nearby universities, including Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley.___Sophie Austin is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838175,European Green Deal: Tracking progress toward the EU's clean energy transition,"In an effort to slow the planet's heating, the European Union made a promise in 2019 to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050.Despite a pandemic and the war in Ukraine and associated energy crisis, EU lawmakers are still pushing for policies to cut pollution.They have written some targets from the European Green Deal into law and are haggling over others. They have added green strings to coronavirus relief packages and ripped up rules blocking clean energy projects. ""COVID didn't kill the Green Deal,"" said Pieter de Pous, a Berlin-based analyst at climate think tank E3G. ""In fact, it made it stronger.""If the European Union could clean up its economy, it could serve as a blueprint to polluters from the US to China — and show countries across Africa and Asia that one of the world's richest emitters is serious about climate change. But how close is the European Union to reaching its targets? And how much further does it have to go?Together with media partners in the European Data Journalism Network, DW is tracking the bloc's progress in five key sectors. This article will be updated regularly as new data becomes available.The European Union has cut annual greenhouse gas pollution by about 30% since 1990, mainly by burning less coal. It now wants to cut greenhouse gas pollution 57% from those levels by the end of the decade.""The honest truth is that the world is not on track to keep the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" said European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans, an architect of the Green Deal, announcing the updated goal at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt in November. ""We need more ambition.""But the new target, which is only slightly more ambitious than the original Green Deal cuts of 55%, falls short of the action needed to honor the promise of keeping global warming to a maximum of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above preindustrial levels by the end of the century. Climate Action Tracker, a project from two environmental research organizations, found that emissions would have to fall at least a further five percentage points, by a total of over 62%.Current policies from member states look set to bring down emissions by just 36%-47%.The European Union gets 22% of its energy from renewable sources. Last year, it put forward a plan to hit 40% by the end of the decade. Then, after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission said it wanted to increase that again, to 45%. The target implies a quick and strong push to electrify polluting activities and clean up the continent's electricity grid.The proposal has passed two rounds of legal bureaucracy but must still be agreed on by member states, which are lobbying to keep the target at 40%.The European Union has scrambled for sources of energy to replace gas since Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and shut pipelines. Countries such as Germany, the European Union's biggest economy, have restarted coal-fired power plants, signed decadelong deals with gas producers in Africa and the Middle East, and built terminals to receive shipments of liquefied natural gas from abroad. At the same time, Germany and other EU member states have promised to build more renewable sources of energy and make it easier for companies to do so.Though analysts expect a spike in pollution from burning more coal, they are more worried about the plans to build new fossil gas infrastructure, which could lock in pollution over decades. That could jeopardize the goal of using 45% green power by 2030.The industry expects the European Union to build the infrastructure for 220 GW of solar power and 92 GW of wind power in the next four years, aided by the falling price of renewable energy. This is more than the amount expected in some scenarios that keep global warming to 1.5 C, according to the London-based climate think tank Ember, which modeled pathways to reach the target.""To get out of this crisis, we need a massive influx of homegrown, reliable renewable energy,"" said Harriet Fox, a solar analyst at Ember. ""If the EU is serious about deploying renewable energy, there's no reason why those industry targets can't be achieved.""The outlook from the wind industry is less optimistic than solar because of the long time it takes to get permits approved and wind farms built. In November, EU member states agreed to shorten the timeframes for granting permits. This means they can skip some of the paperwork to assess a project's environmental impact, speeding up the time between planning and building.The European Union also intends to renovate more buildings and run them on 49% renewable energy by 2030. In a proposal, the European Commission has argued for putting solar panels on new public and commercial buildings from 2027 and on existing ones from 2028. It wants to do the same for new residential buildings from 2030.As well as building infrastructure to make clean energy, the European Union would have to electrify activities that run on fossil fuels such as burning gas to heat homes. One of the most effective ways to do so is swapping gas boilers for electric heat pumps.Modeling from the European Commission shows that the amount of heat generated by pumps running on renewable electricity would have to roughly triple by the end of the decade. A preliminary analysis from the Regulatory Assistance Project, a global nonprofit working to decarbonize buildings, found that the pace of installations would need to almost double. While high gas prices have sent demand for heat pumps soaring, a lack of trained installers has held back the shift.The European Commission intends to cut the average CO2 emissions from new cars 55% by 2030, before hitting zero by 2035. That would be one of the easiest fixes to clean up transport, the only sector where pollution has steadily risen. Greenhouse gas emissions were 15% higher in 2021 than in 1990.Some member states, including Germany and Italy, have pushed back on the target.Experts say the target is achievable, if unambitious. Electric vehicle sales are picking up. The share of electrics among new cars sold in the European Union jumped from 11% in 2020 to 18% in 2021.If more car journeys were shifted to trains, buses and walking, emissions from transport could fall even faster.The European Union has made little progress in cleaning up farms, which are responsible for about 10% of EU greenhouse gas emissions. These come in lots of shapes and from different sources — methane from cow burps, nitrous oxide from fertilizer and both from manure.Two-thirds of the European Union's agriculture emissions come from animals. The EU plans to bring in sustainable feed additives, which can cut methane from cows, and reduce the amount of soy grown on deforested land to feed livestock. According to the European Union, the shift cannot happen without a change in people's diets.This project is an ongoing collaboration among several media outlets in the European Data Journalism Network.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838176,"Protests, strikes over train crash paralyze Greece","Thousands of workers walked off their jobs in Greece on Thursday, bringing the country to a halt amid protests against what they say are subpar railway safety standards that led to the deadliest train crash in the country's history.Unions joined protesters for a 24-hour strike in the capital and beyond, freezing flights, ships and public services. The strike action was the biggest to date in response to last month's train accident.The accident, which happened just before midnight on February 28, claimed 57 lives and brought to the forefront the debate over plans to install railway safety systems.Protests were held in Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city, and Athens the capital where thousands of protestors chanted: ""This crime will not be forgotten.""Police sources reported more than 40,000 people protested nationwide, with some 25,000 taking to the streets in Athens alone.At one point, riot police in Athens clashed with hooded protesters, who hurled firebombs and rocks near parliament on central Syntagma Square. Police used tear gas and arrested six people, and a police officer was slightly injured, Greek media reported.Many protesters called on the government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose term expires in July, to resign. Some of the banners held during the protests read: ""It was not human error, it was crime,"" and  ""Our dead, your profits.""Underground staff and taxi drivers also joined the strikes on Thursday, disrupting urban transport.Protests have been recurring since the deadly crash, with protesters accusing the government of negligence. The passenger train which collided head-on with a freight train was carrying over 350 passengers, most of them university students.A stationmaster and three other railway officials have been charged and an investigation into the crash is ongoing, with authorities blaming it on a ""human error."" However, public anger has focused on long-running mismanagement of the network.Calls by unions to increase safety measures have largely gone unheeded, as conservative governments delayed plans for installing safety systems during the past decade.The crash has also pressured the conservative government ahead of national elections set to take place in the summer.The government says suspended rail services will restart on March 22 and be restored gradually through April 11. The prime minister has also vowed to offer additional staff to monitor safety and mandatory speed reduction rules along sections of the track.dmn, rmt/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/3/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838177,Arkansas holds off Illinois 73-63 with big defensive effort,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Ricky Council IV scored 18 points and Arkansas survived some anxious moments in the second half against an Illinois team that wouldn't go away, holding on to beat the Illini 73-63 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday.Devo Davis had 16 points for the eighth-seeded Razorbacks, who used relentless defense and rebounding to build big leads but couldn't get comfortable until the final minute. Arkansas (21-13) faces top-seeded Kansas on Saturday in the second round of the West Region.Terrence Shannon Jr., held scoreless the first 16 minutes, finished with 20 points to lead the Illini (20-13). It was the first time in five tournament appearances since 2011 that Illinois didn't make it out of the first round.The Razorbacks were up by double digits in the middle of the first half, but no lead has been safe this season. In seven games they blew leads with scoring droughts of five minutes or longer.That didn't happen this time, though it looked like it could when Arkansas failed to land what could have been the knockout punch with 2 1/2 minutes to play. Anthony Black intercepted Coleman Hawkins' cross-court pass and Council missed the fast-break dunk when he would have been better served to lay it in. The blown play left Arkansas coach Eric Musselman flailing his arms and screaming.“We were in this position many times before,” Council said. “We would be up 10, up 12 at halftime, and it starts dwindling down and the other team takes the lead. So just keep that mindset we got to win the game. We all wanted to win, and just keeping our foot on the gas and not giving up. Coach gave us positive energy and we gave positive energy to each other, so we just didn’t let up. We ended up extending the lead.”Council atoned for his missed dunk with a layup to end a 4-minute, 13-second scoring drought, and his two free throws with 1:18 left put the Razorbacks up 68-57.“We were able to survive their run in the second half, and obviously 22 for 29 from the foul line, shooting 76% in a win-or-go-home game. John Daly will be happy,” Musselman said, referring to the pro golfer and big Razorback fan. “He gives me texts after every game about our free-throw shooting. So I’m sure he will give me a positive text tonight.”Arkansas, which has reached the Elite Eight the past two years, led by as many as 14 points in the first half and went to the locker room ahead 36-26 following a scrambling play under the basket where Kamani Johnson battled three Illinois players for a loose ball.The play defined the hardscrabble contest. Jackson got the ball and muscled it into the basket. Nick Smith Jr. was there to celebrate as Johnson turned to go upcourt, playfully pushing his teammate in the chest. Johnson slipped and fell and exchanged smiles with Smith when he got up. A timeout followed, and the Arkansas faithful began a raucous “calling of the hogs,” putting some extra oomph into their “Wooooo. Pig. Souie!”Arkansas' defense was on point from the outset, holding the Illini to 28% shooting in the first half and 38.5% for the game. The Hogs scored 19 points off Illinois' 17 turnovers.“I thought their defense early was the difference,” Illini coach Brad Underwood said. “We had a hard time getting into offense, and then every time we made a run we missed a layup, we turned it over, or missed free throws.”BIG PICTUREIllinois: The Illini dropped to 1-8 all-time against Southeastern Conference teams in the NCAA Tournament. Matthew Mayer, who won a national championship with Baylor in 2021 and was the Illini’s second-leading scorer this season, missed all six of his shots and was held to two points.Arkansas: The Razorbacks are now 6-1 against the Big Ten in the tournament since 1983 and set up for another deep run if they can knock off the Jayhawks.UP NEXTArkansas' last meeting with Kansas in the NCAA Tournament was in the 1991 Elite Eight, a 93-81 Jayhawks win.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838178,2 transfers get NCAA reunions with ex-programs in Greensboro,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Bryce Hopkins could almost feel it coming, long before the NCAA Tournament selection committee had unveiled its 68-team bracket.The Providence star just knew the Friars' path would start with Kentucky — the place where he started his college career before deciding to transfer.He wasn't alone. Pittsburgh forward Blake Hinson got his own such date, facing the Iowa State team he left behind to help spark the Panthers' revival.Fate? Fitting? Either way, a quirk of the bracket has two reunions taking place Friday under the same Greensboro Coliseum roof but in different regions — both featuring players who are leading their new teams in scoring. The scenario could become much more common in the transfer-portal era, with freer player movement evolving into de facto free agency.“It’s interesting, I don’t think young people are as emotional about this stuff as we maybe adults are,” Pittsburgh coach Jeff Capel said. “They’re able to move on very, very quickly and turn the page.”The tournament has already produced one such matchup: Arizona State's Desmond Cambridge Jr. scored 17 points in a First Four win over Nevada on Wednesday night.Now Hopkins and Hinson will get theirs. Hinson is first when his 11th-seeded Panthers face the sixth-seeded Cyclones in the Midwest Region. Hopkins' 11th-seeded Friars follow, facing the sixth-seeded Wildcats in the East.“I’m not trying to go out and prove anything to them,” Hopkins said. “I’m just want to go out and put my team in the best position to win. People are saying it’s a revenge game — I’m not looking at it like that. I’m just trying to go out and move to the next round.”Maybe so. The vibe was certainly different in how Hopkins and Hinson talked — or didn't — about reconnecting with their former programs.Hinson, a 6-foot-7 fifth-year junior, is averaging 15.5 points and 6.1 rebounds for Pittsburgh, mixing an outside-shooting stroke (38.8% from 3-point range) with a sturdy 235-pound frame. He helped Pitt win its First Four game against Mississippi State to reach this matchup, but had little to say about it.“I’m just ready to play my next game in March Madness,” he said, “and I’m focused on winning.”Multiple reporters tried follow-up questions, only to be met with terse or one-word responses.“I’d rather not say,” Hinson said flatly when asked why he left Iowa State.Hinson, a 6-foot-7 forward and a fifth-year junior, was a two-sport athlete who even got a scholarship offer in eighth grade from Florida State to play football before landing at Mississippi. He spent two seasons there and started 59 games before transferring in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He told The Daytona Beach (Florida) News-Journal at the time that he left Ole Miss in part because the state flag included the Confederate battle emblem.He sat out the 2020-21 season with a non-COVID medical condition, then left the program in October 2021 after T.J. Otzelberger had replaced coach Steve Prohm.Otzelberger chalked it up to the coaching change and a “terrific young man” looking for the right fit.“It's one of those situations where I think everybody wants to make something out of it,"" Otzelberger said. “And at the end, there’s a young man who’s playing really well on an NCAA Tournament team. And then it's our group that’s playing well also. So everybody came out OK in that situation.”Hopkins was far chattier about his former school.The 6-foot-7 wing had arrived as a four-star recruit but found himself buried on the bench, averaging just 2.1 points and 1.4 rebounds in 6.5 minutes per game — including failing to see action in Kentucky's stunning first-round tournament loss to 15 seed Saint Peter's. So he left looking for a bigger role.He found it with Ed Cooley's Friars. The first-team Associated Press All-Big East pick has averaged 16.1 points and 8.5 rebounds with nine 20-point games this season.Perhaps that explained why Hopkins couldn't help but smile during Thursday's news conference when teammate Ed Croswell mentioned Hopkins had said he “wished he had a fair chance at Kentucky” but he is “at his happy home now.”Beyond that, Hopkins appears to hold no grudges.“There were some great players last year and I was a freshman last year and I’m pretty sure coach (John Calipari) felt comfortable playing them because they have that college experience and I didn’t have it,” Hopkins said. ""So I don't fault Coach Cal at all.“I understand his decision. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to play at Kentucky. I really appreciate it.”Besides, Hopkins said, he's still a part of a group text thread with his former Kentucky teammates and said multiple times he was excited to play familiar faces.The feeling appears to be mutual, a sign that maybe Capel is right about players being quick to move on.Then again, they have to be in these rapidly changing times for the sport.“It'll be good,” said Kentucky big man Oscar Tshiebwe, last season's AP national player of the year and a two-time All-American. “That's my boy. Good player, good kid.“I miss him a little bit because he was kind of like my best friend, too, on the team. ... I'm just excited to see what he's doing and to play with him, too.”___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838180,UN seeks independent ideas on tackling Afghanistan's Taliban,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Thursday calling for independent recommendations on how a united international community should address the enormous challenges confronting Afghanistan — above all the Taliban’s drastic curtailment of education and work for women and girls, but also terrorism and the country’s dire humanitarian and economic situation.The resolution, co-sponsored by Japan and the United Arab Emirates, asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to establish an independent panel to assess the situation in Afghanistan and make proposals for a “coherent approach” for key players inside and outside the United Nations dealing with the political, humanitarian and development issues. It ordered the assessment to be provided to the Security Council no later than Nov. 17.United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh was asked afterward whether the Security Council and the U.N. Secretariat have run out of their own ideas to address the future of Afghanistan. She called the Afghan situation very complex and said council members hope the ideas from the independent assessment will help bolster the council’s thinking “and the thinking of the international community around an international strategy.”She noted criticism that there is no international strategy to deal with Afghanistan’s challenges and crises.“Afghanistan has been on an extremely alarming trajectory since August 2021,” Nusseibeh said. “So, our hope is that the assessment will offer credible suggestions as to how the various relevant international and regional actors can coalesce around a shared vision for the country, and how we can advance that vision in the Security Council.”She said the unanimous approval of the resolution by the 15-member Security Council, which remains paralyzed over Ukraine because of Russia’s veto power and divided on other issues, shows that unity is possible on Afghanistan.The resolution listed a host of challenges facing Afghanistan that need to be addressed, including human rights, especially of women and girls, the dire humanitarian situation, the problems of religious and ethnic minorities, security and terrorism, narcotics production, social, economic and development needs, promoting dialogue and improving governance and the rule of law.The Taliban seized power in mid-August 2021 amid the chaotic departure of U.S. and NATO troops after 20 years. As the Taliban did during their previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, they gradually reimposed their harsh interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Girls are now barred from school beyond the sixth grade and women are banned from most jobs, public spaces such as parks, and gyms.The Security Council also unanimously adopted a second resolution extending the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan — UNAMA — until March 17, 2024.Its mandate includes fostering an inclusive political dialogue, monitoring and reporting on human rights, facilitating humanitarian assistance, addressing economic and social challenges and countering terrorism and narcotics.“The role of UNAMA is becoming more important and indispensable at this time of crisis,” Japan’s U.N. Ambassador Ishikane Kimihiro told the council before the vote.After the vote, U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood called UNAMA “a lifeline for the people of Afghanistan,” saying it “is critical to working toward the peace and stability that we all agree is so important for Afghanistan and the world.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838181,Bulls' Ball to have cartilage transplant in ailing left knee,"CHICAGO (AP) — Bulls point guard Lonzo Ball will have a cartilage transplant in his left knee, the team and his agency, Klutch Sports, said Thursday.They did not say when the operation will take place or what the timeline for his recovery will be. It will be Ball’s third surgery on the knee in a little more than a year.Ball hasn't played in over a year and Chicago ruled him out for the season last month.“This has been a frustrating process, but I’m confident these next steps are the best path forward,” Ball said in a statement.Bulls executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas said Ball has the organization’s “full support.”“I continue to admire Lonzo’s perseverance throughout this journey,” Karnisovas said. “This has been a long and challenging road for him, and this decision has been a difficult one to make.”Ball hasn’t played since Jan. 14, 2022. He had surgery for a torn meniscus a few weeks later and experienced setbacks when he tried to ramp up basketball activities.The Bulls had him rest for 10 days at one point, hoping it would resolve the issue and allow him to return. But he felt pain again when he started preparing to play.Ball was still unable to run at full speed, or even walk up stairs, without experiencing discomfort when he had another operation in late September. He said at the time he expected to play this season.Ball has been able to do some on-court work. He posted a video on Instagram last month of him dunking. But it became more and more clear that probably wouldn’t happen.Ball averaged 13 points and 5.1 assists while shooting 42.3% on 3-pointers over 35 games last season — his first in Chicago. He helped set up stars Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan and gave the Bulls an elite perimeter defender.Chicago is 11th in the Eastern Conference at 26-33.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838182,"Brehm makes ace for share of lead at Valspar, Spieth 1 back","PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) — Ryan Brehm turned a good round into a memorable one Thursday, making a hole-in-one on the par-3 17th hole at Innisbrook for a 5-under 66 that led to a three-way share of the lead at the Valspar Championship.Stephan Jaeger also had a 66, while Adam Schenk joined them with the low score in the afternoon on the Copperhead course.Jordan Spieth, back at Innisbrook for the first time in five years, had a bogey-free round and was particularly sharp with the putter, making birdie putts of 60 feet and 30 feet on his way to a 67. Also at 67 were former U.S. Open champion Lucas Glover and Maverick McNealy.This is the first lead for Brehm since he won the Puerto Rico Open last year in his final start to try to keep a PGA Tour card. It hasn't been the smoothest road since then. Brehm has made only three cuts this season — one of them at Kapalua — and is coming off an 80 in the second round last week at The Players Championship.“We've been grinding for a little while since then to try and find some good form again, and hopefully ... it's been showing signs of good play,” he said.His ace came with a 6-iron from 196 yards, and he closed with a par. It was his 11th time in the 60s in 43 rounds on the PGA Tour this season.Jaeger had seven birdies in the morning, which started with temperatures cold enough for some players to wear beanies and extra layers.Schenk finished his round with a 10-foot par save on the par-3 eighth hole, and then after going bunker-to-bunker on the ninth, made a par putt from 5 feet.Tommy Fleetwood was at 68, while the group at 69 included two-time defending champion Sam Burns and Justin Thomas, at No. 10 the highest-ranked player in the field.Scoring is never particularly low at Innisbrook, highly regarded as a tournament course with tree-lined fairways, elevation and not nearly as much water as so many courses in Florida.“I’m not comfortable out there at all, but I don’t think anybody really is — maybe Sam Burns; he's won it a couple times,” Brehm said. “But I think it’s a good test of golf. Golf’s not supposed to be easy, I don’t think, and the course does a good job of making you think.”No one had a tougher start than U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick.On the third hole, Fitzpatrick pulled his tee shot out of play. His third shot from the tee found the water, and after a penalty drop, he came up short of the bunker and then from there, short of the green. It added to a 9, and he followed with consecutive bogeys.Fitzpatrick went out in 42, and he bounced back with a 32. Even so, he came into the Valspar Championship having missed three cuts in his last five tournaments.Spieth hasn't been able to fit Innisbrook into his schedule since The Players Championship moved back to March, but he wanted to return this year. This is his fourth tournament in the last five weeks, with the Match Play next week.Before he had a card, Spieth chipped in on the 17th hole and tied for seventh that allowed him to gain special temporary membership on the PGA Tour. Two years later, he won the Valspar Championship in a playoff by making a 30-foot birdie putt. That was in 2015, the year he won the Masters and U.S. Open.This round was mostly about his putting, the long birdies and equally important, a number of mid-length par putts that kept his round going. Spieth hit only five fairways.“With only hitting like five-ish fairways, you do that around this place and shoot under par, it’s pretty solid,” Spieth said, accounting for a few tee shots just off the short grass. “I was able to sneak a couple extras with the putter today. I’ve been feeling like my putting’s been working towards where I really want it to be.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838183,New Mexico gov. signs bill overriding local abortion bans,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico's governor signed an abortion-rights bill Thursday that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting access to abortion procedures and medications.Reproductive health clinics in New Mexico offer abortion procedures to patients from states, including Texas, with strict abortion bans. The new law also aims to ensure access to gender affirming healthcare related to distress over gender identity that doesn’t match a person’s assigned sex.New Mexico has one of the country’s most liberal abortion access laws, but two counties and three cities in eastern New Mexico have recently adopted abortion restrictions that reflect deep-seated opposition to offering the procedure.The bill signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham overrides those local ordinances.An additional bill working its way through New Mexico’s Legislature would protect abortion providers and patients from out-of-state interference, prosecution or extradition attempts.In 2021, New Mexico’s Democrat-led Legislature passed a measure to repeal a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures, which ensured access to abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.Anti-abortion ordinances — adopted over the past several months by officials in the cities of Hobbs, Clovis and Eunice, along with Lea and Roosevelt counties — reference an obscure U.S. anti-obscenity law that prohibits shipping of medication or other materials intended to aid abortions.Separately, Democratic state Attorney General Raúl Torrez has urged the state Supreme Court to intervene against local abortion ordinances that he says violate state constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process.Democratic governors in 20 states this year launched a network intended to strengthen abortion access in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision nixing a woman’s constitutional right to end a pregnancy. The decision shifted regulatory powers over the procedure to state governments.Many states have also enacted or contemplated limits or outright bans on transgender medical treatment, with conservative U.S. lawmakers saying they are worried about young people later regretting irreversible body-altering treatment.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838184,Nonprofit head pleads guilty in Mississippi welfare fraud,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The director of a Mississippi nonprofit organization pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court to stealing government funds intended to help needy families in one of the poorest states in the U.S., court documents show.Christi Webb, director of the north Mississippi-based Family Resource Center, appeared before U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves in Jackson. Court documents show Webb pleaded guilty to charges that could send her to prison for up to 10 years.The federal charges stem from a welfare scandal that has ensnared high-profile figures, including retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre, who lives in Mississippi.John Davis, who was Mississippi Department of Human Services executive director from 2016 to mid-2019, pleaded guilty last September to state and federal charges tied to misspending money through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. He has not yet been sentenced.The Mississippi Department of Human Services last year filed a civil lawsuit to try to recover the millions of dollars of misspent welfare money. Webb and the Family Resource Center of North Mississippi are among those being sued. Favre has not faced criminal charges but is one of more than three dozen defendants in the civil lawsuit.Nancy New and Zachary New, a mother and son who ran another nonprofit organization and an education company, pleaded guilty in April 2022 to state charges of misusing welfare money, including on lavish gifts such as first-class airfare for Davis. The News' organization also funneled welfare money to be used on drug rehab for Brett DiBiase, a former pro wrestler and friend of Davis who has pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges.Welfare money helped fund pet projects of the wealthy, including $5 million for a volleyball arena that Favre supported at his alma mater, the University of Southern Mississippi, the state auditor said. Favre’s daughter played volleyball at the school starting in 2017.A sentencing hearing for Webb has been set for June 16.___Michael Goldberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

And she waved at me and she took off, and the other coaches were like, Who was that?“And I’m like, yeah, we’re in good shape with Liz.”Raven Kitley. Elizabeth's older sister, is autistic and especially connected to her sister's career, and the Hokies. It's been huge for Virginia Tech.Elizabeth Kitley, the two-time Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year, led the No. 4 Hokies to a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament this season. They'll face No. 16 Chattanooga on Friday.“She’ll definitely be here cheering us on, as she always is, and hopefully we can make her proud and happy,” Kitley said.The Hokies will be facing a familiar face. Mocs coach Shawn Poppie spent six seasons as an assistant for Brooks, the last three as associate head coach.“I tell you what, this past season, I have watched from afar as a fan.” Poppie said. “Obviously being here for six years and getting to know the kids and being so close to Coach Brooks and the staff, I have been a fan all year.”The other game will feature eighth-seeded and two-time national champion Southern Cal and ninth-seeded South Dakota State. The USC team is in the tournament for the first time since 2014.“They’re a team that likes to run in transition, get really quick buckets. They’re really, really good three-point shooters. Everyone on the floor can shoot, and I think that’s different from what we’ve faced,” Trojans guard Destiny Littleton said.The Jackrabbits are thrilled for the opportunity.“Any time we can meet up with another opponent, it’s fun,” Myah Selland said. “We have spent the last 21 games playing very familiar faces, so I think we are excited to play somebody new.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838186,Ex-Theranos exec finds way to delay start of prison sentence,"Former Theranos executive Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani found an escape hatch Thursday from the scheduled start of his nearly 13-year prison sentence for a blood-testing hoax he engineered with his former boss and lover, Elizabeth Holmes.Just hours before Balwani was supposed to surrender to authorities, his lawyer filed documents notifying U.S. District Judge Edward Davila that he wouldn't be doing so.The notice cited a last-minute appeal of a recent Davila ruling rejecting Balwani's request to remain free while trying to overturn his conviction on 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy. The Wednesday appeal of Davila's March 9 ruling triggered an automatic stay of his prison reporting date, which had been set for 2 p.m. PT Thursday.That's because Balwani, 57, has been free on bail since a jury convicted him last July, triggering a clause that allows him to remain free on bail until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals weighs in on Davila's ruling issued last week, according to the notice filed by Balwani's attorney, Jeffrey Coopersmith.It's unclear how long it will be before the appeals court deals with the ruling.If and when he is sent to prison, Balawani will service his time in a facility near a Southern California harbor, according to other documents filed Wednesday by Coopersmith. That destination represents a shift from the Atlanta prison that Balwani had been initially assigned by authorities.The change means Balwani will be staying in the Terminal Island prison located in San Pedro, California, located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from downtown Los Angeles. The prison has incarcerated several other prominent figures, including gangster Al Capone in the 1930s, apocalyptic cult leader Charles Manson for an auto theft in the 1950s and LSD evangelist Timothy Leary in the 1970s.In a filing last week, Coopersmith had asked Davila for additional time to appeal the Bureau of Prisons’ decision to send him to that Atlanta prison that has been dogged by allegations of widespread of misconduct and other abuses. Davila had recommended Balwani be sent to a Lompoc prison in Santa Barbara County located about 250 miles (400 kilometers) from the San Jose courtroom where his trial took place.Holmes, 39, and her lawyers will have their chance to try to persuade Davila to allow her to delay the scheduled April 27 start of her more than 11-year prison sentence during a hearing set for Friday morning in San Jose, California.It will mark Holmes' first appearance in court since giving birth to the child she was carrying at the time of her Nov. 18 sentencing on four counts of fraud and conspiracy.Although they had separate trials, Holmes and Balwani were accused of essentially the same crimes centered on a ruse touting Theranos’ blood-testing system as a revolutionary breakthrough in health care. The claims helped the company become a Silicon Valley sensation that raised nearly $1 billion from investors.But its technology never came close to working like Holmes and Balwani boasted, resulting in Theranos’ scandalous collapse and a criminal case that shined a bright light on Silicon Valley greed and hubris.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838187,LSU enters NCAA Tournament energized by Mulkey mania,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — LSU All-America forward Angel Reese wrote the phrase, “four rebounds,” in her locker.The story behind that exemplifies Kim Mulkey's influence on the Tigers, who enter Friday's opening round of the 2023 NCAA tournament having won 54 of 62 games since LSU hired the three-time national champion coach away from Baylor.The 6-foot-3 Reese, who has averaged 23.4 points and 15.5 rebounds this season, pulled down a season-low four boards during LSU's 88-64 loss at unbeaten South Carolina on Feb. 12.During a subsequent practice, Mulkey mentioned that less-than-flattering statistic more than once.“She has humbled me a lot; A lot of players probably can’t be coached by coach Mulkey,” Reese asserted. ""I just appreciate how much she pushes me.“Of anybody, she gets on me the most,"" Reese continued. ""This is something I needed.”LSU (28-2), seeded third in the tournament's Greenville 2 region, hosts Big West tournament champion No. 14 seed Hawaii (18-14) on Friday. Also meeting in Baton Rouge are No. 6 seed Michigan (22-9) and 11th-seeded UNLV (31-2).LSU missed two straight NCAA tournaments before Mulkey, 60, started a new chapter in her career in Baton Rouge — a little more than an hour's drive from Tickfaw, Louisiana, where she grew up.Not only has LSU returned to the tournament in both seasons since, but also was designated a first- and second-round host.The fan base has been re-energized. The Tigers' last home game — a victory over Mississippi — set a new paid attendance record of 15,721 for any event at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center.“Her will to win is what makes her stand out,” said Tigers guard Alexis Morris, who began her college career under Mulkey at Baylor, then transferred to Rutgers and Texas A&M before returning to Mulkey at LSU last season.“That’s why she can perform and produce and piece us together as a team in this era,” Morris said. “Her way to evolve and adjust to the new generation has been incredible.”Before coaching, Mulkey played guard, winning an NCAA title at Louisiana Tech in 1982 and Olympic gold with the U.S. National Team in ‘84. She returned to Louisiana Tech as an assistant in 1985, but after being passed over for that program’s head coaching job in 2000, she left for Baylor and built a powerhouse.“That’s one intense coach and players want to play for her because she’s going to get in their stuff,"" Hawaii coach Laura Beeman said. ""She’s one of the trail blazers in our game. What she did at Baylor was phenomenal. She’s come here and turned this thing around quick.”LSU won one tournament game a season ago before falling to Ohio State. This season has raised hopes for a deeper tournament run, but Mulkey is trying to keep her players focused on their defensive assignments against perimeter-shooting Hawaii.“We better be ready,” Mulkey said. “Hawaii is talented. Hawaii presents problems for us on the defensive end of the floor because they shoot so many 3’s. We have bigs out there that are going to have to guard 3-point shooters.”MISSING PIECE?Michigan had to labor through much of its Big Ten schedule without a key player.Sophomore guard Laila Phelia, who averaged 16.9 points per game this season, recently returned from a leg injury that caused her to miss Michigan's last seven regular-season games. She returned for the conference tournament earlier this month, scoring 13 points in a victory over Penn State and 17 points in a loss to Ohio State.“I personally feel like I’ll be ready for (Friday), mentally and physically,” Phelia said. “Can’t wait.”Being pain-free is one thing. Being in postseason form is another.“She kind of got her feet wet in the Big Ten Tournament and gained some of her confidence back,” Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico said.Phelia is one of three Michigan players who averaged better than 16 points per game this season.Teammates said her presence matters, regardless of how she plays.“Whether that’s her offensive abilities and her explosiveness and really just her versatility, I think that’s a huge thing for us,” Michigan guard Leigha Brown said. “When she’s on the court, I think teams are forced to guard us a lot differently and respect us in different ways.”STACKING WINSUNLV's 31 victories are the second most of any tournament team, behind only Florida-Gulf Coast's 32.Michigan is seeded higher because of the strength of its conference, but Arico sounded impressed by her first-round opponent's win total.“Any team that can win over 30 basketball games in a season is special,” Arico asserted. “If you can go undefeated in your conference and then go to the conference tournament and win the conference tournament, holy cow.”UNLV is on a 22-game winning streak and hasn't lost since Dec. 18. A subplot to their success has been that coach Lindy LaRocque is a Las Vegas native.“This is just an extremely special opportunity,"" LaRocque said, smiling. ""I still kind of talk with my family, I’m like, 'Can you believe I’m head coach of the Lady Rebels? Can you believe that?”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-polland https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

The state prosecutor’s office in Nuevo Leon has said it is investigating the women’s disappearance.The sisters live in Peñitas, a small Texas border city near McAllen, and are legal U.S. residents, while their friend, Saenz, lives in Mexico, KRGV reported.Ramirez, who spoke to KRGV on Tuesday, said she's been in contact with Mexican authorities. She told the TV station that her mother and aunt, who grew up in Nuevo Leon, have made the trip several times to the market.“They had fun going out there, meeting new people,” Ramirez told KRGV.Ramirez told The Monitor in McAllen that she last spoke to her mother Feb. 25, the day after her mother and aunt crossed the border into Mexico.Another case of Americans who went missing in Mexico received an avalanche of attention earlier this month when their March 3 abduction was caught on video after a drug cartel shootout in Matamoros. That case was resolved in a matter of days when the four were found in a wooden shack. Two were alive and two were dead.The massive search for the four kidnapped Americans involved squads of Mexican soldiers and National Guard troops.

Scott Drew is coaching Baylor, Bryce Drew is coaching Grand Canyon and Homer Drew has an entire day to watch and cheer — and sweat it out — from the stands.“It’s a wonderful time,” said Homer Drew, who made seven tournament appearances in his 22 years at Valparaiso. “It’s a wonderful life.”The only dilemma for the 78-year-old retired coach at this impromptu family reunion is finding a place to change shirts. Drew said he brought gear from both teams to Denver and went back to his hotel to change in between Thursday practices.It's a small inconvenience to watch his sons lead their teams on college basketball's biggest stage.An added bonus to the weekend: The boys don’t play each other. The Bears are in the South Regional and the Antelopes in the West. If the teams advance, they wouldn’t meet until the final in Houston.Homer, the boys and their mom, Janet, had an opportunity to catch up this week. But now things turn serious, with third-seeded Baylor playing Santa Barbara in the early game Friday and No. 14 Grand Canyon taking on Gonzaga later in the day.“Made it real easy for my mom and dad. They’re getting up in age so it’s harder to travel, so going to one spot is easier,” said Scott Drew, who led Baylor to an NCAA championship in 2021. “We can cheer for each other, and hopefully we can stay around together.”There have been other perks. When Grand Canyon's gear didn’t arrive with the team on the plane to Denver, Bryce Drew knew exactly who to turn to. Big brother Scott made sure the Antelopes had some of the Bears' scout jerseys, until the equipment showed up later.“We charge them by the hour,” Scott Drew cracked. “Whatever we can do to help.”For a team that has long made basketball a family affair, this weekend feels meant-to-be.“Families, they’re part of it,” Bryce Drew said. “They take wins and losses so hard. I don’t know how my dad coached for so long and my mom, how she stood all those wins and losses for so long.”Twenty-five years ago this week, Bryce Drew drained one of the most iconic shots in NCAA Tournament history to help 13th-seeded Valparaiso knock off Mississippi 70-69 on a last-second shot.He's reminded of that moment every tournament.“We never dreamt that we would be 25 years later getting to answer a question about it,” Bryce Drew said. “Just a special time, special memory. But I like when people just say ‘anniversary’ and they don’t give it the number. The number makes it ... seem a lot older when we put a number on it.”This weekend isn't just a Drew family reunion, either. Gonzaga coach Mark Few and his assistant coach, Roger Powell Jr. are close with the Drews, too.”Just one of the greatest, coolest families out there,"" Few said. ""I don’t know of any father or son-son lineage that seems to be able to do what they have done. ... They’re fun, positive people to be around.”They’re also trying to arrange a pickleball game. It didn’t work out in Denver (it snowed, plus, you know, those tournament games). But maybe soon?""Give them credit for being good coaches,” Bryce Drew said. “But they’re also pretty good pickleball players.” ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838212,LOCALIZE IT: Banks and our money after 2 rapid-fire failures,"NEW YORK (AP) — EDITORS/NEWS DIRECTORS:Silicon Valley Bank became the second largest bank to fail in U.S. history on March 10, followed two days later by the third largest, New York-based Signature Bank. Those twin calamities quickly prompted federal authorities to guarantee full refunds to all depositors — no matter how wealthy they are — to avoid cascading panic.While Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Cecilia Rouse, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, have sought to assure the public that the U.S. banking system is fundamentally sound compared with its state before the 2008 global financial crisis, plunging bank stocks and a phenomenon some are calling the first Twitter-fueled bank run has Americans asking: ""Is my money safe?""We offer tips and resources for reporting around whether banks in your area are trustworthy and reliable.___FIND AP’S LATESTExperts, banks look for ideas to stop next bank failureFed lent $300B in emergency funds to banks in the past weekIs my money safe? What you need to know about bank failuresSee additional bank collapse stories here.___PUBLISHABLE CONTEXTThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 was supposed to ensure that Americans’ money was safe, in part by setting up annual “stress tests” administered by the Federal Reserve. The tests examine how banks might fare under future economic downturns. They are supposed to gauge whether banks and other systemically important financial institutions would be able to continue lending to businesses and households should a wave of pressures converge. The tests estimate potential resiliency against rising unemployment, plunging asset values — such as another collapse in home prices — and “severe market volatility.”But in 2018, Congress rolled back some of those protections. Some Democrats joined Republicans in raising the minimum threshold for banks subject to the Fed’s stress tests. Institutions with less than $250 billion in assets were no longer required to participate. Investor focus over the past week has centered on mid-sized banks, generally defined as those with assets of $15 billion to $115 billion, which are now exempt from the Fed’s most rigorous testing.Even smaller institutions — community banks with assets of less than $15 billion, for example — are vital to specific geographies because they lend to businesses and individuals that might not qualify for loans from bigger banks. Like mid-sized institutions, community banks aren’t subject to the Fed’s stress tests.___KEY QUESTIONS AND RESOURCES— Who owns the bank, and are deposits there protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.?Start with the FDIC's BankFind Suite. Unlike searching the Securities and Exchange Commission's website, this search helps by suggesting related names and includes basic information about banks not traded on any stock exchange. A big green FDIC check mark indicates the bank is FDIC insured, meaning deposits of $250,000 or less are guaranteed by regulators. If the bank fails, depositors get their money back up to that threshold.— What's happening in other business sectors that might impact area banks, and what are local businesses worried about?A big part of SVB’s downfall was its concentration on lending to the technology sector, where businesses have slashed tens of thousands of jobs since the fourth quarter of last year. Being knowledgeable about which industries are concentrated in your area is key. For example, many community banks are big lenders to agricultural interests. Rising inflation is bound to affect their depositors. The local chamber of commerce is a good place to ask what area businesses are worried about and how those worries may be reflected in bank balance sheets.— Credit unions might also be a good indicator of what’s happening locally. Where is their business coming from? Are they seeing an increase in business lending while area banks see decreases? They are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.— Investment banks, mutual funds, pension funds and other financial institutions employ analysts who dissect the inner workings and valuation of companies, including large, small and mid-sized banks. In addition to churning out information for clients, they’re often willing to talk to the media.— Local chambers of commerce; municipal, county or state politicians; small business owners; economic development experts at local universities and regional development think-tanks can provide additional insight into the health of banks in the area and the local economy.— Also consider interviewing local members of Congress about whether they supported the 2018 legislation relaxing Dodd-Frank protections and whether they might reconsider that position now.___WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOROne way to assess a financial institution’s health is to look at its capital ratios and its loan-to-deposit ratio, i.e. the amount of its capital and reserves versus its total assets, and the amount of loans it has issued or debt it has taken on versus the amount of money it has in deposits. While these are not the only factors to consider, they will provide a baseline about a bank's health. This information can be found in various places: self-published via the bank's investor relations page or via the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. The FDIC's “Search for information” results also list total assets and total deposits.Other resources of information from the FDIC: Quarterly Banking Profile reportsBank Financial ReportsCommunity Bank Search___DIGGING INTO PUBLICLY TRADED BANKSStock price is one sign that can indicate a bank may be in trouble. But remember that individual performance should always be compared with peers. If an entire sector is diving, like banks for example, that doesn't mean every bank is in trouble.The triggering factor in the run on Silicon Valley Bank was its decision to sell its collection of Treasury bonds at a loss and the announcement of plans to raise up to $1.75 million in capital in order to strengthen its position.For publicly traded companies, information like this can be found in financial reports filed to the SEC, which are publicly available via the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval search tool. Form 10-Q filings detail a company's quarterly financial filings, Form 10-K filings detail a company's annual financial report, and Form 8-Ks contain up-to-date information on actions and events material to performance.To find these documents on EDGAR, search for a company's stock market ticker. If you don't know a company's stock market symbol, conduct a web search for either the bank or its parent organization.In EDGAR, look for the “Company and Person Lookup” search box. Enter the ticker symbol in the box. The right-hand column should offer “Selected Filings.” Because 8-Ks are among the most searched for, the list of the company's most recent 8-Ks will be there.Silicon Valley Bank's 8-K from March 8 appeared to focus on its plans to raise money through a new stock offering. The exhibits in the filing, however, disclosed a letter to investors noting that the bank had ""sold substantially all of our Available for Sale (AFS) securities portfolio.”___WHICH FEDS TO ASK ABOUT WHATFederal officials in regional offices may help dissect state and regional red flags. State banking regulators are even closer to issues on the ground.While the U.S. Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates nationally chartered commercial banks, its regional offices may be more responsive. Here's how the OCC regions break down:The East Region covers federally chartered institutions based in Delaware, Washington, D.C., Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and some institutions in Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia and West Virginia.The Northeast Region is responsible for Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.The South Region covers Louisiana and Texas.The Southeast Region is for Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, plus some institutions located in Colorado, Kentucky and Texas.The Midwest Region is responsible for Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Wisconsin, and some institutions in Indiana, Kansas, Michigan and South Dakota.The West Region covers institutions headquartered in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming and some in Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.___WHO ARE THE STATE REGULATORS?As well as the federal institutions that regulate banks, each state has its own bank overseers, who can provide information about state-chartered banks. They also tend to be more in touch with the banks they regulate and more accessible to the press.Here's a state-by-state list, along with contact information:Alabama State Banking Department Phone: (334) 242-3452 Website: www.banking.alabama.gov/Alaska Division of Banking and Securities Phone: (888) 925-2521 Website: http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/bsc/Arizona Department of Financial Institutions Phone: (800) 544-0708 Website: https://difi.az.gov/Arkansas Attorney General Phone: (501) 682-2007 Website: https://arkansasag.gov/California Department of Corporations, Financial Services Division Phone: (866) 275-2677 Website: https://dfpi.ca.gov/Colorado Office of the Attorney General Phone: (303) 866-4494 Website: https://coag.gov/Connecticut Department of Banking Phone: (860) 240-8299 Website: http://www.ct.gov/dob/site/default.aspDelaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner Phone: (302) 739-4235 Website: http://banking.delaware.gov/Washington, D.C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838213,Canelo happily taking massive pay cut to fight in Mexico,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Saúl Álvarez says he was determined to fight at home again in Mexico this year. The massive financial sacrifice necessary to make it happen didn't bother Canelo in the slightest.“Sometimes it's not about money,” Álvarez said Thursday. “Sometimes it's about pride, and it's that time. I don't need to say how much I lose, because I don't care. I feel good to fight in my hometown, and I'm proud.”When Álvarez steps into the ring in his native Guadalajara on May 6, he will make about half of what he would have made if the fight were held in Las Vegas, promoter Eddie Hearn told The Associated Press on Thursday in San Diego.Álvarez is eagerly taking that major pay cut — quite possibly more than $10 million — to take on Britain's John Ryder for all four super middleweight world title belts in front of more than 50,000 frenzied hometown fans at Akron Stadium.“It's unbelievable, because it affected me,” Hearn said with a grin. ""Actually, I think it's great. Saul has got a lot of money, so that's (a factor). but it’s still quite unusual. I’ve not really seen a lot of fighters that would take a lot less to do it at home.”Although Álvarez (58-2-2, 39 KOs) and trainer Eddy Reynoso were determined to hold the 168-pound champion's next fight to Guadalajara, Hearn still dutifully fielded offers from Vegas, London and even the Middle East for the next fight from arguably the sport's most bankable fighter over the past decade.“The first round (of offers), it was already much more (than Guadalajara),” Hearn said. “And then when we went back and said, ‘No,’ it kept going up. And I kept going back, and in the end, (Álvarez) told me to stop. 'Stop. Shut up. We're doing it.'""Hearn can't yet give specifics about the size of Álvarez's payday, but Canelo was widely reported to have a guaranteed purse of $45 million for his trilogy bout with Gennady Golovkin last year — with his final earnings likely much higher, perhaps near $100 million. Álvarez also made well over the $15 million guaranteed purse for his bout against Dmitry Bivol last May.The 32-year-old Álvarez turned pro at 15 in Guadalajara, but he hasn't fought in Mexico since November 2011, when the skyrocket of his career made it financially unwise. His last 22 fights have been in the U.S. in locales ranging from Vegas and Miami to the Dallas Cowboys' cavernous home stadium.But Álvarez and Hearn have been working toward a fight in Mexico ever since the British promoter hooked up with the Mexican superstar six fights ago. While Canelo recovered from surgery on his left hand over the holidays, he and Reynoso decided the time had arrived to take a mandatory title defense in front of the fans who first roared for him. Even his grandmother will be in the crowd, he said.“We are so crazy,” Álvarez said. “The vibes are just different. It’s amazing. You feel the energy. Everything moves when the people scream. It's just the best.""The move also comes with pressure: His fans will be expecting something spectacular against an opponent not thought to be on his lofty level. A certain segment of Mexican fans have soured on Álvarez for reasons ranging from his two unimpressive performances in 2022 to his primary residency in San Diego, where he plays golf almost daily.And Ryder (32-5, 18 KOs) is no pushover: The North London native has won four straight fights to earn this shot, including a victory over former champ Danny Jacobs. Ryder has plenty of experience with hostile crowds after traveling to Callum Smith's native Liverpool in 2019 for a 168-pound title fight that began with fans making throat-slashing gestures at him on the way to the ring.“I've earned it, and I think it's great fun,” Ryder said. “I'll keep the blinkers on, put on the hat and just get in the ring.”Álvarez said his hand is healed from surgery, and his biggest challenge is regaining full confidence in his left hook. After this homecoming bout in which Álvarez will be a significant favorite, he wants an even bigger challenge: a rematch with Bivol, who sent Canelo to his first loss in nearly nine years last May in a light heavyweight bout.“I wasn't 100% in that fight, and I have a lot to prove in that (rematch),” Álvarez said. “But first, I have to do what I want to do at home. That's the most important thing.”___AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

The former Ohio State product played all 17 games for the Colts.Slayton started slow last season and came through after Sterling Shepard and rookie Wan'Dale Robinson were hurt early and Kenny Golladay struggled.Slayton started 11 of 16 games and caught 46 passes for 724 yards and two touchdowns. The fifth-round draft pick in 2019 has 170 receptions for 2,554 yards and 15 touchdowns, including eight in his rookie season.After joining the team as a free agent, Ward played in all 19 games for the Giants. He had three sacks, 13 quarterback hits, seven tackles for losses and two forced fumbles in helping New York to its first playoff berth since 2016. Ward has played in 85 regular-season games with 26 starts for the Raiders, Colts, Ravens, Jaguars, and Giants.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838217,North Korea says ICBM test aimed to strike fear into enemies,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Friday it fired an intercontinental ballistic missile to “strike fear into the enemies” as South Korea and Japan agreed at a summit to work closely on regional security with the United States and staged military exercises around the region.The missile, launched Thursday from North Korea’s main airport as leader Kim Jong Un and his daughter smiled from afar, overshadowed a summit held hours later between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minster Fumio Kishida. The meeting in Tokyo was partially aimed at rebuilding security ties between the often-estranged U.S. allies in the face of North Korean nuclear threats.With four missile displays in about a week, North Korea has ratcheted up its tit-for-tat response to ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that are the biggest of their kind in years.The Biden administration wants better South Korea-Japan ties, which declined over historical issues in recent years, as it pushes to strengthen its alliance network in Asia to counter the North Korean nuclear threat and China's rising influence.Aside from their combined exercises that began Monday and run through March 23, the United States and South Korea are also participating in anti-submarine warfare drills, along with Japan, Canada and India, that began Wednesday.North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim supervised the test-firing of the Hwasong-17 missile, which blasted off from a launch vehicle parked on an airport runway. Kim stressed the need to “strike fear into the enemies” over what it called the “open hostility” shown to the North by the U.S.-South Korea exercises.Launched at a high angle to avoid the territory of North Korea’s neighbors, the missile reached a maximum altitude of 6,045 kilometers (3,756 miles) and traveled 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) before landing in waters off the country’s eastern coast, KCNA said.The South Korean and Japanese militaries assessed the flight similarly, indicating the U.S. mainland is within the missile's range. It remains unclear whether North Korea has developed nuclear bombs small enough to fit on its long-range rockets or the technology to ensure its warheads survive atmospheric reentry when fired at a normal trajectory.State TV showed the launch in various angles, including footage from a video camera apparently installed on the missile body that provided an aerial view of the rocket soaring from above ground, amid bright orange flames, before its lower chamber fell off in what appeared to be a stage separation.Pyongyang’s official Rodong Sinmun also published still photos implied to have been taken by a camera on the missile as it soared into space. They showed a rounded view of the Earth, with clouds scattered over what appeared to be the Korean Peninsula and Asian coastline.Kim was accompanied by his daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and about 10 years old. She has accompanied him to several military events since she was publicly revealed for the first time during another ICBM launch in November. Analysts say the intent of her public appearances at military events is to tie the Kim family's dynastic rule to the nuclear arsenal Kim sees as the strongest guarantee of his survival.The high-altitude photos were apparently intended as proof the missile would be capable of accurately striking its target, said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior analyst at South Korea’s private Sejong Institute.While all of North Korea’s ICBM tests have been conducted on a high angle, Cheong said the North is likely coming closer to launching one of those missiles at an angle closer to normal ballistic trajectory across the Pacific Ocean, in what would be one of its most provocative weapons demonstrations ever.KCNA said the ICBM launch sends a “stronger warning” to North Korea's rivals who are escalating tensions with their “frantic, provocative and aggressive large-scale war drills.” The test also was designed to confirm the reliability of the weapons system, KCNA said.Kim said it’s crucial for North Korea’s nuclear missile forces to maintain readiness to counterattack rivals with “overwhelming offensive measures anytime” and make them realize their persistent and expanded military actions will “bring an irreversible, grave threat to them,” KCNA said.Lee Hyojung, spokesperson of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said it’s deeply regrettable that the North continues to use the U.S.-South Korean military drills as an excuse to stage provocative military demonstrations.“It’s clear that North Korea’s reckless nuclear and missile development is the cause of escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula,” she said, urging Pyongyang to return to dialogue.Speaking at a lecture in Singapore on Thursday, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. John Aquilino said China has a role to play in the world if it adheres to the rules-based order, especially in regards to North Korea, which depends on Beijing as its major ally and economic lifeline.North Korea's ramped-up weapons development, underscored by the dozens of missiles it test-fired last year, poses an increasing threat to South Korea and Japan and the country has also “developed the capabilities to threaten the United States as well,” Aquilino said.“It is destabilizing, it’s unpredictable, it’s continuing, it’s not slowing down. The potential for the People’s Republic of China to help to dissuade the DPRK from executing these events would be helpful,” Aquilino said, using the initials of North Korea's official name.North Korea has long portrayed U.S.-South Korean military drills as rehearsals for an invasion, although the allies describe those exercises as defensive.Many experts say North Korea uses its rivals’ drills as a pretext to aggressively expand its nuclear arsenal and overall military capability.Since last week, North Korea also has test-fired cruise missiles from a submarine and fired short-range missiles into the sea, attempting to show it could conduct potential nuclear strikes on both South Korean targets and the U.S. mainland.Thursday's launch was North Korea’s second of an ICBM this year. The Hwasong-15 launched in February is a slightly smaller weapon than the Hwasong-17.At the summit between Yoon and Kishida, the leaders agreed to resume defense dialogue and further strengthen security cooperation with the United States to counter North Korea and other challenges.“The ever-escalating threat of North Korea’s nuclear missile program poses a huge threat to peace and stability not only in East Asia but also to the (broader) international community,” Yoon said. “South Korea and Japan need to work closely together and in solidarity to wisely counter the threat.”___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838218,Southern California jailbreak mastermind convicted,"SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — An inmate who organized a daring, elaborate Southern California jailbreak in 2016 was found guilty Thursday of the escape but acquitted of kidnapping a taxi driver while on the run, authorities said.Jurors in Orange County Superior Court also convicted Hossein Nayeri, 44, of Newport Beach of stealing a van but acquitted him of kidnapping during a carjacking and lesser offenses, the district attorney's office said in a statement.On Jan. 22, 2016, Nayeri and two other men broke out of the Orange County Central Jail Complex in Santa Ana, prompting a weeklong manhunt.Using smuggled tools, they cut through a metal grate in their maximum-security dorm cell, then climbed through plumbing shafts within the walls to reach the roof, where they rappelled down five stories using a rope made of bed linens, according to authorities and a cellphone video shot by Nayeri.The men later kidnapped a 72-year-old unlicensed taxi driver. The driver was sometimes held at gunpoint as he drove the men around. The men then stole a van and took both vehicles and the driver along as they drove hundreds of miles north to the San Francisco Bay Area, authorities said.One escapee, Bac Tien Duong, later feared that the driver would be killed and fled with him back to Southern California, authorities said.Nayeri and Jonathan Tieu were arrested the next day in San Francisco after a man recognized them from media reports, prosecutors said.Duong was convicted of escape and kidnapping in 2021. Tieu is awaiting trial for the escape, prosecutors said.At the time of his escape, Nayeri was awaiting trial on charges that he and two friends kidnapped, tortured and mutilated a marijuana dispensary owner in 2012. The owner was kidnapped from a Newport Beach home because the robbers falsely believed he had buried $1 million in the Mojave Desert, prosecutors said.He was beaten with rubber piping, shocked with a Taser, burned with a blowtorch and finally his penis was cut off before the robbers fled, prosecutors said.Nayeri fled to Iran. But he was later caught in the Czech Republic and extradited. In 2020, he was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.Nayeri's co-defendants also were convicted.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838219,Pence defends joke about Buttigieg 'maternity leave',"KEENE, N.H. (AP) — The husband of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday he hasn’t heard from Mike Pence in the days since the former vice president mocked his family, but will continue to hold him accountable for his words.Chasten Buttigieg was asked on ABC’s “The View” whether Pence contacted him after joking at a dinner for journalists and politicians that Pete Buttigieg took “maternity leave” after he and his husband adopted newborn twins.“Pete is the only person in human history to have a child and everyone else gets postpartum depression,” Pence said Saturday at the Gridiron Dinner.Chasten Buttigieg, who said he doesn’t expect to hear from Pence, called the remarks “part of a much bigger trend attacking families.”“I spoke up because we all have an obligation to hold people accountable for when they say something wrong, especially when it’s misogynistic, especially when it’s homophobic, and I just don’t take that when it’s towards my family, and I don’t think anyone else would, especially when you bring a very small, medically fragile child into it,” he said.Pence defended his comments Thursday night after speaking at a Republican Party dinner in New Hampshire.“The Gridiron Dinner is a roast. I had a lot of jokes directed to me, and I directed a lot of jokes to Republicans and Democrats,” he told reporters. “The only thing I can figure is Pete Buttigieg not only can’t do his job, but he can’t take a joke.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838220,"Alabama, Miller face renewed questions about fatal shooting","BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Brandon Miller sat in a folding chair in a corner of the locker room facing an assemblage of reporters and video cameras.Alabama's freshman All-American fielded few questions about his worst game in crimson and white, not with all the off-the-court matters that have shadowed him and a team mounting a bid for the program's first national championship.Amid myriad distractions, the NCAA Tournament's top overall seed dispatched 16th-seeded Texas A&M-Corpus Christi 96-75 on Thursday in the opening round even with its best player going scoreless for the first time.Miller, who politely but succinctly responded to questions about anything not related to the game, has been accompanied by a security guard provided by the university after facing threats since his presence at the scene of a fatal shooting was disclosed in court testimony.“It doesn’t bother me,” Miller said of the threats, which he forwards to university officials. “I send it to the right people and they handle it.”Miller came into the game averaging nearly 20 points.The story is well known by many college basketball fans by now. Miller and fellow freshman Jaden Bradley were on the scene in the early-morning hours of Jan. 15 when a 23-year-old woman, Jamea Harris, was shot and killed. The players' then-teammate Darius Miles was charged with capital murder along with another man.According to police testimony, Miller had brought Miles’s gun to the scene. Miller’s attorney said the Tide forward was on his way to pick Miles up when Miles texted asking him to bring the weapon. The attorney, Jim Standridge, said Miller never handled the gun and didn’t know any criminal activity was intended.Miller, coach Nate Oats and the Alabama program have faced a steady barrage of questions since then.The night before Thursday's game, a report published by The New York Times, citing an unidentified person, said a fourth player — freshman walk-on Kai Spears, who hasn’t played this season — was also at the scene of the shooting. The university, Spears and his family have called the report inaccurate and the family has hired an attorney.A New York Times spokeswoman told The Associated Press the newspaper stands by its reporting. Police in Tuscaloosa did not return an email sent Thursday by The AP seeking comment on the report.Miller and Bradley have not missed any playing time, a decision that has brought plenty of scrutiny on Oats and the Crimson Tide.Oats disclosed Wednesday that Miller had received threatening messages.“If you guys saw some of what I’ve seen sent his way, I think you would understand why that’s the case,” Oats said, referring to the security guard provided to Miller. “I don’t want to get into all that. The entire situation, as you know, is just a heartbreaking situation on all accounts.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838221,Slingsby's Aussies hope to spoil Kiwis' homecoming in SailGP,"SailGP brings its high-adrenaline racing to yachting-mad New Zealand for the first time and wouldn’t you know it, the crew from across the Tasman Sea would love to ruin the Kiwis’ party.The penultimate regatta of Season 3 of tech tycoon Larry Ellison’s global league will be sailed in Christchurch on Saturday and Sunday, New Zealand time. Skipper Peter Burling will be looking to get his Kiwi squad back on form to keep alive their chances of racing in the three-boat, $1 million, winner-take-all Grand Final at the season-ending regatta in San Francisco in early May.The Kiwis’ main rivals, skipper Tom Slingsby and two-time defending champion Team Australia, have all but clinched a spot in the Grand Final. About the only thing that could prevent them from going for a third straight $1 million check would be if they caused a collision in any race, which would draw a big points penalty.The Aussies lead the fleet of nine 50-foot foiling catamarans with 76 points, 12 ahead of New Zealand. Just three points separate New Zealand in second and Sir Ben Ainslie’s Emirates Great Britain SailGP Team in fourth, with upstart France in between them, which will put pressure on the Kiwis to perform well this weekend.Slingsby would love to put even more heat on the Kiwis as he steers his 50-foot catamaran, nicknamed the Flying Roo for the yellow kangaroo on the wingsail.“It’s kind of something in an Aussie’s blood where that’s a huge drive for us to come to New Zealand and beat them on their home turf, whether it’s rugby, cricket or sailing,” Slingsby said with a smile at a news conference. ""For sure there’s extra motivation there. Just beating New Zealand at any time and then beating them on their home turf maybe could dent their confidence a little heading into San Francisco. I think it will be very important who beats who in this event between us and New Zealand as we’re probably the top two teams this season and confidence is huge in this sport.”Slingsby, an Olympic gold medalist and former America's Cup champion, said the Aussies were going to discuss whether they should try to match-race the Kiwis down the fleet and hurt them in the standings.“We do have to remember that if we have collisions and stuff we can be knocked out of the final,” Slingsby said. “We’re going to have a talk about it today, who we might want to help into the final, who we might take out of the final. It’s all part of the game. For sure the Kiwis are probably our biggest rival. They’ve won three events this year and have beaten us in those final races multiple times. If Pete was in the same position we are he would be going after us probably.""Burling, the two-time defending America’s Cup champion helmsman and a three-time Olympic medalist, will have plenty of motivation, as well.“We’re just incredibly proud to be racing in front of home fans,” Burling said. “It’s been a long time of us traveling to the other side of the world, racing in some pretty horrendous time zones, if you’re a Kiwi supporter, to watch us live. We’re just super excited for the support we’ve got and we’re looking forward to really putting on an amazing show.”The Kiwis will also get their boat back. After winning in Singapore two regattas ago, New Zealand’s catamaran, nicknamed Amokura, was struck by lightning while being towed back into port and sustained significant damage. The Kiwis were assigned a different boat for the Sydney regatta in mid-February and finished fifth.The Sydney regatta was shortened to one day after a severe storm struck just after the third fleet race finished. High winds smashed the Canadian team’s wingsail as it was being lifted off the boat by a crane and damaged the team’s catamaran as well as other teams’ wingsails that were already in the shed.The SailGP Tech Team and the boatbuilders were able to repair all the damage.“When I first saw the damage, I thought we might shut down for six months,” said New Zealander Russell Coutts, a five-time America’s Cup winner who co-founded SailGP with Ellison. “As we sort of assessed the damage, we realized we could probably get seven boats on the water quickly. As things evolved, with a few miracles, we got all nine teams on the start line for this event.”___Follow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at http://twitter.com/berniewilson___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

(AP) — Oregon will temporarily suspend rebates for buying or leasing an electric vehicle for a year starting in May because too many people are applying and the program is running out of money, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Thursday.A growing number of Oregonians are buying or leasing electric vehicles, with over 60,600 registered in the state.The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality announced Wednesday the suspension of the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that has disbursed more than $71 million over five years to help people buy or lease roughly 25,000 of those vehicles. A fifth of the rebates went to low- and moderate-income households, state data shows.Since the end of 2018, the state has offered two cash rebates for Oregon drivers who buy or lease electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids under $50,000. The standard rebate of up to $2,500 is available regardless of income and can be received at participating dealers. The “charge ahead” rebate of $5,000 is aimed at low- or moderate-income households and must be accessed via a mail-in application. The two rebates can be combined for up to $7,500 cash back.“Even though we’re announcing a temporary suspension, it really shows the program is a victim of our own success,” Rachel Sakata, senior air quality planner with the environmental quality department. “We’re one of the top states in the nation in terms of the percentage of EV sales.”Oregon’s Department of Transportation estimates that people will be driving 1.5 million electric vehicles in the state by 2035.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838224,0 left: March Madness upsets end chase for perfect bracket,"The chase for the perfect March Madness bracket will have to wait another year. Again.In a men's tournament that saw a 2 and a 4 seed lose on Day 1, only a relative handful of brackets were still intact in the biggest contests when 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson took the floor against Purdue. The Knights stunned the top-seeded Boilermakers Friday night, sending the remaining perfect brackets into trash cans everywhere.On the CBS Sports site, 0.0003% of brackets were perfect through the eight early Friday games, according to Jared Shanker, the network’s senior director of digital communications. A few hours later, the network tweeted that “ March is for busted brackets ” in describing the goose egg.Consider that 98.7% of CBS brackets selected Purdue to defeat FDU while just 0.4% picked FDU to reach the Sweet 16. The network said 38.4% had Purdue in the Final Four and 8.8% had the Boilermakers winning the national championship.No perfection for ESPN's Tournament Challenge bracket game, either; only 22 brackets out of more than 20 million filled out were still perfect earlier Friday and they vanished as the games wrapped up.Ditto for NCAA March Madness. None left, out of unspecified millions.Victories by double-digit seeds Princeton, Penn State and Furman on Thursday did particular damage. Only 1.4% of ESPN's brackets had all three teams making it out of the first round, and only 0.1% had them surviving the weekend. Fairleigh Dickinson delivered the final blow.A University of Illinois professor who runs an analytics website said Friday he thinks the transfer portal has hurt some power conference schools in the NCAA Tournament.Changes brought on by an increasingly active portal have diminished the cohesiveness within some marquee programs, said Sheldon Jacobson, who operates the site BracketOdds. Lower-seeded teams from mid-major conferences are more likely to have a core group of players who have been together three or four years.Seven No. 15 seeds have won at least one game over the past 11 years, including each of the last three NCAA Tournaments for the first time. The latest of course, was Princeton over Arizona this week. And No. 13 Furman topped No. 4 Virginia in another big upset — even before FDU ousted Purdue.“So although it looks like, ”Wow, we have these big upsets,′ statistically speaking, it is not that unusual,” Jacobson said. “There’s not much difference between a five, six or seven and a 10, 11 or 12. Surely, the five, six and seven are going to win more often, but not that much more often statistically speaking.”Jacobson said a day of upsets often leads to a predictable set of results the following day. Much of Friday played out that way, until the FDU-Purdue game.Looking ahead to the Final Four, Jacobson said the averages indicate at least one of the teams usually comes from outside the top five seeds in each region. Four No. 8s have reached the Final Four, and five No. 11s have made it.“This data says that, yeah, you want one or two No. 1s,” Jacobson said “You probably want a No. 2 also — sorry, Arizona — but after that, you want anything between a three and 11, and it’s pretty much of a crapshoot.“All the sports pundits say, ‘I can’t imagine any of the ones losing.’ I guarantee they’re going to lose. In fact, I guarantee two of them are going to lose and maybe three before we get to the Final Four.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838232,Big banks create $30B rescue package for First Republic,"Eleven of the biggest U.S. banks Thursday announced a $30 billion rescue package for First Republic Bank in an effort to prevent it from becoming the third to fail in less than a week and head off a broader banking crisis.San Francisco-based First Republic serves a similar clientele as Silicon Valley Bank, which failed last week after depositors withdrew about $40 billion in a matter of hours. New York’s Signature Bank was shuttered on Sunday. It appears that First Republic, which had deposits totaling $176.4 billion as of Dec. 31, was facing similar issues.The group of banks behind the rescue package confirmed that other unnamed banks had seen large withdrawals of uninsured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits up $250,000 for individual accounts.Republic’s shares dropped more than 60% Monday, even after the bank said it had secured additional funding from JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve.The rescue package brought back memories of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks collectively came to the aid of weaker banks in the early days of the crisis. Banks then bought each other in hurried deals in order to keep the crisis from spreading further.The $30 billion in uninsured deposits is seen as a vote of confidence in First Republic, whose banking franchise before the past week was often the envy of the industry. The bank catered to wealthy clients, many of them billionaires, and offered them generous financial terms. The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg got a mortgage through First Republic.First Republic shares had been down as much 36% earlier Thursday, but rallied after reports the rescue package was in the works. The stock closed up 10%.As part of the aid package, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have agreed to each put $5 billion in uninsured deposits into First Republic. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will deposit $2.5 billion each into the bank. The remaining $5 billion would consist of $1 billion contributions from BNY Mellon, State Street, PNC Bank, Truist and US Bank.Notably the banks came to the rescue of one of their competitors, while Silicon Valley Bank failed because its closest and most loyal customers — venture capitalists and start ups — fled the bank at the first sign of trouble.“We are deploying our financial strength and liquidity into the larger system, where it is needed the most,” the banks said.The nation’s banking regulators also issued a statement praising the rescue package.“This show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in a joint statement.The $30 billion bet on First Republic is seen as a bulwark against future bank runs. The shares of many midsized banks were hit hard this week as investors feared depositors would withdraw their cash and run to the nation’s biggest banks.Over the weekend the federal government, determined to restore public confidence in the banking system, moved to protect all the banks’ deposits, even those that exceeded the FDIC’s $250,000 limit per individual account. While the banking crisis started with Silicon Valley Bank, regulators told reporters earlier this week that it became necessary for the government to backstop the banking system because it appeared more runs were possible.",2023/3/17,190,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838244,"New Mexico St report calls for strengthened culture, values","An independent law firm investigating a fatal shooting by a New Mexico State basketball player recommended the school enhance its weapons policy and "" strengthen a culture that encourages student-athletes to adhere to the integrity and values of NMSU at all times.”The school released the report Thursday evening, on the first full day of the NCAA Tournament, an event the Aggies were not eligible for after canceling their season in February.An executive summary of the report did not identify any NCAA violations or failure of the school to meet legal obligations. The summary said the report was restricted by the absence of several witnesses, “including multiple basketball coaches and players,” who refused to cooperate or were unavailable.The report made six recommendations stemming from a Nov. 19 incident in which forward Mike Peake brought a gun on a road trip to Albuquerque, then was seen on video using it to fend off an attacker who was firing his own gun at him.Peake has not been charged with a crime in the shooting of University of New Mexico student Brandon Travis. The shootings came about a month after Peake and Travis had been involved in a melee at a football game on the NMSU campus.Other recommendations in the report called for:—Setting better guidelines on curfew “because so many players on the NMSU basketball team broke curfew on the night of the shooting incident.” Peake was among those who were out after curfew on the night before the Aggies were supposed to play New Mexico.—Considering adopting a more detailed weapons policy. NMSU does not allow weapons on campus or on team trips, but that did not go far enough, according to the report. It said the school should adopt a clear policy prohibiting weapons by any player ""traveling for team events or while engaging in any activity where the student-athlete is representing NMSU. NMSU should train all coaches and student athletes as to the same.""—Creating a specific policy for how coaches and staff should interact with law enforcement when athletes are accused of criminal activity. Investigators had difficulty finding Peake's gun after the shooting and also had difficulty contacting coach Greg Heiar and his assistants. Police had to track down the team bus on Interstate 25 after it left the next morning.—Aiming for better coordination between the school and its stakeholders about how to share information about misconduct and possible discipline of players. The school suspended Peake 16 days after the shooting and has not given an update on his status at the university. The report made no specific recommendations about Peake and a school spokesman told The Associated Press there was no update on Peake's status.The shooting is not what ended New Mexico State's season. Rather, it was separate accusations about hazing that compelled chancellor Dan Arvizu to cancel the season and fire Heiar.In a letter accompanying the executive summary, Arvizu said a task force would be formed to implement the recommendations. He said the school was releasing the executive summary to show its commitment to transparency.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

Lim thanked them all for their support and lamented that he was ""very sad"" to leave this post.He pointed out that many people are concerned that if he does not run for re-election, Constituency V, which includes all of Wanhua District and most of Zhongzheng District, will regress. However, Lim expressed optimism that his decision will ""roll out more potential positives and increase the motivation for progress.""Lim said when he entered politics, he wanted to be a bridge for ""enthusiastic and outstanding young people, so that they had the opportunity to win the support of the people and advance their vision for the country.""

Blinken is the highest-ranking US official to visit the former French colony.""Niger is a young democracy in a challenging part of the world,"" Blinken told a news conference in the capital, Niamey. ""But it remains true to the values we share. Niger has been quick to defend the democratic values under threat in neighboring countries.""Both France and the US maintain troops in Niger to battle insurgencies in the region.Blinken's comments come at a time when Russia has been making inroads in the region. Mali and Burkina Faso have gone through two military coups each since 2020, making the region increasingly volatile. Both neighbors have expelled French troops from their countries and enlisted Russian military assistance amid the violence wreaked by Islamic extremists. Niger, however, has been successful in resisting a recent spate of military coups and Russian mercenaries destabilizing its neighbors.Association with the Russian mercenary group Wagner would not bode well for the two countries, Blinken said at a joint news conference with Niger's Foreign Affairs Minister Hassoumi Massoudou.""It's not just that we know this is going to end badly — we've already seen it,"" Blinken said, reiterating that the Russian mercenary outfit has not led to the desired results in other regions where it has operated. ""We've seen countries find themselves weaker, poorer, more insecure, less independent as a result of the association with Wagner.""Niger's top diplomat added that Wagner's presence was often seen in failed states.""Our hope is that it does not go down this trajectory towards this organisation which we consider criminal and mercenary,"" Massoudou said. ""We see that Wagner is only present in failed or failing states,"" he said.The Niger foreign affairs minister went on to condemn Russia's war in Ukraine — something most African diplomats have refrained from.mk/sms (AFP, AP)",2023/3/17,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838306,Vlahović spoils Freiburg's 'special night',"A single Serbian flag draped over the fence that enveloped the traveling fans in the corner of Europa Park celebrated the matchwinning performance of Juventus striker Dusan Vlahović. That told the story that this was not Freiburg's night; the miracle wasn't to be.The Serbia striker is muscular and direct but had come into this game without a goal in six games. The €70 million signing from Fiorentina thought his moment had come when Bremer's header rattled the bar and his strike partner Moise Kean had teed him up to gobble up the rebound. Wild celebrations ensued on the Juventus bench but they were cut short when replays showed Kean to have been offside.A feisty first half had been heading towards a goalless conclusion until VAR determined the game's turning point. Kean was involved again, angling a shot at goal which Mark Flekken saved well. Federico Gatti met the rebound and his shot was cleared off the line by Matthias Ginter and Freiburg thought they'd got out of jail.But the referee got a message in his ear to instruct him to check the pitchside monitor, which revealed Gatti's shot had come off Manuel Gulde's arm. Gulde had already picked up an avoidable yellow card so two yellows became a red – and Vlahović forced the penalty over the line despite Flekken getting a leg to it.For Freiburg to even be competing in a Europa League last 16 contest with Juventus, albeit a shadow of their previous iterations, is testament to the stunning progress this club from the Black Forest have made under coach Christian Streich, now into his 11th full season in charge.Freiburg didn't look like a team reduced to ten men for the whole of the second half, continuing to apply the pressure on the Bianconeri, before substitute Federico Chiesa extinguished any lingering doubt with Juve's second in injury time.""This was a very special evening,"" Streich said after the game. ""It was a great experience for me personally as well.""This is their third Europa League campaign under the 57-year-old and Freiburg could even make it into the Champions League next season, currently sitting level on points with third placed RB Leipzig and fourth placed Union Berlin in the Bundesliga with 10 games to play.However it wasn't all milk and honey for Streich in the post-game press conference, highlighting the time-wasting tactics used by Juventus in both legs.""At every free kick for us in Turin and at every free kick for us today, a Turin player has taken the ball and wasted time,"" Streich blasted.""I'm completely appalled that you get fouled and then still get penalized twice. I think in Turin and today it was 40 times where someone took the ball."" However, he added that this behavior was not unique to the record Italian record champions and that it happened frequently, ""even in the Bundesliga.""As Juventus languish in seventh in Serie A following a points deduction for false accounting, Freiburg will at least be in the Europa League again next season – maybe even the Champions League. They ultimately came up short in this two-legged contest with Juventus, but the appetite has been whetted for more big European nights. That alone shows how far this club have come.",2023/3/17,,

The Bruins are 51-11-5.“I thought we were a little too loose defensively in the first 40 minutes and I think (Swayman) had to be terrific, and he was terrific,” Boston coach Jim Montgomery said. “That might have been his best game of the year and he’s had a lot of good ones, just for his tracking, his control.“He didn’t let any rebounds out. We gave up some significant opportunities that we usually don’t like to.”Frederic opened the scoring at 50 seconds of the first period with his 15th goal of the season. Zacha added his 18th with 6:38 left in the first. Nosek scored into an empty net with six seconds left for his sixth of the season.Boston killed five Winnipeg power plays.“It’s just our four outworking their five, making sure I saw pucks and clearing out rebounds,” Swayman said. “They did a great job at that.”Connor Hellebuyck stopped 21 shots for the Winnipeg.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838323,Honolulu police officers charged after alleged crash coverup,"HONOLULU (AP) — Honolulu prosecutors on Thursday filed charges against four police officers alleging a cover-up in connection with a high-speed car chase that they say resulted in a crash and a traumatic brain injury to the driver of another car.Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Steve Alm said the charges are the result of an exhaustive investigation and review of the evidence.“These charges demonstrate that it is important to seek justice even when those believed to have committed crimes are the very people we expect to uphold the law,” Alm said in a statement.Prosecutors charged Officer Joshua Nahulu with a felony, saying he drove a vehicle involved in a collision resulting in serious bodily injury and failed to stop at the scene. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.The prosecutor's office charged Officers Erik Smith, Jake Bartolome and Robert Lewis each with one felony count for hindering prosecution and another felony count for conspiracy. The first charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, the second by up to one year.Rick Sing, an attorney for Nahulu, declined to comment. Court records did not list attorneys for the other defendants.The police officer's union, the State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.Court documents allege the events occurred in the early hours of Sept. 12, 2021. The four officers were dispatched to respond to a noise complaint at a Waianae beach park at 3:30 a.m. when they saw a white Honda exit the parking lot to Farrington Highway.A civil lawsuit filed against the city and several officers last year by Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati and representatives of his passengers alleges Nahulu, Smith and Bartolome separately chased the Honda at high speeds using two marked Honolulu Police Department vehicles and one vehicle subsidized by police.The lawsuit alleges the officers never commanded Perkins-Sinapati to stop during their pursuit nor did they turn on their blue lights and sirens. The lawsuit says the chase continued until the Honda “left the roadway and crashed, causing serious, life-threatening injuries.”Nahulu, Smith and Bartolome drove past the crash scene without stopping and the trio then met with Lewis at nearby Waianae Intermediate School, prosecutors allege in court documents.From the school, Smith, Bartolome and Lewis were dispatched to the crash site. But when they arrived, they claimed to have no prior knowledge of what led to the collision, the charging documents say.The lawsuit filed seeks unspecified damages.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838324,Stalock's 35 saves lead Blackhawks over Predators 2-1,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Alex Stalock made 35 saves to lead the Chicago Blackhawks over the Nashville Predators 2-1 on Thursday night.Lukas Reichel and Joey Anderson scored for Chicago, which has won two straight.Roman Josi scored late and Juuse Saros stopped 19 shots for Nashville, which had its three-game winning streak snapped. The Predators trail Winnipeg by four points in the race for the Western Conference’s second wild-card berth. Nashville has played three fewer games than the Jets.“It seemed tonight like we didn’t have the energy, the normal energy and competitiveness that we’ve been playing with, and execution,” Predators coach John Hynes said.Reichel was credited with the game’s first goal with 47 seconds remaining in the opening period.The Blackhawks entered the Nashville zone on a 2-on-1 break. On the left side, Reichel’s pass attempt was blocked by the stick of sliding Predators defenseman Dante Fabbro. The puck deflected off Fabbro’s stick and on net. Saros stopped it, but Fabbro’s momentum caused him to crash into Saros and knock both the goaltender and the puck into the net in the process.“The goal was a little lucky,” Reichel said. “It could be a nicer goal, but it doesn’t matter how.”Stalock denied Matt Duchene on a penalty shot at 13:40 of the second period. Duchene fumbled the puck and did not get much on a wrist shot that was easily turned aside by Stalock.“He ended up fumbling it, which was a big bonus for me,” Stalock said.The penalty shot was awarded when Stalock was whistled for throwing his stick as Nashville’s Rasmus Asplund stickhandled behind the Chicago net.“He was all alone in front so I had to be aggressive on him,” Stalock said. “He ended up going behind the net and (I’m) kind of down and out. It was a poke check and obviously it slips out of (my) hand, so it’s an automatic call.”Stalock’s best save of the game came at 11:15 of the first, when he denied Philip Tomasino on a breakaway. Tomasino tried to snap a wrist shot between Stalock’s pads, but the goaltender was able to squeeze them together just in time.Anderson added an insurance goal at 8:01 of the third off an assist from Boris Katchouk, who has four points in his last two games.Josi spoiled Stalock’s shutout bid with 24.5 seconds remaining and Saros pulled for an extra skater.“Most definitely a disappointing loss,” Josi said. “It felt like it just wasn’t our best game. We just didn’t generate enough.”STREAK HALTEDNashville had earned at least one in 16 straight games against Chicago, going 13-0-3 during that span.

They hadn't finished above .500 since going 44-38 in 2005-06, the last of eight consecutive playoff appearances under Rick Adelman.The Kings have had a losing record in the other 29 seasons since moving to Sacramento but are in good shape to end the NBA's longest current postseason drought in their first season under Mike Brown.“I think being here for over four years now, and seeing the bottom — the very bottom — and to see the frustration of fans and the people in the organization, I think it’s nice to be on the other side it,” veteran Harrison Barnes said. ""A lot of people, they don’t get a chance to stay in an organization long enough to see the good times and the bad, they just see the bad side. So I consider myself fortunate to be able to be part of this moment.”The Kings improved to 10-2 since the All-Star break by turning to their defense on a night their usually potent offense stalled while playing on the second night of a back-to-back. They won Wednesday in Chicago when Fox's 3-pointer gave them a 117-114 victory.Sacramento held Brooklyn without any second-chance points and just two fast-break points with some defensive possessions that Brown said were among the best he'd seen all season.“And to see that again in this situation, a back-to-back, was really, really encouraging,” Brown said, “because we’re going to have to win games like this come playoff time.”Yes, it's safe to talk playoffs again in California's capital.Sabonis had 20 points by halftime and the Kings led by as much as 17, but the Nets made it close.Mikal Bridges scored 23 points for the Nets, who fell 1 1/2 games behind the New York Knicks for fifth place in the Eastern Conference and are just 1 1/2 ahead of seventh-place Miami as they try to avoid the play-in tournament.Spencer Dinwiddie added 18 points and Nic Claxton had 14 points and 14 rebounds for the Nets, back in Brooklyn after going 3-2 on their road trip and hoping to capitalize on a home-heavy schedule the rest of the way. Nine of their remaining 12 games are at Barclays Center.It was tied at 41 with under 3 1/2 minutes remaining in the first half before Sabonis converted a three-point play. That kicked off a 13-0 finish for the Kings, with Fox's jumper making it 54-41 at the break.“They were just playing harder and getting stops and they were just scoring, getting to the line,” Bridges said. “But yeah, they just played harder than us.”A three-point play by Barnes followed by a 3-pointer from Fox pushed it to 60-43, but the Nets would recover with a 10-0 spurt later in the third to trim it to six points. Sacramento went on to take an 82-71 advantage to the fourth.TIP-INSKings: Kevin Huerter was scoreless in six minutes before leaving with a right leg injury. He came up limping after missing a shot in the first quarter and will have an MRI exam Friday. ... Sabonis was the first player in the NBA this season with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in the first half. He had five assists, falling short of a third straight triple-double.Nets: Brooklyn is 19-13 at home. The Nets were trying to join Milwaukee and Boston as the only teams with 20 wins at home and on the road.STILL SEE SIMMONS?Ben Simmons has sat out all 12 games since the All-Star break with left knee and back soreness, but Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said the expectation remains that he will play again this season. Vaughn said the 2016 No. 1 pick was doing some work on the court and hadn't had any setbacks, but there was no timetable for his return. “So we want him back to hoop, he wants to be back to hoop and that is definitely the goal,” Vaughn said.UP NEXTKings: At Washington on Saturday.Nets: Host Denver on Sunday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

The prime contractor will be Arizona-based Raytheon Missiles and Defense.“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States,” the State Department said in a statement. “Australia is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.”Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said his country would be working closely with the U.S.“Making sure we have longer-range strike missiles is a really important capability for the country,"" Marles told Channel Nine. ""It enables us to be able to reach out beyond our shores further, and that’s ultimately how we are able to keep Australia safe.”Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy said the missiles could be fired from the Virginia-class submarines Australia would be buying under the so-called AUKUS deal.“We certainly want the best possible capability for the Australian Defense Force, so that includes the ability to strike opponents as far away as possible from the Australian mainland,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. “The cruise missiles are a critical part of that, as are the submarines that launch them.”The submarine deal has raised concerns that it could clear the way for bad actors to escape nuclear oversight in the future. Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, this week pledged to be “very demanding” in overseeing the planned transfer from the U.S. to Australia.Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating this week launched a blistering attack on his nation's plans, saying that because of the huge cost, “it must be the worst deal in all history.”Australian officials have estimated the cost of the submarines at between 268 billion and 368 billion Australian dollars ($178-$245 billion) over three decades.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government had been transparent about the expense.“The assessment that has to be made is does the purchase, and then us building our own nuclear-powered submarines, increase the capacity for us to defend ourselves by more than 10%? You bet it does,"" Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""That’s why it represents good value.”___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/3/17,,World

Texas will play 10th-seeded Penn State in the second round on Saturday in the Midwest Region.“We’re fortunate to get a real game the first game of the tournament. Colgate is an elite, legit team. We won by 20, but it felt like we really won by five or seven,” said Timmy Allen, who returned from a leg injury that kept him out of the Big 12 Tournament.In another inspired performance under interim coach Rodney Terry, his first NCAA Tournament win as a head coach, Rice and the Longhorns picked the perfect time to get hot on the perimeter against the nation's leading outside shooting team. They matched their season best for 3-pointers made.“I just feel every single guy that walked on the court today had a game plan,” Carr said. “The coaches had us prepared, and we executed.”The Raiders (26-9) went just 3 for 15 from deep against a relentless and long-armed Longhorns defense. Colgate shot better than 40% before the tournament. The leading individual 3-point shooter in the country, Oliver Lynch-Daniels, went 1 for 4. He was a 50% shooter from long range this season.“They could beat us with 3s, but they were going to have a hard time beating us with 2s,” Terry said.Keegan Records and Ryan Moffatt each scored 13 points for the 15th-seeded Raiders, who have not won an NCAA Tournament game in six appearances. Tucker Richardson, the Patriot League Player of the Year, had nine points on 4-for-11 shooting.“Especially those guards when they've got Rice in there as a third guard, they’re just really quick,"" Richardson said. “It’s kind of hard for us to get open.”With most of the fans in Wells Fargo Arena rooting for the upset, the Longhorns adjusted to Colgate's second-half zone defense and never let the lead get smaller than seven points.About an hour before Texas took the court, No. 2 seed Arizona was ousted by Princeton in the West Region. The Tigers became the 11th team seeded 15th to win a first-round game in 149 tries and the third in three years.The Longhorns played hard enough — and shot well enough — to make sure they didn't land on that list.After driving hard toward the block, Carr kicked the ball back out to the top of the key to set up Rice’s fourth 3-pointer for a 29-17 lead. As the calm and deliberate Rice flashed a sheepish smile, Carr gave him an exaggerated hand slap as he jumped up and down on the retreat for defense.Rice, the lanky super sub and graduate transfer from New Mexico State who is aiming to play in the Final Four in his native Houston, went 8 for 14 from the field.“He’s as good of an overall basketball player as I’ve seen all year — his intelligence, his IQ, his poise, his defense, his recognition of his teammates, but his ability to step up,” Colgate coach Matt Langel said.The Longhorns have come a long way since coach Chris Beard was arrested on a later-dropped domestic violence charge and fired soon after that.They hit the NCAA Tournament in stride under Terry’s even-keeled guidance with two decisive wins over Kansas, the regular-season Big 12 champion and No. 1 seed in the West Region, that included the conference championship.These Longhorns have a strong bond that has carried them to the verge of a trip to the tournament’s second weekend for the first time since 2008. The last Final Four for Texas was in 2003, when Terry was an assistant under coach Rick Barnes.“I think we prepare really well, better than a lot of teams in the country,” Rice said. “I think we’re really locked into the details and locked into the things that we have to do to win.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

Kreider then scored his 30th of the season into empty net at 19:10 to seal the win and give the third-place Rangers a 10-point lead over Pittsburgh in the Metropolitan Division.“That was a tight game, good hockey,'' said Kreider, whose 259 career goals leave him three behind Vic Hadfield for fifth on the all-time Rangers list. ”We wanted to get behind their defense and establish the forecheck.

Akira Schmid made 21 saves in his 12th start this season.“I thought he gave us a strong game,” Devils coach Lindy Ruff said of his backup netminder.Colton, a New Jersey native playing in his home state, scored his 16th goal of the year 1:09 into the game to give the Lightning a 1-0 lead.The Devils broke through midway through the second period when Nico Hischier found Tatar with a cross-ice pass, and Tatar scored his 16th goal to it at 1.Shortly after fending off a two-man advantage during a power play, Tampa Bay took a 2-1 lead 18:11 into the second period when Stamkos scored his 28th goal.“It’s definitely tough not capitalizing on the 5-on-3 and then it goes back in your throat and they score, it definitely hurts, but that’s why it’s even better that we stuck with it,” Meier said. “We didn’t put our heads down. We kept going and we gave ourselves a chance.”Meier scored his 33rd goal of the season on the rebound to tie it again midway through the third period.Stamkos answered with another go-ahead goal 15:13 into the third.

Buddy Hield scored 20 and T.J. McConnell 19, while George HIll and Jordan Nwora added 15 and 12, respectively, against their former team.“There was a good togetherness about us in the second half,” Nembhard said. “We put up a good fight, and showed good aggression. It was like we had nothing to lose in this moment. It was good for the team to do that and a big win for us.”Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 25 points. Jrue Holiday added 19 and Khris Middleton finished with 16 for Milwaukee (50-20), which shot 52.8%, went 11 for 32 from beyond the arc and gave up 13 points off 12 turnovers.The Bucks hit 18 of their first 29 shots, including 4 of 9 from 3-point distance to take a 40-30 lead after one period. The Bucks missed five of their first six shots to open the second as Indiana closed within five points, helped by an 8-0 run that was capped off by back-to-back 3-pointers from Hill.The Bucks recovered and took a 64-55 lead into the break.Another 8-0 run, this time with back-to-back 3’s by Nesmith, pulled the Pacers within four points with 4:08 left in the third.Nesmith fouled Bobby Portis with 3:15 left in the quarter, putting the Bucks in the bonus. Portis and Joe Ingles each knocked down a pair of free throws to stretch the lead to nine. Indiana stayed within striking distance with its 3-point shooting and after Hill turned a Wesley Matthews turnover into an easy layup, Nwora drained a 3 to put the Pacers up 102-101 with a minute to play.McConnell’s jumper with 26 seconds left put Indiana up three points and an 11-4 run to open the fourth gave the Pacers a 112-105 lead with 10:27 remaining.“They played well tonight, particularly in the second half.,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “They made a lot of 3s, got out in transition. There were a lot of areas where we needed to be better, but a ton of credit to the Pacers tonight.Nesmith’s sixth 3-pointer of the game made it a 122-111 game with 7:08 left and the Pacers never looked back.“It was not a great first half but that was really a special second half,” Carlisle said. “Just in terms of understanding how we needed to play and what it would take to have a chance to get a win here.""This was our franchise’s first-ever win in this building so to have an opportunity to break through with some of our younger players was special.

Johnson stayed down briefly, writhing in pain, before heading to the bench to get checked out. He played in the second half.“I was just scared,” Johnson said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838340,"Hong Kong's Mirror launches English song, revives Cantopop","HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s most popular boy band Mirror, a major driving force behind the revival of the local pop music scene, launched its first English song on Friday, hoping to bring the city’s tunes to music lovers globally.The 12-member group is part of a new wave of local singers being embraced by Hong Kongers at a time when the city has been beset by the COVID-19 pandemic and political challenges over the past three years. Their music has birthed a new generation of fans who have found hope and comfort in the songs at an uncertain time.Its new single “Rumours"" is somewhat “sexy” and “sensual” and accompanied by wavy dance moves, a stark contrast to the group's previous powerful dance songs and funky music, its members said in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday. Unlike their earlier Cantonese hits that conveyed an image of ""a bunch of kids” and their energetic side, the new track shows they have become men, member Ian Chan said.“We are not trying to particularly target any markets, but then we kinda wanna show the possibility of what a boy band from Hong Kong can bring to everyone,” Chan said. “Hopefully, we can bring ourselves and bring Cantopop to more places.”Mirror's global debut is not only a test of whether they can find an audience beyond Hong Kong, a market with 7 million people. The overseas reception may also indicate whether Hong Kong singers, who dominated Asian showbiz decades ago, can regain ground in the region.Cantopop, sung in the mother tongue of most of Hong Kong's population, has made a strong comeback with new idols and diverse genres after falling behind Mandopop and K-pop for years. Local fans find the new stars more relatable, unlike their predecessors who are often seen as pre-packaged and in some cases too beholden to mainland China. Cantopop's rise reflects a wider hunger to express the city's cultural identity.Mirror's members broke into the industry after joining a local broadcaster's reality talent contest in 2018 and stealing the show. The artists — Frankie Chan, Alton Wong, Lokman Yeung, Stanley Yau, Anson Kong, Jer Lau, Anson Lo, Jeremy Lee, Edan Lui, Keung To, Tiger Yau and Chan — range in age from their 20s to early 30s. Some are good at singing, several are known for their dancing skills, a few have devoted themselves to acting and others have hosted TV shows.Their hard work and determination have helped them to attract a loyal following, especially students, middle-aged women and young families.In 2021, Keung declared: “I believe Hong Kong singers can definitely become Asia’s top again.” That year, their fandom became a Hong Kong cultural phenomenon.Fans poured into shopping malls to support their events, with some making and buying advertisements to celebrate their idols' birthdays. Partners of fans flooded Facebook with “self-pity” stories, including having the walls of their homes plastered with posters of the singers. Talk of the group offered many Hong Kongers an escape from downbeat news about COVID-19, political challenges and social changes facing the city.“We always have a social responsibility to bring positive thinking and some good vibes ... to people who like us,” Chan said.But a harrowing incident last July dealt a heavy blow to their rise.A giant video screen fell from the ceiling during a concert and struck two backup dancers, leaving one of them, Mo Li, severely injured. The band subsequently stopped their public appearances for two months. Hong Kong authorities have charged workers from the concert's principal contractor alleged to be responsible for the accident. Last month, Li's father said his son had taken his first steps with the help of an exoskeleton device.“We will never say that we already got through it,” said Lui, adding it was a “huge lesson.” It taught them to cherish every moment, Stanley Yau said.While Mirror works to shake off that tragedy, it has also been battered by criticism of lackluster performances, with some critics accusing the members of chasing money from advertisements rather than focusing on their singing and dancing.Lo said the group is trying to slow down its schedule to strike a better balance and the members now gather at least once or twice a month for activities such as meetings or dance lessons — a significant change as they seldom met each other outside work in the past, he said.The release of “Rumours,” whose lyrics are about chasing a girl and how rumors arise, has marked an important milestone for the group, especially since the members are all native Cantonese singers.English pronunciation was a major challenge, Lui said, and they were all coached one-on-one during the recording sessions.Lo said the group will monitor audiences' reactions closely but that they will no doubt continue producing music in Cantonese even as some members might produce solo songs in Mandarin. The group also has plans to launch a worldwide tour possibly next year, he said.Lui said their ambition of reviving Cantopop as Asia's No. 1 music might sound “like daydreaming.”“But I think we should have that goal inside our hearts and we should try to do our best to pursue this dream,"" he said.",2023/3/17,457,World

The legislator said Chinese officials agreed to allow the soldier's family members to visit him and that she would accompany them on their trip.However, the legislator said that she was informed that the soldier does not want to return to Taiwan. She added that his family members have been notified that he is safe, but have not yet had direct communication with him.According to the legislator, the soldier's father is not from Kinmen and therefore cannot take the Little Three Links and will have to take the larger Three Links route instead. According to regulations, because the soldier has failed to return to his post for more than six days, he is now categorized as a deserter.The lawmaker was cited by Mirror Media as saying the soldier deserted his unit because he was ""under some personal pressure."" However, she emphasized that it was not caused by military discipline issues and called on young people to ""bear pressure bravely.""Chinese state-run media outlet Hong Kong China News Agency claimed the soldier has been ""eating well, sleeping well, and everything is fine."" He also reportedly told his family members not to worry.",2023/3/17,4342,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838343,Sasser hurt anew as top seed Houston beats Northern Kentucky,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — With All-American Marcus Sasser watching from the bench, top-seeded Houston shook off Northern Kentucky for a 63-52 victory to open the NCAA Tournament on Thursday night.Chants of “NKU!” and “Overrated!” filled Legacy Arena as the 16th-seeded Norse trailed by only three at halftime and made it 36-all with under 16 minutes to go against the Cougars (32-3).But Houston pulled away behind 16 points from Jarace Walker, advancing to face ninth-seeded Auburn on Saturday.“I don't coach Northern Kentucky, but I was proud of their team tonight,” Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. “They fought. Their kids are tough. They're smart.”Now, all eyes turn to Sasser, Houston's top scorer and its first member of The Associated Press All-America first team since 1984.After going down last weekend with a groin injury in the American Athletic Conference Tournament, Sasser was a game-time decision for the start of the NCAA Midwest Region.He got the start and looked just fine when he knocked down an early 3-pointer. But Sasser didn't do much else, finishing with five points on 2-of-5 shooting in just under 14 minutes of playing time.When the second half began, Sasser wasn't on the court. The school announced he had aggravated his groin problem, forcing him to watch the rest of the game from the bench.“He said it felt funny,” Sampson said. “So he shut it down, which is the right thing to do.”Sampson also revealed that guard Jamal Shead is bothered by a sore knee, thought he managed to play more than 36 minutes. Shead chipped in with 13 points and six assists.“We've got to see how many healthy bodies we have right now,” Sampson said. “That's probably our most important thing.”The Cougars got by without Sasser on this night.The Norse's upset bid went down in a hail of clankers, the Horizon League champions shooting just 27.5% from the field (19 of 69) — including a horrendous 5 of 34 from 3-point range — to ruin any chance of becoming the next UMBC.The Retrievers remain the only 16th seed in NCAA history to knock off a No. 1 seed, shocking Virginia in 2018.“I’m unbelievably proud of our team, the fight that we showed,” coach Darrin Horn said. “I don’t think it’s a stretch to say we outplayed Houston tonight. We just didn’t make enough shots.”Sam Vinson led the Norse (22-13) with 15 points, though he made just 1 of 8 from beyond the arc.“It was frustrating a little bit, but we don’t think about that during the game,” Vinson said. “The coaches keep saying, ‘Shoot the ball, shoot the ball.'”The Cougars avoided UMBC's fate but things figure to get much tougher in the next one, especially if Sasser can't go.Auburn knocked off No. 8 seed Iowa 83-75 and will have another de facto home game in the second round, playing just a two-hour drive from its campus.“Good for them,” Sampson said. “It's a great break.”The Cougars struggled offensively against Northern Kentucky's matchup zone, which was unlike any defense they had seen this season. Houston led just 30-27 at halftime and finished well under its 75-point average coming into the game.Sampson and his players also conceded to a lack of toughness.“They were more aggressive,” said J'Wan Roberts, who had 11 points and 12 rebounds. “It felt like they wanted it more. We've got to learn from that and get better.”BIG PICTURENorthern Kentucky: The Norse have yet to win three NCAA Tournament appearances, losing as a 14th, 15th and now 16th seed.Houston: The Cougars hardly looked like a national championship contender, and Sasser's health makes a title run look even more tenuous.UP NEXTThe Cougars will be playing Auburn for the first time since Dec. 8, 1982, when Houston's “Phi Slama Jama” powerhouse featuring Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler prevailed 77-65 against the Charles Barkley-led Tigers. Overall, the teams have met just seven times, with the Cougars winning six. Auburn's lone victory in the series came in 1962.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838344,Roach leads Duke in rout of Oral Roberts in NCAA opener,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Jeremy Roach matched his career high with 23 points, and No. 5 seed Duke beat Oral Roberts 74-51 on Thursday night in the school’s first NCAA Tournament game since Jon Scheyer took over as Blue Devils coach.Dariq Whitehead added 13 points for the Blue Devils (27-8), winners of the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament. Roach has now scored 23 points in back-to-back games after setting his career high in the ACC championship game.Scheyer helped Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski win two of five national titles as a former Duke player and assistant. He's now trying to orchestrate some March Madness magic of his own.In his first NCAA Tournament game as Krzyzewski's replacement, Scheyer led Duke to a 10th consecutive win and a second-round matchup in the East Region against fourth-seeded Tennessee (24-10), a 58-55 winner over Louisiana-Lafayette.Krzyzewski lost his first NCAA Tournament game then led the Blue Devils to the Final Four 13 times.Scheyer smiled but cut short any comparisons.“Let's not go down that road,” Scheyer said. “He's done everything you could do. I’m not going down that road.”Oral Roberts (30-5) entered the tournament on a nation-leading 17-game winning streak but was unable to replicate its success of two years ago, when the Golden Eagles upset Ohio State and Florida during a surprising run to the Sweet 16.“Wrong night to have a bad night. A lot of credit goes to Duke. They’re obviously really good,” Oral Roberts coach Paul Mills said. “Walking over here, they offered us Duke Blue Devil colored Powerade, so it’s kind of an indication of how much it wasn’t our night.”Duke scored the first 15 points of the game and Oral Roberts missed 12 straight shots — seven were 3-point attempts — during a 12-minute scoring drought to begin the game. Duke's advantage was never fewer than 13 the rest of the way.Depleted by injuries for prolonged stretches of the season, Duke improved to 19-1 when Scheyer has his full roster available. While the Blue Devils have excelled defensively all year, their offense has blossomed down the stretch.That figures to makes them a very dangerous team moving forward.Roach made 9 of 17 shots from field and all four of his free throws. Dereck Lively II had 12 rebounds and paced Duke's defense with six blocked shots, a freshman record for the NCAA Tournament.Scheyer praised Roach, who has stepped up for Duke with the season on the line.“Jeremy has been on a tear. For me, it’s more just his mindset. I think the scoring, the play making comes with it. He’s never rattled,” Scheyer said. “He’s playing both sides of the ball. He played 36 minutes, and defensively he did a great job.”Summit League player of the year Max Abmas was limited to 12 points on 4-for-15 shooting for Oral Roberts. The high-scoring Golden Eagles shot just 30.2% from the field, including 8 of 32 from 3-point range.FINAL GAME?Abmas, who averaged 22.2 points per game, is a senior. He said he hasn't made a decision on whether he'll return for a fifth year at Oral Roberts.“I’m just in the moment right now and enjoying every part of the season we just had,” he said. “We’ll look at the future later.”UP NEXTOral Roberts: Abmas and three other starters are seniors, which means the Golden Eagles could have a new look if any of them decide to not return next season.“The good news for me right now is I can get them all back. They all have eligibility to return,” Mills said. “I’m not telling you that they will, but what I am telling you is that we have a group that is very invested in getting better as players. I do feel that we’re building something here that hopefully can get to a Final Four.”Duke: The Blue Devils are a year removed from their 17th Final Four appearance overall. The way they’re playing, another deep tournament run isn’t out of the question.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838346,Tennessee holds off Louisiana-Lafayette 58-55 in NCAA opener,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — When shots stopped falling and an 18-point lead nearly slipped away, Tennessee did the one thing it does best: clamp down on defense.Tyreke Key scored 12 points, Jahmai Mashack added 11 and the fourth-seeded Volunteers withstood a late scare to hold off Louisiana-Lafayette 58-55 in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday night.The Ragin’ Cajuns (26-8) whittled an 18-point deficit to three in the final minute — creating some tense moments that included a couple of technical fouls — but the Volunteers (24-10) closed it out by forcing tough shots and making just enough free throws.“It's not always pretty on the offensive end for us, but we'll find a way,” coach Rick Barnes said.Tennessee, which lost six of 10 heading into the tournament, advanced to face fifth-seeded Duke in the East Region’s second round at the Amway Center. The Blue Devils routed No. 12 seed Oral Roberts 74-51 earlier Thursday, giving Duke coach Jon Scheyer a win in his tournament debut.It will be the first meeting between Tennessee and Duke in the NCAA Tournament.The Vols should hope to take much better care of the ball than they did against the Sun Belt Conference Tournament champions. They finished with 18 turnovers in the fourth game without starting point guard Zakai Zeigler, who tore a ligament in his left knee in the team’s regular-season finale. Zeigler led the Southeastern Conference with 6.5 assists a game.“We can't turn the ball over the way we did, and our guys know that,” Barnes said.Tennessee made up for it on the other end, holding Louisiana to 40% shooting and forcing 14 turnovers.“Give them credit. They're one of the best defensive teams in the country,” ULL coach Bob Marlin said.Barnes and Marlin had a relatively lengthy handshake after the game, discussing what happened to create a couple of testy moments during late timeouts. Both benches were hit with technical fouls, and Marlin had to be restrained.It probably should have been somewhat expected from a game that was a defensive grind.Louisiana-Lafayette trailed 48-30 in the second half before rallying to cut it to 50-45. The Ragin’ Cajuns made six of seven field goals over a nearly-five-minute span to surely make Tennessee nervous. Kobe Julien was the catalyst for the comeback, scoring 13 points in the second half.But every time ULL made it a one-score game, Tennessee either answered or forced an errant shot.Uros Plavsic added nine points, and Oliver Nkamhoua chipped in with eight for Tennessee.Jordan Brown led the Ragin’ Cajuns with 16 points. He carried Louisiana early, scoring 12 of the team’s 19 points in the first half. His jumper in the paint tied the game at 19 with 4:43 remaining, but then the Ragin’ Cajuns went ice cold.Tennessee swarmed him in the second half, often sending three defenders his way when he touched the ball. It worked: he scored just four points after halftime.The Vols took control early with an 11-0 run to close the first half. They hit five of six shots while holding Louisiana-Lafayette scoreless for nearly five minutes. Plavsic’s tip-in just before the buzzer was the capper.Despite UT’s late surge, it was an otherwise ugly opening 20 minutes. The teams combined for more turnovers (20) than field goals (19) and nearly as many steals (13) as assists (14).It was much prettier in the end for Tennessee.BIG PICTURELouisiana-Lafayette: The Ragin’ Cajuns fell to 1-7 in the NCAA Tournament, with their lone win coming against fourth-seeded Oklahoma in 1992. But longtime coach Marlin could have the foundation for another run in 2024, considering he has 10 underclassmen on his roster.Tennessee: Barnes has the Vols in the tournament for the fifth time in eight years. Only Kentucky (31) and Florida (19) in the Southeastern Conference have more NCAA Tournament wins than Tennessee (11) since 2010.UP NEXTLouisiana-Lafayette needs to make sure Brown, a 6-foot-11 forward, returns for his senior season. Brown averaged 19.4 points and 8.7 rebounds this season.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838378,"Santos refuses to quit, brazenly says 'truth still matters'","WASHINGTON (AP) — Besieged Republican Rep. George Santos arrives on the House floor most days to deliver short speeches — celebrating women-owned small businesses, a special high school in his district or raising concern about various countries in crises.At other times he can be seen dashing through the halls of the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers do, from one meeting to the next. He once passed out doughnuts to the press corps staking out his office.Far from being chastened by the widespread criticism, mockery and rejection that Santos has received after having admitted to fabricating many aspects of his life story, the newly elected congressman is breezily carrying on in Congress. He is refusing calls for his resignation all while rewriting the narrative in real time.For Santos, it’s an unusual up-is-down approach that would have been almost unthinkable in an earlier generation but one that signals the new norms taking hold amid the deepening of a post-truth era in Congress.""I was elected by the people to come here to represent them, and I do that every day,” Santos told The Associated Press in a brief interview off the House floor.“It’s a hard job. If I said it was easy, I’d be lying to you — and I don’t think that’s what we want, right?”Pressed about the idea of a post-truth era, Santos said, “I think truth still matters very much.""Perhaps not since Donald Trump launched his presidency with exaggerated claims of the crowd size at his inauguration has an elected official arrived in Washington and sought so brazenly and defiantly to convince the public of reality different than the one before their very eyes.Santos is coming of political age at a time of an unmooring in civic life, when a duly-sworn member of the U.S. Congress can persevere, business as usual, despite having admittedly lied to voters about his resume, experience and personal life as he ran for elected office.While Santos faces a crush of investigations — by the House Ethics Committee and a county prosecutor in New York — as well as questions from earlier charges in Brazil, where he lived for a time, he appears unmoved by the challenges.Just a few days ago, Santos filed paperwork to potentially seek reelection.“It used to be that when a politician lied, and they got caught, they were ashamed — or there was some sort of accountability,” said Lee McIntyre, the author of “Post-Truth” and a research fellow at Boston University.“What I see in the post-truth era is not just that people are lying or lying more, it’s that they’re lying with a political purpose,” he said. “The really scary part is getting away with it.""At stake is not just “truthiness,” as comedian Stephen Colbert once called falsehoods in public life, but broader questions over the expectation of truth-telling from political leadership.Santos has admitted he had portrayed himself as someone he was not — not a college graduate, not a Wall Street whiz, not from a Jewish family of Holocaust survivors, not the son who lost his mother in the 9/11 World Trade Center attack.In the time since, more questions have flowed, including about the origins of a $700,000 loan he made to his campaign for Congress and his own reported wealth.Fellow Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito of New York, a freshman who won election last fall from the neighboring Long Island district, said: “I don’t think it’s the state of politics. I think it’s state of an individual — and the state that he’s in is one of delusion.”D'Esposito has introduced a pair of bills that would prevent elected officials from profiting off wrongdoing and said he is working with others to ensure Santos is not “the face of our party. We’ve made it very clear. He’s not our brand. He’s not part of us.”While Santos did remove himself from his committee assignments while the investigations are underway, he has withstood the pressure from Republicans to resign and from Democrats to be expelled from office.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who won a slim Republican majority with just a few seats to spare, has said the voters elected Santos and “he has a right to serve.” If wrongdoing is found, Santos could be removed from office, he said.“He should have resigned a long time ago,” said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the Democratic president of the freshman class who sponsored the resolution to expel Santos.“This is not just Democrats saying this and his Republican colleagues in New York,” Garcia said in an interview. “Nobody wants him in D.C.”But Santos appears emboldened as his profile has risen, even being parodied on “Saturday Night Live.” He has introduced his own bills in Congress — including one to require cognitive tests for presidents — and is trying to move on.“I’ve owned up to it, and I came clean on it,” he said referring to the public apologies he made in December.When President Joe Biden arrived to deliver the State of the Union address last month, Santos infuriated colleagues by situating himself on the center aisle — the place to see and be seen greeting the high-profile guests. He was scolded by fellow Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, who said it was improper for Santos to be “parading in front of the president"" and others.“Senator Romney just echoed something I heard my entire life, right, coming from a minority group, coming from a poor family: Go to the back room and shut up. Nobody cares to hear about you,"" Santos recalled. “Well, I’m not going to do that.”Santos often turns the tables, engaging in the whataboutism that has become commonplace in modern politics — the verbal somersault of equating one's actions with those of others, even when they are not quite comparable situations.“You know,"" Santos said, ""have you ever not told a lie?

(AP) — Jaime Jaquez Jr. scored 17 points and UCLA raced out to a fast start and never looked back for an 86-53 victory over UNC Asheville in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday night.The second-seeded Bruins (30-5) scored the first 14 points of the game and rolled from there. Amari Bailey also had 17 points and David Singleton scored 11 as UCLA bounced back from a close loss to Arizona in the Pac-12 title game.“We don’t take losing well at UCLA,"" coach Mick Cronin said. “We spell fun, W-I-N. We lost our last game. These guys took it personal. You saw how they came out tonight. Our defensive intensity and our deflections early in the game I think really rattled them. They could never really get comfortable.”UCLA advanced to play seventh-seeded Northwestern in the second round of the West Region. The Wildcats beat Boise State 75-67 earlier in the day.Drew Pember had 13 points for the 15th-seeded Bulldogs (27-8). UNC Asheville, which won the Big South regular-season and tournament titles, has lost all five times the school has advanced to the round of 64.""I give them a ton of credit,"" coach Mike Morrell said. “They were the aggressors early, and they took it to us. You've got to give them credit for that because they were not going to be caught sleeping. I thought they were really good defensively. They just kind of really pushed us around all over the floor.”The Bruins apparently took notice of what happened earlier in the day at this site when fellow Pac-12 No. 2 seed Arizona was ousted by Princeton 59-55.UCLA made sure this game was never in doubt, making its first five shots and taking a 14-0 lead on a 3-pointer by Singleton just 3:06 into the game.“It’s like the first day and there’s already so many upsets,” point guard Tyger Campbell said. “It just makes us lock in more because we know it’s possible. Especially earlier today, Princeton and Arizona. I think it made us come out and just understand that, you know, every team in this tournament can play.”Jaquez scored inside to give the Bruins their biggest lead of the first half at 34-11 and they coasted from there.The Bruins dominated in the paint thanks in part to Kenneth Nwuba and Mac Etienne combining to go 9 for 9 from the floor against the smaller Bulldogs.“That’s what you've got to do in games like that,” Cronin said. “If you don’t, if your size and athleticism isn’t a factor, then it doesn’t matter if you’re high major or mid-major. You’ve got to high-major them, and we did that tonight physically.”BIG PICTUREUNC Asheville: The Bulldogs came into the game on a nine-game winning streak and with a school-record 27 wins but were once again overmatched against a major opponent. Four of their five losses in the first round of the tournament have come by at least 20 points, with their only close game being a 72-65 defeat against Syracuse in 2012.UCLA: The injuries that hit the Bruins in the Pac-12 Tournament didn't hurt them in this game. Defensive stopper Jaylen Clark (Achilles tendon) is out for the season and freshman big man Adem Bona sat out his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Bona has a good chance to return for the second round on Saturday.UP NEXTWith a win on Saturday, the Bruins will advance to the Sweet 16 for a third straight season for the first time since 2006-08, when they went to the Final Four each year.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838381,Northwestern beats Boise State 75-67 in March Madness,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Boo Buie scored 22 points to lead Northwestern to a win in the school's second appearance ever in the NCAA Tournament, 75-67 over Boise State on Thursday.The seventh-seeded Wildcats (22-11) previously made it to the Big Dance in 2017, and just like that time, they made sure they wouldn't be one-and-done.“All joy. No relief. It’s really hard to get here, especially when you play in the Big Ten,” coach Chris Collins said. “When you get to this point now, it’s so rewarding and so joyful as a coach to see these guys celebrating and to be on the big stage like that playing well, finding a way to win and advance in the NCAA Tournament.”Northwestern never trailed in a game that was close most of the way and advanced to play second-seeded UCLA in the second round of the West Region.The 10th-seeded Broncos (24-10) are still searching for their first tournament win, losing their opener for the ninth time in as many tries. Max Rice scored 17 points to lead Boise State and Naje Smith added 14.“I don’t think anyone expected us to be here,” Rice said. “I still think it was an amazing season. Obviously we wanted to get our first win in the tournament. But they played good tonight. They played better than us tonight and made a bunch of big shots. But that doesn’t take away from what we’ve done this year.”Chase Audige added 20 points for the Wildcats and Ty Berry scored 13, including three 3-pointers.The Bulldogs fell behind by 10 points early but fought back to tie the game at 40 early in the second half when Rice hit his second 3-pointer of the half.The game was tight most of the way before Northwestern finally built the lead back to 10 on a tip-in by Brooks Barnhizer with 3:15 to go.“We didn’t break down,” Audige said. “We weren't screaming. We might have screamed at each other, but it was a good type of like, ‘C’mon, let’s be better.’ I think every single time we just executed, whether we missed a shot or made it, we got a shot we wanted or liked.”TOUGH IT OUTBroncos guard Marcus Shaver Jr. had to be helped off the court after going down with an apparent leg injury late in the first half. He came out of locker room late after halftime and returned to the game.“He’s courageous, he’s tough, and he didn’t want to let these guys down, us down,” coach Leon Rice said. “It’s just unfortunate.”BIG PICTUREBoise State: With four returning starters from last year's tournament team, including three seniors, the Broncos hoped this year's team could be the one finally to break through. They fell to 0-4 in the tournament under Rice.Northwestern: After finishing second in the Big Ten for the first time since the 1958-59 season, the Wildcats made sure this special season wouldn't come to an early finish. Northwestern lost in the second round to Gonzaga in 2017 after beating Vanderbilt in its tournament debut.UP NEXTNorthwestern is seeking its first trip to the Sweet 16.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838386,"Biden cheers for Irish bonds, unity on St. Patrick's Day","WASHINGTON (AP) — Sporting a green tie and shamrocks for St. Patrick’s Day, President Joe Biden on Friday voiced his support for a recent economic accord affecting Ireland as he hosted the republic's prime minister, a longstanding meetup scuttled by the COVID-19 pandemic the past two years.While the annual Washington tradition is about celebrating the historic bonds of Ireland and the United States, Biden also took time to reflect on the approaching 25th anniversary of the U.S.-brokered Good Friday accord — the agreement that helped end sectarian violence that had raged for decades over the question of Northern Ireland unifying with Ireland or remaining part of the United Kingdom.The president also underscored a more recent agreement, known as the Windsor Framework, that aims to ease tensions over Northern Ireland's trading status in the aftermath of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and to maintain the quarter century-old peace accord.“It’s a vital, vital step and that’s going to help ensure all the people in Northern Ireland have an opportunity to realize their full potential,” Biden said of the framework during remarks at a Capitol Hill luncheon to mark the holiday.Earlier at the White House, he was presented with a bowl of shamrocks from Leo Varadkar, known as the taoiseach, a tradition that began in 1952.The shamrocks made it to the White House last year even though then-prime minister Micheál Martin didn’t. He came down with COVID-19 and had to join the meeting virtually while isolated in nearby Blair House, where world leaders often stay. Biden and Martin's first annual meeting was virtual, too, because of the pandemic.Biden, who often speaks of his Irish heritage and is fond of quoting Irish poets, declared March Irish-American heritage month. The White House even dyed the water of the South Lawn fountain green for the occasion.Biden has said he plans to soon visit both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom, to mark the 25th anniversary of the big peace accord. In addition to his praise in that area, Vradeker saluted Biden and the U.S. for helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.“We really want to profoundly thank you and America for your leadership in relation to Ukraine,"" Varadker said. “We’re going to roll out the red carpet” for Biden's visit in Ireland, he said.The Good Friday agreement came under increasing stress following the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, but the recent accord between the U.K. and the EU addresses some of the issues that arose around commerce and goods that cross the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.The White House said the Windsor Framework is an important step in maintaining the peace accord and Biden on Friday spoke of support for the framework, though Northern Ireland's political leaders have called for changes.Biden, at an early evening White House reception for Varadkar, noted last month’s attempted murder in Northern Ireland of Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell, a well-known officer who has led investigations into murders, organized crime and dissident paramilitary groups.The 1998 Good Friday peace accord largely ended the conflict, known as “the Troubles,” but small IRA splinter groups continue to mount sporadic attacks on security forces.The leaders of Ireland's five biggest political parties, including Irish nationalists Sinn Fein — which was allied with the IRA during Northern Ireland’s decades of Catholic-Protestant violence — and the Democratic Unionist Party, issued a rare joint statement to condemn the attack on Caldwell.Biden said it was important for the parties to stand “shoulder to shoulder” following the attack. “We’ll have to continue to work to protect peace and stability,” he said.Varadkar took over in December for a second term as part of a job-sharing deal made by the country’s centrist coalition government. The two leaders discussed the continued support of Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion.Varadkar and his partner, Matthew Barrett, attended a breakfast with Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff at the Vice President’s home, and Varadkar told the crowd there that Ireland is grateful for the “close and deep bond with these United States.”He said the U.S. has played a central role in promoting peace in Ireland “at critical points when few others had the influence to do so.” And Varadkar said the U.S. has been strong on LGBTQ rights.“From Stonewall to Sacramento to San Francisco. America has led the way when it comes to LGBT equality,” he said. “I don’t think I would be here today were it not for what America did.”Varadkar met with the president in the Oval Office before heading to the Capitol for a lunch with congressional leaders.Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy noted that the annual lunch at the Capitol has brought together Republicans and Democrats dating back to President Ronald Reagan and Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill to ""set aside the issues of the day to gather to toast” Ireland.McCarthy, who like Biden has Irish ancestry, joked that a “clash is brewing” between the president and himself.“I think you might be able to settle this for us: Which one of us is more Irish ?”“I think we have a chance to make hope and history rhyme with all our differences,” Biden said. “I agree with the speaker. There’s no reason why we can’t find common ground. There’s no reason why we can’t hope to change this direction.”Varadkar, who as a college student spent a summer working on Capitol Hill, quipped that ""it’s a pleasure to be sat next to the speaker and the president, not to keep the peace but rather to thank them for doing so much to protect peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland.”___Associated Press writers Hannah Fingerhut and Aamer Madhani contributed to this report.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838389,Hot-shooting Funk leads Penn St to first NCAA win since '01,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Andrew Funk had the shooting game of his career on Penn State's biggest stage in more than two decades.Funk went 8 of 10 on 3-pointers and scored 27 points Thursday night in a 76-59 win over Texas A&M for the Nittany Lions' first NCAA Tournament victory in 22 years.“He’s an OK shooter,” Penn State star Jalen Pickett deadpanned before breaking into a wide smile. “He puts in a lot of work on his jump shot. When he gets going like that, we've got to find him.”Funk, in his first year at Penn State after transferring from Bucknell, led the 10th-seeded Nittany Lions (23-13) to their ninth victory in 11 games. They next play No. 2 seed Texas in the second round of the Midwest Region on Saturday.“When you make that first and second one, the rim opens up a little bit for sure,” Funk said. “In this offense I know I'm going to get a lot of shots from 3. You get into a rhythm, especially in a game where the offense is flowing like that.”Penn State's previous tournament win was its second-round upset of North Carolina in New Orleans in 2001. The Nittany Lions lost to Temple in the Sweet 16, and they lost to the Owls again when they returned to the tournament in 2011.“We talked about this vision of doing this,” coach Micah Shrewsberry said of the breakthrough, “and it's all coming to fruition for us. ... We want to go on a run, a ride, and we're having a blast.""Texas A&M (25-10) had won 10 of 12 as it entered its first NCAA Tournament since 2018. The seventh-seeded Aggies lost in the first round for only the second time in nine appearances since 2006.Dexter Dennis scored 19 points to lead A&M, which shot 34%. The Aggies had battled back from a 6-5 start to the season that included a couple of bad nonconference losses. They ended up second in the Southeastern Conference and reached the league tournament title game.“As yucky as this game was, I think we will look back at what has transpired the last 75 days with great memories,” coach Buzz Williams said. “What has transpired since then has been so good. As time goes, we’ll look back at that.”Funk was 0 for 5 on 3s in the Big Ten championship game last weekend. But he made his first 3-pointer against the Aggies, missed his second, and then hit six in a row.“I just knew he was hot,” teammate Myles Dread said, “and I tried to find him as much as possible.”Funk's streak ended when he put up an air ball on a desperation 3 as the shot clock was running out.Pickett played another strong all-around game with 19 points, eight assists, no turnovers and seven rebounds.Penn State led 38-22 after outscoring the Aggies 28-10 to close the first half. The Aggies hadn't scored so few points in a first half since a win over Notre Dame on Nov. 24, 2021.The Lions' offense ran just the way Shrewsberry likes it, with the threat of 6-foot-10 Kebba Jjie in the post creating space on the perimeter for Funk, Dread and Seth Lundy to do what they do best. Dread and Lundy had two 3s apiece and Penn State finished 13 of 22 from long distance.The Aggies have had trying times recently when it comes to the NCAA Tournament. Williams was infamously miffed when they weren't selected last year. This season they came in as a No. 7 seed, lower than Texas A&M fans felt fair.BIG PICTUREPenn State: The Lions’ dominance in their first NCAA Tournament game since 2011 will only intensify the spotlight on second-year coach Shrewsberry, whose name has been connected to openings at Notre Dame and Georgetown.Texas A&M: The Aggies' first appearance in the tournament in five years ended the same way as the last one — with a thud.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838390,"Boyd scores twice, Coyotes beat Canucks 3-2","TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Coyotes held a team meeting following the All-Star break in hopes of finding some kind of a spark during another disappointing season.Whatever was said worked, shaping the Coyotes into one of the NHL's better team since the break.Travis Boyd scored twice, Ivan Prosvetov stopped 29 shots and the Coyotes stretched their points streak to seven games with a 3-2 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday night.“We kind of hit the refresh button and ever since then we’ve been, positive each and every day and playing the right way,” said Coyotes forward Lawson Crouse, who scored in the third period. “That's what's led us to all these wins and points streaks.”Prosvetov helped the Coyotes withstand a string of early penalties in his second start this season and Boyd had his second multi-goal game this month after going five seasons without one.Arizona is 5-0-2 since losing to Carolina on March 3, has won five straight home games and its 25 points since the All-Star break is seventh-best in the NHL.“We've just got a lot of belief in each other right now,” Boyd said. “We’ve proven to ourselves that if we play the right way, any given night we can be at any given team. I think that’s what you’re seeing right now.”Vancouver's Elias Pettersson had a goal and an assist, and Andrei Kuzmenko scored for the second straight game. Thatcher Demko had 24 saves for the Canucks, who went 0 for 5 on the power play to see their five-game winning streak end.“We got that goal and maybe we thought it would be easy,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said in his first trip back to face his old team. “You've just got to work, plain and simple.”Prosvetov was sharp on short notice his first start of the season, turning away 39 shots in a win over Nashville on March 9 after learning he had been recalled from Tucson of the AHL just before noon.The Russian rookie stood little chance of stopping the puck when Coyotes defenseman Michael Kesserling made a bad pass in his own end midway through the first period. Kuzmenko, the NHL's most accurate shooter at 27.3%, finished off the tic-tac-toe passing from Pettersson and Anthony Beauvillier just outside the crease.The Coyotes gathered some steam after a penalty-filled first period, including Zack Kassian's game misconduct, and tied it on Boyd's wrister from the left circle with 30 seconds left.Boyd scored on a power play in the second period, juking his way around Vancouver defenseman Tyler Myers and slipping a shot between Demko's pads.The Canucks committed another penalty early in the third period and Crouse cashed in, flipping in a sharp-angle shot over Demko's stick shoulder.“You’re down by two going in the third or whatever, they score the first or second shift, you’re not going to come back every time,” Canucks defenseman Quinn Hughes said.They tried.Vancouver turned up the pressure after that and Pettersson beat Prosvetov from the left circle to make it 3-2.The Canucks pulled Demko for an extra attacker the final two minutes, but Prosvetov made a couple of late saves to preserve the win.BOYD'S BOUNCE BACKBoyd set career highs with 17 goals and 35 points a year ago and got this season off to a solid start.The veteran winger went through a quiet stretch heading into the All-Star break, but has upped his production since. Boyd has three goals the past two games and eight since the All-Star break, with four assists.“I think maybe a lot on his mind or whatever before,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said. “He's clean things up and now he’s playing really good hockey.”NOTES: Coyotes F Nick Schmaltz missed his third straight game with a lower-body injury. Vancouver signed F Aidan McDonough to a two-year, entry-level contract. He's spent the last four years at Northeastern and was drafted by the Canucks in the seventh round of the 2019 NHL draft. ...

Other New Zealand agencies could decide later to impose their own bans.Global concern about the app comes after warnings by the FBI and other agencies that TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance could share TikTok user data — such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers — with China’s authoritarian government.New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said he didn't have TikTok on his phone.“I'm not that hip and trendy,” he told reporters.The New Zealand move came on the advice of government cybersecurity experts, said Parliamentary Service Chief Executive Rafael Gonzalez-Montero.He said the app would be removed from all devices with access to the parliamentary network, although officials could make special arrangements for anybody who needed TikTok to perform their democratic duties.“This decision has been made based on our own experts’ analysis and following discussion with our colleagues across government and internationally,"" Gonzalez-Montero said in a statement. ""Based on this information, the service has determined that the risks are not acceptable in the current New Zealand parliamentary environment.”Hipkins said cybersecurity advice came from New Zealand's intelligence agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau.

Market Overview:

            The Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) Market has experienced significant growth over the past decade, both in terms of sales volume and market share. SUVs are typically characterized by their high ground clearance, rugged styling, and spacious interiors, making them popular choices for families, outdoor enthusiasts, and those who value versatility and practicality.

            According to industry reports, SUVs accounted for over 43% of all new vehicle sales in the United States in 2022, and similar trends have been observed in other markets around the world. This growth has been driven by several factors, including the increasing popularity of crossover SUVs, which combine the rugged styling of traditional SUVs with the fuel efficiency and handling of passenger cars.

SUVs are also popular because of their perceived safety and versatility. Many models are available with all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, which can provide better traction and stability in inclement weather or off-road conditions. In addition, many SUVs offer spacious interiors with ample cargo capacity, making them ideal for families, road trips, or other activities that require hauling large items.

            As with any market, the SUV segment is highly competitive, with many different brands and models vying for consumers’ attention. Additionally, luxury SUVs have become increasingly popular in recent years, with brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi offering high-end models with advanced features and amenities.

            The SUV market is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by increasing demand for versatile and practical vehicles. However, the industry will likely face challenges as consumers and regulators push for greater fuel efficiency and environmental sustainability, which could impact sales of larger, less efficient SUV models.

Cameron Payne scored 18 points, Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul each had 16 and Okogie finished with 15. The Suns made all 17 of their free throws.Kevin Durant missed his fourth straight game because of a sprained left ankle sustained in warmups before a game his anticipated home debut against Oklahoma City. He has played just three games with Phoenix since coming over from Brooklyn in a trade in February.Markelle Fultz scored 25 points for Orlando, Banchero added 18 and Cole Anthony 17. Franz Wagner had 16 points and 10 rebounds, and Wendell Carter Jr. also scored 16 points.Orlando trailed by 12 points in the second half before pulling even at 101 on Wagner's 3-pointer with just under six minutes to go.After a Phoenix timeout, Okogie's 3-pointer restored the Suns' lead. The Magic closed to 114-113 on a pair of free throws by Fultz with 8.8 seconds to play.Terrence Ross made two free throws for the Suns with 6.1 seconds left for the game's final points.On the final shot, Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said he was expecting Phoenix to foul before Orlando could attempt a tying 3-point shot.“Usually they’re going to foul,"" Mosley said. ""As soon as Franz caught it (outside the arc), they put two on him. Franz made the right play, pushed it over to Paolo and he almost had the good look. But (Okogie) made a heck of a play.”Okogie said the Suns were planning to foul.“I kind of read it and didn't think it was a good situation to foul him,” he said. “I anticipated the shot. Thank god I didn't foul him.”Added Suns coach Monty Williams: “I'm just glad we were able to make enough plays to pull out a win. (Okogie) making plays like he has all year long when he has been able to play. We are thinking foul but they swung it quickly. To be able to make a play like that at the end is huge for us.”Orlando outrebounded Phoenix 47-35 and had a major advantage in fast-break points (26-2).“We stayed composed, tried to keep pushing the pace and get the shots that we wanted,"" Fultz said. ""We made it a close game, but we had turnovers (19 for 17 Suns points) and I had a few silly fouls. There were multiple plays that added up to us losing the game.”Fultz had nine assists and seven rebounds to go with his25 points.TRAINER’S ROOMMagic: Gary Harris (right hip flexor tendon) was in the starting lineup in what Mosley said was a “game time decision.” He played 26 minutes and scored six points.Suns: Durant took some shots in practice Thursday. “He hasn’t done anything outside of that, it’s just part of his progression,"" Williams said. “We’ll see how he responds to standard shooting.” The original plan was to re-evaluate Durant's condition at the end of March, and Williams didn't indicate it would be any sooner than that.RAVE REVIEWSBanchero has been everything that was advertised in his rookie season. The 6-foot-10 Orlando forward, the NBA’s No. 1 overall pick from Duke, is averaging 20 points.“Most young players with his skill set can score. Not many of them get to the free-throw line consistently,” Williams said before the game. “He’s got the size to take a hit when he gets to the paint.”Banchero has been the NBA’s Rookie of the Month in December, January and February.UP NEXTMagic: At Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.Suns: At Oklahoma City on Sunday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

Four came in the third period to ice the game.“It’s a huge win,” Coleman said. “Obviously, we’ve had trouble in third periods putting teams away. From start to finish, we did a pretty great job tonight making sure we didn’t take our foot off the gas.”It marked the first time in nine tries that the Flames won at Vegas since the Golden Knights joined the NHL in 2017. Before this one, the Knights had outscored Calgary 34-11 in Las Vegas.MacKenzie Weegar, Mikael Backlund and Dillon Dube also scored for the Flames. Jacob Markstrom stopped 17 shots to win for the fourth time in his last six starts.“They’re coming back from a long trip, a lot of time-zone changes coming in there, and our only focus (was) trying to have a good first period,” Calgary coach Darryl Sutter said. “It doesn’t matter if (the final was) 10-2 or 3-2, we need points.”Jonathan Quick, who made 23 saves, lost for the first time since being acquired by Vegas.Zach Whitecloud and Reilly Smith scored for the Golden Knights, who came in boasting a league-best 13-2-2 mark since the All-Star break after a 4-1-0 road trip.Vegas, which has struggled with the league’s second-worst power play (12.5%) since Dec. 28, went 0 for 4 with the man advantage.“Our power play had an opportunity to get us back into the game and we failed in that area,” Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said.Calgary opened the scoring late in the first period when Rasmus Andersson gathered the puck from a faceoff in the right circle and fed Weegar, whose drive from the blue line lasered into the net.Toffoli, who also assisted on Weegar’s goal, added to his stat sheet early in the second when he skated across the crease and around Quick to bury the puck and give the Flames a 2-0 lead.Whitecloud put Vegas on the board later in the second when he skated around the rim of the right circle and rifled a wrist shot past Markstrom, cutting Calgary’s lead in half with 7:27 left in the period.After missing an opportunity to tie the game earlier on a shift with a backhand that soared over the net, Smith made amends when he took William Karlsson’s feed at the doorstep and slammed it home, evening the game 2-all.Calgary regained the lead quickly when Coleman tipped home Elias Lindholm’s shot from the right side of the goal line a little more than a minute after Smith’s goal.“You've got to have pushback on this team,” Coleman said. “They’re a good team. They’re going to have their pushes. Obviously, you don’t want to blow a two-goal lead. We were able to respond tonight.”The Flames began opening some breathing room midway through the third when Backlund scored after trying to feed Toffoli from below the goal line. Instead, the puck caromed off Alex Pietrangelo’s stick and Quick's head before going in.Toffoli and Coleman then added their second goals of the night before Dube closed out the scoring.NOTES: Backlund is five games short of 900 in his career. ... Smith has three goals and six assists in his last seven games for Vegas.UP NEXTFlames: Host the Dallas Stars on Saturday.Golden Knights: Host the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday.___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838399,Houston star Sasser now a big question mark at March Madness,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Marcus Sasser thought his groin felt better, certainly good enough to give it a go in the NCAA Tournament.The All-American guard started for the top-seeded Houston Cougars against No. 16 seed Northern Kentucky, and he certainly looked just fine sinking an early 3 pointer Thursday night.But that was about it for the best player on a team expected to contend for a national championship.Sasser managed only one other basket in under 14 minutes of playing time. And when the second half began, he was watching from the bench.That's where he remained for the rest of the night.“He said it felt funny,” Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. “So he shut it down, which is the right thing to do.”Now, one of the biggest stars of March Madness is a huge question mark, and the Cougars could be in big trouble if he can't go in the second round Saturday.Houston will be facing ninth-seeded Auburn, a team that is essentially playing at home in the first two rounds. The Tigers' campus is only about a two-hour drive from Legacy Arena in downtown Birmingham.“I have a lot more pressing matters to worry about than that,” Sampson said of Auburn's home-court edge. “I need to see how many healthy bodies we have right now. That's probably our most important thing.”Sampson also revealed that starting guard Jamal Shead has a sore knee. Shead still managed to play more than 36 minutes against the Norse, who hung around most of the game before the Cougars prevailed 63-52.Clearly, the biggest concern is Sasser, who injured his groin in the semifinals of the American Athletic Conference tournament last weekend.Sasser sat out the AAC championship game, and he was sorely missed when the Cougars (32-3) got knocked off by Memphis.Despite the loss, Houston was still rewarded with a No. 1 seed.Sasser took Monday and Tuesday off, and went through a light workout Wednesday.Sasser and the Houston training staff thought the extra rest, combined with the treatment he received, left him healthy enough to play in the NCAA opener.Sampson went nearly down to tipoff before deciding to send out his best player in the starting five.“We have great trainers and I've been with Marcus for four years,” Sampson said. “I trust Marcus and I trust our trainers. I leave the decision up to them. Marcus knows his body better than anybody in this room, including me.""I would have been fine if Marcus decided not to play tonight. But he wanted to give it a try. He thought it was a high enough percentage to 100 that he could go. But when he got out there, he didn't feel like he could.”Sasser, who was averaging 17.1 points per game, became Houston's first selection to The Associated Press All-America first team since 1984.He is a dynamic leader of the offense, and it was clear how much his absence meant as the Cougars struggled to put away Northern Kentucky.Houston made only 4 of 16 from 3-point range.“We didn't make an open 3 all night,” Sampson said. “That's the name of the game. When you've got an open look, you've got to put the biscuit in the basket. And we've got one of the best shooters in the country in Marcus Sasser.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838400,"California will remake San Quentin prison, emphasizing rehab","SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) — Visiting San Quentin, California's oldest prison once home to a gas chamber used to execute inmates on the nation's largest death row, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday touted a plan to overhaul the facility in favor of a rehabilitation-centered approach that could become a model for the world.The facility will be renamed the San Quentin Rehabilitation Center and the more than 500 inmates serving death sentences there will be moved elsewhere in the California penitentiary system. The prison houses more than 2,000 other inmates on lesser sentences.""We want to be the preeminent restorative justice facility in the world — that’s the goal,"" Newsom said from an on-site warehouse that will house his envisioned programs. ""San Quentin is iconic, San Quentin is known worldwide. If San Quentin can do it, it can be done anywhere else.""Despite Newsom's ambitious tone, he offered few concrete details on what the new system would look like and who it would serve. It remained unclear how far the plan would go to reimagine a prison once home to California's most notorious criminals, like Charles Manson, and the site of violent uprisings in the 1960s and 1970s.But it has also become known for innovative programs where inmates can get a degree, write for an award-winning newspaper, study the arts and get job training in preparation for reentering society.A group made up of public safety experts, crime victims and formerly incarcerated people will advise the state on the transformation, which Newsom hopes to complete by 2025. He is allocating $20 million to launch the plan.The move by Newsom, who recently began his second term, follows his 2019 moratorium on executions, which drew criticism from some who argued he was neglecting the will of voters who in 2016 upheld the death penalty at the ballot box.From 2020 to 2022, more than 100 inmates with death sentences were transferred from San Quentin to other prisons under a pilot program run by the state. The state spends about $326 million operating San Quentin annually, and Newsom’s administration didn’t say if the new approach would save money.The latest plan is part of a decades-long transformation of the state's sprawling prison system, which went under federal receivership in 2005 after a court determined prison medical care was so lacking it amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. A panel of judges later ordered the state to dramatically reduce the prison population because of overcrowding.About 800 people are released from San Quentin every year, and the goal is to keep them from committing another crime and ending up back in the system, Newsom said.San Quentin inmate Juan Moreno Haines said the plan will help ensure taxpayer money is being spent to end the ongoing cycle of repeat offenses.“I’ll ask Californians: What do you want?” he said. “Do you want them to come out of prison better rehabilitated with skills, or do you want them to come out worse than what they were to continually feed this model of criminality?”Newsom's office cited as a model Norway’s approach to incarceration, which focuses on preparing people to return to society. Officials from the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation toured Norwegian prisons in 2019, where they took note of the positive interactions between inmates and staff. Oregon and North Dakota have also taken inspiration from the Scandinavian country's policies.In maximum-security Norwegian prisons, cells often look more like dorm rooms with additional furniture such as chairs, desks, even TVs, and prisoners have kitchen access. Norway has a low rate of people who reoffend after leaving prison.As of 2015, two-thirds of people convicted of felonies in California were rearrested within two years of release, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California. Newsom said efforts to reduce that rate will boost public safety.Success will be determined “on the basis of people’s willingness and commitment to change themselves, to change their attitudes, and become positive contributory citizens when they’re back in community. We need to help support people along that path,” he said.The Prison Law Office, a public interest law firm that filed the 2001 lawsuit over California's prison medical care, has advocated for such an approach to prisons and led tours of European correctional facilities for U.S. lawmakers. On a 2011 trip to prisons in Germany and the Netherlands, Donald Specter, executive director of the law office, said he was shocked to see that they were “so much more humane” than prisons back home.“While I was there, I thought, ‘oh my god, we should try to import this philosophy into the United States,’” he said.Critics of Newsom's announcement said it follows continued prioritization of people who have committed crimes over victims.“We’re in a climate where it’s all about the offenders and the criminals and not about the innocent victims that have been victimized, traumatized, harmed — family members that are devastated living without their loved ones because they were murdered and taken away too early,” said Patricia Wenskunas, chief executive officer of the Crime Survivors Resource Center.But Amber-Rose Howard, executive director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a group focused on reducing the prison population, isn't convinced a “Norway model” would work in the United States since the two countries have vastly different histories.“Newsom should stay on track with closing more prisons, with implementing policies that have been passed that would reduce incarceration and that would get people home,” she said.Speakers who joined Newsom said they hoped to build on a slew of already successful programs in place at San Quentin. The prison houses the first accredited junior college in the country based entirely behind bars, offering classes in literature, astronomy and U.S. government. Prisoners recorded and produced the hugely popular podcast “ Ear Hustle ” while serving time.Phil Melendez, a former inmate at San Quentin who now works at the advocacy group Smart Justice California, said the rehabilitation programs the state hopes to expand will set formerly incarcerated people up for success when they re-enter society.“Over the course of (my) time here, I found a new sense of hope,” Melendez said at the prison. “I found healing.”___Sophie Austin is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838401,Taiwan's Evergreen Marine to hand out 11 months' pay as mid-year bonus,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese shipping conglomerate Evergreen Marine Corp. announced Tuesday (March 14) it will give every employee 10 to 11 months of monthly salary as a mid-year bonus.Evergreen Marine said that following record-high profits last year, it will allocate NT$1.92 billion (US$62.83 million) in mid-year bonuses to employees, reported FTV News. With 3,100 employees, that amounts to NT$618,000 per worker, and with an average salary of NT$60,000, that equates to over 10 months' worth of pay.In its 2022 financial report, the shipping giant announced consolidated revenues of NT$627.28 billion, an increase of 28.17% from the previous year. Its after-tax net profit amounted to NT$334.20 billion, a 39.82% surge from the year before.The firm's after-tax earnings per share (EPS) in 2022 was NT$87.07. Because Evergreen Marine employees have already been awarded year-end bonuses equivalent to 50 months' salary, this new payment will bring the total number of months' salary workers will receive as a bonus for 2022 to 60 months.Evergreen Marine President Eric Hsieh (謝惠全) was cited by the news agency as saying that in order to expand the scale of operations and strengthen the competitiveness of its shipping line, the firm plans to acquire the rights to use nine ships from its Singapore subsidiary.",2023/3/17,939,Business

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 11 million tourists arrived in Taiwan per year.The first millionth visitor is now expected to arrive in late March. The original estimate had been that 800,000 visitors would have entered Taiwan by then, according to Tourism Bureau Deputy Director-General Lin Hsin-jen (林信任).The bureau is still working out the details of the program, which gives independent travelers the opportunity to receive an electronic card storing NT$5,000 after they arrive in Taiwan, CNA reported. Tour groups with at least eight members could receive NT$10,000, those with 15 members or more a maximum of NT$20,000, with a total of 90,000 groups qualifying for the subsidies.",2023/3/17,10212,Travel & Cuisine
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838459,Unheralded coaches Digard and Still looking to stay unbeaten,"PARIS (AP) — Didier Digard's digging in nicely at Nice and Will Still's still unbeaten at Reims.The two young, unheralded coaches are making a name for themselves in the French league this season, and they head into this weekend's matches defending unbeaten records.Seventh-place Nice is on a 10-game unbeaten streak before hosting ninth-place Lorient, while eighth-place Reims is a club-record 19 league games without defeat as it faces second-place Marseille. Both games are Sunday.Nice and Reims are locked on 43 points, separated by goal difference, and still in the hunt for the European places with 11 rounds of games remaining. Perhaps fittingly, they canceled each other out this season with two 0-0 draws.But the fact they have been performing so consistently is much down to their respective coaches.After a very difficult start, Nice's climb up the table coincided with the appointment of the 36-year-old Digard. Nice had re-hired coach Lucien Favre to replace PSG-bound Christophe Galtier last year, but it didn't work and so Digard took charge in early January.Digard was a gritty midfielder with a decent passing range during his playing days. They were spent mainly with Nice, where he played 165 matches from 2009-15. He also turned out for Paris Saint-Germain, English club Middlesbrough and Real Betis in Spain.The combative attitude from his playing days shows now, notably when Digard prowls along the touchline shouting out orders in his tight-fitting overcoat.There's more to the barking, too, for without any reputation to fall back on, Digard made an immediate impression by winning his first four games in charge.Unlike Digard, however, the 30-year-old Still never played soccer at the highest level but has done remarkably well on limited resources and even less coaching experience.Under his guidance Reims hasn't lost in the league since a 3-0 home defeat to Monaco on Sept. 18 — which was before he took charge and two months before the World Cup started in Qatar.It's the longest unbeaten spell in the club's history, which is saying something considering that, in the era of former France greats Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, the Champagne-based club reached two European Cup finals in 1956 and '59. That last Euro final was 11 years before current league leader PSG was even founded.Still hasn't lost a game since since replacing Oscar Garcia in October, and Reims also has unique bragging rights in the league after holding PSG to two draws.Both teams also have two of the league's best finishers in Nice striker Terem Moffi and Reims sharp-shooter Folarin Balogun.They are both ahead of record seven-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, Argentina's inspirational World Cup champion, who has 13 league goals so far.The 21-year-old Balogun — who is on loan from Premier League leader Arsenal — has 16 goals and one assist.The 23-year-old Nigeria forward Moffi, who joined from Lorient in the January transfer window, counts 15 goals and two assists for cash-rich Ineos-backed Nice.That means they've been involved in 17 goals each and, the coincidence is pushed further because they share a similar playing style. Both are strong, quick forwards who break from deep and are superb one-on-one finishers.Just like their current sides they seem inseparable and, perhaps like their coaches Digard and Still, they could be destined for bigger things.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838461,Kings use strong second period to beat Blue Jackets 4-1,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Carl Grundstrom had a goal and an assist in Los Angeles’ four-goal second period, Pheonix Copley made 30 saves and the Kings beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-1 on Thursday night.Drew Doughty, Anze Kopitar and Viktor Arvidsson also scored to help the Kings improve to 7-0-1 in their past eight games.“We just got to stick to the game plan. If we get away from that, that’s when we struggle, and I think the guys have bought in now and are ready to play it, and we’re gonna be good with it,” Doughty said.Kirill Marchenko scored for Columbus. Daniil Tarasov was pulled in the second period after allowing four goals on 27 shots, and Michael Hutchinson made nine saves in relief. The Blue Jackets have lost five of six.After dominating the first period but having nothing to show for it, the Kings finally went up early in the second on Doughty’s fifth of the season. He used some nifty stick-handling to get into the slot before tapping in his own rebound, admittedly tapping into a side of his game he had to suppress for team success.“I used to do that all the time when I was younger,” Doughty said. “I kind of put it on the back burner for a long time. ... I need to play a good two-way game and, yeah, maybe I should do it more often.""Kopitar made it 2-0 less than three minutes later, and that was plenty for the Kings to move to a 2-0-1 start on their seven-game homestand.Copley nearly got his second shutout of the season while taking his record to an unlikely 21-4-3 in 31 appearances. Neither Copley nor Joonas Korpisalo have allowed more than two goals in the seven games since the Kings dealt away franchise icon Jonathan Quick to the Blue Jackets on Feb. 28. A day after going to Columbus, Quick was traded to Vegas.Since returning from the All-Star break, the Kings are 12-2-2. They have not lost in regulation in nine home games during that stretch, with their lone defeat coming in a shootout against Nashville on Saturday.“Four lines and three pairs of defensemen are committed to doing things right,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “I look at the goal we gave up tonight, we did everything we wanted to do or needed to do. Went off the ref’s foot and into the slot and they score, so those are gonna get built into (playoff) games or series, and you have to be able to overcome them. But just complete commitment to doing what we do.”FEARSOME FOURSDoughty praised the progression of the fourth line of Grundstrom, center Rasmus Kupari and forward Arthur Kaliyev for helping power the Kings’ recent success, with Grundstrom emerging as a driving force at both ends of the ice.“He’s come a long way,” McLellan said. “His goal is a prime example. He takes a shot, he strips a puck, he wins a battle, he rolls out and shoots it again. Simple, straightforward, powerful.”NOT HIS FAULTBlue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said Tarasov wasn’t to blame on any of the first three goals he allowed and caught a bad break on the fourth when a Columbus player lost his stick in the build up.“We put him in bad positions. I felt bad for him because he deserved better,” Larsen said.NOTES: The Kings also had four goals in the second period of a 5-2 victory over the New York Islanders on Tuesday night. It was the fourth time in franchise history Los Angeles has scored four goals in the second period in consecutive games. … Columbus goalie Elvis Merzlikins missed his third straight game as he remains in Latvia to be with his grandmother.UP NEXTBlue Jackets: At Anaheim on Friday night.Kings: Host Vancouver on Saturday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838462,"Flight attack raises questions about security, mental health","LEOMINSTER, Mass. (AP) — The music was blaring on a February afternoon when Francisco Torres stopped by a Massachusetts barbershop, proclaiming he was half-angel, half-devil.He wanted a dozen people to come outside the shop and shoot him with an automatic weapon stored in his car trunk. Before anyone could make sense of the request, Torres fled the shop and drove off. They never saw a weapon and he didn't return.“I didn’t get what he was saying but then I realized he was talking about a gun. I told him there are kids in here, why are you saying this,” said Saul Perez, who was visiting friends at the shop and noted that an employee called 911, ushered children into the back and shut down the shop. “I was spooked.”The incident took place about a week before Torres would be arrested for attacking a flight attendant and attempting to open the plane’s emergency door on a cross-country United flight from Los Angeles to Boston earlier this month.Confrontations on flights have skyrocketed since the pandemic started, with some altercations captured and replayed endlessly on social media.In a video taken by a fellow passenger, Torres loudly threatens to kill people and promises a bloodbath before charging the front of the plane, where a group of passengers tackled him down to the ground to restrain him.He remains behind bars pending a mental health evaluation, with a judge ruling he “may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent.”Torres objected to the evaluation through his federal public defender, Joshua Hanye, who didn't return a call Thursday seeking additional comment. A relative for Torres would not comment on the case.The flight attack was part of a decadeslong pattern of Torres demonstrating signs of a mental illness. He spent time in mental health facilities, according to lawsuits since closed that he filed in 2021 and 2022 against two hospitals in Massachusetts. Torres says he argued in one of the lawsuits that he was misdiagnosed for a mental illness and, in the other, that he was discriminated against for being vegan.In December 2022, police confronted him at his house in Worcester County, where he was outside in his underwear saying he was protesting climate change, according to a police report. On another occasion in 2021, police responded to a call from his mother reporting that he was yelling “homicidal threats” out a window. He told police that he was in World War 3 and he had a special device giving him “super sonic hearing,"" which he used to listen to his neighbors talking about him.His case history demonstrates the challenges facing airlines and federal regulators when handling passengers like Torres. Especially since experts say data shows those with mental illnesses are more often the victims of crimes than those responsible for committing violent acts.Despite repeated run-ins with police, authorities said that he rarely acted violent. He once was accused of grabbing his mother's arm, but those charges were dismissed. He didn't legally own a weapon, even though he often talked about guns. And there were no signs of trouble when he boarded that cross-county flight last month, a passenger said, or during the first five hours in the air.“He is really a nonviolent offender,"" said Leominster Police Chief Aaron Kennedy, who is familiar with Torres from previous run-ins. “This guy was pretty mild.”And even if past incidents raised red flags, experts said there isn't a whole lot that airline companies can or should be doing. Airlines say they don't share banned passenger lists with each other, though there have been a few cases so notorious that the passenger's name became widely known.The FBI maintains a no-fly list for people suspected of terrorism, to which special agents and other approved government employees can submit names for consideration.People with mental illnesses are not prohibited from getting on a plane, according to Jeffrey Price, an aviation-security expert at Metropolitan State University of Denver. Federal law gives U.S. citizens “a public right of transit through the navigable airspace,” he said.Legislation backed by airlines and their labor unions was introduced in Congress last year to create a new no-fly list including people who were charged or fined for interfering with airline crews. The bills died without hearings in the Senate or House, but backers plan to re-introduce them later this month.Several Republican senators opposed the proposal, saying it could be used to punish critics of the federal rule requiring passengers to wear masks — even to “equate them to terrorists.” From January 2021 to April 2022, while the federal mask mandate was still in effect, the vast majority of unruly-passenger cases reported by airlines involved disputes over masks, according to Federal Aviation Administration figures.Some liberal groups also opposed the legislation, arguing that the current no-fly list of people suspected of terrorism is opaque and unfair.The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the government several times over the last decade on behalf of people who didn't know why they were on the list or how to be removed from it. The ACLU also has accused the FBI of putting some people on the list to pressure them to become informants in counter-terrorist investigations against Muslim communities in the U.S.The captain of an airline flight can decide not to fly with a particular passenger on board, although flight attendants say this usually happens when a passenger appears to be drunk.The government runs what it calls “trusted traveler” programs such as TSA PreCheck, which lets people who are fingerprinted and pass a background check speed through security without removing shoes, belts, jackets and laptops from their bags. People can be denied PreCheck for certain crimes, which extends to those who are found not guilty by reason of insanity. But of course people who are denied PreCheck can still fly.Adding travelers like Torres to any no-fly list or barring them from a flight raises a host of logistical and constitutional questions. And determining who would get on a list would be controversial in a country that prides itself on protecting individual rights and keeping health information private by following strict HIPAA rules.Plus, having a “mental health challenge"" is ""not a prediction, necessarily, that someone’s going to have outbursts, have unpredictable behavior,” said Lynn Bufka, a psychologist and the American Psychological Association's associate chief of practice transformation. “That’s not going to be a good marker for determining whether or not someone should safely board.”Before Torres became agitated and threatened those around him, fellow passenger Jason Loomis said he didn't exhibit any strange behavior during boarding and was quiet for the beginning of the flight. Hours later though, Loomis witnessed his outburst. Initially, he spoke with Torres to try to calm him down, but when Torres' anger escalated, Loomis joined other passengers in restraining him.Still, Loomis said he couldn't envision keeping Torres off the flight in the first place. Instead, he said it was a reminder that society needs to take better care of mentally ill people.“I know there has been a lot of talk about airplane security and safety these days, but this was a very rare occurrence,"" Loomis said. ""It wasn't like he was shouting in the airport. He wasn't threatening anything. He was perfectly fine and then something just snapped.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838463,California bill to protect doctors who mail abortion pills,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Doctors in California who mail abortion pills to people in other states would be protected from prosecution under a new bill announced Friday in the state Legislature.The bill would not let California extradite doctors who are facing charges in another state for providing abortion medication. It would also shield doctors from having to pay fines. And it would let California doctors sue anyone who tries to stop them from providing abortions.The bill would only protect doctors who are in California. If a doctor left California to provide an abortion to someone in another state, that doctor would not be protected. It also would not protect patients in other states who receive the medication.State Sen. Nancy Skinner, a Democrat from Berkeley and the author of the bill, said her intent is to make sure California residents who are traveling in other states or living there temporarily — like college students — can still have access to medication that's legal in their home state. But she acknowledged the bill would also apply to California doctors who treat patients who live in other states.“This is essential health care,” Skinner said. “Our health care practitioners should be protected for treating their patients regardless of where their patients are geographically.""Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Maryland and Vermont have proposed or passed similar laws, according to Skinner’s office. Connecticut's law, among other things, blocks criminal summonses from other states related to reproductive health care services that are legal in Connecticut while also blocking extradition — unless the person fled from a state requesting them.“Obviously, if a provider is engaging in telehealth services with someone, even if they do inquire about where they are, they kind of have to take it on faith,” said Connecticut state Rep. Matt Blumenthal, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly’s Reproductive Rights Caucus. “We don’t want to make providers their police for their patients. And we don’t want to make them have to do an investigation every time they perform telehealth.""Other states have tried to block the distribution of the abortion pill, known as mifepristone. Attorneys general in 20 states, mostly with Republican governors, have warned some of the nation's largest pharmacy companies they could face legal consequences if they distribute the pill within their states.Most abortions are outlawed in Idaho, including medication abortions. Blaine Conzatti, president of the Idaho Family Policy Center — a group that opposes abortion rights — said California has a responsibility to extradite physicians who break Idaho laws.“The arrogance of such a proposal is astounding,” Conzatti said of Skinner's bill. “It flaunts the traditional relationship between states and would upend our federal system altogether.”Skinner's bill goes beyond abortions. It would also protect doctors for mailing contraceptives and transgender-related medications.California already has laws that prevents courts from enforcing out-of-state judgments on abortion providers and volunteers. That law was aimed at protecting doctors who provide abortions to people who travel to California from other states. Abortion opponents say laws like that are illegal because they violate a clause in the U.S. Constitution that says states must give “full faith and credit” to the laws of other states.Federal courts have recognized an exception to that clause, including laws in one state that violate the “public policy” of another state. Skinner's law declares it is the public policy of California that doctors should not be charged for providing abortion medication.“We're very careful,"" Skinner said.Abortion pills have been legal in the U.S. for more than two decades and can be used up to the 10th week of pregnancy. It's now the most common abortion method in the U.S. A federal judge in Texas is weighing whether to revoke or suspend the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of the drug, a decision that would apply to all states and not just the ones who have outlawed abortions.Skinner's bill is one of 17 pieces of legislation Democrats have introduced in California this year to protect abortion rights, including proposals to improve access to contraceptives and protect patients' privacy._____Associated Press reporter Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838464,"Dunn scores in overtime, Kraken beat Sharks 2-1","SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Vince Dunn scored 1:58 into overtime and the Seattle Kraken beat the San Jose Sharks 2-1 on Thursday night.Oliver Bjorkstrand had a goal and assist for the Kraken, tying the score with his 15th of the season on a breakaway at 7:03 of the third period.Philipp Grubauer stopped 31 shots, and Dunn extended his point streak to 11 games — especially impressive for a defenseman.“There was a will to him tonight,"" Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said about Dunn. ""You can see his confidence offensively with the puck. At times he controlled some of the play, and maybe fitting that he was the guy to make the play on the winning goal.”Sharks forward William Eklund scored on a penalty shot for his second career goal, both in the last two games. James Reimer was terrific in net, finishing with 30 saves.“It was a good hockey game. A hard game. There wasn’t a lot of room out there. I really liked our effort. I thought we did a lot of good things, just weren’t able to capitalize on some of our chances,"" San Jose coach David Quinn said. ""I thought we defended a lot better tonight. I liked a lot about our game, and it’s unfortunate.”Dunn beat Reimer through the legs to win it.“Just fortunate, I think. Just get it on net and try not to turn it over. If you miss a shot wide, it can turn the other way, and it’s an odd-man rush the opposite way,"" Dunn said. “So for me, just give myself a chance. I think it was a fortunate goal for me. Just kind of caught them on the change a little bit. I think just reading the pre-scout and everything (helped).”Eklund's goal early in the third was the first penalty shot a Sharks player had converted since Logan Couture scored against the Minnesota Wild on March 11, 2019.“It was nice to get a goal,"" Eklund said. ""I was just trying to find my spot there.”Less than six minutes later, Yanni Gourde found Bjorkstrand streaking through the middle of the ice and he beat Reimer over his catching glove.UP NEXTKraken: Host the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday.Sharks: Host the New York Islanders on Saturday.___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838510,"In Israel, TV's dystopian 'Handmaids' is protest fixture","TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — It's become an ominous fixture of the mass anti-government protests roiling Israel: a coil of women in crimson robes and white caps, walking heads bowed and hands clasped. They are dressed as characters from Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel, “The Handmaid's Tale,” and the eponymous TV series.The women, growing in numbers as the demonstrations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies intensify, say they are protesting to ward off what they believe will be a dark future if the government follows through on its plan to overhaul the judiciary.“This display is a representation of the things that we fear,"" said Moran Zer Katzenstein, founder of the women's rights advocacy group Bonot Alternativa, or “building an alternative,” which is behind the Handmaid's protest.""Women are going to be the first to be harmed” under the overhaul, she added.In a move that has sparked widespread opposition, Netanyahu's government is pushing to weaken the Supreme Court and limit the independence of the judiciary, steps they say will restore power to elected legislators and make the courts less interventionist. Critics say the move upends Israel’s system of checks and balances and pushes it toward autocracy.The overhaul has sent tens of thousands of people into the streets in protest each week.Unmissable in the crowd are the women in red robes, turning otherwise usual protest scenes into an otherworldly sight.Ahead of one demonstration, a group of women rode the train from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in costume, transforming the cars and the platform into what could have been a scene from the Hulu series. Another time, they encircled a central fountain in the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv, a site that's typically home to kids in strollers and dogs on leashes. They have also blocked intersections, staying in character during the protests, keeping quiet as they walk in formation.Their jarring appearance is meant to drive home the notion that Israel, which portrays itself as the Middle East’s lone democracy, could morph into a chilling dystopia where women are stripped of their rights.Atwood’s 1985 novel about a futuristic patriarchal society where the robed handmaids are forced to bear children for leaders, has reemerged in recent years as a cultural touchstone thanks to the popular TV series. Its themes of female subjugation and male domination have resonated with women today who see threats in limits on abortion rights, or in Israel’s case, in the rise of its conservative, religious government.The government, Israel's most right-wing ever, is overwhelmingly male. Only nine out of 64 members of Netanyahu’s coalition are women. Ultra-Orthodox parties, which are key components of the coalition, deny inclusion to women members entirely.Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said men and women should not be permitted to serve together in military combat units, while his governing partners have voiced support for discrimination against LGBTQ people and Palestinian citizens of Israel.The costume, which has come to embody globally the threat to women under the patriarchy, has been used in protests elsewhere. American women opposing former President Donald Trump’s conservative Supreme Court nominees have donned the garb, as have Iranian women demonstrating in Britain in support of the protests in Iran, and Polish women calling to preserve abortion rights.But with the crisis in Israel showing no sign of abating, the women in red have become a mainstay at protests around the country and their numbers are growing. About 1,000 women wore the robes at a recent Tel Aviv rally.They're also getting noticed. Atwood herself has retweeted several posts about the women. And Simcha Rothman, the lawmaker and parliamentary committee head spearheading the overhaul, has criticized them, while claiming the legal changes will only strengthen women's rights in Israel.“I am attentive to the protests and demonstrations and happy to give a response to any concern regarding the legal plan. What do I not accept? A scare campaign that incites falsely that Israel will become ‘The Handmaid’s Tale,'” he tweeted earlier this month. “The reform will not harm the protection of women.”Zer Katzenstein, who left a career in marketing for international brands to steer the protest, said that she wouldn't count on Rothman, a religious Jew and conservative ideologue, to protect her rights.The protest is not an exaggeration of where Israel might be headed as some have charged, but rather a warning light, she said.“We don’t think that we (will) wake up and realize that we live in Gilead,"" she said, referring to the name of the fictional republic in Atwood's book.""But we fear that it’s going to be something evolving. First here and then there and another one and another one,"" she added. ""Our message is that we are drawing a red line and we will not let this happen, not even a bit.”",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838511,Stocks fall to cap chaotic week driven by fears about banks,"NEW YORK (AP) — A whipsaw week for Wall Street closed with drops for stocks Friday as worries worsened about the banking industry and fears rose that it could drag the economy into a recession.The S&P 500 sank 1.1%, cutting into its gain for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 384 points, or 1.2%, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%.Markets around the world churned this past week as worries rose following the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. Just a day earlier, markets rallied in relief after two banks in investors' crosshairs bolstered their cash holdings.But on Friday, some of the hope washed out, and the pair went back to falling. In Switzerland, Credit Suisse shares dropped 8%. On Wall Street, shares of First Republic Bank sank nearly 33% to bring their plunge for the week to 71.8%.The two banks have different sets of issues challenging them, but the overriding fear is that the banking system may be cracking under the weight of the fastest set of hikes to interest rates in decades.“If the Fed hikes this far this fast, something will break,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. “There’s a very clear and evident history of that happening, even in slower, smaller rate-hike cycles.”Analysts have been quick to say the current chaos for banks looks nowhere near as bad as the 2007-08 financial crisis that ruined the global economy. But the troubles still feed into concerns about a recession because problems for banks could mean problems for smaller and mid-sized companies getting the loans they need to grow.In “the biggest picture: since 1870 there have been 14 big world recessions, all driven by wars, pandemics & banking crises,” investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a BofA Global Research report.Banks borrowed nearly $165 billion from the Federal Reserve over the last week in a sign of how much stress is in the system.After years of enjoying historically easy conditions, banks are now getting a shock after the Federal Reserve and other central banks jacked up interest rates at a blistering pace. The moves are meant to get the world’s high inflation under control.Higher rates can indeed help tame inflation by slowing the economy, but they raise the risk of a recession later on. They also hurt prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. That latter factor was one of the issues hurting Silicon Valley Bank, which regulators seized a week ago.Since then, Wall Street has tried to root out banks with similar traits to Silicon Valley Bank, such as lots of depositors with more than the $250,000 limit that’s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or lots of tech startups and other highly connected people that can spread worries about a bank’s strength quickly.That's why investors keyed in so much on San Francisco-based First Republic. A group of 11 of the biggest banks on Thursday said they would deposit a combined $30 billion in the bank to show their confidence in it and banks in general. After getting a brief respite Thursday, its stock fell again Friday with other smaller and mid-sized banks.“There’s still a lot of unknowns,” Baird's Mayfield said about what types of investments banks have in their portfolios and how easily they can be turned into cash quickly. “That’s the biggest fear. That’s when markets are typically at their most volatile and most negative. And for most investors who have been in the business for a while, it's hard not to call back to memory 2008, 2009 even if it does look quite different.”Some of the wildest action has been in the bond market, where yields have swung as traders drastically recalibrate bets for where the Fed will take rates.The yield on the two-year Treasury dropped to 3.81% from 4.17% late Thursday. It was above 5% last week and at its highest level since 2007. That's a massive move for the bond market.Traders largely expect this week’s turmoil to push the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at its next meeting by only a quarter of a percentage point. That would be the same sized increase as last month’s and half the hike of 0.50 points that some traders were earlier expecting.A report on Friday gave the Fed possibly more reason to hold off on reaccelerating its rate hikes. Expectations for inflation among U.S. consumers are falling, according to a preliminary survey by the University of Michigan. That's key for the Fed, which has said such expectations can feed into virtuous and vicious cycles.In a more discouraging signal for the economy, confidence also fell. That's at the heart of the most important part of the U.S. economy: consumer spending.Easing expectations for the Fed have helped several Big Tech stocks recently. They've had their own problems, but they tend to benefit from lower interest rates. Partly because of that, the S&P 500 still logged a gain of 1.4% for this past week.All told, the S&P 500 fell 43.64 points Friday to 3,916.64. The Dow fell 384.57 to 31,861.98, and the Nasdaq fell 86.76 to 11,630.51.Cryptocurrencies shot even higher. Bitcoin rose more than 30% this week.___AP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838558,Taiwan's Acer confirms data breach,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwanese technology company Acer confirmed earlier this week that company servers were hacked in February by a hacker using the name Kernelware.The hack was reported over a week ago, but Acer only confirmed this week that a server used by repair technicians was compromised. The company insists that no customer data was stolen in the security breach.According to a report from CPO magazine, Kernelware claims to have obtained 160 GB of data from 655 directories, constituting a total of 2,865 files. The threat actor shared screenshots of some files on a website called BreachForums, and requested a ransom payment in the cryptocurrency Monero.

While the breach may not compromise private customer information, the stolen files include sensitive information about how Acer devices and programs operate. If the files are released to malicious actors, it could create a host of cybersecurity problems and make Acer hardware throughout the world vulnerable to exploitation.Last week, a Swiss cybersecurity firm named Acronis was also targeted by Kernelware, according to a report from Computing. However, the Acronis hack only compromised about 12 GB of data.Acer previously suffered two major hacks in 2021. One was by a group called the REvil ransomware gang, which requested US$50 million (NT$1.53 billion) to protect sensitive financial documents. It is rumored the company paid the ransom price. A second breach happened on Acer systems located in India by a group called Desorden, reported Linux Experten.Some of the Acer data allegedly stolen in 2021 has since resurfaced and is now being auctioned off on hacker forums, as the company now deals with its most recent hack.Acer’s confirmation of its recent data breach comes on the heels of new regulations that were implemented in Taiwan earlier this month. As of March 10, financial regulators will fine listed companies in Taiwan NT$5 million if they fail to disclose major cybersecurity events.",2023/3/17,981,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838612,New Zealand bans TikTok from lawmakers' phones,"New Zealand on Friday banned the short-video sharing app TikTok from devices with access to the country's parliamentary network, citing cybersecurity concerns. The island nation is the latest among several Western countries to ban the app from lawmakers' phones.The ban will come into effect on March 31.Parliamentary Service Chief Executive Rafael Gonzalez-Montero said the risks related to the app were ""not acceptable"" in the current environment.""This decision has been made based on our own experts' analysis and following discussion with our colleagues across government and internationally,"" he said.TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has already been banned on government-issued devices in Canada, Australia, Britain and the US because of concerns that ByteDance shares sensitive user data with the Chinese government. The UK banned it on government-related device less than 24 hours ago. The European Commission has also instructed employees to remove TikTok from their phones. US President Joe Biden has even threatened a complete ban of the app unless it separates from its parent company.Global action against the popular video-sharing app started in India in 2020 when the government banned TikTok as well as over 100 other apps for the entire nation following clashes with China at the border. New Delhi maintained that the ban was to protect the nation's sovereignty and in the interest of national security. Soon after, then-US President Donald Trump called the app out for spying on behalf of the Chinese government.While TikTok has admitted that its employees in China can access details of foreign accounts, it has denied ever turning over data to the government. It blames fundamental misconceptions and wider geopolitics for the regulators banning the app, stressing the $1.5 billion it has spent on security efforts.Gonzalez said special arrangements will be made for lawmakers who need the app to perform their duties and that the platform can still be accessed via browsers.mk/sms (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",2023/3/17,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838613,Footballers at higher risk of dementia,"Elite footballers are more likely to develop dementia than the rest of the population, a new study suggested on Friday.Details of the research, which compared the medical records of more than 6,000 male footballers in Sweden's top division to more than 56,000 non-footballers between 1924 and 2019, were published in The Lancet.Researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden found footballers were 1.5 times more likely to get Alzheimer's disease and other dementias than the control group.Peter Ueda of Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, who led the research, said it shows elite male players is at ""serious risk"" of developing degenerative brain disorders.An exception was goalkeepers, who rarely need to head the ball.""One hypothesis is that the repetitive striking of the ball with the head is the reason players are at greater risk, and seeing the difference between goalkeepers and outfield players supports this theory,"" Ueda said.Gill Livingston, professor in psychiatry of older people at the University College London, said the ""high-quality paper"" added to ""convincing evidence"" that  footballers whose heads come in contact with the ball were at a higher risk of dementia.""We need to act to protect people's heads and brains and keep playing sport,"" said Livingston, who was not involved in the research.The study found no increased risk of motor neuron diseases such as ALS among the footballers and an even slightly lower risk for Parkinson's disease.Ueda cautioned that the observational study was not able to show that playing football directly caused dementia, and its findings could not be extended to female, amateur, or youth football players.""There are more and more voices calling for the sport to introduce more measures to protect brain health and our study may help when making decisions to limit risks,"" added Ueda.Research into head injuries in sports, and post-career side effects, has recently exploded, notably in rugby and American football.Last year a study led by the University of Glasgow found former rugby players were 15 times more likely to develop motor neurone disease than the general population.A 2017 Boston University study found all but one of 111 deceased former National Football League players, who donated their brains for research, had evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).CTE develops after multiple head injuries and can lead to behavioral changes and long-term dementia.The NFL now has a concussion protocol in place for games.It says the protocol is reviewed yearly to ensure that players receive care that reflects the most up-to-date medical consensus on the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of concussions.lo/sms (AFP, EFE, dpa)",2023/3/17,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838623,Taiwan’s Chelpis battles quantum computer attacks,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The next generation of technology, quantum computing, will execute tasks at great speed, defeating security features such as encryption and cryptography that form the backbone of blockchain systems like Bitcoin.To battle quantum computer attacks, security experts have scrambled to develop new data security tools and protocols. New terminology has also emerged, such as post-quantum cryptography (PQC), highlighting the danger all businesses, government agencies, and the public will face in the future.Rapid advancements in this field have given rise to new companies like Chelpis Co., which recently held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a 100-square meter office near Guting MRT Station. The move comes after the company raised NT$61 million (US$2 million) in an initial round of funding in April 2022.A large crowd was on hand to witness the event, including Openfind Chairman and I-Mei Foods CEO Luis Ko (高志明), former Taipei City Deputy Mayor Huang Shanshan (黃珊珊), and other leaders from both the technology sector and government.“I am delighted to provide support to young people involved in technology. I think that they can provide lots of new ideas and creativity. I also want to prevent hacking, and cyber security attacks, which will affect everyone,” said Ko.Later, Chelpis CEO Chih Ming-yang (池明洋) outlined the principles of the “zero trust” ecosystem, which has been widely accepted as the best protection against quantum computer attacks. Chih said that in the future, all participants in a zero trust network will need to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated.Advanced security measures will create a sort of secure information pipeline, or what Chelpis describes as “AORTA,” where endpoint users (EDGE users) on the periphery join the network through notebook computers or cell phones utilizing software encryption, and in the future, chip-enabled security.Chih said Chelpis is developing core software encryption technology useful to many business enterprises. He became interested in cryptography while studying for a master’s degree from National Taiwan University’s College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Many of the company's software team, including Chih, worked together in 2008 at the Cryptography Laboratory of National Taiwan University.End-to-end encryption is needed to prevent quantum computing attacks. (Taiwan News photo)Another member of the leadership team, Chelpis CSO Jason Lu (呂佳諺), has experience leading projects for Trend Micro, a leading anti-virus software security provider. Lu said that many Taiwan companies have a need for post-quantum cryptography, especially those involved in financial services, manufacturing, and government agencies.Lu warned that security attacks can come from a variety of areas, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance technology, and automotive technology. With malicious attacks coming from so many sources, powerful computing chips are required for information security hardware in the next step.In the face of quantum computer attacks from all over the world, especially China, Lu said that Chelpis is keeping one step ahead of malicious cyber attacks with plans to integrate software and hardware to ensure data security.",2023/3/17,580,Business
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838624,"APRC holders, foreign spouses can register for NT$6,000 rebate on March 22","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan nationals and eligible foreign residents can register on March 22 to have a NT$6,000 (US$196) tax surplus payment directly transferred to their bank account.On Thursday (March 16), the Ministry of Finance (MOF) issued a report at a Cabinet meeting announcing that registration for the tax rebates begins March 22. The finance ministry said that in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 10 of the ""special regulations on strengthening economic and social resilience after the pandemic and sharing economic results for all,"" it will distribute cash payments to the public to share in Taiwan's economic gains.The ministry said that, in principle, those who meet the eligibility requirements for disbursement before Oct. 31, can receive a cash payment of NT$6,000. The ministry said the four main groups eligible for the NT$6,000 bonus are as follows:In addition, to allow couples expecting children to share in the ""fruits of economic development,"" families of babies born before the end of this year will also be eligible to receive the tax surplus payment on behalf of their offspring.There are five methods planned to distribute the funds:Individuals who live in the remote townships of Shizi Township in Pingtung County, Wanrong Township in Hualien County, and Jinfeng Township in Taitung County can register for the rebates at their local police stations from March 20-25.On March 22, eligible members of the public can begin registering for the cash handouts on the finance ministry's 6,000 website https://6000.gov.tw. The ministry advised the public to exercise caution and avoid being deceived by fraudsters. In the event of suspected fraud, call the 165 anti-fraud hotline.In a press release Thursday, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA), said that in order to avoid an overload of the website, registration over the first five days, March 22-26, will be limited by the last number of ID cards or residence permit numbers. On each of these days, registration will only be available to holders of ID or residence permits with one of two specific last digits and a lottery will be held on March 20 to determine these numbers.MODA said the registration system is expected to be online for at least six months. The ministry said that beyond the online registration system, the second phase of payments will be via ATMs and the third phase will be direct collection at the post office.In neither of these latter phases is registration on the system necessary, according to MODA. The ministry added that some groups of people, such as recipients of the Labor Insurance Pension, National Pension, Old Age Allowance, Labor Retirement, Disability Allowance, and Low and Middle Income Old Age Allowance, will be credited directly, and no registration is needed.MOF said the special budget has yet to be allocated, and thus the funds cannot yet be credited. It is estimated that the funds will be credited five business days after the budget is approved, and the president announces the date it goes into effect. When this announcement is made, the public can check whether the funds have been deposited in their bank accounts, passbooks, or on the 6,000 website.MODA then included detailed instructions on how to register with the 6,000 website. Once the initial registration is completed, the 6,000 website will present registration results beginning on March 28.The ministry also warned the public to not give their ID cards, residence permits, or health insurance cards to strangers. MODA said that it will send a notification of its NT$6,000 claim via text message or email and people should avoid clicking on any links not associated with the 6,000 website (https://6000.gov.tw).",2023/3/17,7741,Society

The statement also made no mention of Ukraine.Xi will hold a telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy following his Russia visit, according to some media reports. Beijing has not confirmed the call.China and Russia announced a ""no limits"" partnership in February 2022 when Putin visited Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympics, days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering the biggest conflict seen in Europe since World War Two.Beijing and Moscow have since continued to reaffirm the strength of their ties. Bilateral trade has soared since the invasion and China is Russia's biggest buyer of oil, a key source of revenue for Moscow.Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions have fled their homes in Ukraine since the invasion and there is currently no sign of either side actively seeking an end to the conflict.Ukraine has taken issue with Beijing's proposals for not stating that Russia should withdraw behind borders in place since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, though it later said it was open to ""parts of the plan"".Russia welcomed Beijing's initiative and said it would make a ""nuanced study"" of the plan but has also said it sees no sign for now of a peaceful resolution.Moscow says Ukraine must accept its annexation of four regions in the east and south of the country along with the loss of Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula it forcibly annexed in 2014.Russia says its actions in Ukraine are a defensive pushback against a hostile and aggressive West, while Kyiv and its Western allies say they represent an imperial-style land grab.",2023/3/17,160,World

He became Australia’s 46th test skipper after Steve Smith had his captaincy stripped in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal on Australia’s 2018 tour of South Africa.Paine stood down from the captaincy in late 2021 after it was revealed he had sent explicit text messages to a former Cricket Tasmania employee.Paine, who debuted against Pakistan at Lord's in 2010, averaged 32.63 in test matches with a top score of 92 and made 157 dismissals behind the stumps. He also played 35 one-day internationals for Australia.The Hobart-born Paine represented Tasmania over 18 years after debuting in 2005, playing 153 first-class matches.“He has been a phenomenal player, it is an incredible effort to have the longevity that he has had,” Tasmania captain Jordan Silk said. “I’m sure a lot of guys will say there has never been as good a keeper as Tim Paine in Australia.""___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838629,China's Xi to meet Putin as Beijing seeks bolder global role,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to visit Moscow next week, offering a major diplomatic boost to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the same day the International Criminal Court announced it wants to put the Russian leader on trial for alleged war crimes.Xi’s visit was the latest sign of Beijing’s emboldened diplomatic ambitions, and came amid sharpening East-West tensions over the war in Ukraine, now in its 13th month.The U.S. on Friday said it would oppose any effort by China at the meeting to propose a ceasefire in Ukraine as the “ratification of Russian conquest.”White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby encouraged Xi to reach out to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to get his country’s perspective on the war and avoid any “one-sided” proposals.China has sought to project itself as neutral in the conflict, even while it has refused to condemn Moscow’s aggression and declared last year that it had a “no-limits” friendship with Russia. Beijing has denounced Western sanctions against Moscow, and accused NATO and the United States of provoking Putin's military action.Throughout the conflict, China has said the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. It remains unclear, however, whether it sympathizes with Moscow’s claims to seized Ukrainian territory.Russian troops remain bogged down in a battle of attrition, focused now on those areas in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.Xi’s visit would mark his first meeting with Putin since September, when they met on the sidelines of a regional summit in Uzbekistan. Before that, Putin attended the opening of the 2022 Beijing Winter Games and met with Xi shortly before sending troops into Ukraine.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Putin and Xi would have a one-on-one meeting over an informal dinner Monday. Broader talks involving officials from both countries on a range of subjects are scheduled for Tuesday.Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, suggested the talks could yield new approaches to the fighting in Ukraine. “I’m sure that our leader and the Chinese leader will exchange their assessments of the situation"" there, he said. “We shall see what ideas will emerge after that.”Kyiv doesn’t just want Russia to pull back from areas taken since its February 2022 full-scale invasion. Zelenskyy has demanded that Russia also withdraw from the peninsula of Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014 in a move denounced by most of the world as illegal.But Putin has shown no intention of relinquishing the Kremlin’s gains. Instead, he stressed Friday the importance of holding Crimea.“Obviously, security issues take top priority for Crimea and Sevastopol now,” he said, referring to Crimea’s largest city. “We will do everything needed to fend off any threats.”On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang reached out to his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, saying Beijing was concerned about the war spinning out of control and urging talks on a political solution with Moscow.China has “always upheld an objective and fair stance on the Ukraine issue, has committed itself to promoting peace and advancing negotiations, and calls on the international community to create conditions for peace talks,"" Qin said.Kuleba later tweeted that he and Qin “discussed the significance of the principle of territorial integrity.” Ukraine has listed Russia's withdrawal from the occupied areas as the main condition for peace.“I underscored the importance of (Zelenskyy’s) peace formula for ending the aggression and restoring just peace in Ukraine,” wrote Kuleba, who spoke the same day with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.China last month called for a cease-fire and peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. Zelenskyy cautiously welcomed Beijing’s involvement but the overture appeared to go no further.Yurii Poita, head of the Asia section at the Kyiv-based New Geopolitics Research Network, believes the Ukrainian government is going along with China’s involvement because it is reluctant to make another powerful enemy.“Do not antagonize the dragon when you are fighting against a bear,” Poita told The Associated Press.Beijing’s apparent deeper dive into Ukraine issues follows its success last week in brokering talks between Iran and its chief Middle Eastern rival, Saudi Arabia. Those two countries agreed to restore their diplomatic ties after years of tensions.The agreement cast China in a leading role in Middle Eastern politics, a part previously reserved for longtime global heavyweights like the U.S.On the back of that, Xi called for China to play a bigger role in managing global affairs.Washington has marshaled Western military and diplomatic efforts against Putin.On Friday, Kirby told reporters, “A ceasefire now is, again, effectively the ratification of Russian conquest.” It would ”in effect recognize Russia’s gains and its attempt to conquer its neighbor’s territory by force, allowing Russian troops to continue to occupy sovereign Ukrainian territory.”Russia could use a ceasefire to regroup “so that they can restart attacks on Ukraine at a time of their choosing,"" he warned.A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Britain would welcome any genuine effort by China aimed at “restoring sovereignty to Ukraine.”“Any peace deal which is not predicated on Ukraine’s sovereignty and self-determination is not a peace deal at all,” Sunak’s spokesman Jamie Davies said.Nataliia Butyrska, a Ukrainian political analyst, said Beijing’s potential peacemaking role could be clouded by its stance on territorial integrity.“China does not clearly distinguish between who is the aggressor and who is the victim” in Ukraine, she told The AP.China has its own territorial issues, with Taiwan, which it claims as its own, to be brought under its control by force if necessary.U.S.-Russia tensions were further escalated this week with the destruction of a U.S. drone over the Black Sea on Tuesday after an encounter with Russian fighter jets, although that also prompted the first conversations since October between the countries' defense and military chiefs.Putin invited Xi to visit Russia during a video conference call the two held in late December. The visit, Putin said, could “demonstrate to the whole world the strength of the Russian-Chinese ties” and “become the main political event of the year in bilateral relations.”Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday that Xi and Putin will discuss “bilateral relations and major international and regional issues of common concern....""“Currently, the world is entering a new period of turbulence and reform with the accelerated evolution of changes of the century,” he added."" As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and important major countries, the significance and impact of the China-Russia relations go far beyond the bilateral sphere.”The arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court at The Hague accused Putin of involvement in abductions of children from Ukraine to Russia. It also issued a warrant for his commissioner for children's right, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova.The court has no police force of its own to enforce warrants, and the Kremlin has said it doesn’t recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.___Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this story.—-Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine-war",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838630,Scholar explains Taiwan's continued balancing act against China,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s balancing act against China is the best way forward, Dr. T.Y. Wang (王德育), a distinguished visiting scholar at National Chengchi University’s Election Study Center, said Tuesday (March 14).

            Balancing is “the posture and policy of a nation or group of nations protecting itself against another nation or group of nations by matching its power against the power of the other side,” according to Britannica.

            Wang told Taiwan News that balancing is the “optimal” tactic for Taiwan because it serves as a form of deterrence, though it requires the nation to “redistribute scarce resources on defense.” He said that President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) has been building up Taiwan’s military and deepening ties with the U.S. and Japan.

            Previous presidents were unable to form such close unofficial relationships with other countries, he said, but the international environment is more favorable for President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to do so.











            Wang said Chinese nationalist sentiment is the driving force behind Beijing’s motivation to attack Taiwan, not the number of weapons or support Taiwan receives from the U.S. Another factor is Beijing's determination, he said.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) has shown that he wants to have a legacy and he has repeatedly stressed that the cross-strait dispute cannot be passed down from generation to generation, Wang said.

            “Xi wants to show that he was able to unify China. Taiwan is the last piece of the puzzle,” he said.

Strategic ambiguity still effective

            However, Taiwan has become part of the U.S. and its Western allies’ grand strategy of restricting China’s expansion, Wang said. In addition to strengthening partnerships such as QUAD and AUKUS, the U.S. is selling more advanced and mobile weapons to Taiwan and training Taiwanese troops in tactical maneuvering, he said.

            These actions are part of Washington’s efforts to prove to Beijing it will use force if a conflict erupts in the Taiwan Strait, Wang said. At the same time, Washington also needs “convincing assurances” to maintain an effective deterrence strategy, he said.

            One example of this is the U.S. refusal to support Taiwan independence. If Washington recognized Taiwan as a sovereign nation, “Beijing leaders are going to respond very violently,” Wang said.

            China would no longer have the incentive to comply with America’s demands. Thus, strategic ambiguity is still the best policy at the moment, he argued.

            Commenting on the state of cross-strait relations, Wang said there has been an “oscillation” in ties over many decades, referring to the ups and downs of the situation in the Taiwan Strait. During the height of the Cold War, relations between Taiwan and China were extremely tense, but by the 1970s, things became slightly better as China’s objective changed from liberating Taiwan to peaceful unification, he explained.

Cross-strait ties bind

            Ties between Taiwan and China all depend on “how Beijing leaders perceive the Taipei government,” Wang explained. “When they see Taipei taking a more independent approach, they tend to be more confrontational and tense, and put more pressure.”

            “A lot of those tense relationships were initiated by the Beijing government as a reaction towards Taipei’s policy,” he said. Beijing is essentially trying to create a new normal, which comes with frequent provocations, he added. “These can cause accidents, and they can escalate.”

            The professor described China as “very inflexible” when it comes to dialogue with Taiwan because it has boxed itself in with its ""one China policy."" “They cannot jump out of that principle.”

            He added the ball is now in China’s court and that it is “up to Beijing on how they want to play in the future.”

Lessons from Ukraine

            In terms of expanding Chinese authoritarianism, Wang said Beijing wants to portray its style of governance as an alternative to Western democracy. It uses examples such as the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack to paint democracy as a chaotic system, he said.

            China intends to restructure the international order but so far, there haven’t been any takers, he said. Nevertheless, it continues to gradually expand its sphere of influence, such as in Latin America.

            If a cross-strait conflict were to break out, Wang said he does not believe it will become World War III, as keeping it a local conflict is in the best interests of all involved parties.

            In the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. has tried to limit it to a regional war, he said. It is providing key security support but does not plan to have boots on the ground in order to prevent a conflict between two major powers.

            In the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. and China are all trying to avoid a war in the first place, Wang said.

            The war in Ukraine has also shown that “Taiwan needs to have the self-determination to defend itself,” he said. “The U.S. has no appetite to get involved directly in a cross-strait conflict.”

            Taiwan must find a way to maintain a sustainable defense to protect its own democracy, democratic way of life, and economic prosperity, Wang said. Ukrainians have shown that with a strong and determined defensive force, support from abroad will come, he said.

Taiwan must help itself

            Aside from bolstering its defense capabilities, Taiwan should also continue a pragmatic diplomacy of expanding its visibility on the international stage, Wang said, noting that Taiwan is handicapped by Beijing’s diplomatic isolation tactics.

            The professor also advised Taiwan to safeguard its democratic system, which is the most important weapon in the fight against authoritarianism. “If Taiwan is no longer a democracy, there is no reason for the U.S. to help Taiwan,” he said.

            Taiwan’s strategic importance also plays a major role in the U.S. and Western allies’ efforts to restrict China’s expansion, as it is located in the middle of the first island chain, he said. U.S. President Joe Biden has been able to internationalize the cross-strait conflict despite China’s claim that Taiwan affairs are an internal matter.

            Wang said he believes Taiwan’s situation is “certainly better” than before but whether that will continue “remains to be seen.” In the joint statements issued between the U.S. and Japan, South Korea, and other allies, they all voiced concerns about cross-strait tensions in recent years, Wang said, which shows that regional peace and stability are global concerns.

            Ultimately, Taiwanese “must help themselves first,” Wang said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838631,"SKorea, Japan business leaders vow to boost cooperation","TOKYO (AP) — South Korea and Japan should collaborate more on advanced technology, climate change and economic security, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Friday, looking ahead after the two sides agreed to put aside rancor over trade and historical issues.""I think there is a lot of room for cooperation between the two countries in future high-tech new industries such as digital transformation, semiconductors, batteries, and electric vehicles,” Yoon told a gathering in Tokyo of business leaders from both countries.“The governments of the two countries will do everything to help you interact freely and create innovative business opportunities,” Yoon said.The meeting followed talks between Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday that sought to turn a page on the longstanding grievances that have divided the two U.S. allies. South Korea and Japan are seeking now to form a united front, driven by shared concerns over North Korea, China and Russia.During Yoon’s visit, the first such formal summit hosted by Japan in 12 years, South Korea announced it was dropping its complaint to the World Trade Organization alleging Japan’s unfair trade practices, while Tokyo said it will lift the export controls on high-tech goods crucial for computer-chips production, imposed in 2019, on shipments to South Korea.Yoon Suk Yeol was the guest of honor at the Tokyo “business round-table” over a lunch of French cuisine attended by about a dozen business leaders from both nations.Reiji Takehara, director of the International Cooperation Bureau at Keidanren, said the mood was very positive at Friday’s hour-and-a-half-long meeting, which was closed to media except for the opening remarks.“There was a lot of laughter, and everyone was friendly. We didn’t sense even a tiny bit of tension,” Takehara told reporters.The South Korean group was led by Kim Byong-joon, acting chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries, the nation’s top business group, who traveled with Yoon. Executives from Samsung Electronics, Hyundai and LG were also part of the entourage.Yoon joked about his love for Japanese food and stressed there was “light at the end of a long tunnel” of troubled relations, according to a Japanese official who briefed reporters after the meeting at Keidanren Kaikan, the headquarters of Japan’s top business lobby.Challenges remain.

Representatives from those companies did not attend Friday’s meeting.Japan has refused to pay, stressing compensation issues were settled by a 1965 treaty.Yoon's announcement that local funds will be used to compensate the victims, effectively lifting pressure on the Japanese companies, drew protests from those who suffered under Japan’s forced labor system and their advocates. They want payments from Japan and a fresh apology.A shift toward more cordial ties between Seoul and Tokyo was strongly backed by the U.S. The White House applauded Kishida and Yoon’s meeting.“And the United States will continue, of course, to support Japan and the ROK as they take steps to translate this new understanding into enduring progress,” said White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.The Keidanren and the Federation of Korean Industry have set up a $200 million ($1.5 million) fund to promote exchanges among young people, Takehara said.Since the normalization of relations in 1965, Japan has provided more than 100 billion yen ($750 million) in economic cooperation and aid, according to Japanese estimates.Trade between the two countries accounts for no more than 10% of their total trade, suggesting there is room to grow. Despite friction at the government level, tourism has boomed, with travelers from each country being No. 2 in foreign visitors. So have informal cultural exchanges in the form of K-pop, anime and manga.“The aim is to strengthen our partnership for the future,” Masakazu Tokura, chairman of Keidanren and Sumitomo Chemical Co., told reporters.___Aamer Madhani contributed to this report from Washington.Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838632,Rahul leads India past Australia by 5 wickets in 1st ODI,"MUMBAI, India (AP) — India bowled out Australia for 188 and overcame an early wobble to win by five wickets with 10.1 overs to spare in the first of three one-day internationals on Friday.India's reply was in jeopardy at 39-4 but Lokesh Rahul anchored winning partnerships of 44 with Hardik Pandya and an unbeaten 108 with Ravindra Jadeja.India finished on 191-5.Without run rate pressure, Rahul led with 75 not out off 91 balls.Jadeja was named man of the match for his two wickets and unbeaten 45.The second ODI is on Sunday at Visakhapatnam. Both teams are building to the Cricket World Cup in India in October.Mitchell Marsh made light of the bowler-friendly pitch and gave Australia hope with 81 off 65 balls. He struck 10 fours and five sixes.He and Steve Smith (22) put on 72 for the second wicket until Smith was caught behind off Pandya.Marsh added another 52 runs with Marnus Labuschagne (15) by attacking Kuldeep Yadav's wrist spin.But when Marsh mishit a wide delivery by Jadeja and was caught at short third man, Australia collapsed from 129-3 to 188 all out in the space of 16 overs.The visitors lost eight wickets for 59 runs.Labuschagne fell to Yadav, and fast bowler Mohammed Shami returned for a second spell to wreak havoc.In three consecutive overs, Shami bowled Josh Inglis (26) and Cameron Green (12), while Marcus Stoinis (5) was caught behind. Shami's burst of 3-17 in six overs left the Australia innings in tatters at 184-7 in the 32nd over.Jadeja finished with 2-46 and Mohammed Siraj finished things off with a double blow as Australia lost its last four wickets for four runs in the space of 25 balls.Siraj took 3-29 in 5.4 overs.Chasing a paltry total, India faltered as the Australia pacers made good use of swing conditions.Stoinis (2-27) trapped Ishan Kishan for 3, and Mitchell Starc bowled a fiery opening spell. Starc got Virat Kohli lbw for 4, and dismissed Suryakumar Yadav similarly for a first-ball duck in the fifth over.India was 16-3 and Shubman Gill survived a close lbw shout off Sean Abbott. But Starc (3-49) had Gill caught at slip later on as the hosts slumped to 39-4 in 10.2 overs.India was batted out of danger by Rahul, who was composed and overcame poor form to reach 50 off 73 balls. Overall, he faced 91 deliveries, hitting seven fours and a six.At the other end, Jadeja also played a chanceless knock as the duo brought up a 100-run partnership off 119 balls.Jadeja faced 69 balls, and his fifth boundary, off Starc through midwicket, got India over the finish line. ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838638,US says video shows Russian jet intercepted spy drone near Ukraine,"WASHINGTON/NEAR BAKHMUT, Ukraine, March 17 (Reuters) - The Pentagon released a video on Thursday that it said provided evidence a Russian fighter jet clipped the propeller of a U.S. spy drone and caused it to crash into the Black Sea this week, despite Russia's denial.The 40-second-long video was filmed by the MQ-9 Reaper drone as it conducted regular reconnaissance in international airspace two days ago near Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Moscow forcibly annexed in 2014.The video showed what the Pentagon said were two Russian Su-27 fighter jets swooping toward the drone and releasing jet fuel on it in harassing behaviour. After a second pass by the jets, the video cuts out then resumes with images of the drone's damaged propeller.U.S. officials have accused the Russian jets of acting in an unsafe manner. Russia has denied any collision took place and said the drone went down after making ""sharp manoeuvres"", having ""provocatively"" flown close to Russian air space.Highlighting the risk of a Russia-U.S. clash, Moscow contended the air encounter showed the U.S. was directly involved in the Ukraine conflict, something Washington has taken pains to avoid for fear of worsening tensions between the two nuclear powers.The Pentagon said it had indications Russia was trying to recover debris from the drone, which would be difficult to recover in very deep water. Russia said on Wednesday it would try to retrieve the remains but appeared to acknowledge the challenges.Washington has said the drone no longer carried any valuable intelligence.China, which has not condemned Russia for invading Ukraine, said it was concerned about the war intensifying and hoped Moscow and Kyiv would hold peace talks.WAR CRIMES PROBEInvestigations by an international panel said some of Russia's actions since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, may be crimes against humanity. Russia dismissed the report released on Thursday, which said crimes included wilful killings and torture.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made no direct reference to the United Nations-mandated report in his nightly video address. He spoke in remembrance of those killed in the Russian bombing of a theatre in the southern city of Mariupol one year ago.""Russian bombs destroyed the Mariupol theatre, a building used as a shelter. Women and children were inside. Some people were pregnant, others elderly,"" Zelenskiy said.No one knows the death toll for certain.Moscow denies deliberately targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions, pulverised Ukrainian cities, shaken the global economy and created a Cold War chill in international relations.""The day will come when those guilty of war crimes against Ukraine will appear in the halls of the International Criminal Court and in national courtrooms,"" Zelenskiy said.BAKHMUT FIGHTINGZelenskiy also made no direct reference to Bakhmut, the focal point for eight months of Russian attempts to advance through the industrial Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine bordering Russia.Ukrainian forces were withstanding Russian assaults on the ruined city. Reuters reporters roughly 1.5 km (1 mile) from the front lines could hear the constant boom of artillery and the crackle of small arms fire.Ihor, a 36-year-old soldier at the mortar position, said Ukrainian forces had been targeted by air strikes, mortar fire and tank shelling.""You don't always check on what's flying over your head,"" he added, crouching in a deep trench.Bakhmut has become Europe's bloodiest infantry battle since World War Two. Russian forces led by the Wagner private army have captured the city's eastern part but have so far failed to encircle it.""The situation in the city of Bakhmut remains on the brink of critical,"" Oleh Zhdanov, a Ukrainian military analyst, said in a YouTube presentation. ""Russian forces are hitting the same areas over and over again.""Another Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan, told Ukrainian NV Radio: ""There is no point in withdrawing from the city right now. There is no danger now of encirclement. So we should hold not just Bakhmut, but also the line associated with Bakhmut.""Russia has said it targeted Ukrainian infrastructure as part of what it calls its ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian military and remove what it says is a potential threat to its own security.Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of an unprovoked war to grab territory from its pro-Western neighbour.GRAIN EXPORT DEALThe United Nations backed Turkey and Ukraine by calling for a 120-day rollover of an agreement allowing the safe export of grain from several Ukrainian Black Sea ports.Russia has said it would only extend the pact for 60 days without specifically saying why, although it has complained its own food and fertilizer exports are being hindered by Western sanctions.Russia also said it might take over Toyota's 7203.T St Petersburg plant, state-run TASS new agency reported, after the Japanese car maker decided last year to end vehicle production in Russia due to supply chain disruptions in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.NAMI, Russia's Central Automobile and Engine Research and Development Institute, has already snapped up plants from Renault and Nissan.",2023/3/17,127,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838639,China Lilang Announces 2022 Annual Results,"Revenue at RMB3,086 Million Net Profit at RMB448 Million  Total Dividend for the year at HK32 Cents Per Share   HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 17 March 2023 -  China Lilang Limited (""China Lilang"" or the ""Company"", together with its subsidiaries the ""Group""; stock code: 1234) has today announced its 2022 annual results.   Mr. Wang Dong Xing, Chairman and Executive Director of China Lilang, said,   ""In 2022, lockdowns and control measures were imposed one after another to address the fluctuating coronavirus pandemic, slowing down economic development and, at the same time, dampening consumer sentiment as in-store shopping and social activities were refrained, of which the apparel industry bore the brunt with negative growth recorded in retail sales of apparel for the year. Operating in such a challenging business environment, the Group actively responded to the changing market by continuously facilitating new retail business, promoting sales and driving store efficiency.""   In 2022, the Group's revenue decreased by 8.7% year-on-year to RMB3,086 million. Net profit decreased by 4.3% year-on-year to RMB448 million, mainly due to the decrease in overall revenue as the Pandemic weighed heavily on the offline retail business, with certain stores being temporarily suspended due to the pandemic prevention and control measures, and rebates provided to distributors by the Group during the year. The gross profit margin was 46.0%, representing an increase of 4.1 percentage points year-on-year, which was primarily attributable to the inventory provision of RMB120 million recorded in 2021 and the writeback of inventory provision of RMB22.26 million during the year. Earnings per share were RMB37.42 cents, down by 4.3%.   During the year, the Group maintained a healthy financial position with sufficient cash flow. The Board of Directors recommended payment of a final dividend of HK9 cents per share and a special final dividend of HK5 cents per share, together with the interim dividend already distributed, the total dividend for the year amounted to HK32 cents per share, maintaining a stable payout ratio.   The Group actively develop the business in WeChat Mall during the year to take advantage of the interactive features of the social platform and capitalise on the complementary advantages of online and offline services, thus driving store efficiency growth. The Group gradually transformed its online sales service from a channel for off-season inventory clearance to a platform mainly for advertising its brand image, and promoted sales through sales promotion, e-commerce live streaming and other campaigns, such as the launch of pants hot products on e-commerce platforms during the 618 E-Commerce Shopping Festival and the premier launch of quality and hot items, hydrophobic downs, online prior to the Double 11 Shopping Festival. Although retail sales decreased by 0.4% under a stagnant market, a significant increase in gross profit was recorded mainly due to higher unit price of new product sales and sales proportion of new products increased. The new retail business started generating net profit.   However, physical stores' sales were strongly affected by the Pandemic, the Group decisively closed certain underperforming stores and slowed down its plan to open new stores, thus falling short of the target of maintaining the same number of stores throughout the year as the beginning of the year. As of the end of the previous year, the Group had 2,644 stores, representing a decrease of 89 stores as compared to the end of 2021. The Group further optimised its nationwide sales network by relocating approximately 50 stores to premium locations of first- and second-tier cities, so as to enhance store efficiency and utilisation of store space.   Thus far, nearly 40% of core collection stores are operating under the consignment model. During the year, the Group continued to consolidate and develop its nationwide sales network through long-term partnership with distributors, in order to reach more consumers across China. At the same time, the Group pragmatically supported distributors in optimizing the retail network by opening stores in carefully selected quality shopping malls and prime shop locations. The Group also promoted increased usage of the WeChat platform in physical stores to achieve higher store efficiency. On the other hand, smart casual collection stores and online stores were converted to direct-to-retail mode in 2020 and 2021, respectively. By the end of 2022, the Group had a total of 251 smart casual collection stores, and other stores were operated the other stores were operated by distributors or sub-distributors respectively.   With respect to inventory management, despite weaker sales caused by the volatile Pandemic situation, the effort put into inventory clearance by the Group was effective, and the inventory balance during the year approximated that of last year.   On the brand promotion front, the Group has been on the forefront of the apparel industry by promoting its key products with the newly-created virtual ambassador, Li Li, so as to show China Lilang's brand concepts with simple menswear and attract young consumers' attention. Moreover, the Group continued to work with its brand ambassador, Han Han, by being the official menswear partner for his new film ""Only Fools Rush In"" and launching co-branding products with him and the  Chinese National Geography magazine. China Lilang has also co-partnered with artist Cao Yu (Leo), and LESS IS MORE has formed a co-branding partnership with the science fiction,  The Three-Body Universe, for its shop image.   Looking ahead to 2023, the Pandemic situation has gradually stabilised, foot traffic has increased significantly, and social and economic activities are picking up. Besides, multiple provinces and cities have introduced intensive policies to promote consumption, providing strong support to boost market confidence and consumption levels. The Group maintains a wait-and-see attitude towards the retail market in the first half of next year, but adopts a cautiously optimistic outlook on the full year.   China Lilang will adopt a prudent store opening approach to improve its sales network. The Group is aiming for a net increase of approximately 100 stores in the next year, and plans to continue to open stores in quality shopping malls in provincial capitals and prefecture level cities. The Group will also open more stores at outlet malls and use them as the default channel for inventory clearance. The Group aims to grow its total retail sales for the year 2023 by 10% or more.   The Group will step up efforts to promote its new retail business, cultivate the business model of selling at online stores and delivery to offline stores, and introduce better services, to provide more convenient and satisfactory shopping experiences to customers. Instead of being just a channel of the Group for inventory clearance, online stores will also become an important tool for the Group to launch new products. It is expected that in 2023, proportion of new products sold from e-commerce will further increase. Together with precise online promotions, the Group will drive traffic and cultivate customer loyalty, and thereby promote growth in online sales, striving to achieve significant growth in sales from e-commerce business during the year.   Chairman Wang Dong Xing concluded:   ""The Pandemic has accelerated the market consolidation of the retail sector and realised the principle of the survival of the fittest. As a capable menswear enterprise, China Lilang will continue to adhere to its strategy of providing products that offer excellent value for money in the following year in a bid to strengthen its product competitiveness. The efforts made during the past few years enabled the Group to build internally a strong supply chain and inventory management capabilities and to add externally channels of consignment model, retail and e-commerce along with the original distributor model. All of the new channels have been on the right track and recorded profits. In the long run, the Group determines to further consolidate its leading position in China's menswear industry and realise sustainable long-term growth, which in turn will enable it to reward shareholders, staff members and customers for their support.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838650,"Asian markets take breather from banking turmoil, capping tumultuous week","SYDNEY, March 17 (Reuters) - Asian markets extended a risk rally on Wall Street on Friday to end a tumultuous week that saw a brewing banking crisis send bond yields plunging while market participants sharply lowered expectations of future interest rate hikes in Western economies.
The optimism is set to spill over to Europe, with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.6%. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% while Nasdaq futures gained 0.2%.
Overnight, the European Central Bank (ECB) delivered an inflation-fighting 50 basis point rate hike in line with oft-repeated guidance, with sentiment buttressed by the Swiss National Bank's massive support for Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S), which sent the troubled lender's shares 20% higher.
Further helping sentiment, as many as 11 U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) will deposit as much as $30 billion into First Republic Bank (FRC.N).
In an indicator that not all worries have gone away, the bank's shares, which had closed 10% higher after a volatile day that saw trading halted 17 times, slumped by 17% in after-market trading.
Also, data showed overnight that banks sought record amounts of emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve over recent days, underscoring the scale of stress in the financial system.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) surged 1.6% on Friday, helping reverse earlier losses to be up 0.7% on the week. Japan's Nikkei (.N225) climbed 1.2%.
China's bluechips (.CSI300) jumped 1.3%% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (.HSI) rose 1.8%, after data showed that housing prices in China eked out a more decisive gain in February, confirming an economic recovery.
Meanwhile, global central bankers on Thursday introduced what market watchers interpreted as an emerging effort to firewall the rate increases needed to fight inflation from separate efforts to calm concern about financial stability.
After hiking as indicated, the ECB refrained from providing guidance on future rate hikes. Euribor futures have fully priced in a quarter-point hike to 3.25% at the ECB's next policy meeting and the possibility of another.
Goldman Sachs now sees rates peaking at 3.5%, compared with a previous forecast of 3.75%.
Markets are also back to overwhelmingly pricing in another 25 basis point hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve at its meeting next week, though there is a 20% chance of the Fed pausing instead.
""Headlines screaming that the U.S. has seen the biggest bank collapse since 2008 naturally engender fears of a re-run of the GFC. However, the situation today is radically different to 2008,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Bank, referring to the global financial crisis.
""Whether it's the sort of crisis that in the past has ended and then reversed Fed monetary tightening is still unclear.""
Two-year Treasury yields continued to climb on Friday and were last up 5 basis points to 4.1762%, pulling away from a six-month low of 3.7200% touched earlier this week. Yields were, however, headed for a weekly decline of 41 basis points, the steepest since February 2020 when markets were thrown into chaos by COVID-19 fear.
Ten-year yields were mostly steady at 3.5600% on Friday and were set for a weekly decline of 13 basis points.
The U.S. dollar reversed some of its safe-harbour flows, with the dollar index last down 0.3% to 104.4.
The Japanese yen gained 0.6% to 132.93 per dollar while the euro rose 0.4% to $1.0647.
Officials from Japan's Ministry of Finance, Financial Services Agency and Bank of Japan will meet at 0745 GMT on Friday to discuss financial market developments.
""The past week has provided an unwelcome reminder of the inherent fragility of banking systems,"" said analysts at Capital Economics in a note to client.
""There is still a great deal of uncertainty. The key question is whether this episode proves another relatively brief period of volatility that soon dies down, or the first tremors of a major banking crisis. At this stage, the answer is unknowable.""
Oil prices reversed earlier losses to be up 1% on Friday, although they were headed for a 10% fall for the week. U.S. crude rose 1.0% at $69.06 a barrel, while Brent crude also jumped by 1% to $75.5 per barrel.
Gold was slightly higher.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838666,Montenegro presidential vote seen as test of future policies,"PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Montenegro is preparing to hold a presidential election this weekend, a vote taking place amid a political stalemate that has stalled the small NATO member's bid to join the European Union and questions about whether the Balkan country will align more closely with Serbia and Russia.Analysts predict Sunday's election will not produce a clear winner and that pro-Western incumbent Milo Djukanovic, 61, will face one of several challengers in a runoff two weeks later.Djukanovic and his Democratic Party of Socialists led Montenegro to independence from Serbia in 2006, and defied Russia to join NATO in 2017. An alliance dominated by parties seeking closer ties with Serbia and Russia ousted DPS from power in 2020.The presidency is largely ceremonial in Montenegro but the election result holds political weight because of the country's political turmoil and the war in Ukraine. It is also crucial for the political future of Djukanovic, the longest-serving politician in the Balkans.Djukanovic dissolved parliament on Thursday, three months after the government fell in a no-confidence vote. The party whose candidate eventually wins the presidency could receive a significant boost in the early parliamentary election that Djukanovic on Friday set for June 11.Djukanovic's opponents on Sunday include a leader of the staunchly pro-Serbia and pro-Russia Popular Front party, Andrija Mandic, economist Jakov Milatovic of the newly-formed Europe Now group and former parliament speaker Aleksa Becic.Observers say Milatovic, who served in the government formed after the 2020 parliamentary vote but later split from the ruling coalition, may stand the best chance of making it into the runoff against Djukanovic.Who wins could signal Montenegro's future direction, said Ana Nenezic, executive director of the Center for Monitoring and Research, a think tank. “That is, whether further foreign policy priorities will be focused on unblocking the process of European integration, strengthening cooperation with EU countries and membership in NATO.”“The success of the clerical-populist parties, or in this case, the candidates, could lead to strengthening of ties with the Eastern powers and a move away from the European perspective,” she said.Djukanovic, who has served as Montenegro's president or prime minister since 1991, saw his popularity plummet after DPS narrowly lost the 2020 parliamentary election. But with the current government in disarray, Djukanovic hopes to regain voter support.“We decide at the presidential election whether Montenegro will continue to develop as a free, modern, civic European state or, contrary to its centuries-old tradition, will accept to serve the interests of others,” Djukanovic said during campaigning.The political chaos and stalled reforms in a country long seen as the next in line for European Union membership has alarmed U.S. and EU officials, who fear Russia could try to stir trouble in the Balkans to divert attention from the war in Ukraine.Montenegro's 620,000 citizens remain deeply divided among supporters of Djukanovic's policies and those who view themselves as Serbs and want Montenegro to ally itself with Serbia and fellow-Slavic Russia.The Popular Front party's Mandic, who was accused of being part of a 2016 coup attempt, has sought to present himself as a conciliatory figure during the campaign, saying his main goal as president would be to bridge the Montenegrin divide.Milatovic, the economist, has accused Djukanovic and his DPS party of corruption, saying the president's final removal from power is necessary for Montenegro to move forward.Montenegro has some 540,000 eligible voters. The country is known for its stunning natural beauty consisting of wild mountains and a popular Adriatic Sea coastline.",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838667,Hurricanes beat Waratahs 34-17 in Super Rugby Pacific,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The Wellington-based Hurricanes pulled away after a tight first half on Friday to beat the New South Wales Waratahs 34-17 in a fourth round match in Super Rugby Pacific.Scrumhalf Cam Roigard and debuting winger Kini Naholo scored two tries each as the Hurricanes improved their record to 3-1, staying inside the top four.Both teams scored two tries in the first half as the lead passed from one team to the other on four occasions.The Hurricanes then scored three tries in the second half through Roigard, Naholo and veteran hooker Dane Coles. The Waratahs scored the last try through Wallabies backrower Langi Gleeson to deny the Hurricanes a bonus point.“We talked about starting well and trying to be clinical and I thought we did that,” Hurricanes captain Ardie Savea said. Savea returned to the starting 15 after a one-week suspension.“But once again it was hard work against the Waratahs, both teams smarting from (losses) last week,"" Savea said. ""We would have liked the five points but their late try stopped us getting there.”In fact, the Waratahs started best. They chose to play into a swirling breeze and went on to attack from the kickoff and spent long periods inside the Hurricanes half. Overall they had 69% of territory in the first half.After an early penalty by Jordie Barrett for the Hurricanes, the Waratahs rocked the home side with the first try of the match through Nadolo. Nadolo pounced on a wayward pass and had too much pace and power to be stopped from reaching the left corner.Roigard’s first try retrieved the lead for the Hurricanes but the Waratahs went in front again with a try to Max Jorgensen. The 18-year-old Jorgensen touched down for the fourth time in as many matches, showing athleticism to dive over the corner flag and score.Once again the Hurricanes rallied and scored through Naholo to take a 17-12 lead to halftime. Naholo was making is debut for the Hurricanes after previously playing for the Chiefs and Crusaders.Roigard scored the first try of the second half, picking up a dropped pass by the Waratahs and kicking ahead for Roigard who just won the race to the ball.Naholo’s second in the 55th minute made the Hurricanes’ lead 29-12 and when Coles dived over in the 70th minute, the match was safe at 34-12. Gleeson’s intercept try gave the Waratahs the last say.It was the only Super Rugby match scheduled Friday.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838668,German leader says China should not use force to change Taiwan status quo,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview with Nikkei that China should not resort to force to alter the Taiwan status quo.

            Scholz spoke with the outlet in Berlin ahead of a visit to Japan on March 18, where the two countries will hold their first Japan-Germany Inter-Governmental Consultations, a new framework for regular talks between Tokyo and Berlin. The talks will cover a wide range of topics, but will focus on deterring China and Russia, Nikkei cited officials from both countries as saying.

            When asked about a potential war over Taiwan, Schulz told Nikkei, “Just like the U.S., Japan, and many other countries, we abide by the ‘one China’ policy.” But the chancellor also warned China, “We also make it clear that force must not be used in order to change the status quo.”

            China has been a major component of Germany’s Asia policy, especially in terms of trade, but after the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced Berlin to cut its use of Russian energy, the country has become wary of becoming overly reliant on any one country.











            The outlet said this has influenced Berlin’s new China policy, which the cabinet is expected to approve soon. However, Scholz said that Germany does not intend to decouple from China, due to its importance as a great economic power, adding, “It is a partner, a competitor and systemic rival at the same time.”

            Scholz said that while Berlin will continue to do business with China, it will also continue to develop relations with other partners in Asia.

            Germany’s shift in policy could be a sign of things to come across Europe, as some European business community insiders told Nikkei that it is getting more difficult to make large-scale investments in China. These insiders also said that while countries will continue to do business with Beijing, tougher restrictions will likely be placed on advanced technology exports and other areas to China.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview with Nikkei that China should not resort to force to alter the Taiwan status quo.Scholz spoke with the outlet in Berlin ahead of a visit to Japan on March 18, where the two countries will hold their first Japan-Germany Inter-Governmental Consultations, a new framework for regular talks between Tokyo and Berlin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838669,Mozambicans march to honor protest rapper after his death,"MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambicans are planning marches across the country to honor Azagaia, a popular protest rapper and fierce government critic, who died last week.Memorial marches are planned in every major city on Saturday for the musician who died after an epileptic seizure at the age of 38.The nationwide demonstrations follow Azagaia’s funeral procession on Wednesday, in which thousands marched through the streets of Maputo, the capital, chanting protest slogans such as “resistance” and “power to the people.”Riot police used tear gas to disperse the crowd as it tried to carry Azagaia’s coffin past Ponta Vermelha, the official residence of the president.Such mass demonstrations critical of President Filipe Nyusi's government are rare in Mozambique.“Azagaia was a hero of the people. More of a hero than the president, that is why we are taking him to the president’s house,” said Walter, a demonstrator who refused to give his last name for his safety. Speaking before the procession was dispersed, he said: “Nothing like this (march) has ever happened before.”Azagaia, whose real name was Edson da Luz, was known for openly condemning government corruption in his music and garnered a large following, particularly among young people.Commemorative marches are planned on Saturday in all of Mozambique’s 11 provinces, with tens of thousands expected to attend. However, police have refused to authorize a demonstration in the northern province of Cabo Delgado where the government has been fighting an Islamic extremist insurgency since 2017.Authorities have told organizers in Cabo Delgado's cities of Montepuez and Pemba that marches may be allowed on another day when public emotions have calmed down.Mozambique has sometimes seen protests over the prices of fuel and bread but such mass demonstrations celebrating opposition activists are unusual.The day after Azagaia died, a vigil was held in Maputo where hundreds came to hear tributes, many of which explicitly criticised the ruling party Frelimo.”(Azagaia) never sided with any political party because he was the voice of the people,” Tirso Sitoe, an organiser of the vigil, told The Associated Press. “He showed us that things have not changed since independence (in 1975). The only thing that has changed is the colour of (the rulers’) skin.”Azagaia achieved a passionate following, and notoriety, with songs such as “Povo no Poder” (""Power to the People"") which was released in 2008 during protests over rising fuel prices. The rapper accused politicians of stealing from ordinary people to fund their lives of luxury. It has since become an anthem of opposition to the government. Other songs commented on issues such as police brutality and drug trafficking.In recognition of his popularity, Mozambican officials paid tribute to Azagaia.“Mozambican music and culture are in mourning,” Mozambique’s minister of culture, Eldevina Materula, said.Nonetheless, while he was alive Azagaia was often treated with hostility by the government. His songs were generally censored on state media and the Attorney General’s Office accused him of inciting violence following the release of “Povo no Poder.”",2023/3/17,,World

Aboard were people from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and other countries who were seeking a better quality of life in Europe. It broke apart in rough waters off Calabria, killing Raza and at least 66 others.Raza's funeral and burial took place in Quetta, the capital of southwestern Baluchistan province, a day after her body was repatriated from Italy with help from the country's Foreign Ministry.Raza's family said the athlete attempted to emigrate to Europe to find a good job and earn money for the treatment of her disabled son, 3, so he could live a normal life. The boy, who was not on the boat, suffered brain damage as a baby and is also paralyzed on one side of his body. He remained in Pakistan.The athlete's younger sister, Sadia Raza, said on Friday that her elder sister went on the voyage due to financial problems.“She gave her life just for her sick child,"" the athlete's sister said. She thanked the government for bringing back Raza's body so that she can be buried in her own country.Photographs of Raza donning the country’s national colors and sporting accolades have appeared on television and social media.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838672,Patrick Vieira fired by relegation-threatened Crystal Palace,"LONDON (AP) — Patrick Vieira was fired by Crystal Palace on Friday with the team having been dragged into the Premier League’s relegation fight.Palace is in 12th place in the 20-team league but is only five points ahead of last-place Southampton.The team has lost three straight league games and has no wins in any competition in 2023.“It is with enormous regret that this difficult decision has been made,” Palace chairman Steve Parish said. “Ultimately, results in recent months have placed us in a precarious league position and we felt a change is necessary to give us the best chance of retaining Premier League status.”Palace said the process to find Vieira’s successor has already started.Vieira, a former Arsenal midfielder, was in the role for 20 months after being appointed in 2021. Three members of his coaching staff, Osian Roberts, Kristian Wilson and Saïd Aïgoun, have also left the club.Vieira’s departure comes quickly after Palace’s 1-0 loss to Brighton on Wednesday, a result which heightened concerns about the team’s chances of survival this season.A dire run of form had left Palace without a win in any competition since beating Bournemouth in the league on Dec. 31. Since then, there have been seven losses and five draws in 12 games, 11 of them coming in the league.Because the league's bottom places are so congested, 12th-place Palace is only three points above the relegation zone.Vieira led Palace to a 12th-place finish last season and also to the FA Cup semifinals.“Patrick’s impact since joining us in the summer of 2021 has been significant, and he is held in the highest regard by myself, and all of his colleagues,” Parish said. “Patrick has given his all to the club, and we all thank him and his team for their service.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/17,,World

The Taiwanese delegation at the March 13-16 WITS in Perth took part in roundtables about government, youth, and research, and presented cultural activities including dances and online tours of indigenous villages.Patrick Gorman, assistant minister to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, described Taiwan as an important trading partner, adding the hosting of the next WITS would result in closer cooperation in the fields of culture, arts, education, science, and tourism.",2023/3/17,373,Travel & Cuisine
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838696,Paraguay reaffirms its ties of friendship and cooperation with Taiwan,"Paraguay reaffirms its ties of friendship and cooperation with the Government of the Republic of China (Taiwan), as it has done so for more than 65 years. The ties are firm between both countries, since they constitute an alliance for the progress and wellbeing of both peoples.As we understand from foreign policy, a state defines its strategic objectives and uses the appropriate means within the international system, in order to achieve them.Since July 12, 1957, Paraguay has maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) that are part of the Theory of the Games of International Relations, also called ""win-win,"" given that both countries benefit from this historic, fruitful and productive relationship.To pretend to ignore the reality of the conflict of sovereignty between the two Chinas would be illogical, so we must make several clarifications in order to understand the issue.First, Taiwan was never under the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of China, so it is not a territory of that nation. After the end of the Sino-Japanese War, on April 17, 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, whereby the island of Taiwan became part of Japanese territory.After the defeat of Japan in World War II, this territory was returned to the Republic of China (Taiwan) by the Treaty of San Francisco of Sept. 8, 1951 and not to the People's Republic of China, which was founded on Oct. 1, 1949. Therefore, Taiwan was never ruled by the People's Republic of China.Our National Constitution promulgated on June 20, 1992, in Article 143 states clearly: “The Republic of Paraguay in its foreign relations accepts international law and adjusts itself to the following principles: 2) the self-determination of the Peoples; 5) the international protection of human rights; and 8) the condemnation of all forms of dictatorship, colonialism, and imperialism.”It is within these parameters that we cannot fail to defend the rule of law in any part of the world, moreso when it comes to a noble and brotherly people like the Taiwanese.President Mario Abdo Benitez on his last trip to our sister Asian nation in February, stated that our country maintains its alliance with Taiwan because of the shared community of values that identifies us, such as freedom, justice and democracy. This is in addition to the existing technical and cultural cooperation between our countries, and the growing exchange of goods and services.Finally, I would like to refer to the former American President John F. Kennedy, who once said: “Democracy is the superior form of government, because it is based on a respect for man as a reasonable being.”Therefore, given the commonwealth of democratic ideals that we maintain with Taiwan, as well as the commercial interests, technical, cultural and financial cooperation that we are currently developing, it would be a historical mistake to break relations with our sister Asian nation. Despite being geographically separated, we are united by a feeling of work for the development and progress of our peoples.",2023/3/17,684,Opinion
