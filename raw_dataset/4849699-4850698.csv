https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849709,Padres' Seidler willing to spend big for a shot at a parade,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — This kind of thing doesn't happen much in San Diego.As Padres owner Peter Seidler walked on stage for a panel discussion at FanFest on a brilliant Saturday afternoon in February, chants of “Peter! Peter! Peter!” rose up from the crowd of several thousand fans jammed into a grassy park just beyond center field at Petco Park.The most eagerly anticipated season in Padres history starts Thursday and it’s not a stretch to say that Seidler is as beloved as the superstar quartet of Manny Machado, Juan Soto, Fernando Tatis Jr. and Xander Bogaerts. After all, Seidler’s the guy who’s going to be writing the massive checks at least three of those players, and maybe all four, will be cashing into the next decade.“It was a thrill just to be there,” said Seidler, an aw-shucks kind of guy who wants nothing more than to bring San Diego its first World Series title. “When your players are good, I guess, it flows to people like me. But it really was all about the players.”Seidler, a third-generation member of the O’Malley family that once owned the Dodgers, has raised eyebrows across baseball by fearlessly lavishing big contracts on players. Since July, the Padres have signed hometown hero Joe Musgrove — who owns the only no-hitter in franchise history — to a $100 million, five-year deal; Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year contract; ace Yu Darvish to $108 million over six seasons; and the biggest splash of all, giving Machado a $350 million, 11-year deal, the fourth-largest contract in baseball history.Fans hope that with Seidler at the helm, the Padres will be able to sign Soto to what could be the biggest contract in baseball history to keep the young generational talent here beyond 2024.“One year soon, the baseball gods will shine on the San Diego Padres and we will have a parade,” Seidler said the day they signed Machado.Ah, yes, a parade. San Diego has been great at throwing parades for losers. The Chargers got one after they were embarrassed by the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl 29 years ago. The Padres got one after they were swept by the New York Yankees the last time they reached the World Series, in 1998.Seidler envisions a parade with a trophy. The organization feels it’s close after a stirring run to the NL Championship Series last year.Many outside of San Diego, including Colorado Rockies owner Dick Monfort, wonder how the Padres can sustain the spending. Seidler doesn’t care what anybody else thinks. San Diego has a different vibe than most other cities and Petco Park is a fun place to be, Seidler says. He scoffs at the city being a so-called small market.He also doesn’t like the word sustainable.“Let’s find a different one,"" he said. ""Do I believe our parade is going to be on land or on water or on both? Putting a great and winning team on the field in San Diego year after year is sustainable.”Even MLB.com wrote that the Padres were “continuing to outpunch their market weight.”San Diego might rank toward the bottom of broadcast markets, “but that hasn’t mattered to us in a long time,” Seidler said. “We’ve got great fans in San Diego. It’s a sports-oriented city. We, several years ago, believed that if we gave fans a great product, that they would show up with enthusiasm. Our great fans have exceeded our very high expectations. Then the snowball starts rolling down the hill and the better we are, the more support we have in the city, and it’s been a great and healthy dynamic.“I know that we’re growing the game for baseball,” Seidler said. “Our revenues are up. Remarkably our franchise will pay into the revenue sharing system for first time. We’re happy to do it because it means that our way of looking at things is working and I think it’ll continue to work.”Seidler has been involved in the ownership group since 2012. A two-time cancer survivor and co-founder and managing partner of Seidler Equity Partners, he bought out Ron Fowler’s majority stake in November 2020.Owner adulation hasn't been common in San Diego. While previous ownership groups were painfully penurious, Seidler has helped transform the Padres from bottom feeders in the NL West to World Series contenders.The Padres’ project to have the third-highest payroll in the majors this season at $255 million, trailing only the New York Mets and Yankees. San Diego’s luxury tax payroll projects to $285 million.“Peter's very clear what his expectations are,” general manager A.J. Preller said. “He sees the big picture and also understands philosophically what we're trying to do.”The Padres have had San Diego to themselves since the NFL’s Chargers bolted for Los Angeles in 2017. It's a void they've filled eagerly, finishing fifth in the majors in attendance last year, with fans eagerly snapping up expensive jerseys and other gear.“We’re not New York. We know that,” Seidler said. “But I’ll put the passion of our fans and the support of our fans up against anybody. You layer in the hunger of this city to win a title and now the city and our fans know that we can. That’s why our building is rocking every night. We’ll be close to a sellout every single night this year. We have a wait list. It speaks to how much our fans love the players that we’re putting on the field and the conviction that our players bring to it. They’re here to win.”___Follow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at http://twitter.com/berniewilson___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849710,"What is the filibuster, and why does it matter in Nebraska?","LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — A group of lawmakers is continuing this week to filibuster all bills that come before the Nebraska Legislature — even the ones they support — in protest over a bill that would ban gender-affirming treatments for minors.Supporters of that bill say they’re trying to protect children from making body-altering decisions they may later regret. Opponents say it's an unconstitutional overreach meant to marginalize LGBTQ+ people.Filibusters are rare in most U.S. state legislatures, but common in Nebraska. Lawmakers use the tactic in each session of the unique one-chamber Nebraska Legislature to try to force compromise on contested bills. This streak of filibusters is the longest in the state's history and lawmakers behind them vow to block every bill through the end of the 90-day session. Here's a look at how it could play out:WHAT'S A FILIBUSTER?It's a political maneuver that extends debate on a bill in an effort to delay or block its passage. Burning that debate time can also delay votes on other bills and can force lawmakers to work longer days.While filibuster rules vary across the U.S., they bring to mind a lawmaker giving lengthy speeches on the legislative floor to stop a bill, as Jimmy Stewart's character did in the 1939 classic movie, “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.""In 2013, Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis, a Democrat, drew national attention by speaking for 13 hours straight to try to stop legislation restricting access to abortion.In Nebraska, lawmakers can seek to delay bill votes by introducing amendments and motions to it, which are debated by the entire body.WHAT'S HAPPENING IN NEBRASKA?For weeks, a single Omaha Democrat has filibustered nearly every bill to come before the Nebraska Legislature.The move from Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh makes good on a threat she made to conservative lawmakers promising to stonewall all legislation if they advanced a bill out of committee that would outlaw gender-affirming therapies for those under 19. It is one of roughly 150 bills targeting transgender people that have been introduced in state legislatures this year.Now, she's got backup. Cavanaugh paused her filibuster for a day earlier this month after the bill was scheduled for debate, believing it did not have the votes to advance. But after eight hours of debate over three days, the bill passed, thanks to a Democratic legislator who voted with Republicans. That led other lawmakers to pledge they would join Cavanaugh in filibustering every bill for the rest of the session.HOW DOES THE FILIBUSTER WORK IN NEBRASKA?Nebraska’s filibuster rules are less severe than in other states, some of which forbid lawmakers from sitting, taking a bathroom break or speaking on anything other than bill being filibustered.The Nebraska rules also allow them to discuss pretty much whatever they want, as evidenced by Cavanaugh's monologues on everything from her favorite Girl Scout cookies to the plots of animated movies her children have watched.Nebraska rules, instead, place time limits on filibusters. Bills must go through three rounds of debate to pass, and up to eight hours of debate is allotted for the first round before a cloture vote — or a vote to end debate — is taken. If the bill is uncontested, it can get through that process and be voted on much sooner. But if it’s filibustered, it usually takes the full eight hours.The second round gets up to four hours of debate, and the final round gets up to two hours. If a cloture vote gets 33 or more votes, debate ends and a vote is taken on the bill. If cloture gets less than 33 votes — in any round — the bill is considered dead for the year.Former Sen. Ernie Chambers, a left-leaning former lawmaker from Omaha, served 46 years as a state senator and mastered the use of the filibuster to try to tank bills he opposed and force support for bills he backed. But he had a knack for convincing lawmakers to change their minds, often within days.The Nebraska Legislature is also the only one in the U.S. that is officially nonpartisan. But each of its 49 lawmakers self-identify as Republican, Democrat or independent and tend to propose and vote for legislation along party lines.Republicans hold 32 seats, while to Democrats hold 17 seats. Although bills can advance with a simple majority, it takes a supermajority — 33 votes — to end debate to overcome a filibuster. That's more than the 30 votes needed to override a governor's veto.WILL IT WORK?It remains to be seen whether filibustering lawmakers can run out the clock before the session ends or sway other lawmakers to vote down the trans health bill.The effort has succeeded in stunting the work of the Legislature this session. Speaker of the Legislature Sen. John Arch acknowledged last week that the effort has already stymied the number of bills lawmakers will be able to pass, even though he added nighttime debates starting this week.Nearly 200 bills passed in the last 90-day session in 2021. This year, the Legislature is on track to pass only a fraction of that before it adjourns in early June. Not a single bill has passed, and only 32 have advanced from the first round of debate.The minority has had some success in filibustering bills. Last year, progressive lawmakers used it to block an abortion ban and a law allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit.The effort has not derailed the trans health bill, which advanced from the first round of debate last week.The filibuster is getting some pushback from other Democrats.“I don't have the luxury to blow up everything,” said Omaha Sen. Justin Wayne, adding he wants to tackle bills related to criminal justice and improvement of school and child services.",2023/03/29,,World

Bolsonaro, who became ill with COVID, later declined to take the coronavirus vaccine and flouted health restrictions.“We have to look at the past, but at the same time we have to say the health ministry cannot make the mistake of not coordinating, not taking care, not treating (the disease). We need to be united so new tragedies do not happen,” Trindade said.Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials, said the figure is a reminder of the country's obligation to punish those who failed to act against the virus or sabotaged those who were trying.“There was direct responsibility of public agents, who could have answered to this in a much better fashion,” Lago told The Associated Press.",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849713,Germany picked off by De Bruyne and Belgium,"Just when you think Germany might have turned a corner, Hansi Flick’s side remind you that they are a team struggling to accept their shortcomings.A vastly improved second-half performance and a frantic finale might have been enough to stir another sold-out crowd, but it wasn’t enough to hide the truth about this team.While the inclusion of new faces is encouraging, as is the role solid but unspectacular players like Marius Wolf and Niclas Füllkrug play, the quality is too often just not there. Solid only gets you so far — Wolf was great going forward, but regularly exposed defensively. This is not a team that anyone fears anymore, nor is it one that has shown itself capable of competing with the top teams.""Of course it's crap when you concede two goals inside the first 10 minutes,"" said Serge Gnabry. ""It's tough to get into the game after that.""Belgium feasted early and late. Yannick Carrasco tucked in to the gift Wolf offered on six minutes, Romelu Lukaku helped himself three minutes later and Kevin de Bruyne left Germany wishing Jamal Musiala was fit with a 78th minute goal to add to his two assists.""The first 30 minutes were really bad,"" admitted captain Joshua Kimmich to RTL after the match. ""The first 15 we weren't on the pitch at all, we were very error-prone, especially with the ball, and we were not hungry at all.""Too much of this game was hard work for Germany, and when they had their chances, the painfully-familiar problem of taking them returned. Serge Gnabry could have scored more than his late consolation and Timo Werner could offer little more than another offside goal.Perhaps there was no greater example of how in flux this team is than at the half-hour mark. Leon Goretzka required treatment for an injury and while the Belgian players came together in a huddle, Germany’s were scattered across the field.Indeed, this was not a team performance Germany will remember fondly. Individually speaking, Niclas Füllkrug, who scored the penalty that drew Germany to within a goal just before the break, and substitiute Emre Can, who Flick called ""the aggressive leader we needed"" stood out. But collectively, it was a humbling of sorts.Füllkrug told German news magazine Spiegel this week: “Looking at the World Cup, one or two more goals and everything would have been different.”The same might have been said for the game against Belgium, but a draw in Cologne would have done little to convince those watching on that Germany can truly mix it with the stronger teams on the continent.""At the end of the day, there's a lot to learn but there are a lot of positives we can take too, the team showed commitment and morale today,"" said Thilo Kehrer.But there are only so many times Germany’s narrow defeats or entertaining draws can be written up as learning experiences or representations of a team full of character. At some point, they are just signs of a side in major transition and short on the required quality to compete at the top level. Against Belgium in Cologne, that limit was reached.""We were too restrained, too passive and couldn't put them under pressure. Belgium took advantage mercilessly,"" Flick told RTL.One Germany fan had seen enough inside the first 10 minutes. After Lukau's fantastic finish, he walked by the press box and, before leaving, turned and said: “Flick out!”It won’t come to that, but the rebuild might take a lot longer than planned.",2023/03/28,,

Landmarks and tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre had to halt operations as entry was blocked.There were delays at Gare de Lyon train station as protesters set off flares and walked on the tracks.Elsewhere there were clashed between police and protesters on the streets of the western city of Nantes, where AFP news agency reported that projectiles were thrown at police who responded by using tear gas.A bank branch and rubbish bins were also reported to have been set on fire.Water cannons and tear gas were on protesters in the south eastern city of Lyon, while in the northern city of Lille there were reported acts of vandalism.The protests come nearly two weeks after Macron pushed the new pensions law through parliament using a special provision.Earlier government rejected a demand from unions to suspend and reconsider the pension bill, which will push back retirement age by two years to 64.Macron has said the change is being done out of necessity in order to keep the country's finances in check.Laurent Berger the head of the moderate CFDT union called for a mediator to be appointed as ""a gesture in favor of cooling off, and finding a way out"".""We have proposed a way out ... and it's intolerable that we are being stonewalled again,"" Berger, told reporters at the start of a rally in Paris.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said 13,000 security personnel were being deployed on Tuesday — 5,500 of them in Paris alone.

As the new first minister of the devolved government, the 37-year-old becomes the first person of color and the first Muslim to fill the top job.""My grandparents made the trip from Punjab to Scotland over 60 years ago. As immigrants to this country who knew barely a word of English, they could not have imagined in their wildest dreams that their grandson would one day be on the cusp of being the next first minister,"" Yousaf said in an acceptance speech on Monday after securing a majority of votes to replace Nicola Sturgeon as leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP).Zara Mohammed has broken some barriers of her own, as the first Scot, the first woman and the youngest person ever to head up the Muslim Council of Britain. Mohammed says Yousaf's election is a ""momentous occasion, not just for Scots, but for Muslims across the UK.""""It sends such a bold message about our politics, of who can be first minister and who can lead a nation,"" Mohammed told DW. ""We're so used to those negative stereotypes and headlines, particularly around Muslims.""In 2016, Yousaf caught global attention when he delivered a parliamentary oath in Urdu while wearing a kilt, Scottish traditional dress.Yousaf's election means governments in Scotland, the United Kingdom as a whole and neighboring Ireland are now all led by men of Asian descent. Rishi Sunak is British prime minister, while Leo Varadkar is the Irish Taoiseach (prime minister).Zara Mohammed says in the British context, those who migrated decades ago and navigated rampant racism and discrimination should be thanked. ""It's testament to their hard work and perseverance to not give up,"" she said.""It took a couple of generations to get here and a lot of determination to do it.""Yousaf may be making headlines, but he's faced criticism in the past. Until recently he was Scotland's health minister, at a time when the National Health Service was seen to be in crisis. Scotland has long had Europe's highest drug death rate and the lowest life expectancy in western Europe.Yousaf is accused by some of simply being gaff-prone. During his leadership campaign, he asked a group of Ukrainian refugee women separated from their husbands by war: ""Where are all the men?""Politics lecturer Paul Anderson says Humza Yousaf has a tough road ahead after a bruising leadership battle. ""He'll have to try and unite his party behind him, which seems to have been divided a bit and ripped apart over this campaign,"" he said.Anderson also thinks the new leader has big political shoes to fill.Nicola Sturgeon served as Scottish first minister for eight years before her shock resignation announcement last month. ""Whatever you think of her, she's a great orator,"" Anderson told DW. ""She's a very good public speaker, popular even in other parts of the United Kingdom. So that leadership style I think is very important and is something that there will be a loss of in Scottish politics and in the SNP.""Some think Sturgeon's departure could set the independence movement back. Since the 1990s, the devolved administration in Edinburgh has had decision-making powers over policy areas including education and health. The debate on whether to pursue a political divorce from England, Wales and Northern Ireland reached fever-pitch in 2014, when Scots were offered a chance to vote on independence. Fifty-five percent voted to remain in the UK.Yousaf has vowed to now kick activity around the drive for independence into ""fifth gear.""Lucy Beattie runs a farm in the north of Scotland. She wants to see independence in her lifetime and says Yousaf's election hasn't dashed her hopes. Beattie thinks the UK's 2016 decision to leave the European Union has meant such a material change for Scots — the majority of whom voted to stay within the EU — that another vote should be held. ""I think that people's passion for this will never die,"" she told DW.But there is no clear legal pathway to Scottish independence and around half of Scotland's population want to stay within the UK.  Britain's Supreme Court recently ruled Scotland can't hold a fresh referendum without the consent of the government in London.With that in mind, Yousaf's political opponents accuse him of wasting precious political time and capital on a question that was settled years ago.""Instead of setting a platform to focus on Scotland's real priorities, Humza Yousaf has confirmed that he wants to continue the constitutional conflict with UK government,"" Douglas Ross, leader of the opposition Scottish Conservatives party told lawmakers in Edinburgh on Tuesday. ""The record player has changed but the tune remains the same.""Lecturer Paul Anderson doubts there will be a new referendum any time soon. ""The case for independence, particularly the economic case for independence, is still something that has to be won by the new leader,"" he said. Anderson says it looks like Yousaf's strategy will be to continue pressuring the UK government while trying to build support at home.Finlay Duncan contributed to this article.Edited by: Andreas Illmer",2023/03/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849716,Army quickly plans new ads after Jonathan Majors' arrest,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Army is working to quickly pull together some new recruiting ads to air during the NCAA's Final Four basketball games this weekend, after being forced to yank commercials that featured actor Jonathan Majors, in the wake of his arrest last Saturday.Army leaders had been excited to feature Majors in the ads, as a key part of their new campaign aimed at reviving the service’s struggling recruiting numbers — which fell far short of their enlistment goal last year. They believed the ads would capitalize on Majors' popularity coming off his recently movies “Creed III” and “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” — hoping it would help them reach the youth audience.Last weekend, however, they pulled the ads off the air when Majors was arrested in New York on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment. New York City police said the actor was involved in a domestic dispute with a 30-year-old woman. But a lawyer for Majors, Priya Chaudhry, has said there is evidence clearing Majors and that the actor “is provably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows.”Maj. Gen. Alex Fink, head of Army marketing, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that in the past week the Army was able to avoid any loss of of the planned $70 million advertising buy, either by postponing ads or replacing them with other pre-existing commercials that were quickly updated.The ads were set to appear on television, online on places such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and on digital and physical billboards, including on buses. That ad purchase was the main portion of the campaign, which had a total cost of $117 million.“We are absolutely able to utilize a majority of what we have invested,” Fink said in an interview. “We think that we’ll have some brand new creative ads in time for the Women’s Final Four on Friday.”He said that the Army gathered “an enormous amount” of content and footage for the two commercials — titled “Overcoming Obstacles” and “Pushing Tomorrow” — that featured Majors as the narrator.“A majority of that content did not contain our main narrator. ... So we have a ton of content to go back to, to create basically new commercials new ads, if we need to,"" Fink said. “The campaign is full steam ahead.”The Army launched a new ad campaign earlier this month with a big event at the National Press Club as part of the plan to revive the Army’s popular “Be All You Can Be” slogan, which dominated its recruiting ads for two decades starting in 1981. The two new ads highlighted the history of the Army and some of the many professions that recruits can pursue. They ran from March 12 until they were pulled from the air by the Army on the 25th.Last year was the Army’s worst recruiting year in recent history, falling 25% short of its goal to enlist 60,000 recruits.Lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday raised the advertising issue and peppered Army Secretary Christine Wormuth and Gen. James McConville, the Army's chief of staff, with questions about how the service intends to fix the recruiting problems.“I see you had a bit of bad luck on your ‘Be All You Can Be’ commercial,"" said Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee. “Hopefully you’re cutting a new commercial and getting it online as quickly as possible.”Wormuth said the Army has a number of new programs, including bonuses, referral initiatives and a future soldier prep course that gives underperforming recruits a chance to take an academic or fitness course to try and meet enlistment standards.“We’re trying to do everything we can think of because this is really a fundamental thing that the Army has got to solve if we’re going to continue to be the world’s greatest army,” she said.___This story was first published on March 28, 2023. It was published again on March 29, 2023, to correct the wording in a quote by lawyer Priya Chaudhry.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849717,New California gas price law another defeat for oil industry,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — It was just a few weeks ago that California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the oil industry the second most powerful force on earth, trailing only Mother Nature in its ability to bend the elements — both physical and political — to its will.Yet on Tuesday, Newsom signed a new law that gives state regulators the power to penalize oil companies for making too much money, the first of its kind in the country. It's the type of legislation the oil industry might have crushed in the past. But on Monday, the bill cleared the state Assembly with only one Democrat voting against it.“We proved we could finally beat big oil,” Newsom said Tuesday after signing the bill.The bill is the latest in a string of defeats for the oil industry in California, a state many don't think of as a fossil fuel powerhouse. But for decades, California was one of the leading oil producers in the United States with a bustling industry that was a key part of the state's economy. The state is now the nation's seventh-largest oil producer, according to federal data.The oil industry doesn’t mind a David vs. Goliath comparison “as long as you think we’re David and not Goliath,” Kevin Slagle, spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, said about the industry’s influence at the state Capitol. “Just look at the results the last couple of years on legislation.”Oil production has been steadily declining since the late 1980s from a combination of exhausting supplies and the state's changing policy priorities. A state law requires California to be carbon neutral by 2045, meaning the state would remove as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits. The state's plan to do so would reduce demand for liquid petroleum by 94% by 2045.State regulators have banned the sale of most new gas-powered cars in California by 2035. And last year, the state Legislature approved a bill limiting where new oil wells can be drilled, providing buffer zones around homes, schools and other sensitive sites.“We're never going to get it right, in terms of this transition (away from oil), unless we minimize and mitigate the power and influence of big oil in this country,” said Newsom, now in his second term in office and widely seen as a potential presidential candidate beyond 2024. “They're the biggest impediment to a just transition.”While its influence in California might have diminished, the industry is still asserting itself. The Western States Petroleum Association spent $11.7 million lobbying lawmakers in the 2021-2022 legislative session, far more than any other single group. Chevron followed behind it, spending $8.6 million, according to state campaign finance filings. The next closest single spender was the California Teachers Association, at $7.1 million.Likewise, the industry spent millions on campaign contributions in the 2022 election, supporting both Democrats and Republicans. More than a quarter of all 120 seats in the Legislature are newly elected members.Those donations did not always translate to favorable votes. New Assemblymember Esmerelda Soria, a Democrat who represents parts of the Central Valley, was the top beneficiary of money from a Western States Petroleum Association-affiliated committee. Soria voted Monday to support the legislation despite industry opposition.The only Democrat to vote against the potential oil profits penalty was Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, whose district includes Kern County, home of the state's oil industry. Her vote appeared to irk the Newsom administration.Bains, a family medicine and addiction doctor who was first elected in November, tweeted a picture of the vote, saying: “Stand alone if you must, but always stand for truth.”Dana Williamson, Newsom’s chief of staff, replied: “Alone and confused you shall likely remain.”Bains said she voted against the bill because during the height of the gasoline price spike last summer, the Newsom administration and legislative leaders refused to suspend the state’s gas tax. They argued oil companies would not pass along the savings to drivers.“What’s to stop them from passing on the cost of this new tax with high prices at the pump?” Bains said. “That inconsistency is even more frustrating.”Though the industry couldn't stop the legislation, its presence could be felt in the final version, said Chris Micheli, a veteran California lobbyist who represents business clients but was not involved in the oil profits legislation. Newsom initially called for the Legislature to pass a new tax on oil company profits. Then he asked lawmakers to instead impose a penalty if oil company profits surpassed a certain threshold.Finally, Newsom and lawmakers agreed to let the California Energy Commission decide, punting the decision to a five-person panel appointed by Newsom with the consent of the state Senate. The bill also creates a new state agency with the power to monitor the petroleum markets, including requiring oil companies to disclose lots of data about their pricing.“The fact it took them three different substantive proposals to find something that would actually pass the Legislature I think goes to show the continued power and influence of the oil industry in this state,” Micheli said.Next year, the oil industry will be looking to exert its influence in another arena — public opinion. The industry is challenging a new state law that bans drilling new oil wells nearby homes, schools and other sensitive areas. Voters will decide in 2024 whether to uphold the law.“The partisan numbers of the two houses of the Legislature have dramatically changed,” Micheli said, referring to Democrats now having total control over state government. “The broader business community is going to have to go to the voters on some issues of public policy.”Newsom acknowledged Monday the importance of oil for the global economy, telling reporters: “I'm driving home tonight” and “I'm flying this weekend.”“Oil has built the American economy, built the industrial economy, I get it,"" Newsom said. “But we are transitioning.

(AP) — First baseman Luke Voit has a $2 million major league salary in his one-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, and the former big league home run champion can earn an additional $3 million in performance bonuses.Voit's contract, announced Monday, includes a $12 million team option for 2024 with no buyout.He can earn $500,000 each for 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 plate appearances in 2023.If assigned to the minor leagues, his 2023 salary would be $200,000.Voit attended spring training on a minor league contract and opted out last week, then agreed to the major league deal.

At the same time, Vingroup and subsidiary VinFast also jointly received the ""Best Green Loan"" award from The Asset Triple-A Country Awards. With these two prestigious awards, Vingroup has affirmed its pioneering role in sustainable investment and international finance.               The Asset Triple-A Country Awards is one of the region's leading prestigious financial awards with a history of more than 20 years, attracting the participation of major issuers and financial institutions from 18 Asian countries. The awards are held annually, with an objective and independent evaluation process by a council of leading international finance, banking and capital markets professionals.            Overcoming many candidates, Vingroup was awarded the ""Best Issuer for Sustainable Finance in 2022"" award, a prestigious award recognizing the commitment to sustainable finance and implementing effective activities towards the United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals.   In addition to the ""Best Issuer in Sustainable Finance in 2022"", Vingroup and VinFast were also honored in the category of ""Best Green Loan"" for a US$500 million syndicated term loan (including US$400 million for Vingroup and US$100 million for VinFast). Although this is the first syndicated green loan financing from Vietnam, Vingroup and VinFast drew strong interest from the market very quickly, allowing the borrowers to increase the total facility amount from $300 million to $500 million, marking a new milestone in the Group's international fund raising track record.   Mr. Nguyen Viet Quang, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vingroup said: ""The Asset Triple-A's award affirms Vingroup's prestige in the international capital market, as well as our long-term commitment to sustainable development in Vietnam.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849738,"Another powerful Pacific storm hits soggy, snowy California","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A powerful weather system from the Gulf of Alaska pushed into Northern California on Tuesday, bringing more wind, rain and snow to a state battered by months of storms.Forecasters warned of heavy snow in coastal mountains and the Sierra Nevada, where accumulations up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) were possible, highway chain requirements took effect and a backcountry avalanche warning was issued for the greater Lake Tahoe area.The National Weather Service said the storm was expected to pull a plume of Pacific moisture into California as it tracked south, but the rainfall was not expected to be as intense as the atmospheric rivers that impacted the state in recent weeks.After a dozen previous atmospheric rivers and blizzards fueled by arctic air, the water content of California's Sierra Nevada snowpack is more than double normal overall, and nearly triple in the southern Sierra.Damage since the onslaught began in late December includes buildings crushed by snow, flooding of communities and farm fields and homes threatened by landslides.Crews on Monday tore down a historic pier in Santa Cruz County that was in danger of collapse. The 500-foot-long (152-meter) wooden pier at Seacliff State Beach was severely damaged by big surf in January. Built in 1930, the pier connected the beach to SS Palo Alto, a grounded Word War I-era steamship known as the “cement ship.”On the positive side, the storms have brought much-needed water. The state's two largest reservoirs, Shasta and Oroville, have risen above their historical averages to date after being significantly depleted.Cities and farmers that rely on the Central Valley Project, the federally managed water system, got a big boost in their allocations Tuesday.More than 250 agencies — mostly irrigation districts — contract with the federal government for certain amounts of water each year, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation announces each February how much of those contracts can be filled, updating as conditions change.The storm boost in supply means that many providers of irrigation water supplied by the CVP will see the amount they can draw jump from as little as 35% of their contracted total to 80%. Providers for city and industrial uses will be allowed 100% of their historic use instead of just 75%, the bureau said.In Southern California, the Metropolitan Water District is bringing water from the north to fill its massive Diamond Valley Lake, a reservoir that had diminished to 60% of capacity after three years of drought. It's expected to be full again by year's end.“Nature gave us a lifeline,” MWD General Manager Adel Hagekhalil said Monday as officials watched water pour into the reservoir.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849739,Arkansas bathroom bill condemned as too extreme is revamped,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — An Arkansas bathroom bill that went further than a 2016 North Carolina law that was repealed after widespread boycotts was revamped Tuesday following complaints from members of the transgender community and their families that it would criminalize trans people simply for using public restrooms.The House Judiciary Committee endorsed the proposal to allow someone to be charged with misdemeanor sexual indecency with a child if they use a public restroom or changing room of the opposite sex when a minor is present. The majority-GOP panel advanced the measure after it was amended to make it a crime only if the person enters the restroom “for the purpose of arousing or gratifying a sexual desire.” The proposal now heads to the full House for a vote as early as Wednesday.The Republican lawmaker behind the bill said he was OK with the latest version, saying his intent wasn't to target transgender people with the bathroom restriction.“I think this new language in the bill probably helps guide it more directly toward what we're trying to accomplish, and that's bad actors that are in there for sexual gratification to misbehave,” Republican Sen. John Payton said after the vote.The change followed hours of testimony from members of the trans community, family members and other opponents who said the restriction would further marginalize and threaten transgender people who have been targeted by several bills in this year's session.“This bill is such an overreach that it would have an individual whose legal documentation and physical anatomy matches the sign on the door be barred from entering the restroom,” said Evelyn Rios Stafford, a member of Washington County's quorum court and a transgender woman, told the committee during the hearing.The panel heard from transgender people worried about the potential confrontations they could face if they complied with the law.“How would you react to me exiting a gendered facility with your wife or your daughter?” Ethan Avanzino, a transgender man, asked the panel. “We all know that's absurd.”The original version of the bill went further than a bathroom law North Carolina enacted in 2016 and repealed a year later following widespread boycotts and protests. That law did not include any criminal penalties.The committee's vote comes a week after Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed legislation prohibiting transgender people at public schools from using the restroom that aligns with their gender identity. The law, which takes effect later this summer, makes Arkansas the fourth state to enact such a restriction.Proposals to restrict transgender people using the restroom of their choice have seen a resurgence this year, six years after North Carolina repealed its bathroom law. More than two dozen bathroom bills have been filed in 17 states this year.Opponents of the original version of the bill said the new version addresses many of their concerns that the prohibition would be used to prosecute transgender people for using restrooms that match their gender identity.“That vastly changes the meaning because there's an actual intent included in this, whereas before it was just your mere presence in the restroom,” Democratic Rep. Ashley Hudson said after the vote.But some advocates said they were still opposed to the bill, even with the revamp.“We are grateful that our legislators listened to our testimonies and worked to refine the bill, but we want to emphasize that this bill should not pass as it is clearly targeting trans people,” Intransitive, a support and advocacy group for transgender people in Arkansas, said in a statement.The amendment was nearly identical to language suggested by Aaron Jennen, whose teenage daughter is transgender and is among the families challenging Arkansas’ ban on gender affirming care for minors. A federal judge has blocked that law's enforcement and is considering whether to strike it down as unconstitutional.Jennen described to lawmakers how his daughter is looking at where to go to college, but doesn't think it's safe to stay in Arkansas because of the laws in recent years affecting transgender people.“We're facing the likely situation of our daughter moving away to where she knows no one but she's not targeted by her government as a criminal simply for being who she is,” Jennen said.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849740,Puerto Rico governor unveils solar energy plans in address,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Gov. Pedro Pierluisi announced new solar energy initiatives on Tuesday during his annual state of the territory address, a speech viewed by many as critical as he fights plummeting ratings amid growing discontent over costly electric bills, government corruption and slow-moving hurricane reconstruction.The more than hourlong speech and ceremony at the U.S. territory’s seaside Capitol was powered entirely by generators to avoid any potential interruptions given the ongoing instability of the island’s crumbling power grid.The frail grid has been a priority for Pierluisi’s administration, which oversaw the privatization of the operation of the island’s generation, transmission and distribution of power in widely criticized moves given persistent outages.On Tuesday evening, Pierluisi announced that the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency approved microgrid projects to supply 100% of power to the neighboring islands of Vieques and Culebra, which are popular with tourists.He also announced $100 million in federal funds for a new voucher program targeting the middle class to finance up to 30% of the costs of installing battery-backed solar systems in their homes.Pierluisi has pledged that Puerto Rico will ramp up from 3% to 40% renewable energy by the end of 2025, and 60% by 2040.The governor also addressed concerns over ongoing government corruption, with 10 Puerto Rican mayors prosecuted by federal authorities in recent years.He urged the legislature to approve pending bills aimed at cracking down on corruption.“Zero tolerance and zero impunity,” Pierluisi said.He also highlighted ongoing hurricane reconstruction efforts targeting hospitals, homes, roads, schools and other infrastructure that were battered by hurricanes Maria and Fiona.Pierluisi noted his administration has so far helped more than 7,400 families of the 12,000 still awaiting aid for homes damaged by Hurricane Maria, a powerful Category 4 storm that struck the island in September 2017, razing the power grid and destroying or damaging hundred of thousands of homes.Further damage was caused by Hurricane Fiona, a Category 1 storm that hit Puerto Rico’s southwest region in September 2022, sparking an island-wide blackout.Pierluisi also unveiled a preliminary $31 billion budget, which still has to be approved by legislators and a federal control board that oversees the island’s finances. Puerto Rico announced in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and then filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in history in 2017.Pierluisi touted his administration's achievements during the address, which comes as he prepares to run for a second term next year in what many consider will be a highly competitive race.“It’s obvious that the campaigning began,” said Rafael Hernández, speaker of Puerto Rico's House and a member of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party. “But there’s still a lot of work to be done.”José Luis Dalmau, president of Puerto Rico's Senate and also a member of the main opposition party, said he was puzzled by the descriptions of Pierluisi's achievements given the multiple challenges that many on the island of 3.2 million people with a 45% poverty rate still face.“It's clear that the governor lives in another Puerto Rico,” he said.",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849748,Hongkongers predict over 20 years of poor health in retirement highlighting need to plan for the future – Manulife Asia Care Survey,"Residents expect to retire at 63 and chronic or other health issues to set in at 64   With the average life expectancy at 85, they possibly face over 20 years in retirement with poor health   Hongkongers recognize importance of health planning but savings timeline is unrealistic     HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 29 March 2023 - Hongkongers live longer than most people in the world, but they expect their later years to be dogged by poor health, a period many think will start when they enter their early-to-mid sixties. These findings show there is a compelling need for people in Hong Kong to have a savings plan in place to help with the medical costs in later life.       Patrick Graham, Chief Executive Officer, Manulife Hong Kong and Macau     According to Manulife Asia Care Survey 2023, which was conducted across seven markets in Asia, Hong Kong residents expect to retire at 63 and for poor health to set in at 64. With the average life expectancy in the city at 85, many people face the prospect of over 20 years in retirement with poor health. The pessimism is strongest among 25- to 34-year-olds who expect poor health to start at 57 before retiring at 60. This pessimism, however, fades with age, with the 45-plus age group more upbeat, expecting to retire at 64 and stay healthy until they are 69.   In terms of physical and mental health, just one-in-ten Hongkongers describe their physical (10%) and mental (11%) health to be excellent, less than half the regional average for each (respectively 21% and 24%). Interestingly, it is the 25-34 age group that drags Hong Kong's overall percentages down with 7% and 8% for physical and mental health respectively.   ""Hong Kong people enjoy a long-life expectancy but early onset of poor health might affect their quality of life in retirement,"" said  Patrick Graham, Chief Executive Officer, Manulife Hong Kong and Macau. ""They will need to find a way to tackle their health issues to stretch out their retirement. Putting a plan in place can open the door to a happier retirement with peace of mind, while offering more freedom and flexibility in choosing quality healthcare.""   The Manulife Asia Care Survey takes a deep dive into local economies across the region to explore in detail the health and wealth trends and sentiment, along with insurance buying habits. This year, more than 7,000 people across Asia shared their health and financial thoughts and concerns in the post-Covid environment.   According to the survey, Hongkongers' main concern is the challenge of paying for medical treatment, which continues to rise, and finding ways to mitigate or delay its impact. Nearly half (47%) of Hong Kong respondents said they are concerned about the cost of treatment if diagnosed with a serious illness, while just over a third (36%) worry about loss of income or job if they become seriously ill. More than a quarter (29%) are not sure who will take care of them if they become ill.   Hongkongers recognize importance of health planning but savings timeline is unrealistic   In general, Hongkongers think rising healthcare costs (45%) and poorer health (40%) are barriers to achieving their financial goals, especially among those aged 45 or over. More than a third (37%) of those surveyed identified saving for healthcare or medical needs as one of their top three financial goals and are working towards it to support themselves in retirement.   Among these respondents, more than half (56%) said they use cash savings to achieve the financial goal of saving for healthcare or medical needs. However, insurance also plays a significant role, with a third saying they had health and critical illness insurance (33%), and a fifth utilizing savings and endowment insurance to cover healthcare costs. Beyond that, a quarter said they rely on their Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) savings to support their medical needs.   On average, the Hong Kong respondents expect to achieve this financial goal within seven years. The younger segment and mid-income group are more optimistic – or aggressive – in their expectations, aiming to achieve their goals in six years.   Alongside financial planning, taking personal action to improve health and well-being is important to delay health issues in later life. The vast majority – more than 9-in-10 – said they are taking action to help address health issues, with more exercise (54%), better diet (47%), regular body check (40%) and closer self-monitoring of their health (35%) the main methods.   ""The timeframe for meeting savings targets reflected in our survey may not be realistic, given a lengthy retirement and much of it possibly in poor health, especially with the over-reliance on cash. After all, cash is particularly exposed to inflation, which can erode its value very quickly,"" said Graham. ""To avoid getting caught short, we would encourage people to talk to a financial planner on how best to plan for their future.""  Hashtag: #Manulife

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849755,U.S. charges FTX's Bankman-Fried with paying $40 mln Chinese bribe,"NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled a new indictment against Sam Bankman-Fried, accusing the founder of the now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange of paying a $40 million bribe to Chinese officials so they would unfreeze his hedge fund's accounts.The new bribery conspiracy charge adds to the pressure on the 31-year-old former billionaire, who now faces a 13-count indictment over the November collapse of FTX.Bankman-Fried is expected to be arraigned on the new indictment on Thursday before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan federal court. He intends to plead not guilty, according to a person familiar with the matter.Prosecutors had previously accused Bankman-Fried of stealing billions of dollars in customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund, and orchestrating an illegal campaign donation scheme to buy influence in Washington, D.C.Lawyers for Bankman-Fried did not respond to a request for comment.Separately on Tuesday, Kaplan approved modifications to Bankman-Fried's $250 million bail package that are designed to prevent the defendant from tampering with witnesses.The new indictment said Bankman-Fried ordered the $40 million cryptocurrency payment to a private wallet from Alameda's main trading account, to persuade Chinese government authorities to unfreeze Alameda accounts with more than $1 billion of cryptocurrency.Prosecutors said the Alameda accounts had been frozen as part of an investigation into an unnamed Alameda counterparty, and Bankman-Fried's prior efforts to lobby Chinese officials to lift the freeze were unsuccessful.They also said Bankman-Fried around November 2021 authorized a transfer of tens of millions of dollars of additional cryptocurrency to ""complete"" the bribe.China's foreign ministry could not immediately be reached for comment after business hours in Beijing. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to eight of the 13 counts he faces, and not yet been arraigned on the campaign finance or bribery conspiracy charges.He has acknowledged inadequate risk management at FTX, but has denied stealing money.Three onetime members of his inner circle - former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, former FTX technology chief Zixiao ""Gary"" Wang, and former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh - have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.CRYPTO CRACKDOWNBankman-Fried's case is part of an escalating crackdown on alleged abuses at digital asset exchanges by U.S. prosecutors and regulators, following last year's plunge in the values of Bitcoin and other tokens as central banks raised interest rates.Last Thursday, Do Kwon, whose Terraform Labs developed the TerraUSD and Luna coins that crashed last May, was arrested in Montenegro while carrying alleged bogus travel documents, as a Manhattan grand jury indicted him on fraud charges.And on Monday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, and its founder Changpeng Zhao for executing unauthorized transactions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849756,"US, Japan sign trade deal on electric vehicle battery minerals","WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - The United States and Japan on Tuesday signed a trade deal on electric vehicle battery minerals that is key to strengthening their battery supply chains and granting Japanese automakers wider access to a new $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.The swiftly negotiated agreement prohibits the two countries from enacting bilateral export restrictions on the minerals most critical for EV batteries, according to senior Biden administration officials. The minerals include lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and manganese.The deal also aims to reduce U.S.-Japanese dependence on China for such materials by requiring collaboration to combat ""non-market policies and practices"" of other countries in the sector and on conducting investment reviews of foreign investments in their critical minerals supply chains.Minerals-focused trade deals are one way that the Biden administration hopes to open up access for trusted allies to the $7,500 per vehicle EV tax credits in last year's climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act.The Biden administration is now negotiating a similar agreementwith the EU.Half of the credit for purchasing consumers is reserved for North American-assembled vehicles and batteries, a source of considerable tension with the EU, Japan and South Korea, which worry that the U.S. incentives will draw EV and battery investments away from their shores.The other half of the credit is contingent on at least 40% of the value of critical minerals in the battery having been extracted or processed in the United States or a country with a U.S. free trade agreement or recycled in North America.Japan's trade minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, told reporters in Tokyo that EVs made with battery minerals mined or processed in Japan were expected to meet the requirements to qualify for that part of the U.S. tax credits.Earlier, American officials had said that determination was up to the U.S. Treasury, which expected to define sourcing requirements for the EV tax subsidies by the end of this week in guidance anxiously awaited by automakers, miners and battery producers.""As the demand for electric vehicle batteries is expected to grow significantly, securing important minerals essential for their production is an urgent issue,"" Nishimura said.REBUKE FROM DEMOCRATSU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, signed the limited, 10-page sectoral agreement on Tuesday in Washington with Japan's ambassador to the United States, Tomita Koji.""Japan is one of our most valued trading partners and this agreement will enable us to deepen our existing bilateral relationship,"" Tai said in a statement.But Tai did not seek congressional approval for the pact, drawing a strong rebuke from the top two Democrats on trade matters in Congress, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Richard Neal, who called it ""unacceptable.""""Without enforceable environmental or labor protections, the Administration abandons worker-centric trade policy and jeopardizes our climate work by opening the door for another environmental catastrophe,"" Wyden and Neal said in a statement of rare trade criticism from President Joe Biden's own party.Wyden and fellow Democratic Senator Joe Manchin have voiced strong opposition to the Biden administration's efforts to apply the tax credits to vehicles produced outside North America, as they intended for it to jump-start investment in U.S. battery and EV production.The Biden administration officials argued that meeting climate goals will require a massive cooperative effort among trusted U.S. allies to produce the vast amounts of minerals needed to electrify the global auto market and the deal includes commitments on environmental standards and worker rights.The two countries agreed to review the minerals agreement every two years, including whether it is appropriate to terminate or amend it.",2023/03/29,154,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849757,Belarus says it will host Russian nuclear weapons to counter NATO,"Belarus on Tuesday confirmed it will host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of Western pressure, including sanctions and what it said was a military-build up by NATO member states near its borders.The statement from the foreign ministry was the government's first since Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Moscow will deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus and would build a nuclear weapons storage facility there.Although Putin did not say when the deployment would take place, or give further detail, the announcement appeared to pave the way for Moscow's first deployment of nuclear weapons outside its borders since the 1991 Soviet collapse.The Belarusian foreign ministry said Russia's nuclear bombs offered protection after what it called a campaign of pressure from the United States and its allies aimed at overthrowing the government of President Alexander Lukashenko.""Over the last two and a half years, the Republic of Belarus has been subjected to unprecedented political, economic and information pressure from the United States, the United Kingdom and its NATO allies, as well as the member states of the European Union,"" the ministry said in a statement.It complained of ""direct and brutal interference"" in domestic affairs, in a country that has been ruled with an iron first for nearly three decades by ex-Soviet collective farm boss Lukashenko.""In view of these circumstances, and the legitimate concerns and risks in the sphere of national security arising from them, Belarus is forced to respond by strengthening its own security and defence capabilities,"" the ministry said.The decision to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus was one of Moscow's toughest nuclear signals to the West since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year in what it calls a ""special military operation"",Anti-nuclear campaigners have warned that the step, which Putin said would mirror the way the United States deploys nuclear warheads in Europe without relinquishing control of them, will lower the threshold for the use of tactical short-range battlefield nuclear weapons and is unnecessary from a military viewpoint.Minsk said the Russian nuclear plans would not contravene international non-proliferation agreements as Belarus itself would not have control over the nuclear weapons.""The training of Belarusian pilots able to fly planes with specific warheads, the modernisation of such planes, and the deployment of nuclear warheads on Belarusian territory without giving Minsk control over them or access to the relevant technologies does not in any way contravene the provisions of the non-proliferation treaty,"" it said.'UNION STATE'Lukashenko has repeatedly accused the West of trying to topple him after mass protests against his rule erupted in 2020 in the wake of a presidential election the opposition said he had fraudulently won. Lukashenko said he had won fairly, while conducting a sweeping crackdown on his opponents.Minsk allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year. Its own troops have so far not fought in the war however, while stepping up joint military training with Russian forces deployed in Belarus.Lukashenko, who has long been in the process of gradually constructing what he calls ""a union state"" with Russia, is due to deliver a state-of-the-nation address on Friday.(Reporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel)",2023/03/29,261,World

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 29 March 2023 - New research from global cloud communications platform  Infobip reveals the growing trend towards conversational experiences for customer communications. The data, from 449 billion communications interactions on Infobip's platform across 2022, shows the rapid growth of interactions on chat apps such as WhatsApp Business Platform and social media channels such as Instagram for many customer needs.               Customer conversations on their preferred chat channel      Customers have access to more channels and devices than ever before. Infobip's analysis shows that traditional channels like SMS still play an important role for time-sensitive messages, two-factor authentication, and one-time passwords. But when it comes to engagement and support, customers are shifting to more conversational experiences over chat apps.   The data shows a 73% and 51% increase in WhatsApp Business Platform and Email interactions in 2022 compared to 2021, highlighting the ongoing critical nature of these channels. Demonstrating the desire of customers to connect with brands on channels they already use, the data also reveals a thirty-fold increase in Instagram interactions last year. Meanwhile Google Business Messages and Apple Messages for Business interactions increased by 186% and 232%.     For customer engagement, WhatsApp Business Platform, Voice, and mobile app messaging saw the highest growth in 2022. Since the introduction of marketing messages over WhatsApp Business Platform, customer engagement and promotional usage increased interactions on the channel by 2.5 times. Meanwhile, Voice and mobile app messaging increased by 191% and 92%, demonstrating how customers now prefer instant, rich, and human-like experiences with a business or brand.   Chatbots with conversational experience for customer queries    The data also shows how customers increasingly prefer to seek answers to their queries through chatbots on channels they use every day and that have rich capabilities. For instance, WhatsApp Business Platform interactions on Infobip's chatbot increased by 69% in 2022 while Telegram and SMS interactions increased seven-fold and five-fold respectively.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849759,First Phosphate Corp. Signs LFP Production Technology Licensing Agreement with Integrals Power Limited,"Saguenay, Quebec - Newsfile Corp. - 28 March 2023 - First Phosphate Corp. (CSE: PHOS) (FSE: KD0) (""First Phosphate"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has finalized a joint lithium iron phosphate (""LFP"") homologation agreement and LFP production technology licensing agreement with Integrals Power Limited (""IPL"") of Milton Keynes, United Kingdom. The agreement was entered into on January 10, 2023 and became effective March 24, 2023. The agreement could serve to anchor the Company's future LFP cathode active material production facilities and is currently of unknown potential future monetary value. The agreement provides for the following mutually beneficial, perpetual arrangements between the parties:          IPL will validate First Phosphate LFP-grade purified phosphoric acid and iron sulphate for the use in LFP battery cells.           IPLs LFP cathode active material homologation process will use First Phosphate LFP-grade purified phosphoric acid and iron sulphate.           IPL provides LFP production technology license to First Phosphate in the production of LFP cathode active material at any First Phosphate LFP cathode active material production facilities to be built in Quebec, Canada or elsewhere in North America. A royalty fee of 1.5% will apply to all LFP cathode active material sales.           First Phosphate has acquired 7,386 common shares of IPL for a cost of CAD $83,060.35 and has the right to make follow-on investments in future funding rounds.           First Phosphate and IPL plan to leverage First Phosphate's access to green hydro-electric energy in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of Quebec for optionality in the build-out of IPL's future production facilities.      ""We have visited the IPL facilities in the United Kingdom and were able to see and touch the LFP cathode active material produced by IPL,"" says First Phosphate CEO, John Passalacqua. ""We have also viewed the performance logs of test battery cells created using LFP cathode active material produced by IPL. We are cautiously optimistic that IPL technology could hold the answer to improved LFP battery performance.""   ""There is the traditional solid-state method of making LFP cathode active material from ferro-phosphate and lithium-phosphate precursors which is currently the main production formula used in China. Then there are promising new advanced hydrothermal methods such as those being pioneered by IPL that produce higher performance LFP batteries,"" says First Phosphate President Peter Kent. ""We believe it prudent for the Company to have access to IPL's advanced method of LFP cathode active material formulation.""   ""We are pleased to partner with First Phosphate in gaining strategic access to properly curated LFP-grade purified phosphoric acid and iron sulphate which will be in short supply in the near future as LFP production comes online in the Western World,"" says IPL Chief Executive Officer Behnam Hormozi. ""We require a development partner like First Phosphate which is fully committed to the LFP battery industry, to a low carbon footprint, to ESG compliancy, to non-conflict ethical sourcing, to traceable and secure supply and to just-in-time provisioning. All of these are strategic production advantages for IPL and our clients.""   IPL technology demonstrates improvements that should allow for the production of LFP batteries that will have more simplified cooling systems, greater compactness, lighter footprint and lower pre-heating requirements in colder temperatures. Some of the benefits include:        Increased capacity at high discharge rates         High capacity retention within ambient and extreme environmental temperature         Lower cost or higher capacity      The Company is informed that IPL has recently closed its oversubscribed equity investment round which received co-investment by the UK government grant funded project for LFP battery material pilot plant development. The IPL pilot plant is expected to be operational by the end of 2023.   First Phosphate has a measured and phased development approach to becoming a fully vertically-integrated producer of LFP cathode active material in North America. First Phosphate can undertake this strategy because it has access to clean igneous anorthosite phosphate-bearing rock in Quebec, Canada that it will be able to purify into large quantities of battery-grade purified phosphoric acid. Today's agreement with IPL allows First Phosphate to gain another important technological advantage in the production of LFP cathode active material for North America.

Some workers told relatives they smelled natural gas before the blast, although the gas utility UGI said it received no reports of a gas leak. On Tuesday, federal officials said they were investigating the role of a natural gas pipeline in the explosion.A look at some of the hazards of food manufacturing and what may have been behind this fatal blast:THE RISKSIn general, commercial ovens and furnaces, commercial refrigerant using ammonia and combustible dust produced by ingredients like cocoa powder and corn starch are primary explosive hazards at food plants, according to Holly Burgess, technical lead for industrial and chemical safety at the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit group that produces hundreds of codes and standards.“Most people, if you’ve not been in any sort of food manufacturing, you don’t understand what your hazards are and what you’re looking at,” Burgess said.Chocolate companies and other food manufacturers must take steps to mitigate the risk of fire and explosion from dust. Smaller particles that stay aloft pose a greater danger than bigger particles that quickly fall to the floor.“It is a common concern at many food production facilities handling fine combustible particulates,” said Bob Zalosh, a retired professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and a consultant on industrial fire and explosion hazard mitigation and investigations.Food manufacturers are supposed to determine the combustibility of the dust, perform a hazard analysis and then take steps to manage it, adhering to the fire protection association’s standard for preventing dust explosions in food processing plants.Common methods for controlling dust include dust collectors and industrial vacuum cleaners.THE PALMER BLASTOne possible culprit in the blast is highly flammable powdered starch, which candy companies often use to cast chocolate into shapes such as Easter eggs, said Terry Wakefield, a business consultant and food scientist who used to run a manufacturing facility that supplied chocolate to R.M. Palmer.The shock wave from an initial explosion — potentially of natural gas — could have jarred any dust accumulated on ceilings and other surfaces, he said. ""And now you end up with a massive amount of starch, which combusts, and those explosion clouds move faster than sound and they have unbelievable force,” said Wakefield, who made his assessment after watching video of the explosion that was captured by a TV station's weather camera.“A lot of people don’t realize that starch could do that sort of thing,"" he said.Based on the kinds of candy Palmer makes, the company likely used the starch-casting method, according to Wakefield.Officials at the family-owned company have not responded to questions from The Associated Press.Dust explosions have long been a problem in manufacturing. Between 1980 and 2017, nearly 400 combustible dust fires and explosions killed 185 people and injured more than 1,000 across multiple industries, including food, chemical, paper, pharmaceutical and metal processing, according to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board.In 2008, an accumulation of sugar dust ignited and blew up the Imperial Sugar plant in Port Wentworth, Georgia, killing 14.WORKPLACE SAFETY RECORDAt least two workplace accidents have happened at Palmer since 2018, according to federal records.The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which regulates workplace safety, visited Palmer's West Reading plant in 2018, when an employee lost the tip of a finger while cleaning a pressurized valve. The company agreed to pay a $13,000 fine.In 2019, OSHA investigated an accident at Palmer's plant in nearby Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, when a conveyor belt was turned on while a worker was cleaning a roller, according to federal records. The employee's arm was broken in multiple places. The company settled with OSHA for $26,000.And in January, records show, OSHA levied a penalty of more than $12,000 after an inspection at the Wyomissing plant. Details of that case were not available.The online records did not say anything about combustible dust, or any other explosive hazard at Palmer.LITIGATION FILEDA woman who lived next door to the plant filed suit Tuesday, alleging Palmer was negligent in failing to maintain its equipment and prevent the blast. Betty Wright was “lifted from her feet and blown across the room,” suffering injuries to her neck, back, hip and leg, the suit said. She also lost belongings.A statement from Wright's lawyers at Morgan & Morgan said the firm has put together a “team of experts so we can understand what caused this catastrophic explosion.""Additional lawsuits are expected.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849771,Goodell: Commanders report to be released even if team sold,"PHOENIX (AP) — Embattled Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder could very well sell the franchise before an investigation into his organization's conduct can be complete.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said even if that's the case, any report will be made public.“Yes, we've committed to releasing the findings,” Goodell said Tuesday at the league's annual meetings.Snyder and the Commanders are still under investigation by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, who was retained by the league to look into various aspects of the organization stemming from a congressional review into workplace misconduct that also included a referral to the Federal Trade Commission for potential business improprieties.“We'll allow (White) to do her job and then we'll see where we are,” Goodell said.A group led by Josh Harris and Mitchell Rales and another group led by Canadian billionaire Steve Apostolopoulos have formally submitted fully financed bids for the Commanders, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.Two people confirmed the bid from Harris. Both spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because details of the bid have not been publicly announced.ESPN reported both bids came in at Snyder’s $6 billion asking price.NO REVIEW FOR ROUGHING PASSERThere will be no assist from the replay booth when it comes to the NFL's roughing the passer rule.The league's 32 teams declined to adopt a proposal from the Los Angeles Rams that would have allowed coaches to ask for a replay booth review of the often-controversial call. It was one of several potential changes discussed at the league's annual meetings on Tuesday.Rich McKay — the NFL's Competition Committee chairman — said the league's brief 2019 experiment that allowed replay booth review of pass interference calls weighed heavily in the process. The rule was reversed in 2020 and highlighted the tricky nature of reviewing judgment calls on the field.“There are a lot of issues that go into it,” said McKay, who is also the Atlanta Falcons CEO. “It is a dramatic and almost drastic change of officiating, taking it from the field, up to the booth.""It wasn’t a long discussion and then we voted and it did not pass.”The list of changes on Tuesday was relatively minor. Among them: Tightening rules on helmet blows by eliminating the “butt, ram, spear” language that McKay said allowed several players to escape fines.NO FLEXThe NFL said it will not move to a flexible scheduling model for Thursday night games — at least for now.The league has explored a method to adjust its Thursday schedule as the season progressed, giving teams a 15-day notice that their upcoming game would be moved from the weekend to Thursday.“These national windows are for clubs who are playing well,"" said Brian Rolapp, the league's chief media and business officer. “We want to put the best teams in the best windows.”Rolapp said the flex proposal could come up again in May for a vote.The group did pass a resolution that allows teams to play two Thursday games each season on short weeks.ZERO HOURMost NFL players now have a new choice when selecting their jersey number — zero.All players — excluding offensive and defensive linemen — can now select No. 0 if they choose.Offensive linemen are still limited to the numbers between 50 and 79 while defensive linemen can select any number from 50 to 79 or 90 to 99.New Jaguars receiver Calvin Ridley announced he would be among those who would wear No. 0 next season.One of the more interesting rules suggestions was tabled. The Eagles had submitted a proposal that would permit a team to maintain possession of the ball after a score by substituting one offensive play — a fourth-and-20 attempt from the kicking team's 20-yard line — in lieu of an onside kickoff attempt.“There's not an appetite, yet, to have the onside kick go away,” McKay said. “I think what people would rather talk about is ways to get the rate of recovery up.”McKay said that historically, onside kicks have about a 13-14% success rate, but that number was down to 4% during the 2022 season.GUARDIAN CAP EXPANSIONThe use of the guardian cap — a padded addition that fits over a regular football helmet — will be expanded during the preseason to include running backs and fullbacks. Last season, offensive and defensive linemen, linebackers and tight ends used the cap.The cap's use will also be expanded to the regular season during practices that include contact.Jeff Miller — the NFL's Executive Vice President of Communications — said concussions were down 52% for the position groups that used the cap last season when compared to the previous three-year average of the same groups.LAFLEUR PREACHES PATIENCEGreen Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur is preaching patience as he prepares for the likelihood of having Jordan Love rather than Aaron Rodgers as his starting quarterback.Rodgers, 39, has indicated he intends to play for the New York Jets in 2023. Although Rodgers remains under contract with Green Bay, the Packers and Jets are negotiating on a potential trade that would send the four-time MVP to New York.That would cause the Packers to turn to Love, who has made just one career start since the Packers traded up to select him out of Utah State with the 26th overall pick in the 2020 draft. LaFleur cited Love’s inexperience Tuesday while telling reporters that “we’ve all got to kind of temper our expectations for him.”“Certainly I think we’re fooling ourselves if we think he’s going to go out there and perform at a level to the likes of what Aaron Rodgers (has done),” LaFleur said. “This guy is a once-in-a-lifetime, a generational talent. And I don’t think it necessarily started that way when he first started, you know. But he progressed into that. Like I said, it’s going to be a progression.""Hopefully we can surround him with enough people to help him perform at the best of his ability, and then we’ve got to do a great job as a coaching staff.”___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi and AP Sports Writers Stephen Whyno and Steve Megargee contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849772,Short-handed Wizards rout Celtics 130-111,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Just when it appeared Washington fans would have little to worry about besides draft position over the next couple weeks, the short-handed Wizards delivered a dominating victory over one of the NBA's best teams.Go figure.Kristaps Porzingis had 32 points and 13 rebounds, and the Wizards boosted their flickering postseason hopes with a 130-111 victory over the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night.The Wizards won despite the absence of Bradley Beal (left knee soreness) and Kyle Kuzma (right ankle sprain) and pulled within 2 1/2 games of Chicago for the final play-in spot in the Eastern Conference. Washington has six games remaining in the regular season.“Probably the best pace, for 36-to-40 minutes, that we've seen all year,” Wizards coach Wes Unseld Jr. said. “After makes, misses, were able to accumulate quite a few fast break points. Not all those were just off of misses. So being able to play with pace and kind of get stuff early in the clock I thought helped us.”Washington finished with a 19-11 edge in fast break points.The Celtics had their three-game winning streak snapped and fell to 2 1/2 games behind Milwaukee for the top record in the NBA. Jayson Tatum led Boston with 28 points, but the Celtics trailed 64-51 at halftime, and then their deficit rose to as many as 23 points in the third quarter.Milwaukee plays at Indiana on Wednesday before a showdown Thursday against the Celtics.Deni Avdija matched a career high with 25 points and added 10 rebounds for Washington. Monte Morris scored 19 points.“Trying to make the right decisions, trying to be aggressive,” Avdija said. “I guess I'm just not thinking, I'm just playing my game, making plays for others.”Jaylen Brown contributed 18 points for the Celtics.The Wizards went 1 of 8 from 3-point range in the first quarter but still led 29-23. Their shooting picked up in a big way — they finished 13 of 37 from beyond the arc — and Boston never mounted much of a challenge in the second half.The Celtics substituted liberally in the fourth quarter and actually cut the lead down to 13, but then Avdija had a steal and dunk and the Wizards held on without any trouble.AT THE BOTTOMUnseld had a response to those who suggest the Wizards would be better off losing these games. Washington still has an uphill climb to make the play-in round.“That might be something that on paper makes sense, but you can't go in the locker room and tell your team that we're about winning, we're about being competitive, and we're just going to lay down and give games away,"" he said. ""I think that's the wrong message.”After Tuesday's win, the Wizards (34-42) are a game ahead of Indiana (33-43), 1 1/2 ahead of Portland (32-43) and two up on Orlando (32-44). Falling behind those teams could certainly boost the lottery odds.“We understand the situation and the fact that that is a potential outcome. It's not a guarantee,"" Unseld said. ""If we don't get some guys back, it is what it is, but we still want to make sure whoever's available is going to play the right way, compete at a certain standard.”TIP-INSCeltics: Tatum played 31:52, and no other Boston player reached that total. Tatum, Marcus Smart and Al Horford did not play at all in the fourth quarter. Brown and Derrick White — the team's other two starters — played 2:39 each in that period. ... Smart scored 14 points and Malcolm Brogdon added 13.Wizards: Washington was actually down three starters. In addition to Beal and Kuzma, Daniel Gafford missed the game with left foot soreness.UP NEXTCeltics: At Milwaukee on Thursday night.Wizards: Host Orlando on Friday night.___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World

Conference USA is now 16-1 this postseason.North Texas, which trailed 41-29 at halftime, took its first lead of the game at 56-54 with 2:08 remaining on Moulaye Sissoko’s shot in the lane to cap a 10-0 run.Wisconsin forward Tyler Wahl missed two free throws with 49.1 seconds left and North Texas worked the clock down before Perry had it poked away. Wahl had a shot blocked at the rim, but Wisconsin secured the loose ball and called a timeout with 5.8 left. Wisconsin got it inside to Wahl but Sissoko knocked it away and dove on the ball to end it.The Mean Green, the nation's leader in scoring defense at 55.7 points per game, held Wisconsin without a point for the final 9:07 of the game. The Badgers made just one of their last 16 shots — with 10 straight misses.Kai Huntsberry scored four of his 12 points in the game-closing run for North Texas, which extended its program record for wins this season.Chucky Hepburn scored all 15 of his points in the first half for Wisconsin (20-15), which was making its first appearance in the NIT semifinals.Wisconsin dropped to 13-8 this season in games decided by five points or fewer.NEW VENUEThe semifinals and final are being played at Orleans Arena in Las Vegas after Madison Square Garden in New York hosted every year but two since 1938, with the 2020 tournament canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 event held in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

Owen Tippett added an empty-netter.The four-game winning streak matches the longest of the season and the Flyers now have just a 6.5% chance of winning the draft lottery, per tracker Tankathon.“We’ve had our ups and downs all year, but to put a stretch of games like this together towards the end, it’s always nice,” Tippett said.Depends who in Philly you ask.Brendan Gallagher and Rafael Harvey-Pinard scored for the Canadiens, who were eliminated from playoff contention with the loss.The Flyers wrapped a seven-game homestand at 5-1-1 and play three more home games before the season ends.Coach John Tortorella, who won his 700th career game this season, has been tasked with turning the Flyers into winners. Despite the late push at home, his first season has been a disaster in just about every capacity. The Flyers were ravaged by injuries to key players and the front office paid the price as in the midst of a makeover.Tortorella said he was warmly greeted by fans over the weekend at the Flyers charity carnival.But Flyers fans want better results -- soon.“They’re just dying for it to go the right way and get back to where we all want it to get to,” Tortorella said before the game. “I did spend a lot of my day saying that I have to be patient. A lot of people didn’t like hearing that. But there has to some patience and process to it.”The Flyers believe they're making the overdue and hard steps necessary to make them winners again. They fired general manager Chuck Fletcher earlier this month and replaced him on an interim basis with Danny Briere. Dave Scott, the longtime chairman of the Flyers' parent company Comcast Spectacor, announced Monday he will retire. Dan Hilferty will succeed Scott as chairman of the company on April 17 and as the team’s governor on July 1. The Flyers are in the market for a hockey president.“The thing that’s different with this for me is there’s a lot of other stuff,” Tortorella said. ""Not just the on-ice product, but there’s a lot of the other stuff that needs to get straightened out. Just a little bit too gray for me, there’s a lot of gray areas that I think need to get ironed out within the whole organization. I think that is a huge part of our process.”Cayden Primeau stopped 24 shots for Montreal in his first start of the season. The 23-year-old goalie is the son of former Flyers star Keith Primeau.Felix Sandstrom had 27 saves for the Flyers in place of injured goalie Carter Hart.FARRELL DEBUTForward Sean Farrell made his NHL debut for Montreal after two strong seasons at Harvard.

They are 9-1-1 in their last 11 and moved two points behind second-place New Jersey in the Metropolitan Division.The teams play Thursday night in Newark.“We generated a lot of offense in the first. You want to keep moving up in the standings,'' Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said. ”We've got a big one coming up on Thursday.""Shesterkin improved to 34-12-7 as the Rangers won for the sixth time in seven home games. They are 14-5-0 in their past 19 at Madison Square Garden.Chytil opened the scoring 5:23 in with his 22nd goal, with assists to Alexis Lafreniere and K’Andre Miller.Tarasenko made it 2-0 at 6:50, deflecting a perfect pass from defenseman Braden Schneider past Blue Jackets netminder Michael Hutchinson for his sixth goal since joining the Rangers in a trade from St. Louis on Feb. 9. Tarasenko has points in five of his last seven games and 11 points in his last 13. He has 16 goals overall this season.Kane increased the lead to 3-0 at the eight-minute mark of the first with his 21st goal this season and fifth since New York acquired him from Chicago on March 1.“We have a chance to have home ice in the first round,'' Kane said. ”That’s where our mindset is.""It was the first time both high-scoring acquisitions scored in the same game since joining the Rangers. The 34-year-old Kane played 16 seasons for the Blackhawks. Tarasenko, 31, played 11 seasons with the rival Blues.“Vladdy is a great player,'' Kane said. ”Both of us want to produce. Both of us want to do well here. It's nice to be on the same side with him after being in the same division for all those years and battling against each other.”Rookie forward Kirill Marchenko put the Blue Jackets on the board at 11:45 of the first with his 20th goal before Johnny Gaudreau narrowed the deficit to 3-2 at 19:31 with his 19th.Panarin scored his 25th at 17:46 of the second on the power play with assists to Zibanejad and Adam Fox.Zibanejad added his team-leading 38th goal at 14:27, one-timing a cross-ice pass from Panarin past Hutchinson.Zibanejad matched his career high with 81 points, equaling last season's total. He became the fourth Rangers player in the past 25 years with consecutive 80-point seasons, joining Panarin, Jaromir Jagr and Wayne Gretzky.Panarin leads the Rangers with 84 points. Zibanejad has 13 points in his last eight games.The pair became the third duo in franchise history with consecutive 80-point seasons, joining Rod Gilbert and Steve Vickers (1974-75 and 1975-76) and Gilbert and Jean Ratelle (1971-72 and 1972-73).Trocheck added an empty-net goal at 16:21 to complete the scoring. Fox and Lafreniere each had two assists.""They don't need much. They are a dangerous team,'' Columbus coach Brad Larsen said. “Their top three lines are pretty lethal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849778,"Saros's 35 saves carries Predators past Bruins, 2-1","BOSTON (AP) — Juuse Saros stopped 35 shots, Cody Glass scored late in the second period and the Nashville Predators beat NHL-best Boston 2-1 on Tuesday night, halting the Bruins’ seven-game winning streak.Chasing the Western Conference’s eighth and final playoff spot, the Predators won for just the third time in eight games. Cole Smith added an empty-netter late in the third.“There's a lot of belief in this room,” Glass said of the team's playoff chances. “Just beating that first-place team gives you that much more belief.”Boston, which matched its franchise record of 1970-71 with its 57th victory on Sunday, is five away from tying the league record of victories in a regular season with eight games left.Boston’s David Pastrnak scored his 52nd with less than a second left in the game.The Detroit Red Wings set the mark of 62 wins in 1995-96 and Tampa Bay matched it in 2018-19. The Bruins could have earned the President's Trophy with a victory and Carolina losing, which the Hurricanes did against Tampa Bay.“If we play the way that we have all year, then things will take care of itself,” Boston winger Brad Marchand said.Linus Ullmark made 21 saves for Boston, which suffered only its fourth regulation loss at home (30-4-3).“Tonight was one of those nights where we kind of did it to ourselves,” Bruins captain Patrice Bergeron said.There were very few scoring chances in the opening two periods before Glass collected the rebound of a blocked shot in the slot, spun and fired a wrister past Ullmark with 1:49 left in the period.Saros made a body save on Hampus Lindholm’s backhand bid from just outside the crease with just under 13 minutes left in regulation and another on David Krejci with about six minutes left. The Bruins outshot the Predators 16-4 in the final period.SUPPORTBoth the Predators and Bruins wore helmet stickers to show support for The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, after a shooting there Monday claimed the lives of three 9-year-old students and three adult staffers.The Bruins also held a moment of silence before the national anthem with the PA announcer saying: “The Bruins stand alongside the Nashville Predators in solidarity against gun violence and its support of the Nashville community.”""We felt like we needed to do our job the best we could and sacrifice and leave it all out there and maybe try to bring an inspiration to the city of Nashville,'' said Predators defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who didn't fly with the team Monday and stayed with his family after one of his three daughters was in lockdown at a nearby school.REST VS. RUSTAsked after the morning skate how the Bruins planned to rest players before the playoffs, coach Jim Montgomery said: “We do map it out. We talk to sports science. Obviously, (GM Don Sweeney) and I talk about it first. … We’re playing so many games right now players are not going to get rusty even if they only play two games a week.”NOTES: Nick Foligno returned to practice Tuesday morning. “It’s great to have him out there,” Montgomery said. “He brings so much energy, positive energy.” … Boston forward Jakub Lauko was out with an upper-body injury that, Montgomery said, “shouldn’t keep him out long.” … Nashville defenseman Roman Josi missed his six straight with an upper-body injury and center Matt Duchene was also out due to an upper-body injury. … Boston won the other meeting this season, 5-0 in Nashville on Feb. 16.UP NEXTPredators: At Pittsburgh on Thursday.Bruins: Host Columbus on Thursday.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World

No PLA aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line during this time. In response, Taiwan sent naval ships and used land-based missiles to monitor the PLA aircraft and vessels.
So far this month, Beijing has sent 341 military aircraft and 105 naval vessels around Taiwan. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.

In addition, the ministry said diplomatic privileges under Fiji's Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1971 would also be restored to the mission.During a Tuesday press conference, a member of the media asked China Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Mao Ning (毛寧) if the ministry had any comments on the name restoration. Mao said there is only one China in the world and that Taiwan is an ""inalienable part of China's territory.""Mao said the government in Beijing was the ""sole legal government"" representing the entirety of China. She alleged that this is the ""prevailing consensus"" in the global community and a ""universally recognized norm"" that governs international relations.She said Beijing opposes ""any attempt to create 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan.'"" The spokesperson closed by warning that any such attempt ""will not succeed.""Under pressure from China, the former government of Fiji unilaterally changed the name of Taiwan's representative office in Suva to the ""Taipei Trade Office in Fiji"" in 2018. After years of continuous efforts by Taiwan's government and office staff, coupled with the change in the ruling political parties in Fiji, the previous name has been restored, said MOFA.The People's Alliance Party, the National Federation party, and the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) have formed a coalition government with Sitiveni Rabuka from the People's Alliance serving as prime minister. The new government affirmed that since Taiwan established a representative office in Fiji in 1971, it has made substantial contributions to close exchanges and cooperation in the fields of agriculture, fisheries, medical care, education, and personnel training, which have all benefited the people of Fiji.After a discussion over the matter was held by a cabinet meeting, the Rabuka government decided to the revoke the decision made by the previous administration under former Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and restore the name of the representative office and its diplomatic privileges.MOFA expressed gratitude to the new government in Suva for the changes and emphasized that Fiji is ""an important like-minded partner of Taiwan for cooperation in the Pacific region."" The ministry pledged that the two countries will continue to ""maintain exchanges on the basis of existing cooperation, deepen friendly relations between Taiwan and Fiji, and jointly maintain democratic development, peace, stability, and economic prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.""",2023/03/29,2167,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849827,Perron's 3rd-period hat trick lifts Red Wings past Penguins,"DETROIT (AP) — David Perron had a hat trick in the third period and the Detroit Red Wings overcame the ejection of coach Derek Lalonde to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 7-4 on Tuesday night.Perron posted his ninth career three-goal game. He scored on a wrist shot early in the third, put Detroit ahead 5-4 on the power play with 3:40 left and added his 19th goal of the season 45 seconds later.“The biggest one of my career was obviously the one in the playoffs (with St. Louis) last year, but this one was special,” said Perron, a 16-year veteran. “I’ve gotten more in my 30s than I did in my early 20s, so maybe I’ve still got a couple left.”Lalonde was assessed a game misconduct during the second period. He profanely argued after unsuccessfully challenging Pittsburgh’s third goal on a claim of goalie interference.“I don’t remember that happening, and we had a couple guys in St. Louis who could get pretty wound up in Craig Berube and Steve Ott,” Perron said of a coac getting tossed. “(Lalonde) doesn’t usually say too much, so I’m not sure what happened.”Detroit squandered an early three-goal lead and won for just the fourth time in 16 games.“After (Lalonde) got thrown out, I thought the guys came together and played hard, inspired hockey,” said associate coach Bob Boughner, who ran the bench after the ejection. “That team over there is fighting for its playoff spot and they played hard and we were able to beat them.”Jonatan Berggren, Andrew Copp, Dominik Kubalik and Dylan Larkin also scored for Detroit. Alex Nedeljkovic, playing in his 100th game, made 35 saves.Jason Zucker, Jake Guentzel, Jeff Carter and Josh Archibald scored for Pittsburgh, which holds the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference.Guentzel's goal was his ninth in the last 12 games. Evegni Malkin added two assists, giving him 40 points in 26 career games against Detroit.The Red Wings jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first period.Berggren snapped an 11-game streak without a goal when he scored on a power play at 11:03 of the first. Following a Pittsburgh giveaway in its own zone, Copp scored 34 seconds later. He redirected a Moritz Seider shot from the point.Kubalik was credited with a goal when Gustav Lindstrom's shot from the point bounced off him and past screened goaltender Casey DeSmith.“I don’t know how to explain it. We got outplayed in that first period,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “What I did like was the response. I thought we responded the right way and climbed back into the game. It turns into a one-period game and then we didn’t get it done in the third.”The Penguins tied it during the first nine minutes of the second period.Zucker scored to put Pittsburgh on the board. Malkin's shot from the slot during a 5-on-3 situation deflected off Guentzel to make it 3-2. With Pittsburgh still on a power play, Carter scored on a shot that barely crossed the goal line.“Just have to move past it,” said DeSmith, who tied his season high for goals allowed. “Obviously, we didn’t miss the playoffs because we lost tonight. Plenty of more opportunities to come for the team and maybe for myself going forward. I just need to do better to help us get some points here.”GAME NOTESLalonde's ejection was just the third time since last season that an NHL head coach has been tossed. ... Detroit F Joe Veleno snapped a 20-game streak without the point when he assisted on Berggren's goal. ... Pittsburgh was 6-0-2 in its last eight games against Detroit. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849828,Warriors are hopeful of Andrew Wiggins returning this season,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Warriors coach Steve Kerr remains hopeful that Andrew Wiggins will return this season after the veteran forward missed his 20th straight game because of a family matter.Wiggins has been working out on his own every day but when and if he returns to the defending NBA champions, the training and medical staffs would need to evaluate his fitness and how much he might be able to contribute and how soon.“Beyond that, once he's back our training staff will be able to get with him and see where he is,” Kerr said Tuesday.There have been no details on what Wiggins is dealing with because it is private. He hasn't played since Feb. 13 against the Wizards.He missed his 40th game overall Tuesday against New Orleans, having been sidelined for three with left foot soreness, 10 because of a strained adductor in his right thigh, and seven games with a non-COVID illness.Stephen Curry said he is giving Wiggins the space he needs.“We’d love to have him and hope that that does happen, because we want to be whole and I’m sure he wants to be a part of this,” Curry said after a 120-109 victory over New Orleans on Tuesday night. “But when he walks in the door it’ll be when it’s the right time for him. That's kind of the expectation at this point.”The 28-year-old Wiggins signed a four-year contract extension last October.

Young, usually Atlanta's top scorer, had 16 points with 10 assists and only one second-half turnover.“I thought they played off each other and there was a connectivity there that was important to the team,” Snyder said.The Hawks remained tied with Toronto, which beat Miami 106-92 on Tuesday night, for the eighth-best record in the Eastern Conference.Murray said the Hawks know there's no room for home losses with only six games remaining in the regular season.“Just knowing we're in a must-win situation, trying just to control the Atlanta Hawks,” Murray said. “We came out ready to play for 48 minutes and got a great win.”The Cavaliers held out starting forward Isaac Okoro (left knee soreness) and center Jarrett Allen (strained right groin) and were led by Donovan Mitchell's 44 points.

Mitchell played for Snyder for five seasons (2017-22) in Utah. Snyder was hired by Atlanta on Feb. 26, after the Hawks fired Nate McMillan.Mitchell began the night 13 points away from 10,000 points and passed the mark on a layup to open the second half.GUARDING AGAINST FREE THROWSCavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said before the game a goal was to limit Young's trips to the free-throw line. “He does such a good job of putting you in harm's way,” Bickerstaff said. Young made 6 of 9 free throws.Meanwhile, Okongwu made 11 of 12 free throws.“I told him after the game he's got to go 12 for 12,” Snyder said.PRAISE FOR MITCHELLAfter the game, Snyder said “it was kind of strange seeing (Mitchell) on the other team.”Snyder said he is not surprised to see Mitchell, who is averaging a career-best 27.4 points, thriving with Cleveland.“The way he's playing now, it's not surprising to me in the slightest,"" Snyder said. ""... I think the world of him, obviously.”BREY VISITSMike Brey, who stepped down as Notre Dame's coach after posting a 483-280 record in 23 seasons, visited the Hawks' shootaround practice Tuesday morning.

Memphis would extend the lead to 23 in the third.Still, Orlando made a push to get back in, partially fueled by Goga Bitadze, who came off the bench for 11 of his 13 points in the third to cut the Memphis lead to 87-73. Things got even tighter in the fourth, but Memphis was able to hang on. Orlando has faced similar close games on several occasions lately.“It's very valuable,” Banchero said. “Just knowing how to manage games and coming down and putting good possessions together at the end of the game. Today was different. It was more of us just chasing them.”By holding off the late-charging Magic, the Grizzlies won their 33rd game at home, setting a franchise record for home wins in a season.“A win is a win.

He plans to plead not guilty, Reuters news agency reported, based on information from a person familiar with the matter.The new indictment said Bankman-Fried ordered the $40 million cryptocurrency payment to a private wallet from Alameda's main trading account, to persuade Chinese government authorities to unfreeze Alameda accounts with more than $1 billion of cryptocurrency.Prosecutors said the Alameda accounts had been frozen as part of an investigation into an unnamed Alameda counterparty, and Bankman-Fried's prior efforts to lobby Chinese officials to lift the freeze were unsuccessful.They also said Bankman-Fried around November 2021 authorized a transfer of tens of millions of dollars of additional cryptocurrency to ""complete"" the bribe.Prosecutors had previously accused Bankman-Fried of stealing billions of dollars in customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund, and orchestrating an illegal campaign donation scheme to buy influence in Washington, DC.FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, when it ran out of money after the equivalent of a bank run on the global cryptocurrency exchange.Bankman-Fried has remained free on a $250 million personal recognizance bond that lets him stay with his parents in Palo Alto, California.He has pleaded not guilty to eight of the 13 counts he faces, and not yet been arraigned on the campaign finance or bribery conspiracy charges.Bankman-Fried's case is part of an escalating crackdown on alleged abuses at digital asset exchanges by US prosecutors and regulators, following last year's plunge in the values of Bitcoin and other tokens as central banks raised interest rates.dh/wd (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/29,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849878,Honduran students grateful for support from Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Despite their government’s decision to switch diplomatic recognition to China after 82 years of formal diplomatic relations, a group of Honduran students in Taiwan want people to know that they are grateful for the assistance Taiwan has provided to them and their country until now.The National Chengchi University (NCCU) students spoke to Taiwan News on Tuesday (March 28) after their first meeting with university administration since the announcement of the diplomatic break and said that what comes next is unclear. During the meeting, they were told different government agencies, the university, and the university president were still working to find a solution.Master’s student Jorge Salandia said that he still does not know if he will be able to finish his studies. “Basically, at this point, we are pushing for a little bit more clarity,” he said, “but we do realize this took MOFA by surprise, and of course our university, because I know it’s hard to ask them to take the burden.”Victor Hugo, also a master’s student, said despite the uncertainty, the group was highly appreciative of the government’s commitment to funding their studies until at least the end of the semester, and that this will give students, the university, and the government time to decide what to do. “Until June they will keep the stipend and the tuition coming, it will be enough time for them to prepare financially, and speak to any third party like their parents or the government in Honduras,” he said, “and there are three months for the universities to have a clear response.”Hugo also said that while the university had dealt with similar situations before, “they have only ever had one or two students in NCCU with this problem, but this time it was much more than that.”Taiwan News obtained a document showing that out of the 22 Hondurans enrolled at NCCU, 18 of them receive Taiwan government scholarships. Eight students receive funding from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), 10 from the Taiwan International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) scholarships, three are self-funded, and one receives an undefined scholarship.In Central America, students from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize (of which the latter two are Taiwan's formal diplomatic allies) are currently eligible for the ICDF scholarship, though it is unclear whether Honduras will remain on this list. Before Panama broke ties with Taiwan in 2017 and Nicaragua did the same in 2021, ICDF was awarding scholarships to students from those countries, but no longer does.NCCU staff held a meeting on March 28 with its Honduran students for the first time since the Taiwan-Honduras diplomatic split was announced. (Taiwan News photo)Eligibility for the MOFA scholarship is not limited by nationality, though applications are administered by Taiwan’s diplomatic missions in applicants’ home countries. Taiwan’s embassy in Honduras has been disestablished with the ambassador returning to Taiwan on March 25.Abagail Duarte is an undergraduate student who is in her second semester with three more years of studies before graduation, and said that during their meeting the university and staff members had expressed remorse. “Even in the meeting they said ‘we are sorry’, and I was surprised, because we are the ones to be sorry,” she said.Hugo agreed, saying that during Taiwan’s relationship with Honduras, Taiwan never said “we can’t now.” “There was always an emergency committee, there were always missions sent to our country, and there were a bunch of sustainable projects in many parts of the country,” he said.Duarte also said that NCCU staff asked the Honduran students if they would consider going to China to complete their studies. She said that it was difficult to consider a move, because she and her peers had “already built a new life here” in Taiwan.Sophia Fuentes is also an undergraduate student with three more years of study before graduation, and said that for her, going to China is not an option she would consider. “One of the main reasons is that in going to China, we would need to start from zero, our credits will not be taken over,” she said.In addition to the disruption to study, Fuentes said that her government decisions appeared ungrateful to Taiwan, but that she and her classmates are “very thankful” to Taiwan for the support they have received. “It’s kind of unfair for Honduras to end relations so abruptly without even saying thank you,” she said, highlighting the more than 80 year relationship between the two countries.Duarte said that after the meeting with the university she realized it would take some time for the government and the university to decide what to do. “We realized that these decisions are not made in a week, it goes much deeper, and we just hope that the best decision will be made for us,” she said.Salandia agreed: “We just know it’s uncertain, but we are hoping for the best.”",2023/03/29,2308,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849882,Vrana scores twice for Blues in 6-5 overtime win,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Jakub Vrana scored two goals, leading the St. Louis Blues to a 6-5 overtime victory Tuesday over the Vancouver Canucks.Vrana scored 28 seconds into overtime for St. Louis. He finished a give-and-go with Brayden Schenn to help the Blues rebound for a win after taking a 5-3 lead into the third period.""I think overall that was just an amazing play by Brayden. He made a great move there, obviously pass it to me right when I was standing,"" Vrana said. ""Which was perfect to just shoot the puck there. So great play by him. I think I built a lot of speed there. I saw that the ‘D’ was a little bit flat-footed, try to go around him. I was hoping for him to do that move. And he did it. So it worked well.""The Blues improved to 5-1-1 in their past seven games. Vancouver had a three-game winning streak snapped and lost for just the third time in its last 13 games. The Canucks had won five of their previous six.Pavel Buchnevich, Alexey Toropchenko, Justin Faulk and Robert Thomas also scored for the Blues.Andrei Kuzmenko and Quinn Hughes scored two goals apiece, and Brock Boeser added a goal and two assists for the Canucks.Jordan Binnington stopped 32 shots for St. Louis, which improved to 4-0-2 against the Canucks. Vancouver's Thatcher Demko fell to 2-2-1 lifetime against the Blues. He recorded 25 saves.Vancouver scored twice in the third period to tie it 5.“We played a pretty solid game, but in the end, we gave up way too many goals,” Blues coach Craig Berube said. “Penalty kill, got to do a better job. The fourth goal, we’ve got to defend that. We got mixed up on that play, and the tying goal, tough play, but we’ve got to try and eat that shot from the point.”The Canucks narrowed the gap to 5-4 on Kuzmenko’s second goal at 12:18.Hughes tied it with his second goal at 19:06 while the Canucks had an extra skater on the ice.“Quinn has been very assertive in all facets of the game,” said coach Rick Tocchet. “He was competing tonight. Even when it was 5-2, you could tell by the gleam in his eye like he didn’t think we were out of it. So, obviously he was the main reason we got back in it.”Vrana snapped a 2-2 tie at 7:24 of the second period and kicked off a three-goal push. Brandon Saad picked off a Boeser pass and fed Vrana, who scored on a slap shot from the top of the slot.“I collected the puck and I kind of saw him in the slot and figured I would give him one,” Saad said. ""He had a one-timer. As soon as I turned, I knew it went in. Great shot, great play. Like I said, he can shoot the puck. He’s a pure goal-scorer. It’s fun to watch him out there. It’s fun to play with him.”Thomas beat Demko for a power-play goal at 12:08. On a rush, Kasperi Kapanen made a great feed to Buchnevich, who pushed it in for his 25th goal at 13:36.“I don’t think we played that well in the first to be honest,” Hughes said. “We didn’t really play that well in the second either.”ICE CHIPSBlues Assigned goaltender Joel Hofer, 22, to the AHL’s Springfield Thunderbirds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849883,"Stars get goals from 4 players, beat skidding Blackhawks 4-1","CHICAGO (AP) — Tyler Seguin, Colin Miller, Joe Pavelski and Luke Glendening scored as the Dallas Stars topped the skidding Chicago Blackhawks 4-1 on Tuesday night.Dallas improved to 94 points and climbed into a second-place tie with idle Colorado in the tight Central Division. First-place Minnesota has 95 points.Jake Oettinger lost a bid for his fifth shutout when Tyler Johnson popped in a loose rebound at 10:33 of the third period. Oettinger made 17 saves as the Stars rebounded from a 3-1 loss at home to Vancouver on Saturday.Oettinger was only lightly tested as Dallas dominated for most of the game and outshot the last-place Blackhawks 33-18. Dallas, which is 3-1-1 in its last five games, handed Chicago its sixth straight loss.“We came in and did what we had to do and got two points,"" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. ""We're coming off a pretty poor effort, so that was much better effort by us.”Dallas took charge early in this one.“We got a lead. We played hard,” Pavelski said. “The points are important right now, obviously, and it felt like a lot of guys were engaged and that's important as we build over the next couple of weeks.”Chicago's attack was so weak through the first two periods that some United Center fans sarcastically cheered their team’s shots on goal. The Blackhawks didn’t manage one until Lukas Reichel fired from high in the slot at 13:49 of the first period.“We didn't play well at all,” Johnson said. “It also wasn't just the first two periods, it's kind of the whole time.”Chicago coach Luke Richardson agreed.“It was one of the few games this year when we just didn't have skating legs,” he said.Alex Stalock stopped 26 of 30 shots before being assessed a game misconduct penalty with 3:37 left. Petr Mrazek replaced him.Stalock seemed to be upset after Glendening crashed into him after scoring Dallas's fourth goal, a short-handed tally, at 7:04 of the third. Stalock has been sidelined twice this season with concussions.The Stars led 2-0 after the first period on Seguin’s 18th goal, scored 5:45 in, and Miller’s power-play score with 1:11 left.Seguin snapped a one-timer between Stalock’s pads from the slot after taking Jani Hakanpaa’s centering pass. Miller connected on a low shot from the top of the left circle.Pavelski tipped in his 22nd goal from a scrum in front at 11:24 of the second to make it 3-0. He redirected Joel Hanley’s shot from the point.Glendening added his short-handed goal in the third. He completed a swift 2-on-1 break with Ty Dellandrea by tipping in his feed, then accidentally ran into Stalock.Johnson swept in a rebound for his first goal in 14 games midway through the third.TOEWS HINTS AT RETIREMENTLongtime Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews practiced with teammates before the game — his first time skating with them since a game in Edmonton on Jan. 28 — but hinted his stellar career could be winding down after 15 years.The 34-year-old Toews made a statement through the team on Feb. 19 saying he would be stepping away because of the effects of Chronic Immune Response Syndrome and “long COVID.”In meeting with reporters Tuesday, Toews stopped short of saying he hoped to play in any of Chicago’s remaining games this season. His eight-year, $84 million contract is set to expire at the end of the season.Toews said he’s feeling stronger, but isn’t sure if he’ll be able to play again for the Blackhawks or another team.“Both, if I’m being fully honest,” Toews said. “I feel like I’ve said it already, that I’ve gotten to the point where my health is more important.”WORTH NOTINGThe Blackhawks shut down C Philipp Kurashev (shoulder) for the season. He was injured last Thursday in Washington after taking a hit from Tom Wilson. … Chicago D Jarred Tinordi sat out for a maintenance day and LW Jujhar Khaira with an illness. … Dallas C Max Domi faced the Blackhawks, his previous team, for the first time since he was dealt to the Stars at the March 3 trade deadline. … Dallas F Mason Marchment (lower body) missed his seventh game.UP NEXTStars: Play at Arizona on Friday.Blackhawks: Host the St. Louis Blues on Thursday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849884,Nashville Predators' McDonagh remembers shooting victims,"BOSTON (AP) — When the Nashville Predators' team flight took off for Boston, defenseman Ryan McDonagh wasn't aboard.He stayed home Monday, to be with his three young daughters in the shaken community.A day after a fatal grade school shooting in Nashville left six dead, including three children, McDonagh caught a commercial flight. Hours after arriving, and with both teams wearing helmet stickers to remember the victims, he helped the Predators beat the Bruins 2-1 Tuesday night.“It’s not really the first shooting, unfortunately. When you have kids and it happens close to home it hits definitely different,” McDonagh said. “Like any parent, you do anything you can to help your family and kids out.”McDonagh’s daughters — Falan, Murphy and Nola — are all under 9 years old.“His daughter was close to the school -- their school was in lockdown,” coach John Hynes said.Said McDonagh: “Quite frankly there are really no words that you can say after what went on yesterday in Nashville.""“Just a tragedy for those families and everybody affected. You don’t really realize it until you have kids of your own and the perspective. It hits you,"" he said.McDonagh said it wasn’t just another game as the Predators beat the NHL-leading Bruins.“We felt like we needed to go out and do our job the best we could and sacrifice and leave it all out there and just try to maybe bring a little bit of inspiration to the city of Nashville,” McDonagh said.Hynes spoke to his team about the situation.“It's something we talked with our guys about, that we’re on a platform here as professional athletes and coaches,” he said. “The city of Nashville means a lot to these people. We wanted to put an effort for the first responders, for the people that were involved in the incident — the families, the school. We’re just really proud of the guys.”The Predators and Bruins wore helmet stickers to show support for The Covenant School, where three 9-year-old students and three adult staffers were killed.The Bruins also held a moment of silence before the national anthem.“The Bruins stand alongside the Nashville Predators in solidarity against gun violence and its support of the Nashville community,” the PA announcer said.Nashville is trying to make a run at the eighth and final playoff spot and won for just the third time in eight games.Hynes talked to his team about the few hours of relief his team could bring to folks back home.“We did talk to our guys about that,” he said. “Sometimes when things are tough in life — part of sports, it is for the players and people involved with it, but I think for the fans, that it’s an opportunity to take a few hours and maybe get away from a few things in your life. That was the message that we took into the game.” ___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849885,Starbucks leader grilled by Senate over anti-union actions,"Longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz insisted the coffee chain hasn't broken labor laws and is willing to bargain with unionized workers during an often testy, two-hour appearance before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.But he also was firm in his stance that the Seattle coffee giant already provides good wages and benefits and doesn't need a union. And he pointed out that only around 1% of Starbucks’ 250,000 U.S. employees have elected to join a union.“We've done everything that we possibly can to respect the right under the law of our partners' ability to join a union,” Schultz said. “But conversely, we have consistently laid out our preference, without breaking any law, of communicating to our people what we believe is our vision for the company.”At least 293 of Starbucks’ 9,000 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late 2021, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Starbucks Workers United, the labor group seeking to unionize stores, has yet to reach a contract agreement with the company at any Starbucks store.U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent who has been a vocal supporter of Starbucks labor organizers, accused the company of stalling. He said multiple federal courts and administrative judges at the NLRB have found Starbucks guilty of hundreds of labor law violations, including firing labor organizers and illegally closing unionized stores.“The fundamental issue we are confronting today is whether we have a system of justice that applies to all, or whether billionaires and large corporations can break the law with impunity,” Sanders said.Jaysin Saxton, a disabled U.S. Coast Guard veteran and former Starbucks shift supervisor, testified that the company fired him in July after he led a two-day strike at his Augusta, Georgia, store, which voted to unionize last spring. Saxton has filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB.Prior to the union vote, Saxton said Starbucks flooded the store with managers who disciplined employees for minor violations and held required meetings where they threatened employees with a loss of benefits if they voted to unionize. After the union vote, he said, seven workers were fired and others at the store saw their hours cut.“Starbucks and big corporations have a lot of power and money and they are willing to pull out all the stops to deny workers a voice and a seat at the table,” he said.Schultz denied the company has broken the law and said Starbucks is appealing those charges. He said Starbucks respects workers' right to unionize but believes the company already provides its workers with industry-leading wages and benefits.He noted that Starbucks' average starting wage is $17.50, while the minimum wage in Vermont is $13.18.""I think unions have served an important role in American business for many years. In the ‘50s and ’60s, unions generally were working on behalf of people in a company where people haven’t been treated fairly,"" Schultz said. ""We do not believe that we are that kind of company. We do nothing nefarious. We put our people first.”That comment earned a rebuke from Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, who said $17 per hour is not a living wage.“Any large corporation shouldn't necessarily be bragging about $15 to $20 wages,” Braun said.But other Republicans defended Starbucks, saying it has created millions of jobs and is being demonized by Democrats to bolster their support from unions.Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, questioned why customers are willing to pay $6 for a Starbucks latte, and said his family is satisfied with Maxwell House. But Starbucks still deserves respect, he said.“The hearing today is convened to attack a private company for its success,"" Paul said.Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, questioned Schultz's respect for employees, noting that the company has refused to add new benefits — like credit card tipping or wage increases — at stores that have unionized. Schultz countered that those benefits are subject to bargaining.Smith said labor organizers are seeking to address an imbalance of power within the company. Workers say Starbucks cuts their schedules with little notice, for example, making them ineligible for benefits.“You're a billionaire and they are your employees. The imbalance is extreme,” Smith said.Schultz angrily responded that repeatedly calling him a “billionaire” was unfair.“I grew up in federally subsidized housing. My parents never owned a home. Yes, I have billions of dollars. I earned it. No one gave it to me,” he said.Sanders had sought Schultz's testimony for months. Schultz had tried to sidestep the hearing, suggesting that others in the company were more deeply involved in labor matters.But Sanders argued that Schultz, who stepped down as interim CEO last week but remains on the company’s board, was instrumental in setting the company's policies. Schultz, who led Starbucks from 1987 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2017, returned as interim CEO last April.Sanders asked Schultz to commit to providing the union with contract proposals within 14 days. Schultz would not, but said Starbucks remains prepared to meet in-person for bargaining. The union has tried to hold some bargaining sessions over Zoom, which Starbucks has rejected.Starbucks' anti-union stance appears set to continue under the company's new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, who took over leadership of the company last week.“I continue to believe a direct relationship with our partners is the best way forward,” Narasimhan told The Associated Press last week.Still, the company could face some internal pressure to improve its labor relations. Late Wednesday, Starbucks said its shareholders had approved a measure calling for an independent assessment of the company's commitment to workers' rights. Fifty-two percent of those voting favored the measure.",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849897,"""Ear Up Plus"" supported 18 indie music units to broaden the music spectrum in Hong Kong","HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 29 March 2023 - Indie music is no longer for a niche audience but the new black in the Hong Kong music market. Ear Up Music, a music label that spotlights new music of Hong Kong, strives to incubate indie musicians to be self-sufficient in the industry through music festivals, mentorship programmes, workshops, and training camps, as well as collaborating with the music, academic and creative industries to bring Hong Kong music forward to the global scene.            This year, Ear Up Music stepped up their core programme – ""Ear Up Incubation"" – into ""Ear Up Plus 2022: Indie Label Sponsorship Program"" (""Ear Up+""). Sponsored by Create Hong Kong of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, ""Ear Up+"" provided 18 music units with professional support including dedicated small group mentorship sessions about label management, music production, brand building and marketing strategy to assist their sustainable development in the music industry.   Among the 18 ""Ear Up+"" finalists, 8 shortlisted indie music units were entitled to a ""label sponsorship"" of HK$450,000 max. for music production and promotion. They were able to bring their music to the market with passion and strategic tactics in partnership with a commercial music company. The finalists displayed their talents at the Ear Up Music Festival in January. The remaining 10 finalists were entitled to a ""production sponsorship"" of HK$60,000 max for producing one song.   Startup Music to stand out from the mainstream   The 8 shortlisted performers (in no particular order) included  Charming Way,  Lester Lam,  The Hertz,  FIESTER,  XTIE,  Yack Studio,  Prune Deer, and  Virgin Vacation. Many of them were alumni of Ear Up Music programmes in the past.   With their label sponsorship funds, they created two songs and two music videos, as well as executed their own promotional plans. The overall outcome was in line with Ear Up Music's mission to create a more diverse music ecology and encourage rising young musicians to experiment with creative promotional ideas, while injecting a new impetus into the local music scene and creating a multi-media dialogue.   With high circulation and streaming rates from certain indie musicians, it has been proven that the music industry in Hong Kong is no longer just a mainstream culture. Indie music has evolved over the years into a multicultural creative industry through the endless efforts of musicians.            A bright future for indie music   In recent years, local indie music has been thriving with indie musicians successfully attracting a wide range of fans with their unique music styles and genres and gradually forming an unprecedented music scene with its own unique vibe. This in turn influenced mainstream music labels to reposition themselves.   Without the support of major record labels, indie musicians lack the essential capital and connections which limits their development, connections within the industry, and exposure. From songwriting, post-production and music video ideas, to filming, hunting for performing opportunities, and marketing, their projects are either self-financed or rely on their own limited connections.   However, there are still many indie musicians who, through their own endless creativity and enthusiasm, overcame all these obstacles to produce great music with its own character. Ear Up Music is proud to support indie musicians in all aspects through ""Ear Up+"". This project is not only about music, but also about the entire operation of a brand so fans will know more and fall in love with local indie music culture through more professional production and promotion.   All Ear Up+ performers rock the stage and extend the creative music industry         The MV for indie rock band Charming Way's new song ""Imagine Imagine"" is a montage of different scenes and surreal video spaces to express the richness of the scene and an imaginative dream world. The immersive new song release event was a cross-media event, using screen projections, lighting design, virtual reality, and mixed reality. At the same time, the band actively engaged in musical exchanges with Cantopop and R&B singers, sharing the delicate relationship between music and life through IG live broadcasts and inviting the KOLs popular with young people to film IG reels.           The all-female heavy metal and electro rock band FIESTER collaborated with local video production team The Sumerian Studio to produce music videos for their new songs ""It's Time"" and ""Torrent Butterfly"". In addition, they launched a publicity campaign to attract more attention, such as advertising on public transport, collaborating with the social welfare sector for community activities, holding record release parties, selling related merchandises, holding Giveaway events, and collaborating with online media targeting teenagers.           The Hertz is an indie-pop band with a diverse mix of funk and rock. Its self-financed independent label 852 HZ handled all aspects of production and marketing, organizing offline activities such as calligraphy or illustration exhibitions and collecting stories on social media platforms to interact with audiences. The band also collected pre-written time capsules from the participants during the song release event, which they will send them out on their behalf a year later.           Singer-songwriter Lester Lam presented a multi-sensory immersive experience in his concept concert titled ""Rainy days in the Blue Whale"", blurring the boundaries between reality and surreality, including hearing (music, sound design, etc.), sight (set design, lighting, dance, animation) and sensory (rain, snow, fog, wind, etc.), presenting a re-imagined version of The Blue Whale Jazz Club in Los Angeles.           The instrumental rock band, Prune Deer, focused on artistic activities as local promotion, extending the MV story about the worldview ""past, present and future"" to reality, and collaborated with local art photographers to cross artistic boundaries. The band adopted the Arena Stage style in their release event to enhance the sensual excitement of instrumental rock to the audience at close range. The band also worked with overseas music curators to promote their music in Taiwan and Japan and collaborated with renowned Japanese sound mixers to further expand the reach of Prune Deer's music to new markets.           The experimental instrumental rock band - Virgin Vacation - teamed up with musicians, artists, and designers to produce new songs and MVs showcasing their unique musical style. These creative talents included Li Chi Tak, Lai Tat Tat Wing, Overloaddance, Romers Quartet, MV Director wootwoot and Aberto Gerosa@Thy Lab. The new songs were released at The Room in Freespace, with the participation of Fountain de Chopin. The show offered a unique experience for the audience to immerse in the music of Virgin Vacation through their performance, visuals, and lighting effects.           XTIE is a new generation singer-songwriter who promotes body positivity through art and music.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849925,Senate votes to repeal Iraq War approval many see as mistake,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted Wednesday to repeal the resolution that gave a green light for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a bipartisan effort to return a basic war power to Congress 20 years after an authorization many now view as a mistake.Iraqi deaths are estimated in the hundreds of thousands, and nearly 5,000 U.S. troops were killed in the war after President George W. Bush’s administration falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.“This body rushed into a war"" that had massive consequences, said Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat who has pushed for years to repeal the powers.Senators voted 66-30 to repeal the 2002 measure and also the 1991 authorization that sanctioned the U.S.-led Gulf War. If passed by the House, the repeal would not be expected to affect any current military deployments. But lawmakers in both parties are increasingly seeking to claw back congressional powers they have given the White House over U.S. military strikes and deployments, and some lawmakers who voted for the Iraq War two decades ago now say that was a mistake.Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., noted it would be the first time in more than 50 years that Congress would repeal a war powers vote, since the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that authorized military force in Vietnam was repealed in the early 1970s.“Americans want to see an end to endless Middle East wars,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, adding that passing the repeal “is a necessary step to putting these bitter conflicts squarely behind us.”Supporters, including 18 Republican senators, say the repeal is crucial to prevent future abuses and to reinforce that Iraq is now a strategic partner of the United States. Opponents say the repeal could project weakness as the U.S. still faces conflict in the Middle East.“Our terrorist enemies aren’t sunsetting their war against us,” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is at home recovering from a fall earlier this month and missed the vote. “When we deploy our servicemembers in harm’s way, we need to supply them with all the support and legal authorities that we can.”The repeal’s future is less certain in the House, where 49 Republicans joined with Democrats in supporting a similar bill two years ago. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has suggested he is open to supporting a repeal even though he previously opposed it, but Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has indicated he would like to instead replace it with something else. But it is unclear what that would be.Kaine and Todd Young, R-Ind., who led the effort together, have said they believe a strong bipartisan vote sends a powerful message to Americans who believe their voices should be heard on matters of war and peace.President Donald Trump’s administration cited the 2002 Iraq war resolution as part of its legal justification for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani, but the two war powers resolutions have otherwise rarely been used as the basis for any presidential action. About 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and assist and advise local forces.A separate 2001 authorization for the global war on terror would remain in place under the bill, which President Joe Biden has said he will support.The October 2002 votes to give Bush broad authority for the Iraq invasion were a defining moment for many members of Congress as the country debated whether a military strike was warranted. The U.S. was already at war then in Afghanistan, the country that hosted the al-Qaida plotters responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, something Iraq played no part in.The Bush administration had drummed up support among members of Congress and the American public for invading Iraq by promoting what turned out to be false intelligence alleging Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. After the initial March 2003 invasion, American ground forces quickly discovered that the allegations of nuclear or chemical weapons programs were baseless.The U.S. overthrow of Iraq’s security forces precipitated a brutal sectarian fight and violent campaigns by Islamic extremist groups in Iraq. Car bombings, assassinations, torture and kidnapping became a part of daily life for years.Some GOP senators opposing the repeal, including McConnell, have raised concerns about recent attacks against U.S. troops in Syria. A drone strike last week killed an American contractor and wounded five troops and another contractor, then a rocket attack wounded another service member. Iranian-backed militants are believed responsible for the attacks.Biden and his administration have argued that the repeal would not affect any response to Iran. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both said at a Senate hearing last week that American troops are authorized to protect themselves and respond to attacks, including under Article 2 of the Constitution, which gives the president the authority to protect troops.Sen. Menendez, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said just ahead of the vote that the repeal “in no way diminishes” the U.S. ability to deter Iranian aggression.“This is not about Iran,” Menendez said. “This is about Iraq. Saddam Hussein is gone.”The pushback from McConnell comes amid a growing rift in the Republican Party on the U.S. role in the Middle East, with some echoing Trump’s “America First” message to argue against military intervention abroad. Other Republicans are concerned Congress is giving too much leeway to the president in matters of war.“It’s time we take back our constitutional authority to declare war,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., after voting for the repeal. Cramer said every authorization on the books should relate to current threats.Young said that “a lot of lessons have been learned over the last 20 years.”He said supporting the legislation “want to ensure that the American people can hold us accountable, rather than delegating those important authorities to an executive branch and then lamenting the unwitting wisdom of the executive branch if things don’t go well.""___Associated Press writer Lolita C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849926,Basic training without yelling: Army recruits get 2nd chance,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Last August, Daysia Holiday decided to try one more time to join the Army.She’d taken the academic test and failed three times. So, when she was offered a slot in a new Army prep course to help improve her scores and qualify for basic training, she jumped at the chance.Seven months later, Pvt. 2nd Class Holiday is a proud graduate of Army basic training, and is finishing her advanced instruction at Fort Lee, Virginia, to become a power generation specialist who will maintain engines and other equipment for the service.Holiday is an early beneficiary of the new program, which gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards. In place for only eight months, it is already making a significant difference for both the Army and those who want to serve in it.So far, 5,400 soldiers have made it through the prep course since it started in August at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That’s an important boost since the Army fell dramatically short of its recruiting goals last year, due to low unemployment and general wariness about military service. And at least one other military service, the Navy, took notice and is setting up a similar course.For those who make it through the program, it can be life-changing. Holiday, 23, said many of her peers in her hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, didn’t make it out of high school, with some “dead or in jail.” Sitting outside the class building in her Army fatigues last summer, she talked about trying to pass the academic test for two years with no success.She said she wanted to set an example, especially for her younger siblings. The prep course gave her a second chance. She raised her academic score by more than 20 points.The course, she said, was like “basic training without the yelling.” It also allowed her to bond with fellow students. “We helped each other out throughout basic training, so it was easy,” she said. “All of us actually passed, so it was a good experience. And we all keep in touch.”Army leaders say the program — it involves classroom instruction and training ranging from how to wear the uniform and properly make a bed to fitness and discipline — gives recruits like Holiday an advantage.“I think an interesting thing we’ve seen is that the kids coming out of that course, who go into basic, actually seem to have a little bit of a leg up,” said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. “During basic training, certain young individuals who show a little bit more leadership skills than others get selected to have leadership positions. And what we’re seeing is the kids coming out of the prep course are often the ones who are being chosen for that.”As of March 17, nearly 8,400 people had been admitted to the prep course and more than 5,400 had graduated and gone on to basic training. Army Lt. Col. Randy Ready, spokesman for the Army Center for Initial Military Training, said about 6% of those recruits don’t make it through basic and advanced individual training, about the same attrition rate as for those who don’t go through the prep course.Ready said almost 4,000 of the graduates were in the academic track and about 1,400 were in the fitness track. Students in the academic program increased their test scores by an average of 19 points, he said.“It has been largely very, very successful,” said Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, head of Army Recruiting Command, adding that students who go through the prep course come out more prepared. “It instills a level of positively and confidence in those future soldiers.”Gen. James McConville, Army chief of staff, told a House committee on Tuesday that students in the program are improving their academic scores and losing 4% to 6% of their body fat.“We’re really giving them discipline,” he said. “They’re getting in shape. We’re giving them a head start. So when going into initial military training, where they were at the lowest category, they’re actually excelling and in some ways exceeding the standards — becoming the student leaders.”Once in the program, recruits are tested every week. And every three weeks they can move into basic training if they pass the military’s academic test — the Armed Services Voluntary Aptitude Battery — or if they meet the physical standards. If they don't pass or meet the standards after the first three weeks, they can stay on and keep testing for up to 90 days, but they have to leave the Army if they haven't succeeded by then.Army leaders initially thought they might open as many as four locations for the prep course, but they haven't seen the need. Instead, they doubled the capacity at Fort Jackson and created a smaller, similar program at Fort Benning, Georgia, which gives young soldiers a chance to raise their academic scores if they want to qualify for higher-skilled jobs or bonuses.The program got the Navy's attention. Late last November, Navy Capt. Frank Brown and several others visited Fort Jackson, and as a result will open a new sailor fitness prep course next month. Brown said recruits who are 6% above the body composition requirements will take a three-week fitness course, and can repeat it for up to 90 days to meet the standards and go on to boot camp.Brown, the director of operations for training at Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois, said 60 to 80 recruits will start the course on April 10. He said the Navy is also planning a pilot program for an academic course, likely this summer, to allow lower-scoring recruits to improve so they can qualify for higher-skilled jobs.Air Force officials said they haven't ruled out doing a prep program, but are currently using other ways to boost recruiting.“We are focusing our efforts on eliminating unnecessary or outdated policy barriers to recruiting, adapting our outreach strategy, and adjusting our recruiting approach"" to better reach potential recruits, said Maj. Gen. Ed Thomas, commander of the Air Force Recruiting Service.As for Holiday, when she graduates Wednesday she will head to her first post, in Fort Carson, Colorado. “I’m very much glad that I did it,” she said. “It’s been a good journey for me.""And she's got bigger ambitions.“I still want to try to do the Green Beret (course),” she said. “And, I want to do other courses — airborne and stuff like that. And I want to also try to become an officer as well.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849927,Poll: Cut federal spending — but not big-ticket programs,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the federal budget standoff, the majority of U.S. adults are asking lawmakers to pull off the impossible: Cut the overall size of government, but also devote more money to the most popular and expensive programs.Six in 10 U.S. adults say the government spends too much money. But majorities also favor more funding for infrastructure, health care and Social Security — the kind of commitments that would make efforts to shrink the government unworkable and politically risky ahead of the 2024 elections.These findings from a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show just how messy the financial tug-of-war between President Joe Biden and House Republicans could be. At stake is the full faith and credit of the federal government, which could default on its obligations unless there is a deal this summer to raise or suspend the limit on the government's borrowing authority.Biden this month proposed a budget that would trim deficits by nearly $3 trillion over 10 years, but his plan contains a mix of tax increases on the wealthy and new spending that led GOP lawmakers to declare it dead on arrival. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is insisting on budget talks with the White House but has not produced a plan of his own to cut deficits, which Biden has said is a prerequisite for negotiations.The new poll finds U.S. adults are closely divided over whether they want to see a bigger government offering more services or a smaller government offering fewer services. But a clear majority — 60% — say they think government is spending too much altogether. Just 16% say the government is spending too little, while 22% say spending levels are about right.U.S. adults were previously less supportive of spending cuts, a possible sign of how the pandemic and a historic burst of aid to address it have reshaped politics. Compared with 60% now, 37% called for spending cuts in February 2020, as COVID-19 was beginning to spread throughout the U.S. By May, even fewer, 25%, wanted less spending, after the virus had forced major disruptions to public life, the economy and the health care system.Retiree Peter Daniluk acknowledged the tensions over the federal budget by saying the government might be “a little too” large, but “you’ve got to spend money in order to make things better.” The 78-year-old from Dryden, New York, voted for Biden and believes there should be more funding for the environment and military, while also preserving Social Security and Medicare.""The rich don’t pay enough of the taxes — that’s the problem,"" he said. “They know how to get out of paying their proper share.”Inflation jumped as the U.S. economy recovered from the pandemic. GOP lawmakers have blamed Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package for rising prices as they’ve pushed for spending cuts, while the president says inflation reflects global factors involving supply chains and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Federal expenditures are expected to be equal in size to roughly 24% of all U.S. economic activity for the next several years, a figure that will likely grow as an aging population leads to more spending on Social Security and Medicare. Government spending accounted for just 20.5% of U.S. gross domestic product a decade ago, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget.Even if a majority of adults desire a tightened budget, the challenge for lawmakers trying to hash out an agreement is that the public also wants higher spending on a wide range of programs. While Biden rolled out a budget that would trim deficits largely through tax increases on the wealthy, GOP lawmakers have struggled so far to gel around a set of spending cuts — and even if they did, the White House is betting that their plan would upset voters.Roughly 6 in 10 adults say the government is spending too little on education, health care, infrastructure and Social Security, as well as assistance to the poor and Medicare. About half say government is spending too little on border security, child care assistance, drug rehabilitation, the environment and law enforcement.By comparison, a wide majority — 69% — say the U.S. is spending too much on assistance to other countries. But slashing foreign aid would have almost no impact on the overall size of the government, as it accounts for less than 1% of all federal spending, and major programs such as Social Security and Medicare are causing the government to grow in size over the next decade.Glenn Cookinham, 43, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, said inflation and health care expenses are major problems confronting the U.S. as a country right now. A Republican who views Biden as “OK,” Cookinham feels as though the U.S. could pull back on military funding to focus on its own internal challenges.“I don’t think we should be the police for the rest of the world, really,"" he said.About a third of U.S. adults say spending on the military is too little and nearly as many say it’s too much; an additional third say it’s about right.Bipartisan majorities back more spending on infrastructure and Social Security. But wide differences across party lines on other priorities could be a sticking point in budget talks.Most Republicans say too much is spent on assistance to big cities (65% vs. just 19% of Democrats), and about half say too much is spent on the environment (51% vs. just 6% of Democrats). Republicans are more likely than Democrats to indicate that the military, law enforcement and border security are underfunded. By comparison, far more Democrats say too little is spent on aid for the poor (80% vs. 38% of Republicans), the environment (73% vs. 21% of Republicans), child care assistance (71% vs. 34% of Republicans), drug rehabilitation (67% vs. 36% of Republicans), and scientific research (54% vs. 24% of Republicans).There is also a generational breakdown in terms of priorities. Young adults are more likely than older adults to say too little is spent on the environment and assistance to big cities, while more older adults say too little is spent on infrastructure, the military, law enforcement and border security. Young adults are especially likely to think too much is spent in those areas.For those between the ages of 30-44, who are especially likely to have school-age children, there is a desire for the government to spend more on education.___The poll of 1,081 adults was conducted Mar. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849928,Ukraine's Zelenskyy: Any Russian victory could be perilous,"ON A TRAIN FROM SUMY TO KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Tuesday that unless his nation wins a drawn-out battle in a key eastern city, Russia could begin building international support for a deal that could require Ukraine to make unacceptable compromises. He also invited the leader of China, long aligned with Russia, to visit.If Bakhmut fell to Russian forces, their president, Vladimir Putin, would “sell this victory to the West, to his society, to China, to Iran,” Zelenskyy said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press.“If he will feel some blood — smell that we are weak — he will push, push, push,"" Zelenskyy said in English, which he used for virtually all of the interview.The leader spoke to the AP aboard a train shuttling him across Ukraine, to cities near some of the fiercest fighting and others where his country’s forces have successfully repelled Russia’s invasion. Zelenskyy rarely travels with journalists, and the president’s office said AP’s two-night train trip with him was the most extensive since the war began.Since then, Ukraine — backed by much of the West — has surprised the world with the strength of its resistance against the larger, better-equipped Russian military. Ukrainian forces have held their capital, Kyiv, and pushed Russia back from other strategically important areas.But as the war enters its second year, Zelenskyy finds himself focused on keeping motivation high in both his military and the general Ukrainian population — particularly the millions who have fled abroad and those living in relative comfort and security far from the front lines.Zelenskyy is also well aware that his country's success has been in great part due to waves of international military support, particularly from the United States and Western Europe. But some in the United States — including Republican Donald Trump, the former American president and current 2024 candidate — have questioned whether Washington should continue to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid.Trump's likely Republican rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, also suggested that defending Ukraine in a “territorial dispute” with Russia was not a significant U.S. national security priority. He later walked that statement back after facing criticism from other corners of the GOP.Zelenskyy didn't mention the names of Trump or any other Republican politicians — figures he might have to deal with if they prevailed in 2024 elections. But he did say that he worries the war could be impacted by shifting political forces in Washington.“The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win,” he said in the interview. He sipped tea as he sat on a narrow bed in the cramped, unadorned sleeper cabin on a state railway train.The president's carefully calibrated railroad trip was a remarkable journey across land through a country at war. Zelenskyy, who has become a recognizable face across the world as he doggedly tells his side of the story to nation after nation, used the morale-building journey to carry his considerable clout to regions close to the front lines.He traveled with a small cadre of advisers and a large group of heavily armed security officials dressed in battlefield fatigues. His destinations included ceremonies marking the one-year anniversary of the liberation of towns in the Sumy region and visits with troops stationed at front-line positions near Zaporizhzhia. Each visit was kept under wraps until after he departed.Zelenskyy recently made a similar visit near Bakhmut, where Ukrainian and Russian forces have been locked for months in a grinding and bloody battle. While some Western military analysts have suggested that the city is not of significant strategic importance, Zelenskyy warned that a loss anywhere at this stage in the war could put Ukraine’s hard-fought momentum at risk.“We can’t lose the steps because the war is a pie — pieces of victories. Small victories, small steps,” he said.Zelensky’s comments were an acknowledgement that losing the 7-month-long battle for Bakhmut — the longest of the war thus far — would be more of a costly political defeat than a tactical one.He predicted that the pressure from a defeat in Bakhmut would come quickly — both from the international community and within his own country. “Our society will feel tired,” he said. “Our society will push me to have compromise with them.”So far, Zelenskyy says he hasn't felt that pressure. The international community has largely rallied around Ukraine following Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. In recent months, a parade of world leaders have visited Zelenskyy in Ukraine, most traveling in on trains similar to the ones the president uses to crisscross the country.In his AP interview, Zelenskyy extended an invitation to Ukraine to one notable and strategically important leader who has not made the journey — Chinese President Xi Jinping.""We are ready to see him here,” he said. “I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have.”China, economically aligned and politically favorable toward Russia across many decades, has provided Putin diplomatic cover by staking out an official position of neutrality in the war.Asked whether Xi would accept an invitation from Zelenskyy — or whether one had been officially extended — Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters she had no information to give. She did say that Beijing maintains ""communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine.""Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked whether a meeting between Xi and Zelenskyy would be useful to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, said Russian authorities “highly appreciate” China’s balanced position on the issue and “have no right to come up with any advice” on whether the two should meet. “The Chinese leader himself decides the appropriateness of certain contacts,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters Wednesday.Xi visited Putin in Russia last week, raising the prospect that Beijing might be ready to provide Moscow with the weapons and ammunition it needs to refill its depleted stockpile. But Xi’s trip ended without any such announcement. Days later, Putin announced that he would be deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which neighbors Russia and pushes the Kremlin’s nuclear stockpile closer to NATO territory.Zelenskyy suggested Putin’s move was intended to distract from the lack of guarantees he received from China.“What does it mean? It means that the visit was not good for Russia,” Zelenskyy speculated. He was unsparing in his assessment of Putin, calling him an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war.“He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskyy said.The Ukrainian president makes few predictions about the biggest question hanging over the war: how it will end. He expressed confidence, however, that his nation will prevail through a series of “small victories"" and ""small steps"" against a “very big country, big enemy, big army” — but an army, he said, with “small hearts.”And Ukraine itself? While Zelenskyy acknowledged that the war has “changed us,” he said that in the end, it has made his society stronger.“It could’ve gone one way, to divide the country, or another way — to unite us,” he said. “I'm so thankful. I’m thankful to everybody — every single partner, our people, thank God, everybody — that we found this way in this critical moment for the nation. Finding this way was the thing that saved our nation, and we saved our land. We are together.”___Julie Pace is senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849929,Markstrom reigns over streaking Kings as Flames win 2-1,"CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Jacob Markstrom made 32 saves Tuesday night to backstop the Calgary Flames to a critical 2-1 victory over the streaking Los Angeles Kings.Andrew Mangiapane and Walker Duehr scored for Calgary, which won its second consecutive game and improved to 7-3-2 in its last 12.Sean Durzi had the lone goal for Los Angeles, which scored 19 in its previous three games. The Kings have been the NHL’s hottest team, entering the night on a franchise-record 12-game point streak (10-0-2).“I don’t think it was a lack of effort, certainly today,"" Kings captain Anze Kopitar said. “It was a hard-fought game, a physical game. For the most part we did a good job. Just obviously unfortunately we didn’t convert on a few of our chances.”Los Angeles is two points behind first-place Vegas and one up on Edmonton in the Pacific Division. The Oilers won 7-4 in Las Vegas.The Flames moved within two points of the Winnipeg Jets, who occupy the final wild-card spot in the Western Conference. Winnipeg lost 3-0 at struggling San Jose.Starting for the 15th time in 16 games, Markstrom turned in one of his best performances this season. The veteran goalie made numerous important saves to help the Flames’ 2-1 lead from the first period hold up the rest of the way.“He was sharp. Made some big stops. He probably stole us two points,” Calgary center Elias Lindholm said.Making his sixth start in goal since being acquired in a trade with Columbus, Joonas Korpisalo made 30 stops but lost for the first time with Los Angeles.“Both goaltenders were first and second star in whatever order you want to pick,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “They both played well. Korpi made some really good saves for us. He gave us a chance to have those good looks at the other end. It’s unfortunate we couldn’t reward him with at least one to get him a point.”Momentum swung halfway through the first period when Rasmus Andersson’s goal, which would have made it 2-0, was waved off after an offside review. Less than two minutes later, the Kings tied it.Durzi was left with open space to skate in from the blue line and he whipped a shot into the top corner.Calgary restored its lead at 17:59 when Duehr slipped a shot past Korpisalo from the side of the net. It was the sixth goal in 21 games for the rookie from South Dakota, who was playing on the fourth line.“It felt like a playoff game. We had our pushes, they had their pushes and I thought Marky stood on his head tonight and gave us a chance to win,” Duehr said.Eight days ago in Los Angeles, the Kings thumped Calgary 8-2.“Obviously, we’re not very happy about the last meeting against these guys and it’s still fresh in the memory. Today I thought we played a better game,” Markstrom said.LINEUP SHUFFLELos Angeles made three lineup changes. Blake Lizotte returned from a one-game suspension, but RW Gabe Vilardi (upper body) wasn't with the Kings to begin the road trip after getting injured in the previous game. Arthur Kaliyev also drew in up front with Jaret Anderson-Dolan coming out. On the blue line, Alex Edler replaced Sean Walker.PRIDE NIGHTIt was Pride Night at the Saddledome, with all Flames players wearing custom jerseys for warmups that were designed by local artist Megan Parker. The Flaming C on the front and the numbers featured a pattern of flora and fauna from Alberta prairies arranged to reflect the rainbow-colored pride flag.UP NEXTKings: Continue a four-game trip at Edmonton on Thursday night.Flames: Play at Vancouver on Friday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849931,Hawaii authorities say 33 swimmers were harassing dolphins,"HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii authorities on Tuesday say they have referred 33 people to U.S. law enforcement after the group allegedly harassed a pod of wild dolphins in waters off the Big Island.It's against federal law to swim within 50 yards (45 meters) of spinner dolphins in Hawaii’s nearshore waters. The prohibition went into effect in 2021 amid concerns that so many tourists were swimming with dolphins that the nocturnal animals weren’t getting the rest they need during the day to be able to forage for food at night.The rule applies to areas within 2 nautical miles (3.7 kilometers) of the Hawaiian Islands and in designated waters surrounded by the islands of Lanai, Maui and Kahoolawe.The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a news release that its enforcement officers came upon the 33 swimmers in Honaunau Bay on Sunday during a routine patrol.Aerial footage shot by drone shows snorkelers following dolphins as they swim away. The department said its video and photos showed swimmers “who appear to be aggressively pursuing, corralling and harassing the pod.”Enforcement officers contacted the group while they were in the water, and told them about the violation. Uniformed officers met the swimmers on land where state and federal officials launched a joint investigation.Hawaii’s spinner dolphins feast on fish and small crustaceans that surface from the ocean’s depths at night. When the sun rises, they head for shallow bays to hide from tiger sharks and other predators.To the untrained eye, the dolphins appear to be awake during the day because they’re swimming.But because they sleep by resting half of their brains and keeping the other half awake to surface and breathe, they may be sleeping even when they’re maneuvering through the water.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849932,Takeaways from AP's interview with Ukraine's Zelenskyy,"ON BOARD A TRAIN FROM SUMY TO KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A team of journalists from The Associated Press spent two days traveling by train with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he visited the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, which still faces regular shelling from Russian forces, and northern towns in the Sumy region that were liberated shortly after the war began a year ago.Zelenskyy rarely travels with journalists, and the president’s office said AP’s two-night train trip with him was the most extensive since the war began. Here are some takeaways from an interview with Zelenskyy as he returned to Kyiv late Tuesday.WESTERN WEAPONSThroughout much of the war, Ukraine's military has been bolstered by billions of dollars of ammunition and weaponry from Western nations. Zelenskyy welcomed the help but said some of the promised weapons had not yet been delivered.“We have great decisions about Patriots, but we don’t have them for real,” he said, referring to the U.S.-made air defense system.Ukrainian soldiers have received training in the U.S. since January on how to use the Patriot system, but it hasn’t yet been deployed in Ukraine.Ukraine needs 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets,” Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy added that a European nation sent another air defense system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again.” He did not name the country.Zelenskyy also reiterated his longstanding request for fighter jets, saying “we still don't have anything when it comes to modern warplanes.” Poland and Slovakia have decided to give Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine, but no Western country so far has agreed to provide modern warplanes amid concern that it could escalate the conflict and draw them in deeper.PUTIN'S ISOLATIONZelenskyy was unsparing in his assessment of Russia's Vladimir Putin, calling him an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything"" over the last year of war.“He doesn't have allies,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that it was clear that even China — an economic powerhouse long favorable toward Moscow — was no longer willing to back Russia. Chinese President Xi Jinping recently visited Putin i n Russia but left without publicly announcing any overt support for Moscow's campaign against Ukraine.Zelenskyy suggested that Putin's announcement shortly after Xi's visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to NATO territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader's visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain's decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine.Despite Putin's nuclear provocations, Zelenskyy said he does not believe the Russian leader is prepared to use the bomb.“If a person wants to save himself, he really ... will use these,” he said. “I'm not sure he's ready to do it.”AVOIDING A NUCLEAR DISASTEROn Zelenskyy's itinerary this week was a meeting with Rafael Mariano Grossi, the visiting head of the UN’s atomic energy agency. Grossi was in the region to take stock of the situation at the nearby Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which Russia took control of last year.Fierce fighting around the plant, Europe’s largest, has put the facility and the broader region at significant risk. During his meeting with Zelenskyy on Monday, Grossi said the situation was not improving.Grossi has called for a “protection zone” around the plant but has failed to come up with terms that would satisfy both Ukraine and Russia. Grossi told the AP on Tuesday he believed a deal was “close.” However, Zelenskyy, who opposes any plan that would legitimize Russia’s control over the facility, said he was less optimistic a deal was near. “I don’t feel it today,"" he said.THE FIGHT FOR BAKHMUTThe longest battle of the war is raging in the eastern city of Bakhmut, where Ukrainian and Russian forces have been locked in a grinding conflict for seven months.Some Western military analysts have questioned why Ukraine is willing to suffer so many losses to defend the territory, arguing that the city is not of strategic significance. Zelenskyy argued otherwise, saying any loss in the war will give Russia an opening. He predicted that if Russia defeats Ukraine in Bakhmut, Putin would set out to “sell” a victory to the international community.“If he will feel some blood, smell that we are weak, he will push, push, push,” Zelenskyy said, adding that the pressure would come not only from the international community but also from within his own country.“Our society will feel tired,” he said. “Our society will push me to have compromise with them.”Zelenskyy recently traveled near Bakhmut for a morale-boosting visit with troops fighting in the hard hit city.CALLS FOR TOUGHER SANCTIONSWestern sanctions against Russia don’t go far enough, according to Zelenskyy, who called for more far-reaching measures against people in Putin’s inner circle.More than 30 countries, representing more than half the world’s economy, have imposed sanctions on Russia, including price caps on Russian oil and restrictions on access to global financial transactions. The West has also directly sanctioned about 2,000 Russian firms, government officials, oligarchs and their families. More than $58 billion worth of sanctioned Russians’ assets have been blocked or frozen worldwide, according to a recent report from the U.S. Treasury Department.Zelenskyy said more should be done to target Putin’s enablers, who “have to know that they will lose all their money … all their real estate in Europe or in the world, their yachts everywhere.”RIDING THE RAILSMost of Zelenskyy's travel in Ukraine is done by rail. There are few other options: Commercial air travel has been grounded and Ukraine's expanse, as well as the unpredictability of life in a war-torn country, make road travel arduous.The state railway system, however, has remained remarkably stable throughout the war and largely untouched by the constant barrage of Russian missiles. One notable exception: the April 2022 bombing of the crowded Kramatorsk train station that killed dozens of people.Though Zelenskyy rides on a train set aside for him and his delegation, it is largely indistinguishable on the outside from the blue-and-yellow trains ferrying other people and goods across the country. Most Ukrainians barely looked up to acknowledge Zelenskyy's train as it zipped through towns across the countryside, passing picturesque fields and the occasional bombed-out building or bridge.___Karl Ritter in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",2023/03/30,,World

Golden State lost 99-96 at home to the Timberwolves on Sunday, so coming back from 20 down to win this one was key as the defending champions try to avoid the play-in round. The top six teams are guaranteed playoff berths.“We lost a heartbreaker the other night. We knew we had to bounce back,” Kerr said.Brandon Ingram had 26 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, Trey Murphy III scored 21 points and CJ McCollum added 15 for the Pelicans, who came in riding a five-game winning streak.Green chirped and pushed the emotions and physicality all game, then threw an alley-oop to Jonathan Kuminga for a dunk with 7:09 left for one of his 13 assists and a 101-98 advantage.“Draymond willed us to victory tonight,” Kerr said. “His frustration early with the way we were playing. Mad at the world. Yelling at everybody, their bench, our bench, me, and frankly we all deserved it.”Green was whistled for a double technical for tussling with Ingram late in the second quarter — and Green’s foul was upgraded to a Flagrant 1. He already served a one-game suspension March 17 at Atlanta for his 16th technical.Green committed an offensive foul moments later and players for both sides tangled, Green’s feet getting caught up with Herbert Jones’ head. A replay showed no additional infractions but Kerr briefly took Green out with tensions running high because of his “extreme energy” in that moment.“We looked dead those first 18 minutes of the game,"" Kerr said. ""We had to find some energy somewhere. I knew it wasn’t just going to come.”Three straight 3-pointers by Curry late in the third got Golden State within 89-83. Poole then stole the ball from Ingram and dunked on the other end as the Warriors trailed 89-85 going into the final 12 minutes.Golden State started the third on an 8-0 burst fueled by Donte DiVincezo. He made a putback dunk over Ingram early in the second half then a three-point play before Thompson's 3 at 10:44 made it 63-54.McCollum's 3 with 1:40 left before halftime put the Pelicans up 60-43, then Ingram made it a 20-point game with a 3 New Orleans' next time down.The Pelicans, coached by former Warriors assistant Willie Green and longtime Golden State assistant Jarron Collins on his staff, had won five straight after a 124-90 romp at Portland on Monday night.The Warriors' victory prevented the Sacramento Kings, coached by former top assistant Mike Brown, their first playoff berth since 2006 that would end the worst drought in NBA history at 16 years.TIP-INSPelicans: McCollum was hit with a Flagrant 1 at the 6:43 mark of the third. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850008,"Nugent-Hopkins, Oilers roll past Golden Knights 7-4","LAS VEGAS (AP) — The surging Edmonton Oilers got a career night from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and made the Pacific Division race even tighter with just more than two weeks left in the season.Nugent-Hopkins tied a career high with five points and Edmonton's top-ranked power play scored three goals as the Oilers beat the Vegas Golden Knights 7-4 on Tuesday.The Oilers have 95 points and are three behind first-place Vegas. Los Angeles lost 2-1 to Calgary and remains in second place with 96 points. Edmonton hosts the Kings on Thursday.“Obviously, we know who we’re playing,” Nugent-Hopkins said. “We know where they’re at in the standings. We know where we’re at and we’re still pushing for home ice, and I think that does make a difference come playoff time.”With the NHL's two leading scorers (Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl) and an eight-game point streak, the Oilers are playing like a team no one wants to face in the playoffs.“I don’t think we’re anywhere near our potential just yet,” coach Jay Woodcroft said. “I think we’re working towards that. ... We're building towards peaking at the right time, which is in about three weeks.”Edmonton cooled off a Golden Knights team that had won four games in a row and eight of nine. The Oilers also prevented Vegas from clinching a playoff spot.Nugent-Hopkins helped make sure of it with a goal and four assists. His only other five-point game occurred Nov. 19, 2011, when he had five assists against Chicago.He is four points from 100 this season; his previous career high was 69 in the 2018-19 season.“He doesn’t get nearly enough recognition that he deserves,” Draisaitl said. “The things he does are so subtle, and most people don’t realize what he does out there. Just a phenomenal hockey player.”Nugent-Hopkins was one of three Oilers with multiple points. McDavid had three assists and Draisaitl a goal and an assist. McDavid leads the NHL with 143 points and 83 assists.The Oilers also got goals from Evan Bouchard, Darnell Nurse, Evander Kane, Zach Hyman and Brett Kulak. Edmonton's power play went 3 for 3 in just 2:55 of total time, and Stuart Skinner made 19 saves.Jonathan Marchessault had two goals for the Knights, and William Karlsson and Michael Amadio each scored once. Alex Pietrangelo added two assists.In the first 10 minutes, the teams combined for five goals. Nugent-Hopkins had three points and a friendly fire puck to the face, the Oilers scored on both power-play opportunities and the Knights netted a short-handed goal.Edmonton broke open a 3-all game in the second with three goals in the final 13:59, dominating the ice with 34 shots on goal through the first two periods compared to 12 for the Knights.Laurent Brossoit replaced Jonathan Quick in the Knights' net to open the third period.“We allowed their high-end players to make plays in front of him,” Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. “I'm not putting it on Jonathan. This was more about, ‘It’s not your night and we're not playing well in front of you.'”Golden Knights defenseman Shea Theodore did not play in the third period because of an undisclosed injury.GOING STREAKINGThe Oilers built on a number of impressive streaks. Draisaitl and Hyman each extended their goal streaks to three games, and Draisaitl's point streak reached 10 games (six goals, 14 assists). McDavid (six goals, 13 assists) and Nugent-Hopkins (five goals, 13 assists) have ongoing nine-game streaks, and Nurse (three goals, three assists) is at six games.Vegas also extended a couple of notable streaks. Marchessault scored for the third game in a row, and Phil Kessel has a five-game point streak (two goals, four assists).UP NEXTOilers: Thursday against Los Angeles in a battle for playoff positioning in the Pacific Division.Golden Knights: Thursday at San Jose, which is last in the Pacific.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850009,Nashville shooting highlights security at private schools,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — An alarm blared and lights flashed as a heavily armed assailant stalked the hallways of The Covenant School.Surveillance footage of the shooting Monday at the private Christian school in Nashville showed many familiar security measures, including the double set of locked glass doors the killer shot their way through before fatally shooting three children and three school employees.“It’s just next to impossible to stop someone” coming through that door with a high-powered weapon, said George Grant, a leader with the Nashville Presbytery, which is connected with the school. Grant said the presbytery doesn’t have a formal security program for its churches and schools but that members have worked together to share best practices and improve safety.Around the U.S., private schools generally do not face as many requirements as public schools for developing security plans. In Tennessee, laws requiring schools to develop and submit safety plans do not apply to private schools, an emailed statement from the state Department of Education said.Private schools also sometimes lack access to government programs to bolster security, though private schools in some states are eligible for state money to bolster security with staff, equipment and technology. Some federal grants also are available to private schools for security aid.Generally, private schools don't have access to the police many public schools have assigned to their campuses, said Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers. He said some private schools have arranged to hire recently retired officers.“I would imagine after this horrific situation in Nashville that there may be more attempts by private schools to try to not only bolster security but to get school resource officers.”Still, amid widespread concerns about mass shootings, experts say private schools have invested similarly to public schools in violence prevention.Private schools were among institutions that invested most heavily in security in the aftermath of the 2012 shooting that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Today, private schools have some of the highest-paid security specialists, including retired federal agents, said Michael Dorn, who has been involved in assessing security at thousands of schools as executive director of Safe Havens International, a nonprofit school safety center.Security protocols for private schools are similar to those for public schools, but they are more tailored to each school’s location and circumstances, said Myra McGovern of the National Association of Independent Schools.Security such as metal detectors may not be as visible at private schools, which also have considerations including boarding students and, in some cases, the children of heads of state to look after, she said.“Attention to security is similar, but the way that it manifests is perhaps different,” McGovern said.The quality of safety plans for private schools also varies widely, as it does for public schools, Dorn said.“We see schools that are pretty behind and some that are exceptional,” he said.In Tennessee, an executive order last year by Gov. Bill Lee on school safety measures directed the state to conduct a report on the use of armed guards in nonpublic schools and assess their need for active-shooter training.Most U.S. school systems conduct active-shooter and lockdown trainings, and the Nashville school had in fact undergone active-shooter training in 2022, which prevented further loss of life during Monday's shooting, city police spokesperson Brooke Reese said.Private or not, shootings are more common at middle and high schools than at elementary schools like Covenant, which are less likely to have assigned security officers. Educators also are wary of unsettling young learners with more heavy-handed security measures.The Covenant School has about 200 students from preschool through sixth grade. The school and the Covenant Presbyterian Church are connected with the Nashville Presbytery, which includes congregations in the Presbyterian Church in America, across Middle Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky.“Over the last several years, most of our churches have undergone training and have really scrutinized their security arrangements,” said Grant, the immediate past moderator for the Nashville Presbytery. “It’s not an official sort of presbytery-wide initiative, but it has just sort of grown out of relationships.”Grant said Franklin Classical School, a school under the spiritual oversight of his church, Parish Presbyterian Church in Franklin, Tennessee, has lockdown procedures and security codes in place. The school always has a former police officer on site when school is in session. It is unknown whether The Covenant School had a security officer.Grant said his church’s security team has called for a review of security protocols and already had training planned for the week after Easter.“This is just a good reminder that we live in a broken, fallen world,"" he said. ""And we need to be vigilant to care for one another as best we can.”___ Ma reported from Washington, D.C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850011,China threatens to retaliate if McCarthy meets Taiwan leader,"BEIJING (AP) — China threatened retaliation on Wednesday if U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy meets with Taiwan's president during her upcoming trip through Los Angeles.President Tsai Ing-wen left Taiwan Wednesday afternoon on a tour of the island's diplomatic allies in the Americas, which she framed as a chance to demonstrate Taiwan’s commitment to democratic values on the world stage.Tsai arrived in New York later in the day and was scheduled to spend Thursday in the city before heading to Guatemala and Belize. She is expected to stop in Los Angeles on her way back to Taiwan on April 5, when a meeting with McCarthy is tentatively scheduled.The planned meeting has triggered fears of a heavy-handed Chinese reaction amid heightened friction between Beijing and Washington over U.S. support for Taiwan and trade and human rights issues.The spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, Zhu Fenglian, denounced Tsai's stopovers and demanded that no U.S. officials meet with her.“We firmly oppose this and will take resolute countermeasures,” Zhu said at a news conference. The U.S. should “refrain from arranging Tsai Ing-wen’s transit visits and even contact with American officials and take concrete actions to fulfill its solemn commitment not to support Taiwan independence,” she said.Beijing claims self-governing Taiwan is part of its territory and threatens to bring the island under its control by force if necessary.Speaking later Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China will “closely follow the development of the situation and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”Mao said the United States was “conducting dangerous activities that undermine the political foundation of bilateral ties.”McCarthy, a Republican from California, has said he will meet with Tsai when she is in the U.S. and has not ruled out the possibility of traveling to Taiwan in a show of support.White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that Tsai's brief stops in the U.S. will be “consistent with our longstanding unofficial relationship with Taiwan and is consistent with the United States one China policy, which remains unchanged.”“Every Taiwan president has transited the United States. President Tsai Ing-wen herself has transited the US six times since taking office in 2016, each time without incident,"" Kirby said. “The People’s Republic of China should not use this transit as a pretext to step up any aggressive activity around the Taiwan Strait. United States and China have differences when it comes to Taiwan. But we have managed those differences for more than 40 years.”Following a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in 2022, Beijing launched missiles over the area, deployed warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and carried out military exercises in a simulated blockade of the island. Beijing also suspended climate talks with the U.S. and restricted military-to-military communication with the Pentagon.Tsai told reporters before boarding her plane that “I want to tell the whole world democratic Taiwan will resolutely safeguard the values of freedom and democracy and will continue to be a force for good in the world, continuing a cycle of goodness, strengthening the resilience of democracy in the world.”“External pressure will not obstruct our resolution to engage with the world,” she said.Beijing has recently ramped up diplomatic pressure against Taiwan by poaching its dwindling number of diplomatic allies while also sending military fighter jets flying toward the island on a near-daily basis. Earlier this month, Honduras established diplomatic relations with China, leaving Taiwan with only 13 countries that recognize it as a sovereign state.U.S. administration officials in a call with reporters ahead of Tsai’s arrival said her previous stopovers in the U.S. have included meetings with members of Congress and members of the Taiwanese diaspora. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive visit, said Tsai is also expected to meet with American Institute in Taiwan chair Laura Rosenberger. AIT is the U.S. government-run nonprofit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan.One official added that “there is absolutely no reason” for Beijing to use Tsai’s stopover “as an excuse or a pretext to carry out aggressive or coercive activities aimed at Taiwan.”Beijing sees official American contact with Taiwan as encouragement to make the island’s decades-old de facto independence permanent, a step U.S. leaders say they don’t support. Pelosi was the highest-ranking elected American official to visit the island since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997. Under its “one China” policy, the U.S. acknowledges Beijing’s view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan, but considers Taiwan’s status as unsettled. Taiwan is an important partner for Washington in the Indo-Pacific.U.S. officials are increasingly worried about China attempting to make good on its long-stated goal of bringing Taiwan under its control. The sides split at the end of a civil war in 1949 and Beijing sees U.S. politicians’ visits as conspiring with Tsai’s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party to make the separation permanent and stymy China’s rise as a global power.The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. relations with the island, does not require Washington to step in militarily if China invades but makes it American policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status by Beijing.Tensions spiked earlier this year when U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a Chinese spy balloon shot down after it traversed the continental United States. The Biden administration has also said U.S. intelligence findings show that China is weighing sending arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine, but has no evidence Beijing has done so yet.China, however, has provided Russia with an economic lifeline and political support, and President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in Moscow earlier this month. That was the first face-to-face meeting between the allies since before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago.The Biden administration postponed a planned visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken following the balloon controversy but has signaled it would like to get such a visit back on track.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao said the blame for tensions lies squarely with Washington for boosting relations with Tsai. Beijing has frozen almost all contacts with Tsai’s administration since shortly after she was elected to the first of her two terms in 2016.“It is not that China overreacts. It is that the U.S. kept emboldening Taiwan independence forces, which is egregious in nature,” Mao said at a daily briefing.Tsai’s state visits coincide with a 12-day trip to China by her predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, of the pro-unification Nationalist Party, in an appeal to voters whose descendants arrived with Chiang Kai-shek’s defeated forces in 1949.Ma has been visiting sites in the former Nationalist capital of Nanjing and emphasizing historical and cultural links between the sides, while avoiding the politically sensitive topics of China’s determination to eliminate Taiwan’s international presence and refusal to recognize its government.Tsai is barred from seeking a third term and her party is widely expected to nominate Vice President Lai Ching-te to run for the presidency in January.___Associated Press writers Huizhong Wu in Taipei, Taiwan, and Aamer Madhani in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.",2023/03/30,299,World

(AP) — James Reimer earned his third shutout of the season and the San Jose Sharks snapped a nine-game losing streak Tuesday night with a 3-0 victory over Winnipeg, handing the Jets a costly defeat as they try to secure a playoff spot.“When you get a shutout, it's nice,"" Reimer said. “Usually, whenever you get a shutout, you get all the bounces and tonight was one of those.”Reimer stopped 41 shots, including a diving paddle save with 3:40 left in the second period. Noah Gregor, Kevin Labanc and Martin Kaut scored for the struggling Sharks, who had dropped 14 of 15.The only victory in that stretch also came against the Jets, a 3-2 win at Winnipeg in overtime March 6.“It’s as solid of a win as we’ve had in a while, and we haven’t had a win in a while. So it was a good win,"" San Jose coach David Quinn said. ""Obviously, Reims played great. But they were opportunistic, and it was a gutty performance in a lot of ways against a team that’s fighting for a playoff spot.”Connor Hellebuyck made 26 saves for the Jets, who went 0 for 3 on the power play.“They scored more than we did, I guess. A lot of looks. A lot of chances. I don’t know if we’re gripping it right now,"" Jets defenseman Dylan DeMelo said. ""Tough to win when you can’t score or are not able to pot ’em in. We’re working. Guys are trying. We had net-front traffic and tips and scrambles off that, backdoor passes, stuff like that. We’re getting quality looks. We had quality looks today, for sure. They’re just not going in for us.”Winnipeg holds the second wild card in the Western Conference by two points over Calgary and three over Nashville, which has two games in hand.“We've got to be a desperate team. It’s a big-time right now. It’s down to crunch time,"" Jets coach Rick Bowness said. ""We’ve just got to embrace that fight and embrace it together as a group. And keep fighting. Fight with each other and put it all out there. That’s all we can do.”Sharks forward Jacob Peterson made a nice play behind the net by faking one way and going back the other to find Gregor in front. It was Gregor's fifth goal of the season, and he extended his point streak to three games.Labanc added his 13th goal 2:23 into the third period. Gregor got an assist on the play as well.Kaut iced the game with 2:03 to go with his fourth goal of the season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850013,Mexico investigates 8 over deadly fire at migrant facility,"CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) — Mexican authorities said Wednesday that eight employees or officials are being investigated for possible misconduct at a migrant detention center where a fire killed 39 detained men.Anger and frustration in the northern border city of Ciudad Juarez boiled over as hundreds of migrants walked to a U.S. border gate hoping to make a mass crossing.Mexican officials appeared to place blame for the deaths in the fire late Monday largely on private, subcontracted security guards at the detention center in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. Video showed guards hurrying away from the smoky fire apparently without trying to free detainees.No charges were announced, but authorities said they would seek at least four arrest warrants later in the day, including one for a migrant who was part of what they described as a small group that started the fire. They said a migrant also damaged a security camera inside the cell where the fire occurred.Five of those under investigation for possible misconduct are private security guards, two are federal immigration agents and one is a Chihuahua state officer, federal Public Safety Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez. saidThe investigation has centered on the fact that guards appeared to make no effort to open cell doors for the detained men — almost all from Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela and El Salvador — before smoke filled the room in a matter of seconds.The deaths caused frustration, and may have played a role in a mass march late Wednesday afternoon by hundreds of migrants, who began walking toward a U.S. border crossing in the belief that American authorities would let them through.Adding to anger over the deaths was pent-up frustration of migrants who have spent weeks trying to make appointments on a U.S. cellphone app to file asylum claims. Rumors spread among the migrants that they might be let in into the U.S.Jorman Colón, a 30-year-old Venezuelan migrant, walked hand-in-hand with his 9-year-old daughter, saying he had heard on social media that acquaintances had gotten through.“We want to turn ourselves in,” Colón said, referring to the first step in the asylum process.Several hundred of the migrants crossed the shallow Rio Grande from Mexico toward the U.S. and approached a gate in the border fence that separates El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. Armed agents stood guard at the U.S. gate entrance.Venezuelan migrant Victoria Molina, 24, complained that “the app never gives us an (appointment) date.”A group of about 50 migrants initially approached a Border Patrol vehicle and personnel and sat or kneeled on the ground. About 25 of them were then led in single file through the gate into the U.S. and onto a white school-bus style vehicle that drove away.U.S. officials said Wednesday night that a total of about 1,000 migrants had crossed the river and were being processed in an orderly manner. It was unclear if they would be allowed to remain or be bussed to a formal border crossing for expulsion.Smoke began billowing out of the migrant detention center late Monday after a group of detained migrants set fire to foam mattresses, to protest what they thought were plans to move or deport them.Immigration authorities said they released 15 women when the fire broke out, but have not explained why no men were let out.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday that both immigration agents and security guards from a private contractor were present at the facility.Also Wednesday, Pope Francis offered prayers at the end of his general audience for those who died in the “tragic fire.”Leaked surveillance video shows migrants, reportedly fearing they were about to be moved, placing foam mattresses against the bars of their detention cell and setting them on fire.In the video, later confirmed by the government, two people dressed as guards rush into the camera frame, and at least one migrant appears by the metal gate on the other side. But the guards don't appear to make any effort to open the cell doors and instead hurry away as billowing clouds of smoke fill the structure within seconds.It was unclear if the two guards actually had the keys, but authorities suggested Wednesday that they should have gotten them or broken the lock — a highly difficult task, given the quick spread of smoke.U.S. authorities have offered to help treat some of the nearly 30 people who are hospitalized in critical or serious condition, most apparently from smoke inhalation.The migrants were stuck in Ciudad Jaurez because U.S. immigration policies don’t allow them to cross the border to file asylum claims. But they were rounded up because Ciudad Juarez residents were tired of migrants blocking border crossings or asking for money.“There were several complaints from neighbors about a group of migrants, we don't know if it was this group or another, that was allegedly acting aggressively, asking people in the street for money, demanding it,” said Rodríguez.The high level of frustration in Ciudad Juarez was already evident earlier this month when hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants tried to force their way across one of the international bridges to El Paso, acting on false rumors that the United States would allow them to enter the country. U.S. authorities blocked their attempts.After that, Ciudad Juarez Mayor Cruz Pérez Cuellar started campaigning to inform migrants there was room in shelters and no need to beg in the streets. He urged residents not to give money to them, and said authorities removed migrants intersections where it was dangerous to beg and residents saw the activity as a nuisance.On Wednesday, the mayor told AP his office had not received any report of rights abuses of migrants in detention facilities. He insisted that his government shared no responsibility for what happened.“It’s a terrible tragedy that pains all of us. We are grieving,” he said, adding that authorities should “come down with the full weight of the law on those responsible – the people that for instance, didn’t open the doors for the migrants.”___Associated Press videojournalist Alicia Fernández and writers Maria Verza Guadalupe Peñuelas in Ciudad Juarez, Mark Stevenson in Mexico City, Sonia Pérez D. in Guatemala City and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850014,"Palestinian teachers' strike grows, reflecting deep crisis","AL-AZZA REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) — In schools across the world, children are halfway into their second semester. But in a Palestinian refugee camp south of Jerusalem, kids wake up at 1 p.m. They kick soccer balls, hang out in barbershops and aimlessly scroll through TikTok. They watch television until dawn, just to wake up late and laze around all over again.Palestinian public schools in the West Bank have been closed since Feb. 5 in one of the longest teachers’ strikes in recent memory against the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority. Teachers’ demands for a pay raise have escalated into a protest movement that has vexed the increasingly autocratic Palestinian self-rule government as it plunges deeper into an economic crisis.But the strike isn’t just about money. As the largest group of government employees in the West Bank after security forces, teachers are also calling for a democratically elected union. The authority hasn't budged, fearing its rivals, like the Islamic militant group Hamas, could use their movement against the ruling Fatah party.“Everything is chaos,” said Sherin al-Azza, a social worker and mother of five in a refugee camp called al-Azza, which has become a neighborhood of the West Bank city of Bethlehem. Determined that her children have an education, she cobbled together $200 in savings to hire private tutors and send her eldest son to after-school classes during the strike — an impossibility for most of the refugee camp, she said.President Mahmoud Abbas’ Palestinian Authority, which rules parts of the West Bank not controlled by Israel, accuses striking teachers of holding around a million schoolchildren hostage to their demands for better pay.But teachers who have felt undervalued for decades say they have no choice but to walk out.“I feel terrible for the kids,” said Mohammed Brijeah, a 44-year-old Arabic teacher for the past 23 years. “But the way (the Palestinian Authority) treats us is insulting. I want to live with some dignity.”For years, teachers across the West Bank have struggled to make ends meet with salaries of some $830 a month — considerably less than other professions requiring a comparable education. Now, a year and a half after the Palestinian Authority slashed the income of government employees by 20% to cope with a budget shortfall, teachers say they’ve had enough.The crisis started in January, when teachers expected to receive a 15% pay raise along with back pay based on an agreement that ended a shorter strike last May. That deal also promised changes to their system of representation, allowing for long-sought union elections. But as the year started, teachers said one look at their pay slip broke their trust in officials.“They lied to us,” said Yousef Ijha, a 37-year-old history teacher in Bethlehem. He and other teachers pressing to form their own independent elected union are pushing back against the current syndicate stacked with supporters of Fatah. Their movement has mobilized through an anonymous Telegram channel with nearly 20,000 followers and galvanized huge, angry crowds for two sit-ins in the city of Ramallah, the seat of the authority.In response, the authority has threatened mass firings and even arrests, drawing fresh attention to what critics describe as its crackdown on civil society groups and freedom of expression.A lawsuit filed by the Ministry of Education on March 13 lists the names of 151 outspoken teachers who would be dismissed if they continued their strike and detained if they put up further resistance.""Not only are we not getting our salaries, we're literally not allowed to speak up,"" said Ijha, whose name is on the list.Before a protest in Ramallah earlier this month, Palestinian security forces set up checkpoints and roadblocks on the way to the city, according to teachers who attended, diverting them through rocky hills.The heavy security struck a darkly familiar chord for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.“They made us feel like criminals,” said 50-year-old science teacher Omar Mhisen, who said Palestinian police stopped him and made him show ID as he drove from the West Bank city of Hebron.Analysts say that the increasingly unpopular authority — widely seen as a collaborator with Israel — worries opposition groups like Hamas could gain control of the teachers' freely elected union, wielding power over a vast and vital swath of the public workforce and fueling instability in the territory. Hamas violently wrested control of the Gaza Strip from Abbas' authority in 2007.“The opposition's ability to win is an outcome of the decline of the Palestinian Authority's ability to fulfill its obligations,” said Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and Cabinet minister.On Monday, after the teachers’ movement rejected the PA’s latest offer to gradually compensate for their salary cuts over an undetermined period of time, the Ministry of Education said it’s preparing to recruit over 45,000 teachers on short-term contracts to replace all the strikers next month. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh pleaded with the teachers to return to schools.“We must meet our responsibility to ensure the right to education for our sons and daughters,” Shtayyeh said at Monday's Cabinet meeting.The self-rule government, limping along as it struggles with an economic slowdown and soaring debt, argues it cannot afford to pay all its employees. Earlier this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government further crippled the authority when it decided to deduct an additional 50 million shekels (over $14 million) each month from the tax revenues it collects on the Palestinians' behalf, among other punitive measures.“We are facing dangers from declining donor support and an enemy that denies our existence and perpetuates our financial crisis with unfair cuts,"" said government spokesman Ibrahim Melhem. “We have done everything we can.""Many teachers are skeptical. Refusing to back down, the movement warned it would pitch tents in Ramallah’s main square and camp out for the rest of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.As the standoff deepens, parents fret that their children are falling far behind and won't be prepared for university entrance exams or even next semester.“This is our lost generation,” said Ahmad, a 43-year-old lawyer and father of six, who gave only his first name for fear of reprisals.It was past noon in his sunlit apartment and his pajama-clad kids were rubbing sleep from their eyes as they staggered into the kitchen and played on their phones. With him and his wife working all day and his kids left alone, he said he couldn't get them to stick to a set schedule or bedtime.“As a father, I am suffering,” he said.His 15-year-old son, Athal, was perfectly content. “I never want to go back to school,” he said.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850015,"Harris out to reframe US views on Africa, foster partnership","ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — If U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has a favorite number on her trip to Africa, it's undoubtedly 19. That's the median age in Africa, and she repeats the fact at every opportunity.For Harris, it's not a piece of trivia but the driving force behind the stepped-up U.S. outreach to African countries. Washington is racing to build partnerships on the oldest inhabited continent with the youngest population, a test that could reshape the economy in Africa and, by extension, the rest of the world.In the near future, “1 in 4 people on this earth will be on this continent,"" Harris said during a conversation with reporters. “Just on that alone -- the demographics of it all alone -- if you put aside the present and the past, if we are to be forward-looking in terms of national policies and priorities, we have to look at this continent.”As part of that effort, Harris on Wednesday announced more than $1 billion in public and private money for women's economic empowerment. The money is expected to come from a mix of nonprofit foundations, private companies and the U.S. government, and it's intended to expand access to digital services, provide job training and support entrepreneurs.Harris made the announcement during a meeting with six Ghanaian female entrepreneurs. It was her final event in Ghana before she left for Tanzania, where she arrived Wednesday evening, as part of a weeklong Africa tour that will also take her to Zambia.She called the women at the table “a model for the potential of all people,"" and said that “the well-being of women will be a reflection of the well-being of all of society.”Harris is the highest-profile member of President Joe Biden's administration to visit Africa this year. While in Ghana, she paid particular attention to economic development and young people.She visited a skate park and recording studio, released a Spotify playlist of African musicians, spoken before thousands of young people, and invited celebrities, civil rights leaders and businesspeople to join her at a banquet in her honor.It's a carefully calibrated campaign to reframe how Americans view opportunities in Africa, something that senior officials from Harris' office described as central to her goals for the trip. New investments could not only benefit U.S. businesses but also alleviate one of the most pressing challenges here.“If we don’t find jobs — because that’s what it’s about — for this growing young population, it will be dangerous for the political stability on the continent,"" said Rama Yade, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center. ""Because they will attack the institutions if they don’t have the means for living.”Her vision, officials said, was a trip centered around youth, women and innovation, rather than the humanitarian assistance that often characterizes American perception of Africa.It's a vision that requires money, and the desire for investment was on full display during a state banquet Monday at Ghana's presidential palace where Hollywood stars Spike Lee, Idris Elba and Rosario Dawson were among the attendees.Although the atmosphere was festive, the message was all business. A large screen at the far end of the banquet tent showed a computer-generated animation of future development in Accra, a vision of a modern African metropolis.“We’re encouraged by the fact that more American companies than ever are looking to invest in Ghana,"" said President Nana Akufo-Addo. ""And we will continue to create and maintain the conducive investment atmosphere that will not only guarantee the safety of their investments, but good returns on those investments as well.”By diversifying the country's economy beyond exporting natural resources, Akufo-Addo said, he envisioned “a Ghana beyond aid.”Ghana is being squeezed by skyrocketing inflation and a bulging debt burden. Akufo-Addo noted the impact of “pernicious developments” such as the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic.“We want to work together to change the African narrative, which has been characterized largely by a concentration on disease, hunger, poverty and illegal mass migration,"" he said. ""Together, we must help make Africa the place for investment, progress and prosperity.”It's a change that Harris is eager to help foster.“While we face real challenges, I look around tonight and I am truly more optimistic than ever,” Harris said in her banquet toast. “And I know that by working together, the United States and Ghana, alongside the diaspora and the people of this beautiful continent, will share and share our future for the better.”Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, joined the effort. He went to a girls basketball clinic and spoke with students at a town hall discussion with the cast of the local television series “You Only Live Once,” which addresses public health issues and other challenges facing Ghanaian youth.Emhoff said the message was about “having confidence in yourself to know that you can do whatever you want to do in this world.”But that hope for the future isn't necessarily widespread.Adwoa Brentuo, who graduated four years ago with a degree in information science, is one of many who fear their education was no help.“I have now given up about getting a job because they are nonexistent,” she said. “I have also realized that writing applications have become a waste of time.”Ghana’s minister of youth and sports, Mustapha Yussif, estimated that only 1 out of 10 college graduates gets a job.“The rest will not be able to get any employment for a long time,” Yussif said.It's a problem across the continent. The African Development Bank estimates that there are on average about 11 million people entering the job market while at the same time only about 3 million jobs are created.Harris has tried to seek out bright spots in Africa during her trip, finding one of them at Vibrate Studio in Accra, a hub for young artists with a recording studio and music business program. Names of supporters such as Kendrick Lamar and the late fashion designer Virgil Abloh are written on the outside of the sunny yellow building.At the adjacent skate park, young people glided back and forth as Harris arrived, their boards occasionally clattering against the pavement.Inside, a staff member said that teenagers can learn topics like accounting in addition to recording music.“We are all learning from scratch,” the staff member told Harris. “Let us hope for the next generation in here.”",2023/03/30,,World

An investigation found a discrepancy in the format of the files and that no TWSE data was compromised, it told CNA.The assurance comes following reports that up to one million investors had their information stolen and peddled on a foreign platform. The breach allegedly involved the name, email account, and address of investors.The case was filed with law enforcement in September for further investigation. The accuracy of the alleged leaked data could not be verified, according to the FSC.Taiwan has been grappling with data breaches both in the public and private sectors. Last year a hack resulting in the leak of 23 million items of personal data in the country’s house registration systems made headlines, with a Chinese hacker identified as the culprit.Multiple cybersecurity incidents in businesses were reported over the past months, including an airline, a department store, and two car rental platforms. The government has pushed for heavier penalties for companies failing to protect clients’ data.",2023/03/29,292,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850028,Taxi fares in north Taiwan to increase starting Saturday,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Starting on Saturday (April 1), taxi rates in Taipei, New Taipei, and Keelung will be raised.In a press release, the New Taipei City Government Transportation Department wrote that the base fare that applies to the first 1.25 kilometers will increase from NT$70 (US$2.30) to NT$85, after which the mileage rate will remain at NT$5 per 200 meters.Meanwhile, passengers will be charged a waiting fare, which applies when taxis are driving at 5 km per hour or not moving. The rate, originally NT$5 per 80 seconds, will be changed to NT$5 per 60 seconds.In addition, passengers that begin a taxi ride between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. will be charged a NT$20 night time surcharge.Taxi fares in remote areas such as Wulai and Ruifang are subject to higher rates. In Tamsui, the base fare will remain at NT$100.According to the department, the purpose of the price hike is to reasonably reflect the costs of operating taxi services, such as drivers’ salaries, fuel, and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, by shortening the waiting fare interval, the government hopes to encourage taxi drivers to accept short-distance passengers.While most taxis in the greater Taipei area have finished updating their meters, the department urged drivers who have not yet done so to go to registered meter providers for adjustments. Taxi drivers that fail to update their meters before Saturday must continue charging passengers at the old rates.Taxis that do not charge passengers according to their meter are subject to a fine between NT$9,000 and 90,000.",2023/03/29,1502,Travel & Cuisine

She will first stopover in New York City, visit diplomatic allies Guatemala and Belize, then have a layover in Los Angeles, where she is slated to meet with McCarthy, before returning to Taiwan on April 7.In response to Tsai's trip, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) Spokesperson Zhu Fenglian (朱鳳蓮) claimed at a press conference that day that the so-called 'transit' by the leader of the Taiwan authorities is essentially a provocative act of ""relying on the U.S. to seek independence"" in an attempt to create incidents that violate the one-China principle such as (declaring) ""one China, one Taiwan"" or ""two Chinas,"" reported Mirror Media.Zhu accused Tsai of seeking an opportunity to sell Taiwan independence ideas internationally and seek support from anti-China forces in the U.S. She criticized Taiwan's president for using the transit to meet with U.S. government officials and members of Congress under various pretexts to ""engage in official exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan, and to link up with external anti-China forces.""The TAO spokesperson then warned that if Tsai meets with McCarthy, ""it will be another provocation that seriously violates the one-China principle, damages China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait."" She stressed that China ""firmly opposes this and will definitely take resolute measures to fight back.""She closed by reiterating that Beijing urges the U.S. to strictly abide by the ""one-China"" principle and the provisions of the Three Communiques. She called on the U.S. to not arrange for Tsai's transit visit ""or even have contact with U.S. officials, and take practical actions to fulfill the solemn promise of not supporting Taiwan independence.""However, prior to boarding her flight at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport on Wednesday, Tsai delivered a speech in which she said that Taiwan's determination to come into the world will only become stronger. She said that ""leading Taiwan in going out into the world and enabling the world to come to Taiwan are important goals of our governance.""The president then defiantly declared, ""External pressure will not hinder Taiwan's determination to go out into the world. We are calm and confident, and we will not yield or provoke.""",2023/03/29,3690,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850075,"Vietnam economy slows on rising costs, weaker exports","HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnam's economy slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year, with growth coming in at a much weaker than expected 3.3%, as its exporters were hit by rising costs and weaker demand, the General Statistics Office reported Wednesday.The slowdown in the January-March quarter from 5.9% year-on-year growth in the last quarter of 2022 was nearly as severe as that during the beginning of the pandemic and the second lowest for the first quarter in 12 years, it said.Vietnam has been one of the most dynamic economies in Asia in recent years, buoyed by strong foreign investment in manufacturing of electronics and other light industries. But efforts to slow economies to fight stubbornly high inflation are denting demand for consumer goods and other products.The decline is “a stark one which underscores the severity of the issue,” and is why the central bank cut its key lending rate earlier in March to help ease a credit crunch, Mizuho Bank researchers said in a report.The data released Wednesday showed that total trade, including both imports and exports, fell 13%.The vital manufacturing and construction sectors grew just 0.4% from a year earlier amid a severe downturn in the property sector.“The primary risk facing Vietnam’s growth is the worsening real estate sector crunch that is triggering an episode of defaults,” Theng Theng Tan of Oxford Economics said in a report. “An ongoing crackdown on corruption has also deterred investors and caused disruptions in investment approvals.”However, strength in the services sector likely will offset weakness in those industries, the Mizuho report said.In 2022, the Vietnamese economy grew at an 8% pace as the country recovered from restrictions on travel and disruptions to trade from the pandemic. Inflation remained relatively moderate, at 2.6% excluding volatile food and energy costs.Estimates for growth this year have been lowered sharply, to roughly half last year's robust pace. Tourism is one brighter spot in the economy, though, after the country opened its borders wider late last year.",2023/03/29,,World

Shanghai followed Wall Street lower. Oil prices gained.Fears global banks might be cracking under the strain of interest rate hikes to cool inflation temporarily pushed aside unease about slowing economic growth. Some calm has returned after regulators announced measures to shore up the system.“Clearly, investors have not completely lost their anxiety,” said Robert Carnell and Min Joo Kang of ING in a report.The Shanghai Composite Index lost less than 0.1% to 3,243.06 while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained 0.8% to 27,728.70.The Hang Seng in Hong Kong jumped 1.9% to 20,165.60 after Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group announced plans to split into six units in an effort to become more agile and unlock value for investors. It said they would include e-commerce, entertainment and logistics.The Kospi in Seoul was unchanged at 2,435.60 while Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.2% to 7,050.30.India's Sensex opened up 0.3% at 57,807.62. New Zealand declined while Southeast Asian markets rose.On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index dipped 0.2% on Tuesday to 3,971.27.Most stocks in the index gained, but that was offset by big declines for some banks and modest losses for tech shares. First Republic fell 2.3% and PacWest Bancorp. was down 5%. Apple and Microsoft declined.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1% to 3,394.25. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.4% to 11,716.08.The failure of two U.S. banks and one in Switzerland creates a dilemma for central bankers who are trying to cool economic activity and bring down inflation that is near multi-decade highs.The Federal Reserve and central banks in Europe and Asia usually would respond by hiking rates again. But the bank failures showed institutions are vulnerable after earlier hikes caused prices of bonds and other assets on their books to fall.Traders placed bets Tuesday that the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting in May, though the slight majority still expects it to hold rates steady. Traders are still largely betting the Fed will have to cut rates as soon as this summer to prop up the economy.Reports on the U.S. economy have been coming in mixed. The job market remains remarkably solid, while smaller corners of the economy have been showing more weakness.A report Tuesday showed consumer confidence is strengthening, contrary to expectations.Another report suggested U.S. home prices softened in January from December, but not as much as economists expected.In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude advanced 51 cents to $73.71 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 39 cents on Tuesday to $73.20. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, added 28 cents to $74.82 per barrel in London. It gained 53 cents the previous session to $78.65.The dollar gained to 131.71 yen from Tuesday's 130.80 yen. The euro declined to $1.0839 from $1.0842.",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850137,German manners: Is after the pandemic before the pandemic?,"A few weeks ago, I was at a doctor's appointment in Cologne and was flabbergasted when the first thing the physician did when he walked into the room was to offer his hand for me to shake. After my initial shock, the gesture prompted me to quip: ""Are we really allowed to do that again?!"" He laughed and responded: ""We HAVE to be able to do that again!""

Granted, as an orthopedist, he generally has a more hands-on approach, but since I was still muffled under an FFP-2 face mask, it did make me wonder.Once I left the appointment, I realized that I was warmed by that gesture of his handshake, and by his answer to my joke. What flashed through my mind on the way home was: ""Another thing back to half-way normal again!""The question is: Do we really want things to go ""completely"" back to normal?It was only then that it dawned on me what the lifting of the last of the COVID protective measures in the past few months in Germany meant (although, as of this publication, masks are still required among visitors to hospitals, nursing homes, doctors' offices and other healthcare facilities).Back in 2019, I wrote a story for ""Meet the Germans"" about German manners and how Germans seemed to be global champions at handshaking, so much so, that it often felt like a national sport.Even after decades of living in Germany (I was born in the US), I had still considered this handshaking ritual to be a rather formal gesture, even though Germans would do it all the time.

Not just in formal settings like business meetings or when being introduced to someone, but also when you said ""happy birthday"" to someone, for instance. Even children would sometimes shake hands with other children (like my three-year-old German niece with my 10-year-twins back then)!Through three long hard years of the pandemic, we all know that people modified how they behaved with each other: Everything from learning to stand 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to doing a quick ""footshake"" rather than a handshake.So, now, in 2023, what to do when a doctor offers you his hand in Germany? I asked Linda Kaiser, a spokeswoman for the Essen-based Deutsche-Knigge-Gesellschaft — a consulting association for all things concerning German etiquette — for advice. (Click here for the full interview.) ""Frankly, I always thought it was rather unusual that such a thing occurred at all in a doctor's office [before the pandemic]: 'Do I really want to shake hands with someone who just treated another patient with some ailment?,'"" she reflected.""At least now, we can kindly refuse such a handshake, and it will not appear ungracious,"" she said. What a relief!We can also refuse other forms of greeting without appearing rude, she pointed out.For instance, not too long ago, I met up with a group of acquaintances. All of us had been vaccinated and had already had COVID-19, so we felt relatively safe to hug each other. But when I attempted that with one of the women, she took a step back and said ""no, I'd rather not."" I was a bit startled, but then she explained that she was scheduled to have an operation the following week and didn't want to take the risk.The bottom line is, says Kaiser, that we are all partially relearning our manners and what is considered polite and we how to show our respect to someone.""Questions are asked, like: 'How may I greet you? ' 'May I hug you?' People sometimes prepare themselves more,"" Kaiser explained.During lockdown, Kaiser offered courses online about German etiquette, but they were more theoretical, ""like how to set a table, how to hold your wine glass, how you address someone,"" she said. ""But doing that online is very different than when you show someone live how they should eat spaghetti properly with silverware!""As much as possible, ""interacting with each other should be done in the presence of each other,"" she said, explaining that many young people, for instance, entered the workforce or started a new job during the pandemic.They hadn't or still haven't yet learned what it means to actually go to a workplace. ""Many are now experts in leading video conferences, but when you meet them in person, they may be shy and reserved,"" she said.""And many do not know how to dress in business attire,"" she added, pointing out the famed sweat pants people took to wearing during video calls during lockdown.But while learning how to dress for success may be quickly acquired, learning and refining other types of etiquette require more time and finesse, especially for others of us who have largely worked from home these past three years.During video conferences, for instance, people have had that ""divide"" of a computer monitor, Kaiser elaborated. ""It suggests a kind of barrier, and when people are sitting at home working, they may feel more protected and feel everything is fine. They may have felt comfortable enough making comments or saying things they normally would not say sitting in a room full of people.""Going back to in-office work settings, when people ""now interact with others in person, it's not quite so easy,"" Kaiser observed.The subtleties and nuances of interpersonal communication then become all the more pronounced.For my part, though, I think I will still refrain from shaking hands with a physician in the doctor's office. A big, fat smile will just have to suffice, with my eyes crinkling up over the edges of my mask.You'll find more Meet the Germans on YouTubeand www.dw.com/MeetTheGermans as well as fresh content on Instagram.Edited by: Stuart Braun",2023/03/29,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850138,Taiwanese president leaves for US drawing China's anger,"Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen left on Wednesday for a trip to Central America that will transit through the United States, sparking more tension between Beijing and Washington.Tsai is expected to transit through New York on March 30 and Los Angeles on April 5 as part of her trip to Guatemala and Belize, returning to Taipei on April 7. On her way back, Tsai is scheduled to meet US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a plan that has drawn China's anger.The Taiwanese president has transited via the United States seven times since taking office in 2016, often meeting US officials, including members of Congress. However, this will be the first meeting between a House speaker and a Taiwanese president on US soil.Tsai's meeting with McCarthy comes at a time when relations between US and China are arguably the worst since 1979 when Washington normalized ties with Beijing and switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei. The US does not officially recognize Taiwan as an independent territory but maintains unofficial relations with the island.China claims Taiwan as its own territory and responded adversely to a visit from then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August 2022. Washington-Beijing relations have only worsened since.Before leaving for her trip, Tsai told reporters that external pressure would not stop their determination to go out into the world.""We are calm and confident, will neither yield nor provoke,"" she said at Taiwan's main international airport at Taoyuan. ""Taiwan will firmly walk on the road of freedom and democracy and go into the world. Although this road is rough, Taiwan is not alone.""China has reacted strongly to the impending meeting in the US and threatened ""to resolutely fight back.""""If she contacts US House Speaker McCarthy, it will be another provocation that seriously violates the one-China principle, harms China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and destroys peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said in a news conference. ""We firmly oppose this and will definitely take measures to resolutely fight back.""This is not the first time China has threatened action over US-Taiwan ties.The United States, meanwhile, said China has no reason to react since the planned transit was consistent with long-standing practice and the US one-China policy.""There's absolutely no reason for Beijing to use this upcoming transit as an excuse or a pretext to carry out aggressive or coercive activities aimed at Taiwan,"" a senior US official said. Beijing's military, economic and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan will not alter Washington's practice of facilitating transits, he said.A second US official, on the condition of anonymity, urged China to keep communication channels open with the US. He noted that US President Joe Biden had planned to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to clear the air after a US fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon. That talk is yet to happen. Washington and Beijing had also discussed a postponed visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and visits by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, he said.mk/sms (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/03/29,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850150,New Generation of Malaysians Shop Value-Based Online,"KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 29 March 2023 - New generations of Malaysians are shopping with purpose online — Shopee's marketplace data shows online consumers are three times more likely to buy products that promote smarter consumption in 2023 than in 2020. Malaysians are increasingly searching for keywords such as 'pre-loved', 'pre-owned', 'warehouse clearance', 'demo unit' and 'thrift' over 'new'.            Over the last three years, Shopee marketplace saw consumers putting value-based shopping into practice with a total 1.4 million items sold that were demo units, warehouse clearance items with minor defects, bundled goods, and also pre-owned products.  50% of these were FMCG categories Baby and Toys, Groceries and Pets, and Health and Beauty, 27% pre-owned fashion, 17% lifestyle items (Home and Living, Outdoor Sports, Hobbies, Games and Books) and the remainder used Electronics.   Kenneth Soh, Head of Marketing at Shopee Malaysia, said, ""Value-based shopping is clearly the future. Generation Z shoppers on our marketplace are telling us with their keyword searches that  for every 6 times they look for something new, 4 other times, they are looking for something pre-loved, recycled, reused or display units. They are exercising their purchasing power in a very deliberate way, and it's humbling to be able to meet the needs of this group of consumers by connecting them to sellers who are aligned with their values.""   ""Shopee makes it easy for Malaysian sellers with stocks to clear to list their pre-loved goods and describe and show users the conditions they are authentically in so that people can make smarter shopping decisions. In February 2023, we saw an estimated 15% increase in pre-loved SKU listings compared to the same month last year. We believe that we make it easier for our consumers to shop with more value online,"" Soh concluded.   The most popular warehouse clearance supplies were hand sanitisers as Malaysians increased their need for personal hygiene protection. As households economised on spending, overstock but affordable skincare, cosmetics, and personal care products were hot in demand. Unsurprisingly, shoppers also chose 'pre-owned' over 'new' with baby and children accessories, baby and children toys, and pet accessories that get outgrown with age.   Influencers' content on Shopee Live has also been shifting to cater to value-based and purposeful shopping decisions.  Throughout the last three years, livestream sellers recorded four times more pre-loved orders sold and twice as much live streaming content for pre-owned products compared to new products. This could be attributed to the authenticity generated by influencers demonstrating pre-loved units in their genuine condition along with positive messages shaping sustainable mindsets.   Shoppers keen to support recommerce can type the following keywords on Shopee’s search bar: “pre-loved”, “bundled”, “warehouse clearance”, “thrift”, “second hand”, “used”, “demo unit” and “pre-owned”. In addition, users can find titles for preloved Live Streams available to view in the Shopee mobile app. Shopee users should also note that from 24 March, Shopee has introduced ‘Change of Mind’, a free return and refund feature for the entire Fashion segment (Local Sellers only) on the marketplace, to enable a ‘want not, waste not’ mindset this Ramadan and Raya.     Notes:    Shopee Platform Data focuses on the Pre-, During, and Post-Pandemic Timelines and Trends from 1 February 2020 - 28 February 2023   Hashtag: #Shopee

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850155,King Charles III makes world debut as tour starts in Germany,"BERLIN (AP) — King Charles III arrived in Berlin on Wednesday for his first foreign trip as Britain’s monarch, hoping to improve the U.K.'s relations with the European Union and show he can win hearts and minds abroad, just as his mother did for seven decades.Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, landed at Berlin's government airport in the early afternoon. The king, dressed in a black coat, and his wife, in a light blue coat and a feather-trimmed teal hat worn at a jaunty angle, paused at the top of their plane's stairs to receive a 21-gun salute as two military jets performed a flyover.The royal couple said in a joint statement, released on their official Twitter account, that it was a “great joy” to be able to develop the “longstanding friendship between our two nations.”An hour later, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife, Elke Buedenbender, welcomed them with military honors at the German capital's historic Brandenburg Gate.Soldiers hoisted the British and German flags as the national anthems were played. Steinmeier and Charles then strolled past the cheering, flag-waving crowd, shaking hands and chatting briefly with people.Some took close-up pictures on their phones as Charles and Camilla approached, while others gave them flower bouquets. One woman handed Charles a gift bag. Journalists and security personnel trailed the royal couple and their German hosts as they made their way back to their motorcade.Charles, 74, who ascended the throne after the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September, is set to be crowned on May 6. As Britain’s head of state, the king meets weekly with the prime minister and retains his mother’s role as leader of the Commonwealth.He had initially planned to visit France before heading to Germany, but the first leg of his trip was canceled due to massive protests over the French government's efforts to raise the country's retirement age by two years.Billed as a multi-day tour of the EU’s two biggest countries, the trip was designed to underscore British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s efforts to rebuild relations with the bloc after six years of arguments over Brexit and highlight the countries’ shared history as they work together to combat Russian aggression in Ukraine.Now everything rests on Germany, where the king faces the first big test of whether he can be an effective conduit for the “soft power” the House of Windsor has traditionally wielded, helping Britain pursue its geopolitical goals through the glitz and glamour of a 1,000-year-old monarchy.Highlighting the diplomatic importance of the trip, Charles was accompanied by Britain’s Foreign Secretary, James Cleverley.Charles, a former naval officer who is the first British monarch to earn a university degree, is expected to insert heft where his glamorous mother once wielded star power.During an afternoon reception and again at a white tie evening banquet at Palace Bellevue, the German president’s official residence, Steinmeier remarked on the significance of Charles's first visit taking him to Berlin, calling it “a wonderful personal gesture and at the same time an important sign for German-British relations.”Steinmeier noted that Britain began the tortuous process of leaving the EU on March 29, 2017.“For me personally, this was a sad day,” he said. “Today, exactly six years later, we open a new chapter.”Steinmeier paid tribute to Charles' mother Elizabeth, stressing how much she had done to foster German-British ties.“Your family stands for continuity, for stability, particularly in times of change,"" he said, noting that Charles, too, had visited Germany more than 40 times as a prince.It was a subject picked up by Charles, who said the countries' friendship was of great importance to his mother, who enjoyed immense popularity in Germany.“The relationship between Germany and the United Kingdom matters greatly to me too,"" he said. “I am more convinced than ever of its enduring value to us all.”“It means so much to us that my wife and I could come to Germany for this very first overseas tour of my reign,” said Charles. ""I can only assure you that throughout the time that is granted to me as King, I will do all I can to strengthen the connections between us.”Switching from English to near-flawless German, Charles insisted: “Our ties will become even stronger, I'm convinced of that, if we work together for a sustainable future in prosperity and security.”The banquet was attended by guests including former Chancellor Angela Merkel and scientist Ozlem Tureci, who co-founded the German company BioNTech that developed the first widely approved coronavirus vaccine.On Thursday, the king is scheduled to give a speech to the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament. He will also meet Chancellor Olaf Scholz, talk to Ukrainian refugees, and meet with British and Germany military personnel who are working together on joint projects. In the afternoon he will visit an organic farm outside of Berlin.The royal couple plan to go to Hamburg on Friday, where they will visit the Kindertransport memorial for Jewish children who fled from Germany to Britain during the Third Reich, and attend a green energy event before returning to the U.K.The king was urged to make the trip by Sunak, who during his first six months in office negotiated a settlement to the long-running dispute over post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland and reached a deal with France to combat the people smugglers ferrying migrants across the English Channel in small boats. Sunak hopes goodwill created by a royal visit can help pave the way for progress on other issues, including Britain’s return to an EU program that funds scientific research across Europe.Britain's senior royals are among the most recognizable people on the planet. While their formal powers are strictly limited by law and tradition, they draw attention from the media and the public partly because of the historic ceremonies and regalia that accompany them — and also because the public is fascinated by their personal lives.Elizabeth’s influence stemmed in part from the fact that she made more than 100 state visits during her 70 years on the throne, meeting presidents and prime ministers around the world in a reign that lasted from the Cold War to the information age.Politicians were eager to meet the monarch for tea, if for no other reason than she’d been around so long.___Kirka reported from London.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850156,Spain clean energy case shakes confidence in EU investment,"MADRID (AP) — Renewable energy investors who lost subsidies promised by Spain are heading to a London court to try to claw back $125 million from the government — a decadelong dispute with ramifications for clean energy financing across the European Union.The outcome will be closely watched by investors after the U.S. passed a new law offering incentives for homegrown green technology. Experts say the Inflation Reduction Act is already drawing clean energy investment away from EU countries like Spain, leaving the 27-nation bloc much less competitive globally.The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has proposed its own rules on allowing state aid and incentives for green investment. But those changes would not affect court cases already underway.The lawsuit in London’s Commercial Court this week involves investors from the Netherlands and Luxembourg who poured millions into a solar plant in southern Spain in 2011. The Spanish government offered subsidies to encourage growth in renewable energy production, then controversially slashed the payments without notice as it cut costs after the 2008 financial crisis.Spain has been sued internationally more than 50 times over the retroactive changes. It has not paid out despite losing more than 20 cases so far, according to U.N. data on international investment disputes. The EU backs Spain's position.“Those renewable investors — multibillion-dollar companies — are very concerned about the attitude of Spain and Europe looking forward,” said Nick Cherryman, one of the lawyers leading the case against Spain. “Why should they take risks investing in Europe given the track record?”Spain now ranks alongside Venezuela and Russia as countries with the most unpaid debts over commercial treaty violations, according to a recent ranking compiled by Nikos Lavranos, a Netherlands-based expert in investment arbitration and EU law.Most of the cases allege that Spain broke agreements it agreed to honor under the international Energy Charter Treaty, a legally binding agreement between 50 countries to protect companies from unfair government interference in the energy sector.Environmental campaigners have criticised the treaty for protecting fossil fuel investment because financiers can also sue over policy changes aimed at scaling back polluting projects. However, for Spain, almost all cases relate to renewable energy.“If you take the bigger picture, the EU is shooting itself in the foot by supporting Spain in this,” Lavranos said. “You cannot trust that they can follow through with their agreements, so I think you do shake investors’ confidence.""He also questioned how leaving investors in the lurch over initiatives to ramp up renewable energy production aligned with recent EU initiatives like the Green New Deal, a goal for carbon neutrality by 2050 and relaxation of subsidy rules.“It’s very contradictory,” Lavranos said.In 2013, the investors in Spain brought a case before the World Bank-backed International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, an arbitration body between governments and investors.Spain in 2018 was ordered to compensate investors over its subsidy changes. Despite being told to pay out more than $1 billion by the international body, Spain has refused, citing EU rules.Spain’s Ecological Transition Ministry said the payments “may be contrary to EU law and constitute illegal state aid.” When the government is told to make a payout, it says it notifies Brussels but that “Spain cannot pay before the commission’s decision, so it is faithfully complying with its legal obligations.”The European Commission said the Energy Charter Treaty does not apply in disputes between member states like the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Spain, arguing EU law takes precedence. The commission says the decision to compensate investors over lost Spanish subsidies is still being studied and “the preliminary view is that the arbitration award would constitute state aid.”Cherryman, the investors' lawyer, said the EU thinks it ""should be superior to international treaty law."" After waiting for payment for a decade and given the EU position, his team is trying to seize part of a $1 billion settlement awarded to Spain over a 2002 oil spill.Starting Wednesday, the London court will hear Spain’s arguments that the investors should not be allowed to seize those assets in lieu of compensation they have yet to be paid.José Ángel Rueda, a Spanish international arbitration lawyer who has represented several renewable energy investors against Spain, said the country's reputation is at stake. Other EU members like Germany and Hungary have paid out after international disputes, opting to maintain a positive image, he said.“Spain is not like Russia or Venezuela. It was expected to be a serious country. But the awards remain unpaid,” Rueda said. “Investors can see that Spain might not be a reliable state in terms of the rule of law.”Following years of legal wrangling, the EU is now considering a coordinated withdrawal from the energy treaty, though that would not affect pending disputes.“It is not possible to modernize the treaty to make it compatible with the objectives of the Paris agreement and the European Green Deal,” Spain's Ecological Transition Ministry said.The European Commission agreed, saying a withdrawal was “the most pragmatic way forward.”That might simply nudge investors to look across the Atlantic, Cherryman said.“America has been nimble, and it introduced very favorable legislation to encourage renewable investment,” he said. “They will respect my investment. Or I can take risk and go into Europe, go into Spain.”The risk was the loss of more money for renewables, which are “a win for everybody,” Cherryman said. “We all want to see renewables being invested in and we all want a greener environment that is a safer future for our children.""",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850157,"Israeli PM, Biden exchange frosty words over legal overhaul","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s prime minister on Wednesday brushed aside criticism of his judicial overhaul plan from President Joe Biden, saying the matter was an internal Israeli issue and would not be influenced by outside pressure.While both sides tried to play down their differences, it was a rare bout of public disagreement between the two close allies, and reflected what has been a lukewarm relationship between the Biden administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government. It also marked the latest sign of cooling ties between Israel and the Democratic Party.The disagreement came after months of unrest in Israel over Netanyahu’s proposed overhaul of the country’s judicial system. Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, says the plan is needed to rein in the powers of an interventionist judiciary. Critics say it will push the country toward authoritarianism by weakening an independent court system.Following especially heavy protests, Netanyahu this week froze the plan and launched negotiations on a compromise with his political opponents. The timeout prompted Biden’s ambassador, Tom Nides, to tell Israeli media that he expected Netanyahu to soon be invited to the White House.Asked about the legislation on Tuesday, Biden told reporters, “I hope he walks away from it.” He said Netanyahu’s government “cannot continue down this road” and called for a compromise. He also said there were no immediate plans for a White House visit, saying: “No, not in the near term.”Netanyahu responded with a statement expressing appreciation for Biden’s years of support for Israel and vowing to seek a “broad consensus” over the legal program. But he also dismissed the outside pressure.“Israel is a sovereign country which makes its decisions by the will of its people and not based on pressures from abroad, including from the best of friends,” Netanyahu said.Members of his coalition reacted even more harshly, saying Biden had no business interfering in an internal Israeli matter.Israel “is not another star in the American flag,” said National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party. “I expect the U.S. president to understand this point.”Netanyahu later tried to soothe tensions in a speech to the U.S. “Summit for Democracy,” a virtual gathering of global leaders, saying that while the United States and Israel have “occasional differences,“ the ties between them are “unshakeable.”A senior Israeli official, speaking to reporters, described the spat as a “tempest in a teacup” and said there have not been any discussions with the Americans about a Netanyahu visit to Washington. He spoke on condition of anonymity because to discuss behind-the-scenes diplomacy.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also tried to play down the disagreements, saying Biden's comments about the judicial overhaul plan have remained “completely consistent.” He also dismissed suggestions they caused tensions in an “unshakeable” relationship.“The great thing about a deep friendship is you can be that candid with one another,” Kirby said.While they may get through this latest dispute, it will not erase the deeper differences between them.After five Israeli elections in under four years, Netanyahu managed to cobble together a coalition government with a group of ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist partners late last year.These include far-right partners who oppose Palestinian statehood and have strong ties to the West Bank settler movement — putting them at odds with U.S. support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Since taking office, there have been repeated run-ins with the Americans over Israeli settlement construction on occupied lands and comments by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who called for a Palestinian town to be “erased” and later said the Palestinian people don’t exist. Washington has called his comments “repugnant” and snubbed Smotrich during a recent U.S. visit.Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, who enjoyed good ties with Biden during a brief period as caretaker prime minister last year, accused Netanyahu of harming Israel’s most important relationship.“For decades, Israel was the USA’s closest ally,” Lapid wrote on Twitter. “The most radical government in the country’s history ruined that in three months.”That relationship, however, has been repeatedly tested in recent years by a growing partisan divide in the U.S. over support for Israel.Netanyahu has long been seen as favoring the Republicans over the Democrats. During his 2009-2021 term as prime minister, he cultivated close ties with U.S. evangelical Christian groups.Netanyahu had several public spats with the Obama administration — in which Biden served as vice president — over Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians and the Iranian nuclear issue. In 2015, he infuriated the White House by addressing Congress to rail against a U.S.-led nuclear deal between world powers and Iran.His close relationship with former President Donald Trump further alienated U.S. Democrats.Democratic lawmakers, particularly in the party’s progressive wing, have grown increasingly outspoken in their criticism of Israel.A Pew poll published last May found Republicans expressing far more favorable views of the Israeli government than Democrats. The poll found that Democrats — especially young voters — have increasingly expressed favorable views about the Palestinians.This gap has spread to the American Jewish community, a key base of support for Israel, which tends to lean heavily toward the Democrats.A separate Pew poll published in 2021 found that Jewish Democrats, especially the younger generation, have lower levels of support and connection to Israel.The Netanyahu government’s attempts to reshape the judiciary now risk accelerating these trends. Business leaders, top economists and former security chiefs have all come out against the plan, saying it is pushing the country toward dictatorship.It has also drawn criticism from Israel’s supporters in the U.S., including American Jewish organizations, as well as Democratic members of Congress.The plan would give Netanyahu, who is on trial on corruption charges, and his allies the final say in appointing the nation’s judges. It would also give parliament, which is controlled by his allies, authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit the court’s ability to review laws.Critics say the legislation would concentrate power in the hands of the coalition in parliament and upset the balance of checks and balances between branches of government. They also say that Netanyahu has a conflict of interest while on trial.After this week’s freeze of the overhaul, the rival sides have several months to find a compromise.But Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul-general in New York who is now a columnist for the liberal daily Haaretz, said the damage has already been done.“This is not about an invitation to the White House,” he wrote Wednesday. “This is about a fundamental crisis of trust. Worse, it is about asking whether a dependable U.S. ally is becoming unstable, unreliable and untrustworthy.”___Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed reporting.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850158,Calls mount for Taliban to free girls' education activist,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Calls mounted Wednesday for the Taliban to free a girls' education activist arrested earlier this week in Kabul, as a minister in the Taliban-led government defended the detention.Matiullah Wesa, founder and president of Pen Path — a local nongovernmental group that travels across Afghanistan with a mobile school and library — was arrested in the Afghan capital on Monday.Since their takeover of Afghanistan, the Taliban have imposed restrictions on women’s and minority rights. Girls are barred from school beyond the sixth grade and last year, the Taliban banned women from going to universities.Wesa has been outspoken in his demands for girls to have the right to go to school and learn, and has repeatedly called on the Taliban-led government to reverse its bans. His most recent tweets coincided with the start of the new academic year in Afghanistan, with girls remaining shut out of classrooms and campuses.Late Tuesday, the U.S. chargé d’affaires for Afghanistan, Karen Decker, said she was disturbed by “multiple, disturbing reports” of Afghans being detained while peacefully protesting in support of their aspirations.Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was saddened to hear of Wesa's arrest.Local reports said Taliban security forces detained Wesa after his return from a trip to Europe. The Taliban authorities have not confirmed his detention, whereabouts or reasons for the arrest.Abdul Haq Humad, the director of publications at the Ministry of Information and Culture, defended the detention.“His actions were suspicious and the system has the right to ask such people for an explanation,” he said Tuesday in a tweet. “It is known that the arrest of an individual caused such widespread reaction that a conspiracy was prevented.”Wesa's brother, Attaullah Wesa, said Taliban forces surrounded the family home on Tuesday, beat family members and confiscated Matiullah’s mobile phone.Social media activists have created a hashtag to campaign for Matiullah Wesa’s release. Many posts condemned his detention and demanded immediate freedom for the activist.Wesa and others from the Pen Path launched a door-to-door campaign to promote girls’ education. “We have been volunteering for 14 years to reach people and convey the message for girls’ education,"" Wesa said in recent social media posts. “During the past 18 months we campaigned house-to-house in order to eliminate illiteracy and to end all our miseries.""",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850228,UBS brings back Ermotti as CEO with Credit Suisse deal ahead,"GENEVA (AP) — UBS said Wednesday that it's bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse.Ermotti, who was the bank's top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction"" for him not to accept the post ""to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes. Any implications for the UBS takeover were not immediately clear.Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close.Ermotti suggested he didn't view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail' but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland's renowned banking and financial industry.Shares of UBS and Credit Suisse were up more than 1% on the Swiss stock exchange — though European bank stocks overall were mostly higher in midday trading.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850229,British comedian and TV star Paul O'Grady dies at 67,"LONDON (AP) — Entertainer Paul O’Grady, who achieved fame as drag queen Lily Savage before becoming a much-loved comedian and host on British television, has died. He was 67.Britain's queen consort, who worked with O'Grady to support animal charities, led tributes to a performer who emerged from the alternative gay comedy scene and became a national treasure.O’Grady’s partner Andre Portasio said he died “unexpectedly but peacefully” on Tuesday evening.“He will be greatly missed by his loved ones, friends, family, animals and all those who enjoyed his humor, wit and compassion,” Portasio said in a statement.Born in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, in 1955, O’Grady was working as a local-authority care worker when he began performing as Savage, a tart-tongued Liverpudlian drag queen.Savage became a fixture as a standup and talent-show host at London’s Royal Vauxhall Tavern, a landmark gay venue. O’Grady used his platform to speak out about LGBT rights at the height of the AIDS crisis, a time when the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was passing anti-gay laws.Lily Savage moved into television in the 1990s, including a stint hosting talk show “The Lily Savage Show.”Later, as Paul O’Grady, he hosted talk shows and gameshows including “The Paul O’Grady Show,” “Blind Date” and “Blankety Blank,” as well as a long-running program on BBC radio.An animal lover, he also presented “For the Love of Dogs,” which profiled the work of the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, an animal rescue charity. Camilla, the queen consort, was a guest on the show last year.The official royal family Twitter account posted a picture of O'Grady and Camilla with the message: “Deeply saddened to hear of the death of Paul O’Grady, who worked closely with Her Majesty in support of @Battersea_, providing lots of laughter and many waggy-tailed memories.”Veteran gay-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said O’Grady “wasn’t just a brilliant comedian and broadcast personality but a much admired campaigner for LGBT+ equality and animal rights.”“Paul was one of the loveliest people you could ever meet,” Tatchell said. “Everyone whose lives he touched will miss him greatly, as will those who enjoyed his wit and admired his compassion.”O’Grady is survived by Portasio, whom he married in 2017, and by a daughter from a previous relationship.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850230,Some in dry Somalia break Ramadan fast with little but water,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — This year’s holy month of Ramadan coincides with the longest drought on record in Somalia. As the sun sets and Muslims around the world gather to break their daily fasts with generous dinners, Hadiiq Abdulle Mohamed and her family have just water and whatever food might be at hand.Mohamed is among more than 1 million Somalis who have fled their homes in search of help while an estimated 43,000 people died last year alone. She and her husband and their six children now take refuge in one of the growing displacement camps around the capital, Mogadishu.Ramadan brought an increase in food prices for a country already struggling with inflation caused in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the withering of local crops by five consecutive failed rainy seasons. Millions of livestock that are central to people’s diets have died.Now food is even harder to come by for those displaced. For Ramadan, Mohamed and her family rely on well-wishers to provide their single meal a day. First, they break their fast with water and pieces of dates, then spoons of rice. Finally, they eat the donated meal of rice cooked with mixed meat, bruised banana and a small plastic bag of juice, which Mohamed waits in line for hours under the searing sun to obtain.“I recall the Ramadan fast we had in the past when we were enjoying and prospering,” she said. “We would milk our goats, cook the ugali (maize porridge) and collard greens and drink water from our catchment. However, this year we are living in a camp, without plastic to cover us from rain, without food to eat, thirsty and experiencing drought. We have this small hot meal, but do you think that this can feed a family of six children, plus a mother and father? That is not possible.” The family once was prosperous and owned farmland and goats in a village about 140 kilometers (87 miles) west of the capital. Now they try to get by on the little money her husband makes by carrying goods in a wheelbarrow. But food prices have soared so much that his income is no longer enough to buy a 1 kilogram (2.2 pound) bag of rice.The inflation in Somalia pinches the more well-off, too. The typical Ramadan fast-breaking meal includes samosas and other snacks; juice and tea and coffee; the main dish of rice or spaghetti or flatbread with camel, goat, chicken or fish; and finally, dessert.The Horn of Africa country imports the majority of its food, from Ukraine-grown wheat to the bottles of Mountain Dew stocked in some gleaming Mogadishu shops. Meanwhile, prices of basics like rice and cooking oil continue to rise in parts of the country.This month, World Food Program monitoring reported that supply chain resilience was generally good in Somalia, but the spike in demand for Ramadan would be “a disadvantage to vulnerable households who depend on local markets.”“We are really experiencing a soaring price of food and another basic commodities,” said Ahmed Khadar Abdi Jama, a lecturer in economics at Somalia University. “Whenever there is an external factor that can reduce the supply of food, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it is more likely that Somalis will feel a low supply.”For example, a kilogram of camel meat that cost about $4 before the holy month now costs about $6. But this inflation will subside after the month is over, Khadar said.Ramadan is a month of alms and forgiveness throughout the Muslim world. With the growing number of Somalis displaced by the drought, the imams of the mosques in Mogadishu are leading efforts to encourage the city’s wealthy and others who can afford it to sympathize with the poor and give generously.“Some people need food to afford to break their fast,"" said one imam, Sheikh Abdikarim Isse Ali. ""Please help them.”___Cara Anna in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850231,"Paris trash strike ends, pension protest numbers shrink","PARIS (AP) — Striking sanitation workers in Paris are set to return to work Wednesday — potentially ending one of the most enduring symbols of resistance to French President Emmanuel Marcon’s controversial pension bill, as nationwide protests also appeared to be winding down.Clean-up crews were set Wednesday to start picking up heaps of trash that had piled up over their weekslong strike beginning March 6 — as well as debris from the streets following the tenth nationwide anti-pension reform protest a day earlier.Trash mounds of up to 10,000 tons along the French capital’s streets — matching the weight of the Eiffel Tower — have become a striking visual and olfactory symbol of opposition to Marcon’s bill raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.In a decision that sent waves of relief among some Paris residents, the powerful CGT union representing sanitation workers announced that the three-week-long strike would be “suspended” as of Wednesday. They will join others who were legally requisitioned over the last week to help with the daunting clean-up process.“It’s good that the trash is collected. It’s very unsanitary, and some residents already have trouble with rats and mice. It can be dangerous if it’s left too long,” said artist Gil Franco, 73.The suspension of the strike, together with the dwindling protest numbers, is seen by some as the beginning of the end of demonstrations against the pension bill.“People are getting tired of it. There has been too much violence. Paris is a mess, and I want to get on with normal life,” said Paris resident Amandine Betout, 32, getting her morning croissant in Le Marais district. She said it was a “good thing” that the trash is swept up from the streets, even though the cleanup could take some time.An artist going by the single name Bisk who has drawn attention for his creative sculptures using trash said his work has added some levity to otherwise tense protests, reminding Parisians about the lighter side of life.“People come by all serious then see a monster’s face or a little man, and they leave with a smile. People have thanked me for puncturing the mood,” the 30-year-old artist said.Bisk said he has worked on around 100 trash bin ‘sculptures’ since Mar 6, creating fantastical monster’s faces with mad eyes or little friendly men — that have garnered a life of their own on social media.“Everyone is tense, and I’m stopped by police when I’m working as they think I’m going to set fire to the trash – but I’m just doing art,” Bisk said. “I’m not political. I just transform crap into gold.”Tuesday’s protests in Paris saw dozens of arrests and flare ups of violence, though significantly fewer people participated in the action nationwide.The Interior Ministry put the number of demonstrators nationwide at 740,000, down from more than 1 million five days ago when protesters voiced their rage at Macron’s order to ram the bill through parliament without a vote.For unions, the fight against the law is far from over. An eleventh day of action is scheduled for April 6.",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850250,US-Taiwan Business Council envisions two paths for future US-Taiwan ties,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Considering the proximity of President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) trip to the U.S. and Central America and former President Ma Ying-jeou's (馬英九) visit to China, there are two different scenarios of what the U.S. can expect from the Democratic Progressive Party and Kuomintang (KMT) if either should win the general election next year, U.S.-Taiwan Business Council (USTBC) President Rupert Hammond-Chambers said in an opinion article.
Tsai has been an important U.S. partner during her two terms and her possible successor, Lai Ching-te (賴清德) would likely follow suit, Hammond-Chambers said. Lai would also maintain good ties with Japan, he added.
“The foreign policy and national security officials that have been indispensable to President Tsai’s government are likely to retire, opening the door for a new stable of leadership,” Hammond-Chambers said.
Under Ma, Taiwan pursued closer relations with China, which led to a U.S. arms sales freeze from 2011 to 2015 that “contributed mightily to the current military power imbalance in the Taiwan Strait,” the council president said.










While there are many “superb” senior KMT party members who would advocate for continued amicable U.S.-Japan relations, the old party leadership, including Ma, will seek to resume cross-strait exchanges, “possibly at the expense of America and its allies,” Hammond-Chambers said. Taiwan could possibly drift away from the U.S. under a KMT president, which would draw heavy criticism from the U.S. Congress and various government departments “insisting that Taiwan is the problem,” he said.
China could then capitalize on this rift in U.S.-Taiwan relations, which would damage peace and security in the Taiwan Strait, he noted. Ultimately, “Who runs Taiwan and what policies they will pursue have real implications for American national interests,” he said.
Tsai left for the U.S. and Central America on Wednesday (March 29). Her trip will last 10 days and will include a meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
The president will first stop in New York City before heading to Guatemala and Belize, both diplomatic allies. Then, she will have a layover in Los Angeles, where she will meet with McCarthy, before returning to Taiwan on April 7.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Considering the proximity of President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) trip to the U.S. and Central America and former President Ma Ying-jeou's (馬英九) visit to China, there are two different scenarios of what the U.S. can expect from the Democratic Progressive Party and Kuomintang (KMT) if either should win the general election next year, U.S.-Taiwan Business Council (USTBC) President Rupert Hammond-Chambers said in an opinion article.Tsai has been an important U.S. partner during her two terms and her possible successor, Lai Ching-te (賴清德) would likely follow suit, Hammond-Chambers said.

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 29 March 2023 - As a leading institute of research excellence in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) joined forces with leading business and academic institutes in Shenzhen, China to sign strategic agreements of cooperation that align strengths in research, development and innovation.           Photo captions [credits: KAUST]  [LEFT] A delegation from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology met with representatives from the      Southern University of Science and Technology, Schenzhen, China to initiative agreements centered on research exchange.      [CENTRE] A KAUST delegation meeting with business and academic leaders in Schenzhen, China, enjoyed a guided tour at      Shenzhen Innox Academy, where they signed agreements centered on tech innovation, transfer and talent exchange.      [RIGHT] At a KAUST alumni event in Shenzhen, China, President Tony Chan (middle) speaks with (left to right) Yanlong Tai, a professor at      Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology; Jian Pan (second from left), president of the      KAUST China Alumni Chapter; and Caigui Jiang, a professor at Xi'an Jiaotong University. The alumni reunion was part of a larger mission to Schenzhen, China with KAUST delegates and Schenzhen business and academic leaders focused on research exchange and tech innovation.     Shenzhen, the third largest city in China, is dubbed the ""Silicon Valley of China"" for being a major global technology, manufacturing and research hub with many important institutions headquartered there. KAUST President Dr. Tony Chan and a delegation of 10 university representatives met with diverse leaders there to create partnerships that will accelerate knowledge exchange and the commercialization of impactful technologies into innovative, market-ready products that can address global challenges.   KAUST's assets include its globally recognized faculty and student subject experts; world-class facilities, including the  Core Labs and  Shaheen III supercomputer — to be the most powerful supercomputer in the Middle East; advanced training and specialized equipment; and network of partnerships with Saudi industries, ministries and academic entities in fields such as telecommunications, semiconducting, energy and environmental engineering, artificial intelligence, materials design, computer science and bioscience, to name a few.   High-innovation, China partners involved in the signings include the  Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen;  Shenzhen Innox Academy;  International Digital Economy Academy;  X-Institute;  Southern University of Science and Technology;  Xbotpark; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology; and  Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data. The objectives of the agreements leverage complementary strengths intended to expand capabilities in areas including but not limited to industrial innovation and exchange; technology transfer and incubation; knowledge sharing of talent and materials; joint laboratories and research and development platforms; and entrepreneurship training.   ""Why did we visit Shenzhen?"" asked KAUST President Tony Chan. ""Shenzhen was a fishing village that has since emerged with a GDP exceeding Seoul, South Korea in just a short four decades. This evolution was made possible by building the world's most effective and efficient innovation ecosystem. Our visit gave us much insight on how Shenzhen achieved this miracle.""   Cheng Buyi and Zheng Hongbo, members of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee who met with President Chan to discuss the cooperative exchange, said that KAUST and Shenzhen have achieved rapid development in the fields of education, technology, and talents, and there is broad space for cooperation. They will continue to consolidate and expand exchanges and cooperation in scientific and technological research, innovation and entrepreneurship, and talent training, and other areas of mutual development.   ""In the coming days, we hope to identify mechanisms and platforms to help accelerate innovation at KAUST up to 'Shenzhen speed',"" Chan added.   The Shenzhen agreements build on another example of thriving Saudi-China exchange as reflected in the growing demographic of Chinese academics at KAUST. Approximately 20% of KAUST's students, 34% of its postdoctoral researchers, and 9% of its distinguished faculty are from mainland China, with the China alumni group being the biggest and most engaged of all chapters. President Chan met with some 130 China alumni attendees at a special dinner event as part of the larger Schenzhen visit. These research relations are poised to increase as a result of the Shenzhen agreements, and, in turn, will help drive the growth and engagement of Saudi Arabia with China.  Hashtag: #KAUST

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850282,UN official struggles to explain why Taiwanese are excluded from UN buildings,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — This week, the United Nations (UN) was asked to justify its exclusionary policies towards Taiwanese visitors to the organization’s headquarters in New York, with one French reporter directly asking the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General, “Is China running the UN?”Several reporters pressed Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Stephane Dujarric about the basis of the policy that excludes Taiwanese nationals from UN buildings over two days this week, reported CNS News. On Monday (March 27), Yvonne Murray, a journalist with the Irish Times, asked about the topic after mentioning that Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) will visit the U.S. this week.When asked by Murray if the UN leader has any message for Tsai, the president of “what’s considered Asia’s leading democracy,” Dujarric said that his position on the matter is “guided by the General Assembly’s resolution on the One China policy.”“Sorry. I’m not asking about China. I’m asking about Taiwan,” Murray said. She then went on to ask why Taiwanese people are not allowed to enter UN buildings for tours or meetings.Dujarric explained that only individuals with an ID issued by a member state of the UN may enter. However, the spokesperson was unprepared when Al Jazeera reporter James Bays followed up by asking if the decision to exclude Taiwanese people was based on a decision by the General Assembly or one by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Dujarric was not sure about the answer. Bays then pressed Dujarric further by saying, “It seems to me all of these people are citizens of the world. And I wouldn’t have thought that the secretary-general is someone who wants to practice discrimination.”Later during Monday’s press conference, a French reporter, Celhia De Lavarene, returned to the issue of Taiwanese visitors being excluded from UN buildings. “I want to know, is China running the UN?” Lavarene asked bluntly.Dujarric said Lavarene’s question was the most “ridiculous” he had heard that day. The Spokesperson for the General-Secretary then concluded his talk with the press.On Tuesday (March 28), Dujarric was again asked about the issue by journalist Joe Klein during a daily briefing. Klein said he examined General Assembly resolution 2758, which expelled Chiang Kai-shek and his representatives from the UN body, but “there’s no reference to excluding the Taiwanese people from participation in UN activities.”

Dujarric, who was flustered in his reply, contested Klein’s use of the word “exclude,” but was unable to explain the origin and legal justification for the UN’s policy of not allowing Taiwanese people to enter UN buildings or join UN activities.“I will get back to you as soon as I have the answer,” said Dujarric, before hastily moving on to another question.",2023/03/29,3507,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850292,"Free Taipei Youbike rides for first 30 mins to return 2023, but at what cost?","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) wants to make the first 30 minutes of every Taipei Youbike ride free again, but critics say the policy fails to recognize that the current number of public bikes can not keep up with demand.Mayor Chiang said on Wednesday (March 29) that he has directed the Taipei City Department of Transportation to increase the number of Youbikes in the city by about 1800, in addition to canceling the fee for the first 30 minutes, per CNA. Kuomintang legislator Chan Wei-yuan (詹為元) said on Facebook on Monday (March 27) that Chiang’s intentions are good but will not solve the problems caused by a lack of public bikes in the city.“Among the top five problems reported by the public, ‘no bikes to borrow’ ranked first,” Chan said, “however the statistics can’t reflect the reality of the situation, because most people go to the rental point, find that there are no bikes, and leave.” He said that because people often do not report the lack of bikes, the statistics are likely inaccurate.“If the 30 minutes of the bike rental are free, it’s likely to be more difficult for people to borrow bikes during peak periods,” Chan said. “The only thing to say is that the current strategy of dispatching staff with extra bikes is too slow,” he added.Longshan Temple and Taipei 101 MRT stations’ Youbike docks are reported to be the most difficult to secure a bike at peak times, with wait times of up to 20 minutes. “Reports of bikes being unavailable at Exit 2 of Taipei 101/World Trade Center Station in my constituency are as high as 69 times,” Chan said.Despite the criticism, cheaper Youbike rides may prove popular among constituents, following the announcement that taxi fares in the greater Taipei area will be raised on Saturday (April 1). Local authorities said the base fare for the first 1.25 kilometers will increase from NT$70 (US$2.30) to NT$85, after which the mileage rate will remain at NT$5 per 200 meters, and waiting fees will be increased.Bringing back free Youbike rides is not the only policy affecting public spaces that Chiang wants to resurrect, with UDN reporting in February that he and his deputy Lee Shu-chuan (李四川) intended to bring back many of the city’s rubbish bins removed under former Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲).",2023/03/29,642,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850293,Mass shootings seldom shift partisan policies despite outcry,"Public outrage is swift following mass shootings, such as the killing of six people at a Christian elementary school in Nashville. Sorrow and sympathy are widespread. But what comes next from policymakers is likely to depend on which political party is in charge of a state.Don't expect new gun controls in Republican-led states, such as Tennessee or Texas.But when similar tragedies occur in Democratic-led states, more gun limits are likely — even if they already have restrictive laws.Mass shootings generally don't seem to change a state's basic political makeup.“Democratic-led states tend to focus more on firearm restrictions whereas Republican-led states do not and often emphasize lessening regulations on guns,” said Jaclyn Schildkraut, executive director of the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium at the Rockefeller Institute of Government.The fact that responses seem predicated by Republican and Democratic labels is perhaps an indication of the nation's political polarization — and of differing viewpoints that pin the problem primarily on violent individuals or their easy access to weapons.TENNESSEE SHOOTING RESPONSEFollowing Monday's shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, tensions ran high among state lawmakers meeting across town in the state Capitol. Democrats called for action on gun control — and got their microphones cut off by Republican leadership for criticizing their GOP colleagues' love of the Second Amendment.""Prayers are good, but faith without works is dead,"" Democratic state Sen. Raumesh Akbari implored with a biblical reference. ""Let’s not let another preventable tragedy unfold without this legislature taking real action.”Any action from Republican lawmakers, however, is more likely to move in a different direction. Republicans this year have introduced bills that would make it easier to arm teachers and allow college students to carry weapons on campus.On the same day as the Nashville shooting, a federal judge approved a legal settlement lowering the minimum age to carry handguns without a permit in Tennessee from 21 to 18. That came just two years after a new law set the age at 21.BLUE STATESMichigan's new Democratic legislative majority took its first steps earlier this month toward passing a sweeping gun safety package.The Senate voted along party lines for a red-flag law that would allow guns to temporarily be removed from people with potentially violent behavior. It also passed measures requiring anyone purchasing a rifle or shotgun to undergo a background check, which is currently only required for handgun purchases, and to store guns safely where they cannot be accessed by minors.Much of the package was crafted by Democrats nearly 15 months ago following a shooting at Oxford High School. But the bills saw little movement until Democrats won control of the Legislature from Republicans in last fall's elections. They've gained momentum after a gunman killed three people last month at Michigan State University, not far from the state Capitol.In Colorado, the Democratic-led Legislature was pursuing a variety of new gun restrictions after five people were killed last November at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs. After another shooting injured two administrators a Denver high school last week, Democratic majorities are pushing through hours of Republican filibusters to send several gun control bills to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.The bills would expand who can petition to temporarily remove a firearm from someone who poses a danger, raise the minimum age for purchasing a firearm from 18 to 21 and institute a three-day waiting period when buying a gun. While Polis supports those three bills, he has demurred from questions around a fourth bill that would ban semi-automatic firearms. That bill faces a steeper battle to become law.RED STATESRepublican-led Florida responded to a 2018 shooting that killed 14 students and three staff members at a Parkland school by passing laws that raised the gun-buying age to 21, imposed a three-day waiting period for purchases and authorized red-flag laws to temporarily remove guns from people. But that marked a bit of an exception for Republican states.In Texas, minority party Democrats have filed numerous gun-control bills after a shooter killed 19 children and two teachers last May at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde. Relatives of some of the victims have joined Democratic lawmakers at Capitol rallies urging action. Some proposals would raise the age for owning so-called assault weapons, limit firearm transfers among people and create requirements for safe firearm storage.But GOP state leaders have made clear from the start that these bills do not have the necessary votes to pass.Instead, Texas officials responded last summer with about $105 million for school safety and mental health initiatives. The Senate also passed a bill earlier this month that would require the reporting of court-mandated mental health hospitalizations to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System for people as young as 16. That bill now is pending in the House.Students from Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School in St. Louis, where a gunman killed two and injured seven others last fall, also have traveled to the Missouri Capitol to urge greater gun-control measures. But Democratic-sponsored bills to create a red-flag law allowing temporary gun removals have yet to receive a hearing in the Republican-led Legislature.Instead, the Legislature approved $20 million for safety grants to schools across the state in response to the shooting, and is considering more money for the program. A House committee also recently endorsed budget amendments that would provide several hundred thousand dollars for mental health care, art supplies and musical instruments at the school.___Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850294,Swiss seniors take government to European court over climate,"STRASBOURG, France (AP) — A group of Swiss retirees took their government to a top European court Wednesday over what they claim is its failure to take sufficient action on climate change.Lawyers and members of the group Senior Women for Climate Protection appeared before the European Court of Human Rights for a rare public hearing that activists say could mark a legal milestone in efforts to force governments to curb greenhouse gas emissions.The group, which counts around 2,000 members across Switzerland with an average age of 73, argues that older women's rights are especially infringed on because they are most affected by the extreme heat that will become more frequent due to global warming, which current Swiss climate policy contributes to.“It’s been proved that we older women are particularly sensitive (to climate change),"" said plaintiff Rosmarie Wydler-Waelti, 73, from Basel. ""We get sick a little bit faster due to heat waves than older men or other groups.”After exhausting domestic legal avenues, the group has taken its case to the Strasbourg, France-based tribunal in the hope of winning a ruling that applies to all signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights.“We are suing for our human right to life,"" said Lore Zablonier, a 78-year-old from Zurich who stood outside the court. ""With this case, we want to help spur politicians into action a little bit.”Lawyers for the Swiss government said they want the court to dismiss the case.“The plaintiffs are not sufficiently affected with the required intensity in their right to life for the application to be admissible,” said Alain Chablais, who represented the Swiss government at the hearing.“Switzerland is not alone (in being affected by global warming) and this problem cannot be solved by Switzerland alone,” he told The Associated Press.Georg Klingler, a climate campaigner with the environmental group Greenpeace that supports the case, said seeing the Swiss government having to defend its climate efforts before the court “is a very exciting moment.”Klingler noted that the complaint brought by the Swiss seniors is one of three related cases being heard by the court over the coming months and could set a legal precedent.“Those three cases will define how this very important court will get involved in the biggest threat to human rights that we see nowadays,” he said.A verdict is expected next year.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850295,Chairman says Gazprom close to maximum gas supply to China,"BO'AO, China (AP) — Russia's Gazprom is increasing gas supplies to China and expects soon to reach the maximum planned level through a Siberian pipeline, its chairman said Wednesday, highlighting Beijing's importance as his country's top export market in the face of Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.Gazprom is negotiating with China over a possible additional supply project across neighboring Mongolia, Viktor Zubkov said at a government-organized economic forum. He said the company is open to serving other Asian markets.Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s government sees Moscow as a diplomatic partner in opposing U.S. domination of global affairs and has refused to criticized its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing has called for a cease-fire and negotiations but not a Russian withdrawal.China's imports from Russia, mostly oil and gas, surged 31.3% over a year ago in January and February to $18.6 billion. That helps President Vladimir Putin offset lost revenue after the United States, Europe and Japan blocked or limited imports.“Russia is increasing its gas supply to China,” Zubkov said at the Boao Forum for Asia. “The gas supply through the Power of Siberia pipeline will soon reach the contracted annual volume of 38 billion cubic meters,” or 1.3 trillion cubic feet.Gazprom is negotiating with state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. on a gas supply project through Mongolia that is designed to carry 50 billion cubic meters (1.8 trillion cubic feet), according to Zubkov.“Russia is open to cooperation with other Asian countries in clean energy supplies,"" Zubkov said.Also at the forum, the deputy chairman of the Chinese Cabinet's planning agency said Beijing will balance its plans to reduce carbon emissions with its need for energy security. China is the biggest emitter of climate-changing industrial gases.The ruling Communist Party stepped up mining of coal and construction of coal-fired generating stations after power shortages in late 2021 caused blackouts and forced factories in some areas to shut down temporarily. Xi said in 2020 that carbon emissions would peak by 2030 but announced no target level.“We will actively and prudently promote carbon peaking and carbon neutrality,"" said Zhao Chenxin of the National Development and Reform Commission. “However, we must balance its relations with energy security and development.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850296,Biden: World 'turning the tide' after backslide on democracy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday offered an optimistic outlook on the health of democracy worldwide, declaring that leaders are “turning the tide” in stemming a yearslong backslide of democratic institutions.Opening his second democracy summit, Biden looked to spotlight hopeful advancements over the past year despite Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine and U.S. tensions with China over its military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.The president cited signs of progress across the globe, from Angola's effort to create an independent judiciary, Croatia's move to boost government transparency and the Dominican Republic's anti-corruption steps. At home, Biden pointed to his stalled push for voting protections in Congress as evidence of his administration's commitment to support democracy.“Today, we can say, with pride, democracies of the world are getting stronger, not weaker,"" Biden said. “Autocracies of the world are getting weaker, not stronger. That’s a direct result of all of us.""The summits, which Biden promised as a candidate in 2020, have become an important piece of his administration's effort to try to build deeper alliances and nudge autocratic-leaning nations toward at least modest changes.He said the U.S. will spend $690 million bolstering democracy programs — supporting everything from free and independent media to free and fair elections — around the world. He said he also wanted to use the summit to foster discussion about the use of technology to “advance democratic governance” and ensure such technology is “not used to undermine it.”The U.S. also signed a joint statement with nine other countries to deepen international cooperation on countering the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware. Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom signed on the agreement.About 40 participants had signed on, as of Wednesday, to a set of guiding principles for how the governments should use surveillance technology, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement before its formal announcement. The guidelines are to be published before the close of the summit on Thursday.The White House announced plans for the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency to partner with nine other countries to work on protecting human rights and other activist groups that are at risk of facing transnational cyber attacks. The UK is co-leading the effort and Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Japan, New Zealand and Norway have also signed on.Earlier this week, Biden signed an executive order restricting the U.S. government's use of commercial spyware tools that have been used to surveil human rights activists, journalists and dissidents around the world.Since Biden's first democracy summit in December 2021, countries have emerged from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia invaded Ukraine, the largest-scale war in Europe since World War II.Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, pushed back at those suggesting it was time for a negotiated settlement with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. “We should get rid of the illusion that compromising with evil can give something to freedom, and enemies of democracy must lose,” Zelenskyy told the summit.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the invasion was a jolting moment for the world's democracies.“For decades, the idea of war in Europe seemed unthinkable. But we were wrong as Russia’s brutalization of Ukraine has shown we cannot assume that democracy, freedom and security are givens, that they are eternal,” Rutte said.Kenya's president, William Ruto, said building democracy was was essential to the growth of developing nations. Ruto was the winner last year of Kenya's close presidential race in which opposition candidate Raila Odinga had alleged irregularities. Kenya’s Supreme Court unanimously rejected the challenges.“This is our path to sustainable development,” Ruto said.The U.S. hosted the last summit on its own. This time, it recruited four co-hosts — Costa Rica, the Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia — after ambassadors from China and Russia criticized the first summit and accused Biden of causing a global divide with a Cold War mentality.Still, some countries would rather not get between Washington and Beijing, an increasingly important economic and military player.Pakistan announced, as it did in 2021, that it received an invitation but would skip the summit, a move seen in part as an effort by the impoverished Islamic nation to assuage longtime ally China, which was not invited.Xu Xueyuan, the charge d’affaires of China's embassy in Washington, on Wednesday called the summit “at odds with the spirit of democracy.”“The U.S. draws an ideological line between countries, and through its narrative of ‘democracy versus authoritarianism,' it has formed factions and caused divisions in the international community,” she said.The Biden administration has also expanded its invitation list. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gambia, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Lichtenstein, Mauritania, Mozambique and Tanzania were invited this year after being left off the list in 2021.The first day of the summit was convened in a virtual format and will be followed on Thursday by hybrid gatherings in each of the host countries.Costa Rica will focus on the role of youth in democratic systems. The Dutch are taking on media freedom. South Korea is looking at corruption. Zambia is centering on free and fair electionsThe U.S. is no stranger to the challenges facing democracies, including deep polarization and pervasive misinformation.Lies spread about the 2020 presidential election by then-President Donald Trump and his supporters have convinced a majority of Republicans that Biden was not legitimately elected, normalized harassment and death threats against election officials, and been used to justify efforts in Republican-controlled legislatures to adopt new voting restrictions.Later this year, the Supreme Court will rule in a case from Alabama that voting rights advocates fear could virtually dismantle the nearly 60-year-old Voting Rights Act. Congressional efforts to shore up that federal law and increase voting access have failed.Biden came into office vowing that human rights and democracy would play significant roles in his approach to foreign policy. But he's faced criticism from some human rights activists for being too soft on Saudi Arabia and Egypt over their human rights records. The administration sees both nations as important partners in bringing stability to the Middle East.More recently, Biden administration officials have been at odds with close ally Israel as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tries to push forward a far-reaching judicial overhaul that the U.S. worries will diminish Israel's democracy.Netanyahu, in remarks at the summit's opening session, said Israel remained a “robust democracy” in the midst of “a very intensive public debate.”“Democracy means the will of the people as expressed by a majority, and it also means protection of civil rights, individual rights. It’s the balance between the two,” he said.Later Wednesday, Biden hosted President Alberto Fernández of Argentina, a summit participant, for talks.___Associated Press writers Munir Ahmed in Islamabad, Tom Verdin in Sacramento, California, Daniel Politi in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Seung Min Kim, Ellen Knickmeyer, and Colleen Long contributed to this report.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850297,Philippine police seize large stash of drugs in tea bags,"BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) — Philippine police seized more than 500 kilograms (more than half a ton) of suspected methamphetamine concealed in tea bags Wednesday and arrested a suspected Chinese drug dealer in a northern mountain resort city, police officials said.The drug seizure in Baguio city had an estimated street value of 4 billion pesos ($74 million) and was one of the largest in recent years, officials said.A drug syndicate apparently hid the suspected drugs, locally known as shabu, in Baguio, a popular tourism destination known for its mountain scenery and pine trees, and not in metropolitan Manila due to an ongoing anti-drugs crackdown in the capital region, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos and police officials said.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in June, has vowed to press on with his predecessor's crackdown against illegal drugs, which left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead, but said it would be done differently and focus more on rehabilitating drug dependents.Under former President Rodrigo Duterte, more than 6,000 mostly poor suspected drug dealers were killed in reported clashes with law enforcers. The widespread killings alarmed Western governments, including the United States, and sparked an International Criminal Court investigation as a possible crime against humanity.Duterte had denied condoning extrajudicial killings in his so-called war on drugs but had openly threatened to kill suspects until his final years in power.Police say there have been considerably fewer killings of drug suspects under Marcos, but human rights groups have still expressed alarm over the continued killings under the government crackdown and asked Marcos to cooperate with the ICC in investigating the killings that took place when Duterte was president and a longtime mayor of southern Davao city.After the ICC rejected a Philippine government appeal to stop investigating the Duterte-era killings, Marcos said Tuesday that his administration would cut off contact with the Hague-based court.“That ends all our involvement with the ICC because we can no longer appeal,” Marcos told reporters when asked to comment on the decision of the ICC appeals chamber. “At this point, we essentially are disengaging from any contact, from any communication, I guess, with the ICC.”When he was still president, Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC's founding treaty in 2019 after the court launched a preliminary examination into the thousands of killings under his anti-drugs crackdown.Critics said then that Duterte's move was an attempt to evade accountability. The ICC prosecutor, however, said the court still has jurisdiction over crimes alleged while the Philippines was still a member of the ICC, a court of last resort for crimes that countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute themselves.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850298,Sri Lanka slashes fuel prices in welcome relief amid crisis,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka’s government on Wednesday announced significant cuts in fuel prices, providing welcome relief for many after a year of shortages and skyrocketing prices amid the country’s worst economic crisis.Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara told reporters different categories of petrol and diesel will be sold at prices from 8% to 26% lower starting Wednesday midnight. He said the price reduction is in line with an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which includes adjusting fuel subsidies and prices based on production costs and global oil prices.Sri Lanka earlier this month secured approval of a $2.9 billion IMF bailout program a key step in its recovery from a crisis brought on by the pandemic and other troubles. Last year, severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel led to street protests that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.In a related development, petroleum industry trade unions opposing a government decision to give licenses to three companies from the United States, Australia and China to run fuel stations in Sri Lanka were threatening to strike.The unions are protesting a plan to partially privatize government-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corp., which now only faces competition from Indian Oil Corp. as competition.People rushing to beat a possible strike lined up near fuel stations, fearing supply would run out. Wijesekara said even though the strike had caused some disruptions, the military was helping to ensure normal operations. Any shortages were due to dealers not ordering enough fuel because they were anticipating a price cut as part of a monthly revision in April.The government plans to get out of business and privatize key semi-state-owned companies to raise revenue to build its reserves and resume payments of foreign debt.Some opposition political parties and trade unions oppose the idea, contending that selling off state resources might compromise national interests.Last year, Sri Lanka suspended repayment of about $7 billion of its foreign debt that was due in 2022. Sri Lanka's creditors have agreed to restructure its debt, in addition to the IMF bailout.President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that giving up the IMF program would compel cash-strapped Sri Lanka to repay $6 billion-$7 billion a year until 2029.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific news coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850299,Asian stocks mixed after Wall St rally as bank fears ease,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday following a rally on Wall Street as worries over banks following the collapses of several lenders in recent weeks eased further.Forceful actions by regulators have helped to calm markets as investors have turned their focus to how central banks might adjust their interest rate policies to reflect persisting worries over how higher rates might affect lenders.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.8% to 27,662.54. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.9% to 7,110.20. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.2% to 2,449.45. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.7% to 20,048.99, while the Shanghai Composite declined 0.2% to 3,232.39.“Fading concern about the banking sector is also supporting risk assets as the end of the month and quarter approaches,” Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a commentary.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 1.4% to 4,027.81, for its fourth gain in the last five days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1% to 32,717.60, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.8% to 11,926.24.The month has being dominated by worries about banks and whether the industry is cracking under the pressure of much higher interest rates.But by Wednesday, a measure of fear among stock investors on Wall Street had fallen to nearly where it was on March 8, the day before Silicon Valley Bank’s customers suddenly yanked out $42 billion in a panicked dash. It became the second-largest U.S. bank failure in history and sparked harsher scrutiny of banks around the world.“I think the market has been very much focused on a set of extremes, like what we saw in the COVID period, where it was either: The sky is falling, or everything is euphoric,” said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments.Regulators in Switzerland brokered a takeover of Credit Suisse by its bigger rival, UBS. UBS said Wednesday it’s bringing back its former CEO, Sergio Ermotti, to help it absorb Credit Suisse. Ermotti led a turnaround at UBS following the 2008 financial crisis.On Wall Street, nearly all of the financial stocks in the S&P 500 rose Wednesday. Some banks hit hardest in recent weeks rose sharply. First Republic Bank jumped 5.6%, and PacWest Bancorp. gained 5.1%.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced the sale of much of Silicon Valley Bank's assets early this week. Regulators have also announced programs to help banks raise cash and indicated support for depositors in case of crisis.The path ahead for the Federal Reserve and other central banks has become much more difficult because of the banking industry’s struggles. Typically, the still-high inflation seen around the world would call for even higher interest rates. But that would risk more pressure on banks, which could pull back on lending and squeeze the economy.Traders are largely betting the Fed will have to cut rates as soon as this summer, something that can act like steroids for markets. That's helped Big Tech and other high-growth stocks in particular, which are seen as some of the biggest beneficiaries of lower rates.But the Fed has hinted it sees one more hike before holding rates steady through this year and many Wall Street professionals take it at its word, saying rate cuts would likely come more quickly only if the economy is in serious trouble.For now, a resilient job market has been holding up the economy, even as parts of it weaken under higher interest rates. Most of Wall Street will soon begin reporting how much profit they made in the first three months of the year under such conditions.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell 29 cents to $72.68 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard declined 39 cents to $77.89 a barrel.In currency trading, the U.S. dollar slipped to 132.68 Japanese yen from 132.75 yen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850300,"May Madness: This March, FAU coach has Owls on cusp of title","Dusty May's March Madness run with FAU likely was one few saw coming.May had, to be fair, not much better than minimal name recognition when he took the Florida Atlantic job five years ago. That wasn’t the case with almost all the other FAU coaches over the years, names like Mike Jarvis and Matt Doherty and Michael Curry and Sidney Green and Rex Walters.Curry had been an NBA coach and played for years in the league. Green was an NBA lottery pick. Doherty coached at North Carolina, his alma mater, and Notre Dame. Jarvis had been at three other schools and coached a high schooler named Patrick Ewing. Walters was a Big 8 star at Kansas and played in the NBA.And their FAU resumes don’t compare — some don’t come even close — to what May has done.A school that used to be known for coaches looking to rebound now has a team headed to the Final Four, led by a coach whose claim to fame when he entered coaching was that he was a student manager for Bob Knight at Indiana.“I think Coach May obviously has done an incredible job building this program from humble beginnings,” FAU athletic director Brian White said. “I think it is a great sign for the whole university and the athletic department that FAU is a place where you can come and build something special.”The Final Four — FAU (35-3) plays San Diego State (31-6) on Saturday in Houston, before Miami (29-7) plays UConn (29-8) in the other national semifinal — is rarefied air for the Owls. Truly. Before this year, the last time the Owls were in the final four of any postseason tournament was 2002, and that was the ASun Conference Tournament.Think about that. Go two decades without so much as a trip to a conference final four, and end up this year in the Final Four. It's a crazy ride orchestrated by the only coach to win 100 games at FAU, someone who hadn't played in the NBA or been a head coach anywhere else, big-time or even small-time.“Florida Atlantic is a new university,” May said. “It’s been booming before I got here. One of the reasons I took it was because it was the right place at the right time, and it’s growing exponentially. So we’ve talked about it. We’ve just never had that moment as a university.”Until now.There’s no Division I men’s basketball team in the country that has a better record this season than FAU. No team with more wins. No team with a longer winning streak. No team with a better home record, either.All that would have been hard to envision five years ago. Or five months ago, for that matter.The excitement on FAU’s campus was felt most at the campus bookstore Tuesday. The Owls’ Final Four apparel arrived late that morning, and students, alumni and fans walked around the store looking for their March Madness gear.Some students stood on FaceTime with their parents, asking what size t-shirts to bring home to them.“Gotta spend some money here and support,” Chas Kaplan said as he checked out with a couple red and grey shirts.And he's not even a student. Kaplan’s aunt works at the university, and he traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to FAU to tour of the school’s athletic department and support the Owls’ tournament run.FAU has tended to be a school where coaches go with hopes of winning, yes, but also reviving their own careers. It worked out for all sides during Lane Kiffin’s three years as football coach at the school; the Owls won two Conference USA championships and Kiffin landed the Ole Miss job. He’s been the exception to the rule; FAU wasn’t exactly a springboard back to the biggest levels of big-time for other coaches who made their way to Boca Raton.It didn’t work for Willie Taggart, who was fired at Florida State and then got fired last fall by FAU after being unable to come close to matching Kiffin’s success. The jury is out on Tom Herman, the former Houston football coach who’ll coach his first game for the Owls this fall. Kiffin arrived with the burden of expectation and delivered. Taggart didn't. Time will tell on Herman.“At Florida Atlantic, we will see great things happen,” Kiffin said on the day he got hired at FAU. “For us to do the impossible, we have to see the invisible.”May saw the invisible. He has done the improbable. He's two wins away from the impossible.He arrived at FAU five years ago for his first chance at being a head coach and inherited — to be polite — less-than-stellar facilities and a program with almost no basketball history to speak of.The facilities are better now, with more upgrades on the way in the coming months. The Owls' home arena, which can hold about 3,000 fans if the fire marshal isn't looking, might sell out next season. And some people might not know how to pronounce Boca Raton — it’s Ra-tone, by the way — but certainly more people in the basketball world now know what’s capable at FAU.“The brand enhancement is just phenomenal and that’s the reason we have Division I athletics, to be the front porch for the university,” White said. “Then exposure that we’ve gotten during this run for the whole university, you just can’t buy that.”___AP Sports Writer Alanis Thames in Boca Raton, Florida contributed.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850301,De la Fuente under pressure early as Spain’s new coach,"MADRID (AP) — Two games in, and the Luis de la Fuente era in Spain is already being questioned.A lackluster win and a disappointing loss were enough to put the new coach under the spotlight.Spain needed two late goals in a hard-fought 3-0 win over Norway to open its qualifying campaign for the 2024 European Championship on Saturday, then fell 2-0 at Scotland on Tuesday after another poor performance.De la Fuente’s Spain showed some of the same problems from the past — lots of possession and few scoring chances — leaving the coach under pressure to show some significant improvement the next time the team plays in June in the Final Four of the Nations League.“It was a painful loss,” De la Fuente said after the Scotland match. “Analyzing the game now, we feel like we did enough good things to deserve a different result, but there is a lot to improve.”The 61-year-old De la Fuente replaced Luis Enrique after the team’s elimination by Morocco in the round of 16 of the World Cup in Qatar. He took over while being relatively unknown in Spain after spending years coaching the nation’s youth squads. He came in as the latest attempt to breathe new life into Spain’s “tiki-taka” possession-based style that again looked outdated at last year’s World Cup.Luis Enrique had failed to get his team to translate the tons of passes into goals, and De la Fuente had arrived pledging to make scoring a priority for the national team going forward. He brought in some of the nation’s top strikers while revamping the squad.Spain managed only three shots on target against Scotland — the same as its opponent — despite having nearly 70% of possession. It was Spain’s first loss to the Scots in 39 years, and its first defeat in European qualifying since 2014. The result left La Roja three points behind first-place Scotland in Group A of Euro 2024 qualifying.“We need to learn from this match, but the overall plan doesn’t change,” said De la Fuente, who made eight changes to the squad that started against Norway. “We have to work hard to try to win the remaining matches.”Spain’s next qualifying game isn’t until September, when it visits Georgia. It will first face Italy in the Nations League on June 15 in the Netherlands, when the De la Fuente will be under heightened scrutiny.“Unfortunately there’s a long time until we play again,” De la Fuente said. “Certainly we will do better in the future.”The criticism had already started, though.“Disaster,” said a headline by the sports daily Marca. “What’s the plan?”“Spain fails to make the cut in Glasgow and will have to recover in September,” wrote the Mundo Deportivo sports daily.Spain midfielder Rodri tried to downplay the team’s early setbacks.“Please, let’s not start with the doubts already,” he said. “We are working hard and a lot of good things have been done. We all win and lose together.”The pressure is on, though, and the De la Fuente era is already in jeopardy.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850302,SVB collapse and Credit Suisse failure: Lessons for Taiwan banks and regulators,"With global markets abuzz with the news of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) on March 10 and the subsequent failure of Credit Suisse (CS) on March 20, it is easy to be alarmed and subscribe to at least some commentary that sees this as the start of a new global financial crisis.
U.S. regulators announced the takeover of SVB when depositors rushed to withdraw tens of billions of dollars.
What was SVB?
SVB was not a megabank of the likes of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs, but it was a major player and successful in the tech sector as the 16th largest U.S. bank with billions of dollars in deposits.
What went wrong at SVB?
In hindsight, bad investments led to its collapse. SVB had to invest the billions of dollars of deposits that it had on its books, deposited by a then flourishing U.S. tech industry.










Traditional lending was a limited avenue for SVB, so SVB chose to invest billions of dollars in long-term U.S. treasury bonds, generally considered safe, modest, and prudent investments, when U.S. interest rates were at record lows in 2021.
However, long-term bonds only pay out at maturity, and they lost value as the Fed began to raise interest rates in 2022 to fight inflation. SVB had to sell the bonds at a staggering US$1.8 billion loss, which caused panic among investors and depositors. This led to a sharp sell-off of the bank’s shares, and a run by depositors.
SVB’s collapse also highlights the almost unique behavior of SVB’s customers, venture capital firms, startups, and wealthy tech sector individuals to use SVB exclusively as “their bank”, thereby creating their own form of what is known as concentration risk.
What was CS?
CS's story stretches back to July 5, 1856, and its original purpose was to finance the expansion of the railroad network as well as further industrialize Switzerland.
At the time of its purchase by UBS Group AG (UBS), the largest Swiss-based multinational investment bank and financial services company, on March 19, CS was the second-largest financial institution in Switzerland.
What went wrong at CS?
Battered by years of scandals and losses, CS had been fighting a crisis of confidence for months. The collapse of SVB and concerns of a new global financial crisis saw CS needing a $54 billion lifeline from the Swiss central bank on March 16 to shore up its capital after a slump in its shares and bonds. The now generally accepted view is that UBS was prompted to buy CS following concerns relating to CS expressed by the Swiss government and the Swiss financial regulator. Some commentators also expressed that UBS feared a global banking crisis if it failed to buy CS.
It was surprising that CS had continued for so long. The failings of CS included a criminal conviction for allowing drug dealers to launder money in Bulgaria, entanglement in a Mozambique corruption case, a spying scandal involving a former employee and an executive, and a massive leak of client data to the media. The fines and sanctions from global regulators were so frequent and numerous as to warrant an entirely separate article. The more interesting story will be how UBS integrates CS into its business.
Impact on Taiwan?
The collapse of SVB had little impact on Taiwan and, according to the Financial Services Commission (FSC), Taiwan’s principal financial regulator, Taiwanese insurance and securities firms had no exposure to SVB. Taiwanese trust funds are said to have had some NT$300 million (US$10 million) in exposure to SVB, but this is not considered to be a substantial amount and will not impact Taiwanese investors.
Similarly, the failure of CS had little impact on Taiwan. The FSC confirmed the domestic banking sector's exposure to CS was limited and no banks held CS’s high-risk AT1 bonds. In Taiwan, the total amount of exposure to CS was estimated to be NT$155 billion (US$5.08 billion), including NT$47 billion in the banking sector and NT$108 billion in the insurance sector. Certainly, larger numbers than in SVB’s case, but CS was a global bank, and this is simply an increase in exposure to UBS.
Could these events happen in Taiwan?
At present, a collapse or failure of a Taiwanese bank, in the manner of SVB or CS, would be unlikely. Taiwanese banks are highly regulated by the FSC, and they undergo regular in-house inspections almost every two years. Taiwan’s banks are quite conservative. There are obvious geopolitical risks that affect Taiwan, but not any single Taiwanese bank.
The FSC plans to conduct stress tests on Taiwan’s banks over the first half of 2023 with the results to be published in June. It is unclear if the results of these tests will be publicly reported.
Taiwan is certainly overbanked, with some 38 major banks in operation at present, and there seems little appetite amongst the banks for mergers or acquisitions. Taiwanese banks seem more interested in creating payment systems, backed by credit cards, for their retail clients, as opposed to creating high-risk products or being involved in scandals and corruption.
In terms of deposit protection, Taiwan has its own Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC). The CDIC is the only institution in Taiwan exclusively in charge of managing the deposit insurance system and serves as an integral part of Taiwan’s financial safety net.
Conclusion
We are unlikely to see a Taiwanese bank collapse in the manner of SVB, especially as no one bank serves only one industry or sector. We are also unlikely to see the failure of a Taiwanese bank in the manner of CS. There are regulatory guardrails in place, a vigilant regulator, and a generally more conservative environment. There will be lessons to learn from the SVB collapse and CS failure and it is certain that Taiwan will watch and learn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850346,"Taiwanese more interested in tax rebate, baboon than Ma's trip to China","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese internet users appear more interested in Taiwan's NT$6,000 tax rebate and saga of an escaped baboon, than former President Ma Ying-jeou's (馬英九) trip to China, based on Google Trends.Ma is currently in China, making him the first former or current leader of Taiwan to visit the communist country. On Tuesday (March 28), the second day of his trip, he visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, China.While speaking to the media outside the mausoleum, Ma said that ""People on both sides are ethnic Chinese and are descendants of the Yan and Huang emperors."" He also called on the two sides of the strait to ""pursue peace, avoid war, and dedicate themselves to reinvigorating the Chinese spirit,"" which is the responsibility of ""Chinese people on the two sides.""However, recent polls show that citizens of Taiwan consider themselves Taiwanese, while the percentage who identify exclusively as Chinese is in the single digits.Peaking in popularity at the start of Ma's trip was the story of a baboon that had been on the loose in Taoyuan City for 16 days. On Monday (March 27), it was captured but soon died after it was shot in the chest by a hunter.The hunter is facing criminal charges of violating the Wildlife Conservation Act (野生動物保育法), while Taoyuan Department of Agriculture officials also face scrutiny for their handling of the incident. Officials bowed at the baboon's body and apologized to the public for the firing of live ammunition at the animal and the posing of staff members for photos rather than tending to its urgent medical needs.Many more Taiwanese were focused on the fact that the registration website for Taiwan's NT$6,000 tax surplus payment on Monday opened to all eligible Taiwanese and foreign residents. Payments for those who registered on the online system are expected to receive the funds in their bank accounts as soon as April 6, while the surplus payments will also be available at ATMs on April 10 and can be picked up at the post office on April 17.Austin H. Wang, an assistant professor at the Department of Political Science, University of Nevada Las Vegas pointed out on Twitter that while Ma was talking about how ""Chinese people"" on the two sides of the strait should strive for peace, Taiwanese people appear to be more concerned about the escaped baboon and the NT$6,000 cash rebate.Wang included a screenshot from Google Trends which showed that on Monday the search term ""6000"" reached the peak level of popularity of 100. Meanwhile, the term ""baboons"" had more of a flat trajectory, never reaching a popularity rating of 25, while the term ""May Ying-jeou"" was lower, still hovering in the single digits in terms of popularity.Wang told Taiwan News that Ma's influence on the cross-strait relationship and public opinion of him is low now because he is ""no longer the presidential candidate, and he has no direct influence on the next KMT nomination."" It is for these reasons that ""Taiwanese people pay more attention to other issues,"" said Wang.#Taiwan former president Ma said in China today that ""Chinese people on both sides should work together to pursue peace"". Meanwhile, Taiwanese people care a lot more about the strayed baboon and the NTD6000 that the gov issued this week.https://t.co/df4DfzreZ9 pic.twitter.com/uwOqNocLmd",2023/03/29,1334,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850351,"California reparations amount, if any, left to politicians","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The leader of California's first-in-the-nation reparations task force on Wednesday said it won't take a stance on how much the state should compensate Black residents whom economists estimate may be owed more than $800 billion for decades of over-policing, disproportionate incarceration and housing discrimination.The $800 billion is more than 2.5 times California's $300 billion annual budget and does not include a recommended $1 million per older Black resident for health disparities that have shortened their average life span. Nor does the figure count compensating people for property unjustly taken by the government or devaluing Black businesses, two other harms the task force says the state perpetuated.“All forms of discrimination should be considered in reparations,"" Thomas Craemer, a public policy professor at the University of Connecticut, told the panel Wednesday. ""The task force should feel free to go beyond our loss estimates, and determine what the right amount would be.”Black residents may not receive cash payments anytime soon, if ever, because the state Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom will ultimately decide whether any reparations are to be paid. The task force faces a July 1 deadline to recommend the forms of compensation to be awarded and who should receive it, along with other remedies to repair the harm.But the panel’s chair, Kamilah Moore, said Wednesday it’s up to the state Legislature to ascribe a restitution amount based on the methodology economists recommended, and which the task force approved on Wednesday.“The task force is pretty much done regarding the compensation component. Our task was to create a methodology for calculation for various forms of compensation that correspond with our findings,” she said in an e-mail.For those who support reparations, the staggering $800 billion estimate underscores the long-lasting harm Black Americans have endured, even in a state that never officially endorsed slavery.Several people who gave public comment Wednesday spoke of the urgent need to pay Black Americans for all that was taken from them.“My family came from the South because they were running for their lives, they were fearful of being lynched, just for voting,"" said Charlton Curry of Sacramento, California, who discusses reparations on his Big C Sports podcast.“Cash payments are necessary. Money talks,” he said, noting that white people benefited from free U.S. government land through the 1862 Homestead Act, and Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II and Jewish Holocaust victims received reparations.Critics pin their opposition partly on the fact that California was never a slave state and say current taxpayers should not be responsible for damage linked to events that germinated hundreds of years ago.Bob Woodson, a prominent Black conservative, calls reparations impractical, controversial and counterproductive.“No amount of money could ever ‘make right’ the evil of slavery, and it is insulting to suggest that it could,” he said in an email to The Associated Press, adding that Black communities relied on faith and family to build thriving communities following slavery. “Some of these communities only began coming apart after we lost sight of these values, which also hold the key to these communities’ restoration.”Financial redress is just one part of the package being considered. Other proposals include paying incarcerated inmates market value for their labor, establishing free wellness centers and planting more trees in Black communities, banning cash bail, and adopting a K-12 Black studies curriculum.Reparations talks are stalled at the federal level, but the idea flourished in California as well as U.S. cities and counties following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. Newsom signed legislation in 2020 creating the reparations task force.An advisory committee in San Francisco has recommended $5 million payouts, as well as guaranteed income of at least $97,000 and personal debt forgiveness for qualifying individuals. Supervisors expressed general support, but stopped short of endorsing specific proposals. They'll take up the issue later this year.U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday said from Ghana that she and President Joe Biden support a reparations study, but the president has so far sidestepped calls from advocates to create a federal commission.The $800 billion estimate in California includes $246 billion to compensate eligible Black Californians whose neighborhoods were subjected to aggressive policing and prosecution in the “war on drugs” from 1970 to 2020. That would translate to nearly $125,000 for every person who qualifies, the consultants wrote.The numbers are approximate, based on modeling and population estimates. The economists also included $569 billion to make up for the discriminatory practice of redlining in housing loans. That would amount to about $223,000 per eligible resident from 1933 to 1977. The $569 billion is considered a maximum and assumes all 2.5 million Californians who identify as Black would be eligible.But they won't all be. People must meet residency and other requirements for monetary compensation. They also must be descendants of enslaved and freed Black people in the U.S. as of the 19th century, which leaves out Black immigrants.The task force on Wednesday also endorsed methodologies for devaluation of black businesses and unjust property takings. Those methodologies have no numbers due to a lack of data.——————AP White House reporter Chris Megerian contributed from Accra, Ghana——————This story has been corrected to reflect that the task force is not required to recommend specific compensation amounts in its July 1 report to the Legislature. It is required to make recommendations on what form compensation should take and who should be eligible.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850352,Edmunds: BMW-X1 vs Mercedes-Benz GLB,"Extra- small luxury SUVs are a great way to cruise around in luxury without paying an excessive amount. As an example, check out the Mercedes-Benz GLB. It has been one of Edmunds’ top performers in its class since it was introduced in 2020. It sports distinctive boxy styling, excellent technology and a comfortable ride. But in today’s highly competitive market, there’s always a new model aiming for the top spot. The GLB’s main rival, the BMW X1, was redesigned for 2023. The little Bimmer received updated styling, a roomier interior and many of BMW’s top-notch technology features. Which one is the better buy? Edmunds’ experts compared them to find out.POWER AND FUEL ECONOMY Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines power both luxury SUVs. The X1’s 241-horsepower powerplant is not only more powerful than the GLB’s 221-horsepower mill, but it’s also more fuel-efficient. With all-wheel drive, the X1 delivers an EPA-estimated 28 mpg in combined city/highway driving, 3 more than the all-wheel-drive GLB’s 25 mpg. When equipped with front-wheel drive, which the BMW doesn’t offer, the GLB’s rating of 27 mpg combined still doesn’t top the X1.The results were closer when the Edmunds test team drove all-wheel-drive versions of both SUVs on its real-world test route. The X1 averaged 27 mpg, a tad more than the GLB’s average of 26 mpg. At the track, the extra oomph in the BMW showed. It accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in a brisk 5.9 seconds, besting the GLB’s 6.5-second sprint. That’s not a huge difference but the X1 does feel a bit more eager when you need a burst of speed.Winner: BMW X1TECHNOLOGY AND INTERIOR SPACE When it comes to standard tech, the X1 sports wireless smartphone connectivity, a digital instrument panel and a 10.7-inch center touchscreen. The GLB’s standard dual monitors are only 7 inches. Wired smartphone connectivity is your only option in the Mercedes. Both SUVs come standard with only a few basic advanced driver aids.As for optional tech, both SUVs provide a wide variety of advanced driver aids. But unlike the GLB, the X1 offers a drive system that allows hands-free driving at low highway speeds. For a cost, the GLB’s tiny standard dual screens can be upgraded to larger ones about the size of the BMW’s.Passenger space is relatively even, but the X1 has 3.7 more cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row. Although, the GLB offers an optional third row for families needing seating for seven. It’s small, however, and suitable for children only.Winner: BMW X1DRIVING AND COMFORT As with most BMWs, the X1 is more fun to drive than most of its rivals, including the GLB. It’s quicker, has sharper steering and takes corners with more confidence. When you’re puttering around town, however, the Mercedes is the smoother of the two. The X1’s engine stop-start system is rough when restarting and its transmission can sometimes stumble during slow-speed driving.Mercedes vehicles are known for comfort, and the GLB isn’t any different. It provides a soft ride, comfortable seats and two features the BMW doesn’t offer — ventilated front seats and real leather upholstery. The X1’s seats and ride are praiseworthy but on the firmer side, especially if you opt for the M Sport package that includes a firmer suspension.Winner: Mercedes-Benz GLBPRICING AND VALUE The GLB’s starting price of $40,950 is practically the same as the X1’s starting price of $40,095. However, the X1 comes standard with all-wheel drive, which costs an extra $2,000 in the Mercedes. Besides the X1’s larger dual monitors, standard features in both SUVs are similar, and each offers a long list of optional features and packages that can quickly inflate the price. If the standard engine isn’t potent enough, the 302-horsepower AMG GLB 35 will please your inner speed demon for a starting price of $52,650. A more powerful X1 isn’t available.Both rivals boast excellent build quality, but a keen eye will notice that the BMW uses fewer hard plastics inside. Limited warranties are identical, four years or 50,000 miles. Although BMW generously includes three years or 36,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance.Winner: BMW X1EDMUNDS SAYS: Each luxury SUV has a lot to offer, and you can’t go wrong with either highly rated model. But between these two rivals, the BMW X1 takes the win thanks to its value and standard tech, plus a more powerful and efficient engine._______This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.Michael Cantu is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Instagram.___Eds.: An earlier version of this story was published with photographs from a previous Behind the Wheel.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850353,"Russia stops sharing missile test info with US, opens drills","MOSCOW (AP) — Russia will no longer give the U.S. advance notice about its missile tests as envisioned under a nuclear pact the Kremlin has suspended, a senior Moscow diplomat said Wednesday, as its military rolled missile launchers across Siberia in a show of the country’s massive nuclear capability amid fighting in Ukraine.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies that Moscow has halted all information exchanges with Washington under the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the U.S. after suspending its participation in it last month.Along with the data about the current state of the countries' nuclear forces routinely released every six months in compliance with the New START treaty, the parties also have exchanged advance warnings about test launches and deployments of their nuclear weapons. Such notices have been an essential element of strategic stability for decades, allowing Russia and the United States to correctly interpret each other's moves and make sure that neither country mistakes a test launch for a missile attack.The termination of information exchanges under the pact marks yet another attempt by the Kremlin to discourage the West from ramping up its support for Ukraine by pointing to Russia's massive nuclear arsenal. In recent days, President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to the territory of Moscow's ally Belarus.Putin suspended the New START treaty last month, saying Russia can’t accept U.S. inspections of its nuclear sites under the agreement at a time when Washington and its NATO allies have openly declared Moscow’s defeat in Ukraine as their goal. Moscow emphasized that it wasn’t withdrawing from the pact altogether and would continue to respect the caps on nuclear weapons the treaty set.It wasn’t immediately clear whether Ryabkov’s statement indicated Moscow’s intention to terminate all warnings about missile tests or just those envisioned by the New START treaty. Moscow and Washington have exchanged notifications about test launches of ballistic missiles since the Cold War era, and the Foreign Ministry said last month that Russia will keep issuing them in line with a 1988 U.S.-Soviet agreement.“There will be no notifications at all,” Ryabkov said in remarks reported by Russian news agencies when asked if Moscow would also stop issuing notices about planned missile tests. “All notifications, all kinds of notifications, all activities within the framework of the treaty will be suspended and will not be conducted regardless of what position the U.S. may take.”U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said the Biden administration was aware of Ryabkov’s comments but it has not ""received any notice indicating a change.”He added that Washington has “across-the-board concerns about Russia’s reckless behavior as it relates to the New START treaty.”Heather Williams, director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank, said Russia's rhetoric was concerning but fits a pattern of behavior related to Ukraine.”They use nuclear weapons to turn up the volume on a lot of their other activities, and arms control treaties are just the latest way for Russia to try to advance its goals in Ukraine,” she said.Of more concern, Williams said, is that the collapse of New START has caused a severe reduction in communications between Washington and Moscow, which could be dangerous. “One of the biggest tragedies of the breakdown in New START is the loss of the communication channel,” she said.Pavel Podvig, an expert on Russian nuclear forces, tweeted that Ryabkov's reference to the termination of notices in the context of the New START indicated that Russia will keep issuing them in conformity with the 1988 pact.Ryabkov's announcement followed U.S. officials' statement that Moscow and Washington have stopped sharing biannual nuclear weapons data that were envisioned by the New START treaty. Officials at the White House, Pentagon and State Department said the U.S. had offered to continue providing this information to Russia even after Putin suspended its participation in the treaty, but Moscow told Washington it would not be sharing its own data.The New START, signed in 2010 by then-Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.The inspections have been put on hold since 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussions on resuming them were supposed to have taken place in November 2022, but Russia abruptly called them off, citing U.S. support for Ukraine.As part of the Russian drills that began Wednesday, Yars mobile missile launchers will maneuver across three regions of Siberia, Russia's Defense Ministry said. The movements will involve measures to conceal the deployment from foreign satellites and other intelligence assets, the ministry said.The Defense Ministry didn't say how long the drills would last or mention plans for any practice launches. The Yars is a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of about 11,000 kilometers (over 6,800 miles). It forms the backbone of Russia's strategic missile forces.A Defense Ministry video shows trucks carrying the missiles driving from a base to go on patrol. The maneuvers involve about 300 vehicles and 3,000 troops in eastern Siberia, according to the ministry.The exercise took place days after Putin announced a plan to deploy the tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia's neighbor and ally. Such weapons are intended for use on the battlefield and have a relatively short range and a much lower yield compared with the long-range strategic missiles fitted with nuclear warheads that are capable of obliterating whole cities.Putin’s decision on the tactical weapons followed his repeated warnings that Moscow was ready to use “all available means” — a reference to its nuclear arsenal — to fend off attacks on Russian territory.Ryabkov said Wednesday that Putin’s move followed the failure by Kyiv's allies to heed previous “serious signals” from Moscow because of what he described as the “fundamental irresponsibility of Western elites before their people and international security.”Russian officials have issued a barrage of hawkish statements since their troops entered Ukraine, warning that the continuing Western support for Kyiv raised the threat of a nuclear conflict.In remarks published Tuesday, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's Security Council, which Putin chairs, sternly warned the U.S. and its allies against harboring hopes for Russia's defeat in Ukraine.Patrushev alleged that some American politicians believe the U.S. could launch a preventative missile strike on Russia to which Moscow would be unable to respond, a purported belief that he described as “short-sighted stupidity, which is very dangerous.”“Russia is patient and isn’t trying to scare anyone with its military superiority, but it has unique modern weapons capable of destroying any adversary, including the United States, in case of a threat to its existence,” Patrushev said.___AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report from Washington.",2023/03/30,,World

While working at the farm, he allegedly got into a verbal and physical fight with the farm’s staff member surnamed Wu (巫), who accused him of theft.After the fight, he took Wu’s key and drove away to Kaohsiung in his car. The police formed a task force and put him on the wanted list following his escape.According to Liberty Times, Tu traveled between Kaohsiung and Pingtung after fleeing but never stayed in the same place for over an hour. He was arrested on Wednesday (March 29) and taken into custody for interrogation.Tu is serving an approximately six-year sentence for theft, hit-and-run, and negligently causing injury to another. While in prison, he was reportedly well-behaved, which earned him work release.Since beginning his job at the farm in late February, Tu would arrive for work at 8 a.m. and return to a correction center at 5 p.m. every day. He was searched and received an alcohol test on a daily basis.Considering his performance, it was estimated that he had to serve only less than two years before being released.",2023/03/29,842,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850406,Ukraine updates: Bakhmut battle 'badly damaged' Wagner group,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief of the infamous mercenary force known as the Wagner Group, said on Wednesday that his forces and their equipment have been ""badly damaged"" in the months-long campaign for control of the small but strategically important city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.""The battle for Bakhmut today has already practically destroyed the Ukrainian army, and unfortunately, it has also badly damaged the Wagner Private Military Company,"" he said in an audio message, according to Reuters news agency.According to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Wagner forces now control the majority of the city.""ISW assesses that Russian forces have advanced into an additional five percent of Bakhmut in the last seven days and that they currently occupy roughly 65 percent of the city,"" they wrote in a report.Their gains include the city's main market area and Wagner troops are swiftly advancing on the city center, the think tank said.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, March 29:Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that he had invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit his country.""We are ready to see him here,"" Zelenskyy told the Associated Press.Xi, who recently visited his ""dear friend"" Russian President Vladimir Putin on a state visit to Moscow, has not spoken with Zelenskyy since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, 2022.""I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn't have,"" said Zelenskyy.The Ukrainian president also suggested that despite China's clear alliance with Russia, Beijing had not given Vladimir Putin what he wanted during the recent Moscow meeting, namely weapons and ammunition to replace dwindling Russian stockpiles.Zelenskyy pointed to Putin's announcement that Russia would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus as a distraction to divert attention away from the fact that China had not given any such assistance: ""What does it mean? It means the [Chinese] visit was not good for Russia.""Still, China, which has publicly proclaimed neutrality on the war in Ukraine, has remained closely allied with Moscow, both economically and diplomatically.China has also put forth what it claims is a 12-point plan for ""a political resolution of the Ukraine crisis.""Ukraine has voiced appreciation for China's involvement, yet President Zelenskyy has been clear that he would only consider negotiations after a withdrawal of invading Russian troops from Ukrainian territory.Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov Wednesday told reporters in Moscow that Russia's belligerence toward Western countries would not end anytime soon.Asked how long his country's ""special military operation"" would last — it is illegal to call the war a war in Russia — Peskov replied, ""If we talk about the operation in a broader sense… the confrontation with Western countries, hybrid war… this will go on for a long time.""Peskov continued to say, ""we need to be resolute and self-confident and to consolidate around the president.""Sweden's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said it would summon Russia's ambassador to Stockholm after he released a statement on his embassy's website claiming Sweden and Finland would become ""legitimate targets for Russian retaliatory measures, including those of a military nature,"" should they join the NATO military alliance.Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said: ""The Foreign Ministry will summon the Russian ambassador to make a clear statement against this blatant attempt at influence. Sweden's security policy is determined by Sweden — no one else.""Both Sweden and Finland reversed decades of military policy to seek admission into NATO in the wake of Russia's February 2022 invasion of neighboring Ukraine.Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine Wednesday. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe, Zaporizhzhia is under Russian control.The visit is Grossi's second since Russia launched its invasion. The IAEA and the wider international community have been in a state of constant alarm over the situation in Zaporizhzhia, which has been shelled by Russian troops and suffered frequent power outages, raising fears of a major nuclear accident. The IAEA has had inspectors at the plant since September, in a situation Grossi says, ""is still perilous.""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday told Grossi, ""Without the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops and personnel from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and adjacent territory, any initiatives to restore nuclear safety and security are doomed to failure.""Ukrainian troops have begun shelling the Russian-controlled southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol according to media reports.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850407,Can sweatpants be banned in classrooms?,"Quick to pull on and comfortable, affordable, unisex: Sweatpants have long found their way as a fashionable everyday clothing item, and are even considered acceptable in many offices.But that type of casual wear hasn't found acceptance in Wermelskirchen, a city in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where high school students were sent home because they were wearing sweatpants in class. The school was thereby implementing a dress code that had been introduced in 2019.""We would like to encourage our students to wear clothes that do not tempt them to 'chill,'"" stated the school management in reaction to the media's criticism.""Young people need to learn that different behaviors apply in different social spaces. Clothing that is appropriate on the couch at home may not be appropriate at school. You don't lie on a school desk like you do on a couch,"" Moritz Lohmann, the educational director of the school, told local newspaper Remscheid Generalanzeiger. In a letter to the parents, he asked them to ""support this educational measure.""The Wermelskirchen high school director believes that sweatpants are only intended for one purpose: sports.The German association for etiquette, the Deutsche-Knigge-Gesellschaft (Knigge Society), supports the ban: ""Going to school is like going to work, so it's not a place to wear sweatpants,"" the organization said in a statement to German press agency dpa.The Knigge Society is seen as Germany's authority on proper manners. It is named after Adolph Freiherr Knigge (1752-1796), author of the sociological treatise ""About dealing with people.""Different athletes follow this dress code, too. In 2019, football coach Jürgen Klinsmann banned his team at that time, Hertha BSC, from wearing tracksuits while traveling. Their dress code still isn't quite as strict as the one adopted by the US basketball league in 2005, which states that all NBA players must dress in business or conservative attire while arriving to and departing from a scheduled game, and even while sitting on the bench if they are injured.Fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld (1933-2019) famously said, ""Whoever wears sweatpants has lost control of their life.""But meanwhile, many designers, including Valentino, Gucci and Prada, have added elements of luxury to the leisurewear, whether by creating models in fine silk or adorning the trousers with Swarovski crystals.For cultural and fashion sociologist Lutz Hieber, wearing sweatpants is not about losing control, but rather about making a rebellious statement: ""Sweatpants are an expression of a relaxed lifestyle, showing that you don't care too much about traditional standards,"" the University of Hannover professor told news agency epd.So perhaps the new saying should be: Whoever wears sweatpants really has their life under control.Le Coq Sportif, a French sports brand, launched the first jogging pants in the 1920s.The sportswear item, however, only became really popular in the 1970s, as the fitness movement started spreading.On the other hand, by the 1980s, the trousers had also gained a bad reputation, seen as chubby pants worn by socially disadvantaged people who didn't wear them for sports, but to go grocery shopping.In the 1990s, rappers and hip-hoppers successfully turned their sweatpants into a fashion statement.Since 2009, the comfortable pants with an elastic waistband have been celebrated with International Sweatpants Day, marked on January 21. On that day, a news anchor for German public broadcaster ARD once wore sweatpants to present the Tagesschau news show; some school teachers do too — but certainly not in Wermelskirchen.But who can dictate what students should wear?There are no school uniforms in Germany. Schools are allowed to establish a dress code as part of the school rules, but from a legal perspective, this is only a recommendation, not an obligation.According to legal experts, ""There is no basis for an individual ban. The legal situation is pretty clear,"" said Hinnerk Wissmann, professor at the University of Münster, told dpa.There is no dress code at universities either, unlike at elite universities in the UK, for example, which have strict dress codes for exams and ceremonies.In Germany, a law student once sued her university after she lost points for not wearing smart pants, but jeans, during an oral examination. She won the case.In other words, Germany protects individuals' rights to determine their external appearance.

Fashion designer Thomas Rath, who is ""a big fan of sweatpants"" and a ""Germany's Next Top Model"" juror, believes the acceptance of casual clothes has increased significantly due to the pandemic, when many people worked from home, but also due to the great influence of streetwear in our everyday life. ""It is important and it keeps us young,"" Rath told dpa.He is against a ban. ""The years of dictates of fashion are — thank God — over and we can dress individually,"" said Rath. Sweatpants are no longer homewear, but haute couture: ""We've even seen prominent women donning sportswear in a stylish manner on the red carpet,"" he added.Apparently, the Wermelskirchen school board needs to be updated on today's fashion concepts.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/29,,

He argued that climate change was  raising the risk of his home being flooded.Although the highest administrative court found in favor of the town against the central government, the individual case was thrown out.

The two countries were also involved in a range of proxy conflicts, including the war in neighboring Yemen.But on March 10, both countries announced they planned to exchange diplomatic missions following talks hosted by Beijing.In his first comments on the reconciliation, Xi told the Saudi crown prince on Tuesday that China would ""play a major role in strengthening regional unity and cooperation,"" state media reported.Bin Salman, who is also the country's prime minister, expressed ""appreciation"" for what he said was a Chinese initiative to support the restoration of ties.The top diplomats of Saudi Arabia and Iran are due to meet during the ongoing Muslim holy month of Ramadan to revive relations. Both countries are preparing to reopen embassies in each other's capitals, per the reconciliation agreement. Saudi Arabia also invited Iranian President  Ebrahim Raisi to visit the country earlier this month.Both Xi and bin Salman expressed the importance of strategic bilateral ties between their countries. Xi added that both countries would support each other and work to promote peace, stability and development in the Middle East.China's progressing relationship with Saudi Arabia, among the world's top oil exporters, comes amid rising tension between Beijing and Washington.China's growing influence in the Middle East increases its rivalry with the US, which historically had a strategic relationship with most countries in the region.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850412,Western countries are banning Chinese tech. Why is it still spreading?,"Do you have a security camera at home? If so, there's a good chance it was made by either Hikvision or Dahua, two Chinese companies that are dominating the business of video surveillance. In 2021, they made up over one third of a global market worth around $35 billion (€32 billion), according to the latest data of market researcher IDC.But while Chinese companies like Huawei are increasingly seen as a security threat in European countries, the two surveillance giants have received relatively little attention – even as their equipment watches over airports, train stations and even government buildings all over the world. Tens of thousands of Hikvision devices are currently in use in Germany, including in police stations and ministries, according to recent media reports.Not everyone is happy about this. The Chinese government owns parts of both companies, and their presence in critical infrastructure has led to worries about potential espionage. Critics warn that their systems may have built-in back doors, through which Beijing could secretly syphon off sensitive data.Such security breaches are difficult to detect. But Beijing does have a more obvious access to data that it is potentially interested in:""If we look at the Chinese laws, it is very clear,"" says Antonia Hmaidi, a researcher at Berlin's Mercator Institute for China Studies. ""Every Chinese company has to cooperate with the government and hand over data, if asked. This includes data stored in the PRC that was gathered abroad.""This is why many countries are banning Chinese firms. Telecommunications providers Huawei and ZTE may be the most prominent cases, but Western governments have increasingly been trying to rein in Hikvision and Dahua as well. Since late 2022, Australia and the UK have decided to remove the companies' products from government sites and other sensitive areas. The United States have banned their sales and import altogether, citing an ""unacceptable risk to the national security.""The two surveillance companies are also facing severe allegations of enabling human rights abuses: Several independent reports have found Hikvision to be providing video technology used in China's persecution of its Uyghur minority.Considering such grave concerns, how were the Chinese behemoths able to secure such a dominant position in the first place?The answer can be found on their price tags: Hikvision equipment can be up to ten times cheaper than its competitors, according to a 2021 report from digital rights NGO Access Now. A price gap that's hard to explain within the rules of competition.""The concern is that because they're so tightly coupled with the government, they may not be playing fair in terms of the price of their technology,"" says Mike Jude, a market analyst at IDC specializing in video surveillance. This brings a decisive advantage in poorer countries in the Global South, where Jude sees a large potential for the video surveillance market.Take Latin America, where analysts project an annual market growth rate of over 13% for the next few years. Governments across the region are already expanding their video surveillance capabilities, including tools for biometric recognition. But data protection laws in many countries are insufficient to hold authorities and companies accountable. This poses a threat to people's privacy, Access Now told DW.In their efforts to amp up public surveillance, governments in the region have often turned to Chinese manufacturers. Along with cheap prices, Hikvision has also tried to increase its presence by providing free equipment to some countries to test drive, or to detect infections during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company is also expanding in less subtle ways, opening an assembly site in Brazil and acquiring Mexico's largest security systems company, industry research group IVPM reports.The market for surveillance technology is likely to continue to grow, both within Latin America and globally. While the impact of Western sanctions on the operations of Hikvision and Dahua is hard to assess, overall demand for their products is unlikely to wane anytime soon.To safeguard data gathered by video surveillance systems, bans and sanctions that exclude Chinese companies could provide a remedy. But cyber-security expert Antonia Hmaidi sees the need for improved security in surveillance systems more generally. In Germany, for example, most of these systems are currently not updated regularly, she explains – no matter where they were built. This leaves them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. ""And we know that state-sponsored and private actors operating from China are very active in this field,"" Hmaidi adds.Longer-term solutions for improved cyber security, she says, must include transparent rules obliging all video surveillance providers to keep their devices updated and, ideally, to keep their servers outside the reach of authoritarian regimes.Current global trends, however, do not seem to be pointing in that direction yet.Edited by: Kristie Pladson",2023/03/29,,

On Wednesday (March 29), Wang held a press conference at the National Taiwan University Alumni Association to announce his bid for the presidency, reported UDN. Out of fear that Taiwan’s current existence may end, Wang called for cooperation with Beijing so that Taiwan can maintain its political system and avoid war.
Wang, who served as President of the Control Yuan from 2008 to 2014, is currently 84 years old. He was a founding member of the New Party, formerly the New Chinese Party, which advocates for unification with communist China.
At Wednesday's event, Wang revealed new business cards which feature a cartoonish picture of himself as a pig, which he jokingly explained is a reference to the insult of “foreign pig (外省豬),” which has been used to insult those who arrived from China in 1949. Wang claims to hear this insult often when he discusses the political unification of Taiwan with China.
“Even foreign pigs love Taiwan,” Wang said, “We have contributed a lot to Taiwan. If there is a war, I will definitely stay in Taiwan.""
Wang, a former member of the Kuomintang, once ran for Taipei mayor in 1998 as a third party candidate against the KMT’s Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) and the DPP’s Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁). In that race, he came in a distant third place with under 3% of the vote.
A decade later, in 2008, during the first year of the Ma administration, Ma appointed Wang to manage the Control Yuan. The Control Yuan is the supervisory organ of the government, tasked with auditing the other four branches.
As a Taiwanese politician with a favorable view of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang is unlikely to receive more than one or two percentage points of any national vote. His candidacy will likely serve as an annoyance to the KMT candidate, since he may draw votes away from the fringes of the pan-blue camp.
Wang’s candidacy is not expected to significantly impact Taiwan’s presidential race.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850425,WWE's WrestleMania extravaganza draws sponsors to the ring,"NEW YORK (AP) — WWE’s WrestleMania, the Super Bowl for the sports entertainment company, arrives this weekend to a massive audience and vastly larger sponsorship revenue as it seeks to establish itself as a serious contender for major dollars from such partnerships.Craig Stimmel, WWE’s senior vice president and head of global sales and partnerships, told The Associated Press in an interview that sponsorship revenue for this year’s event has doubled to more than $20 million, a record for any WWE event.Those numbers are critical in light of the return in January of Vince McMahon, the founder and majority shareholder of WWE, who said the sports entertainment company could be up for sale.There are numerous rumors circulating about who might be willing to buy WWE and for how much, and it's unknown if anyone has stepped forward with a bid yet. But the company's broadening presence everywhere from TikTok to streaming channels could lift its asking price.Marketing experts see WWE as a prime venue for brands due to the makeup of its core audience. That audience ranges from minors to seniors, has a wide range of incomes, it’s global, and it’s fervently devoted to the craft, said T. Maxwell, a partner at Max Sports Marketing.“WWE fans are fiercely loyal and dedicated, they are hooked, they crave storytelling and will be WWE fans for life,” Maxwell said. “This creates an amazing opportunity for savvy brands to connect with a unique audience for life.”The company, based in Stamford, Connecticut, is increasingly leaning into its marketing potential and finding new ways to resonate with fans and sponsors.For the first time at a premium live event in January, WWE incorporated a single company’s branding (Mountain Dew) on the ring canvas, in post-show press conferences and elsewhere. WWE also played off the product the company was introducing to consumers, a drink called “Pitch Black.” The match was held in the dark, in a ring with fluorescent ring ropes and gear.During last year’s WrestleMania, wrestlers Shinsuke Nakamura and Rick Boogs incorporated the colors used by Mike’s Hard Lemonade to launch a new drink into the gear they wore in the ring.Stimmel said WWE will incorporate corporate brands into this year’s WrestleMania in a multitude of ways, including a match sponsorship, a “blurring of the fourth wall” between what home viewers see vs. what live audience members observe and an augmented reality experience.“We try to find the perfect marriage of brand and story,” Stimmel said.WrestleMania 39, a two-day event that begins Saturday at SoFi Stadium outside of Los Angeles, has 12 sponsors, half of them returning from last year's event.While there has been pushback by fans in some sports leagues that have tried to introduce more advertising, it does not appear to be an issue for WWE.“I think WWE fans are much more accepting of (sponsors) than the traditional sports,” Maxwell said.Sponsors are keen to take advantage of WWE's push into social media as the company pursues a multifaceted online effort to reach viewers on YouTube, TikTok and elsewhere.The company surpassed 16 billion social video views in the final quarter of last year. It has nearly 94 million YouTube subscribers and has more than 20 million followers on TikTok. Its female wrestlers comprise five out of the top 15 most followed female athletes in the world, across Facebook, Twitter & Instagram, led by Ronda Rousey with 36.1 million followers.WWE had more than 7.5 billion digital and social media views in January and February of this year, up 15% from the same time frame a year ago.The size of the net that WWE is throwing out to capture viewers has been noticed by retail analysts.“WWE has multiple channels to connect with customers which is important for sponsors who don’t want to rely on just one medium,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. “It basically gives brands multiple bites of the cherry to reach customers. WWE has built out an entire entertainment ecosystem which brands can tap into and use to push their marketing messages.”Even the timing of WrestleMania in early April, which falls between the end of the National Football League season and early days of the Major League Baseball season, puts WWE in a position to capture more sponsors.“WrestleMania is our Super Bowl,” said Stimmel.",2023/03/29,,World

That has now been extended worldwide.“FIFA can confirm that following a request by the Italian FA (FIGC), the Chairperson of FIFA’s Disciplinary Committee has decided to extend the sanctions imposed by FIGC on several football officials to have worldwide effect,” the governing body said.The decision will have a significant impact on Tottenham at a time when the Premier League club is conducting a search for a new manager following the departure of Antonio Conte.Conte, who is Italian, left the London club by “mutual agreement” on Sunday, just over a week after a post-match outburst in which he criticized the players and made withering comments about Tottenham's ownership.Paratici would have been expected to play a key role in identifying and hiring Conte's successor, with former Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann among the names linked with the job.On Tuesday, Paratici spoke about Conte's exit and of his determination to see Tottenham have a successful end to the season.“We will fight to achieve our targets. We are prepared to fight until the end of the season,"" Paratici said. ""Everyone has to be focused on the last part of the season.”Prosecutors had been investigating since 2021 whether Juventus cashed in on illegal commissions from transfer and loans of players. Juventus said at the start of the coronavirus pandemic that 23 players agreed to reduce their salary for four months to help the club through the crisis. But prosecutors claim the players gave up only one month’s salary.Juventus, which denies wrongdoing, has appealed the 15-point penalty to Italy’s highest sports court within the Italian Olympic Committee, known as CONI.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850428,Stakes high for Anthony Joshua ahead of fight with Franklin,"One minute he’s talking about a blockbuster, all-British heavyweight fight with Tyson Fury.The next he’s looking forward to “loving life” in retirement, free from the pressure of an expectant public.Such are the stakes for Anthony Joshua in a fight that comes at a crossroads in his career.Coming off consecutive losses to Oleksandr Usyk, the former two-time world champion takes on American boxer Jermaine Franklin at London’s O2 Arena on Saturday for a non-title bout that is bigger than it appears at first glance.If Joshua loses, his career is pretty much in ruins. OK, he could still sell fights — he has been a huge draw in Britain for a decade, ever since he won Olympic gold at the London Games in 2012 and immediately turned professional — but he will no longer have the credibility to go along with the hype.And, to be sure, the hype was justified in his golden period from 2016-18 when he won seven straight world title fights, including an epic against Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 spectators in 2017, to allow him to dream of becoming the first undisputed champion since Lennox Lewis in 1999-2000.“I was really pushing that undisputed narrative for so long, that road to undisputed hashtag with all of the brands we work with,” Joshua said this week. “We pushed it, but now we’re at a new stage.“We can’t look back. We’re only looking forward and I see a bright future and that kind of keeps me in good spirits.”He would love that future to include a fight with Fury, which has been sought for so long but — maddeningly for the British public and beyond — has never materialized for various reasons.Joshua (24-3) thinks there is still a chance, especially after Fury — the WBC champion — was unable to secure a fight with Usyk, who holds the WBA, WBO and IBF belts that Joshua had for so long.“There’s no better time to get Fury in the ring than now because he needs me to redeem himself from this circus, this letdown,” Joshua said.“He needs me, so there’s no better time than for him to call my name out and I’m someone that will take on any challenge.”Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, still yearns for Joshua-Fury even if he has grown weary of negotiating with the Fury camp.“Neither guy would have a fight (lined up), the politics would be gone and it might be a chance to get it made,” Hearn said, “but we’ve been there before.”And Hearn is wary of getting too far ahead of himself, considering what’s at stake for Joshua if his man loses.“People talk about whether his career is over if he loses this fight,” Hearn said. “Well, his world title ambitions are in tatters if he loses this fight.”Franklin has only lost one of his 22 professional fights, and that was his most recent one — against Dillian Whyte on points in November. His previous opponents have been low on quality, though, and Franklin has never fought for a world title.Indeed, prior to fighting Whyte, Franklin was working full time and long hours as a roofer.In short, and for a man still believing he belongs in the category of the world’s top three heavyweights, Joshua shouldn’t lose. And the 29-year-old Franklin knows there's a general feeling that he’ll be “a pushover or a walkover or something like.”“The circumstances around this fight are very different,” the Michigan native countered. “For the Dillian fight, I was working a job before we got that phone call. I wasn’t in the gym. We took like five-to-seven weeks to get in shape for that fight. For the time I had, I did what I could. This time I’ve got more time to prepare and more time to get in shape.”Joshua believes Franklin poses a proper test of where he is at after those losses to Usyk.“Coming off two losses, it would be crazy to get a soft touch,” Joshua said at a news conference Wednesday. “That's not the right place for me to be in my career. Soft touches build a false sense of confidence.”And the 33-year-old Joshua has no time to waste. He reckons he has three or four years left at the top of the heavyweight game and doesn’t see himself fighting into his 40s like Klitschko or Alexander Povetkin.“I truly believe that boxing’s a young man’s sport,” said Joshua, who has faced repeated questions about whether he will retire if he loses to Franklin.There doesn’t appear a clear-cut answer on that.“I know when I am retired, I am going to be chilling,” he said. “You lot (the media) put so much pressure on me so when I am done, the chains are going to be gone. I am going to be laughing and loving life.”___Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80___More AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850430,UN agency warns of rising combat near Ukraine nuclear plant,"DNIPRO, Ukraine (AP) — The head of the U.N.’s atomic energy watchdog crossed the front line in the war in Ukraine to visit Europe's largest nuclear power plant Wednesday, and warned that it was easy to see evidence of intensified fighting in the area that poses a threat to the facility's safety.The increasing combat makes it urgent to find a way to prevent a potentially catastrophic nuclear accident at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, said Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.“It is obvious that this area is facing perhaps a more dangerous phase,” he said of the facility, which is in a partially Russian-occupied part of Ukraine. “We have to step up our efforts to get to some agreement of the protection of the plant.”Grossi has struggled to agree with Russian and Ukrainian authorities on a deal to secure the plant, which has been hit several times during the Ukraine war. The site has also suffered several losses of external power needed to cool its six shut-down reactors, forcing it to rely on emergency back-up generators.Wednesday’s visit to the plant was Grossi’s second since the start of the war. He tried for months to negotiate on securing the whole zone around the complex, but he said at a news conference during his visit that the concept “is evolving” to focus more on protecting the plant itself.Grossi said he was working on “realistic measures” and had narrowed the scope in the hopes of reaching agreement on a mutually acceptable plan.“Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well determined zone around the plant,” he told reporters during his visit. “Now the concept is evolving. It’s refocusing more on the protection itself, and the things that should be avoided, for example, in order to protect the plant, rather than on territorial aspects, which pose certain problems.”The IAEA, based in Vienna, Austria, has been rotating inspection teams at the power plant since Grossi's visit in September. Grossi told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday that it is his duty to ramp up talks between Kyiv and Moscow aimed at safeguarding the facility and avoiding a catastrophic accident. He said a deal was “close.”Grossi met Monday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and said he would “most probably” head to Moscow in the coming days.However, Zelenskyy said in a separate interview with AP that he was less optimistic a deal was near. “I don’t feel it today,” he said.Speaking in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro after his visit, Grossi said he saw clear signs of increased military activity in the area and assessed damage the plant sustained in shelling last November, which he described as “quite severe.”Buildings near two of the reactors were hit “wittingly or unwittingly, ... so this is very serious,” he said, adding that his visit allowed him to confirm “the gravity ... of the situation and the need for us to get to results as soon as possible.”He didn’t give details of the evolving security plan, but said that “not using the plant as a military platform is very important” as stationing heavy military equipment there can become a target.Equally, he said, there should be “of course no attacks, no targeting. And we saw that at least until November, there were attacks. So I hope there won’t be another one. But the reality and the facts prove that there have been.”The Kremlin’s forces took over the plant after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Zelenskyy opposes any proposal that would legitimize Russia’s control.Interruptions to the outside electricity supply due to the fighting required plant personnel to switch to emergency diesel generators six times during the 13-month war. When backup power supplies might be needed again is unpredictable, Grossi told AP. ___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850431,Group: Oil tanker tied to US-traded firm receiving Iran oil,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An oil tanker owned by a major U.S.-traded transportation company appears to be taking on Iranian crude oil in a key Asian maritime strait in violation of American sanctions, an advocacy group alleges. The firm allegedly involved, Euronav, said Wednesday it will “take appropriate action when necessary.""Satellite photos and maritime tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put the Belgian-flagged crude oil tanker Oceania just next to the Vietnamese-flagged tanker Abyss for a possible ship-to-ship transfer. The group United Against Nuclear Iran has warned the Oceania's owner, the Antwerp-based Euronav, that it believes the Abyss took on Iranian crude oil in late February.The suspicion comes as Iran remains able to trade its crude oil at sea despite American sanctions snapping back into place after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Now, nearly five years later, Iran enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels while continuing to sell its oil and supplying bomb-carrying drones to Russia to fuel Moscow's war on Ukraine.Brian Gallagher, a spokesman for Euronav, told the AP in a statement that the company “has and always has taken all the appropriate measures and protocols to ensure we are in compliance with all regulations.”“All cargoes within our system have passed these requirements,” Gallagher wrote. “Euronav will continue to monitor any specific shipments and take appropriate action where necessary.”Gallagher said the Oceania was a storage vessel and the cargo from the Abyss was for “a third party NOT directly with Euronav.” He added if the allegation the oil is Iranian is proven, “the cargo will be returned to the third party who delivered it.”Euronav trades on the New York Stock Exchange.The U.S. Treasury declined to immediately comment. The Abyss' manager did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC and data from the ships' Automatic Identification System trackers put the vessels on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Malacca Strait, one of the world's busiest waterways between Indonesia and Malaysia. In an image on Tuesday, tug boats were pushing the Abyss toward the Oceania.Tracking data from MarineTraffic.com showed the vessels alongside each other on Wednesday. At sea, oil tankers can funnel crude between each other in a ship-to-ship transfer that typically sees boats in a similar position.In a letter dated Tuesday to Euronav, United Against Nuclear Iran said it believed the Abyss took on crude oil at the Iranian port of Bandar Mashahr, some 600 kilometer (370 miles) southwest of the capital, Tehran, on the Persian Gulf. The Abyss had turned off its AIS tracker on Feb. 18 as it was pointed toward Bandar Mashahr.Ships are supposed to keep their AIS trackers on for safety reason, but vessels believed to be carrying Iranian crude oil routinely turn theirs off to mask their movements over the international sanctions Tehran faces.A ship corresponding to the Abyss' size and features could be seen docked at Bandar Mashahr on Feb. 22 in a satellite photo analyzed by the AP. United Against Nuclear Iran said it found a satellite image it believed showed the Abyss at the port in the same position the day before.“Any other signs of manipulating AIS transponders should be considered red flags for potential illicit activity,” the New York-based group said in its letter signed by Mark Wallace, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.The Abyss is managed by Ho Chi Minh City-based PetroVietnam Transportation. Vietnamese vessels have been suspected of smuggling Iranian crude oil in the past. Smugglers typically misidentify where the crude oil they carry came from in order to skirt suspicions.Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.This is not the first time a U.S.-linked firm has been associated with an Iranian oil transfer at sea. In February 2022, United Against Nuclear Iran warned Los Angeles-based private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management that it believed a tanker the firm owned took on Iranian crude oil.The U.S. government has said illicit Iranian oil revenue funds the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, an expeditionary unit believed to be working abroad in countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to back Iranian-allied militias.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850432,US: Credit Suisse violates deal on rich clients' tax evasion,"GENEVA (AP) — Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes, U.S. lawmakers said Wednesday, releasing a two-year investigation that detailed the role employees at the embattled Swiss bank had in aiding tax evasion by clients.The U.S. Senate Finance Committee pointed to an ongoing, possibly criminal conspiracy tied to nearly $100 million in accounts belonging to a family of American taxpayers that the bank did not disclose. It also said Credit Suisse helped a U.S. businessman hide more than $220 million in offshore accounts from the IRS.Credit Suisse revealed that it had found 23 accounts each worth more than $20 million that were not declared to tax authorities, many of them unveiled just days before the report was released, according to the committee. It said its findings show that more than $700 million was concealed in violation of the bank's 9-year-old plea deal with the U.S. Justice Department.“Credit Suisse got a discount on the penalty it faced in 2014 for enabling tax evasion because bank executives swore up and down they’d get out of the business of defrauding the United States,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, the Democratic chairman of the committee.“This investigation shows Credit Suisse did not make good on that promise, and the bank’s pending acquisition does not wipe the slate clean,” he said.The Swiss government pressed for a $3.25 billion takeover of long-troubled Credit Suisse by rival bank UBS this month amid turmoil in the global financial system. The collapse of two U.S. banks ignited wider fears that sent shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank tumbling as customers withdrew their money.The Senate findings pose new problems for UBS as it tries to absorb Credit Suisse and create a single Swiss megabank, coming the same day that UBS named a new CEO to help push through the takeover. It's also Credit Suisse's latest run-in with U.S. authorities, following settlements worth hundreds of millions of dollars over mortgage-backed securities that were behind the 2008 financial crisis.Credit Suisse, whose yearslong troubles range from hedge fund losses to fines for failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine ring, said it “does not tolerate tax evasion” and insisted that the Senate report described “legacy issues” — some dating to a decade ago — that have been addressed since.“We have implemented extensive enhancements since then to root out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities,” the Zurich-based bank said.“Our clear policy is to close undeclared accounts when identified and to discipline any employee who fails to comply with bank policy or falls short of Credit Suisse’s standards of conduct,” it said.UBS said it has assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It's working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.The Senate report noted Credit Suisse’s cooperation with the investigation, including having appointed new leadership.The Swiss lender paid a discounted fine of $1.3 billion to the U.S. Justice Department after pleading guilty in 2014 to conspiracy to aid and assist U.S. taxpayers in filing false income tax returns and other documents with the IRS.The bank acknowledged “knowingly and willfully” helping thousands of Americans open accounts that weren't declared to tax authorities and concealing offshore assets. It avoided criminal charges in exchange for agreeing to report undeclared accounts and provide other information to U.S. officials.The Senate committee said secret offshore accounts belonging to a family of dual U.S.-Latin American citizens and worth nearly $100 million were closed in 2013 but the money was transferred to other banks without telling U.S. authorities.With that maneuver, ""Credit Suisse enabled what appears to be potentially criminal tax evasion by a client to go undetected for almost a decade,"" the report says.The committee said former senior bankers helped manage that family's accounts. In addition, Credit Suisse employees helped a U.S. businessman hide $220 million from U.S. authorities despite long knowing he was an American, according to the report, which said whistleblowers flagged the scheme after the plea deal.Credit Suisse workers were incentivized to help accounts hide U.S. ties because their bonuses depend on the amount of money being managed, the report said. To that end, employees who had clients with assets above $20 million or $30 million may have given those accounts special consideration because it would mean they got larger bonuses, the committee said.Investigators say bankers figured out how to code accounts for Americans who possess dual citizenship. Those bankers would use the non-U.S. passport of wealthy individuals to evade internal systems designed to look for identifying marks in U.S. passports.Lawmakers on the committee became aware of 13 out of 23 potentially undeclared accounts worth over $20 million just days before releasing their report. That raises concerns Credit Suisse is still disclosing hundreds of millions of dollars in large, undeclared accounts belonging to ultra-wealthy Americans years after signing the plea deal and facing additional scrutiny, the committee said.___Bonnell reported from London.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850466,Greece: Terror suspects offered money to target Jewish site,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek authorities said police were continuing searches in Athens and other parts of the country Wednesday following the arrest of two suspects accused of planning an attack at Jewish center in a busy downtown area of the Greek capital. The two men, described of being of Pakistani origin but not further identified, were charged Tuesday with terrorism offenses, while a third man believed to be in Iran was charged in absentia. Rabbi Mendel Hendel, who runs the Chabad Jewish center, said he learned about the planned attack on the news. “Thank God we are safe. We're grateful that this act of terrorism was prevented,” Hendel said in a statement with his wife Nechama e-mailed to the Associated Press. “We would like to publicly thank the Greek authorities.” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Tuesday said his country's intelligence agency Mossad helped Greece prevent the terrorist attack. A statement from his office maintained the attackers were linked to Iran.Greek authorities are investigating whether other attacks on Jewish sites in Athens were being planned. The arrests were announced ahead of the April 5-13 Jewish holiday of Passover.Public Order Minister Takis Theodorikakos said it was likely the two suspects had been offered money to carry out the attack. “From the evidence we have obtained, the motivation appears to be financial. The organizer they consulted with was a fellow countryman in Iran,” Theodorikakos told private Antenna television. The Jewish Community of Athens sent a letter to the minister thanking the authorities for the arrests. “A terrorist attack has been prevented against Jewish targets in a busy area of the historic center of Athens,” the community said in a statement.“Thanks to the methodical work and timely intervention of the security forces, dozens of human lives have been saved.”The two suspects are due to appear before a public prosecutor Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850468,FDA approves over-the-counter Narcan. Here's what it means,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved selling the leading version of naloxone without a prescription, setting the overdose-reversing drug on course to become the first opioid treatment drug to be sold over the counter.It’s a move that some advocates have long sought as a way to improve access to a life-saving drug, though the exact impact will not be clear immediately.Here’s a look at the issues involved.WHAT IS NARCAN?The approved nasal spray from Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Emergent BioSolutions is the best-known form of naloxone.It can reverse overdoses of opioids, including street drugs such as heroin and fentanyl and prescription versions including oxycodone.Making naloxone available more widely is seen as a key strategy to control the nationwide overdose crisis, which has been linked to more than 100,000 U.S. deaths a year. The majority of those deaths are tied to opioids, primarily potent synthetic versions such as fentanyl that can take multiple doses of naloxone to reverse.The drug has been distributed to police and other first responders nationwide.Advocates believe it's important to get naloxone to the people who are most likely to be around overdoses, including people who use drugs and their relatives.The decision ""represents a decisive, practical and humane approach to help people and flatten the curve of overdose deaths,” said Chuck Ingoglia of the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, in a statement.___WHAT DOES THE FDA APPROVAL MEAN?Narcan will become available over-the-counter by late summer, the company said.Other brands of naloxone and injectable forms will not yet be available over the counter, but they could be soon.Several manufacturers of generic naloxone that's made similarly to Narcan will now be required to file applications to switch their drugs over the counter as part of a requirement by the FDA.The nonprofit Harm Reduction Therapeutics Inc., which has funding from OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, already has an application before the FDA to distribute its version of spray naloxone without a prescription.___HOW IS NALOXONE DISTRIBUTED NOW?Even before the FDA's action, pharmacies could sell naloxone without a prescription because officials in every state have allowed it.But not every pharmacy carries it. And buyers have to pay for the medication — either with an insurance co-pay or for the full retail price. The cost varies, but two doses of Narcan often go for around $50.The drug is also distributed by community organizations that serve people who use drugs, though it's not easily accessible to everyone who needs it.Emergent has not announced its price and it's not clear yet whether insurers will continue to cover it as a prescription drug if it's available over the counter.FDA Commissioner Robert Califf in a statement encouraged Emergent to make the drug available “at an affordable price.""___DOES MAKING NALOXONE OVER-THE-COUNTER IMPROVE ACCESS?It clears the way for Narcan to be made available in places without pharmacies — convenience stores, supermarkets and online retailers, for instance.Jose Benitez, the lead executive officer at Prevention Point Philadelphia, an organization that tries to reduce risk for people who use drugs with services including handing out free naloxone, said it could help a lot for people who don't seek services — or who live in places where they're not available.Now, he said, some people are concerned about getting naloxone at pharmacies because their insurers will know they're getting it.“Putting it out on the shelves is going to allow people just to pick it up, not have stigma attached to it,” he said.But it remains to be seen how many stores will carry it and what the prices will be. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which now cover prescription naloxone for people on the government insurance programs, says that coverage of over-the-counter naloxone would depend on the insurance program. The centers have not given any official guidance.Maya Doe-Simkins, a co-director of Remedy Alliance/For The People, which launched last year to provide low-cost — and sometimes free — naloxone to community organizations, said her group will continue to distribute injectable naloxone.___HOW WILL PEOPLE LEARN TO USE NARCAN?Emergent had to conduct a study examining whether untrained people could follow directions for using Narcan.Last month, an FDA expert panel voted to make the drug available over the counter, despite numerous errors in using the device reported in the company study. The FDA suggested Emergent make several changes to how the directions will be displayed on the packaging and said the device can be safely used “without the supervision” of a health care worker.Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University addiction expert, said one benefit of currently having pharmacists involved in dispending the drug is that they can show buyers how to use it. One key thing people need to be reminded of: Call an ambulance for the person receiving naloxone after it's been administered.He also said there are fears that if the drug isn't profitable as an over-the-counter option, the drugmaker could stop producing it.___AP Health Writer Matthew Perrone contributed to this story___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850469,Companies bid $264M in Gulf oil sale mandated by climate law,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Oil companies offered a combined $264 million for drilling rights in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday in a sale mandated by last year’s climate bill compromise.The auction was the first in the Gulf in more than a year and drew strong interest from industry giants including Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil. But it could further test the loyalty of environmentalists and young voters who backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and were frustrated by this month's approval of a huge drilling project in Alaska.Developing the Gulf leases would produce up to 1.1 billion barrels of oil and more than 4 trillion cubic feet (113 billion cubic meters) of natural gas over 50 years, according to a government analysis. Burning that oil would increase planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions by tens of millions of tons, the analysis found.A legal challenge to the sale from environmental groups is pending in federal court.Bids were up 38% from the last auction and marked the most offered in a sale since 2017. Chevron USA was the top bidder, offering $108 million for 75 tracts. BP Exploration and Production had $47 million in high bids and Shell Offshore had $20 million in high bids.The next Gulf lease sale is scheduled in September. It's unknown how many more the administration could conduct as it faces continued pressure over approval of the ConocoPhillips Willow project in Alaska.The uncertainty means companies could be trying ""to lease blocks now in case future auctions are restricted,” said Sami Yahya, an analyst with S&P Global.""From a global perspective, we are perpetually moving toward an environment with stronger anti-fossil fuel sentiment, as operators will continue to face more public scrutiny regarding emissions,“ Yahya said.The sale came two days before a deadline set in last year's climate bill. The bill also prohibits leasing public lands for renewable power unless tens of millions of acres are first offered for fossil fuels. That was a concession to West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, an industry supporter.Manchin issued a statement saying the sale results showed the climate bill was “holding this administration’s feet to the fire” to continue fossil fuel production.The climate law also raised the royalty rate companies must pay on oil they produce. The Biden administration set the rate for Wednesday at the maximum allowed — 18.75%, versus 12.5% historically.The parcels offered covered 114,000 square miles (295,000 square kilometers) an area larger than Arizona. Like past auctions of similar magnitude, only a fraction of the available acreage — about 2,600 square miles (6,700 square kilometers) — got bids.The vast majority of tracts had only one bidder as the company offers were opened Wednesday in New Orleans, in a state that is economically dependent on the oil and gas industry and especially vulnerable to climate change.Since it takes years to develop offshore parcels before crude is pumped, the leases could produce oil and gas long past 2030. That's when scientists say the world needs to have drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions to stave off catastrophic climate change.Sea level rise is a factor in Louisiana’s steady loss of coastal wetlands, which in addition to harboring a variety of fisheries and wildlife, provide a buffer between inland population areas and hurricanes that scientists say are growing stronger as the world warms.ExxonMobil offered almost $10 million on 69 tracts in the northwest Gulf. The company in 2021 bid nearly $15 million for tracts in the same area. It includes shallow waters — less than 656 feet (200 meters) deep — where oil has mostly played out.The acquisitions are likely linked to Exxon's pursuit of a government-industry collaboration to capture and store carbon dioxide from industrial plants in the Houston Ship Channel, experts said.""They purposely went out to lease property where the geology was right for storage and they knew any oil and gas production on a commercial scale was not a possibility,” said Eric Smith, associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute.The carbon dioxide would be transported in pipelines and injected deep under the Gulf floor, a process known as carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. Oil and gas companies are banking on carbon capture to extend the lifespan of fossil fuel facilities,. Critics say the technology is unproven and less effective than switching to renewable energy.All the leases sold Wednesday were for oil and gas only, federal officials said.That means Exxon needs Interior Department cooperation to revise its lease agreements before the company can use them for carbon capture, said Justin Rostant, a principal analyst with industry consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.“There might be some risks associated with whether they're actually able to use it for carbon capture,” Rostant said. “That is a big question mark.""ExxonMobil spokesperson Todd Spitler declined to say if there was a link between its bids and the ship channel proposal.Environmentalists called on Biden to abide by campaign pledges to end new drilling on federal lands and water. Diane Hoskins with the group Oceana said the Democrat can “make good on his promise” by including an end to leasing in a long-overdue five-year plan for the Gulf.Oil industry groups called for more offshore lease sales so companies can continue exploration work to ensure future domestic supplies.It takes 90 days for the government to evaluate any bids, which means Wednesday's sale still could be blocked. The 2021 sale was subsequently blocked by a federal judge, then reinstated under the climate bill.“There’s been a lot of talk from the administration about taking climate change seriously and moving our economy away from fossil fuels, and yet we continue to see massive oil and gas projects, both onshore with Willow and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico,” said George Torgun, an Earthjustice attorney representing environmental groups in the pending federal lawsuit.Many of the leases sold Wednesday were in deep waters, which Torgun said increases the chance of another major oil spill like BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.Chevron said in a Monday court filing that it could lose millions of dollars if the leases were blocked.In coming months the administration plans to auction more than 500 square miles (1,400 square kilometers) of onshore oil and gas leases in Wyoming, New Mexico, Montana, Nevada and other states.___Brown reported from Billings, Montana.___Follow Matthew Brown and Kevin McGill on Twitter.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850470,Man charged over Danish mall shooting that killed 3,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A 23-year-old man has been formally charged with murder and attempted murder for allegedly opening fire last year in a crowded Copenhagen shopping mall, killing three people and injuring several more, Danish police said Wednesday.Danish authorities have ruled out the attack being related to terrorism. The suspect — who was known to mental health services — allegedly acted alone and apparently selected his victims at random.Police said that on July 3, the suspect, who was not identified, opened fire inside one of Scandinavia’s biggest shopping centers on the outskirts of the Danish capital. The suspect, carrying a rifle and knife, was quickly arrested. Police said the firearm he had was obtained illegally.On Wednesday, the man was charged with three counts of murder, 11 counts of attempted murder and one count of attempted murder by shooting at a group of about 21 people, prosecutor Søren Harbo said in a statement.He said it was “an extremely serious case” and the charges were made after investigating the case “very carefully.”A trial in the case has been set to start on June 12 at the Copenhagen District Court. It is scheduled to end on July 5.Two dozen people were slightly hurt, most in a panicked stampede after the shots rang out at the Field’s shopping center, on the outskirts of the Danish capital. A Harry Styles concert that was scheduled for hours later nearby, was canceled due to the shooting.Gun violence is relatively rare in Denmark.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850471,"Montenegro: South Korea, US seek extradition of Do Kwon","PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — South Korea and the United States have requested the extradition from Montenegro of Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon, who is wanted in connection with a $40 billion crash of the firm’s cryptocurrency that devastated retail investors around the world, Montenegro's justice minister said Wednesday.Do Kwon and another South Korean citizen were arrested in Montenegro last week on international arrest warrants. A court in the small European country ordered the two detained for 30 days for legal proceedings, Justice Minister Marko Kovac said.South Korea asked Interpol in September to circulate a “red notice” asking the agency’s 195 member nations to find and apprehend the 31-year-old Kwon.He and the other man were arrested at Montenegro’s Podgorica Airport on March 24 while trying to depart for Dubai using fake Costa Rican passports, authorities have said.They are believed to have been hiding in Serbia but moved to Montenegro after South Korean investigators tracked their whereabouts and asked Serbian authorities to detain them, the South Korean Justice Ministry said when the arrests were made.Kovac, the Montenegrin justice minister, said both men were under investigation in Montenegro for possessing false documents and could face criminal proceedings for the offense, which carries a potential sentence of up to five years in prison.It was not immediately clear when and to which country Do Kwon could eventually be extradited. Kovac said South Korea was seeking the extradition of both suspects, while the U.S. requested only to have Kwon handed over.“The Ministry of Justice of Montenegro guarantees that the citizens of South Korea will be granted all the rights in accordance with the laws in Montenegro and international agreements,” said Kovac.Kwon and five others connected to Terraform are wanted because of allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022.TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg in May.",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850494,Go Green - But beware Taipei City's electric scooter hurdles,"The decision was made. It had been the subject of months of discussion. We were going to buy a scooter.
Not just any scooter. We were going to go green and buy an electric scooter in line with Taiwan’s 2050 Net Zero Pathway. We were going to be way ahead of the government’s commitment that all scooter sales be electric by 2040.
A recent move has placed our new residence just a bit further away from the services of the trusty MRT. Buses are plentiful but it does require walking to the nearest bus stop. We had, however, compared with our previous residence, managed to move within the geographic circle of the rental scooter system. We avail ourselves regularly of both of those means of transport and they adequately support most of our needs.










However, 3 nights a week of evening classes and just the desire to zip around for errands and the exercise facilities had set the discussion in motion once more. The other factor was the financial incentives offered by Taipei City following the purchase of an electric scooter and that was really the tipping point in terms of the financial outlay for a new scooter.
We’d done the rounds of the secondhand market, but models are scarce and the asking price was not much less than a brand-spanking new scooter. When those factors were taken into consideration, the attractiveness of the financial incentives just seemed to tip the decision in favor of a new model.
Our household consists of a Taiwanese citizen and a foreign spouse on a Taiwan Join Family Resident Visa (JFRV). It is a great, flexible visa with most aspects of life in Taiwan. No complaints. 
We settled on the brand, probably the most well-known, and made an appointment at the closest outlet. Upon arrival, we were certainly treated well by the salesperson. A decision had already been made to opt for the 50cc model, not only due to price but from experience, renting this model at least 3 times a week for night school transit. The 50cc model provided everything that was needed.
The incentive on offer, according to the website, was NT$17,000. This amount was not to be ignored. This amount does not come from the purchase price. The purchase is made and then it requires an application to Taipei City to receive reimbursement.
Next was the color choice, a bit underwhelming. Powder pink/purple combination or what some would call off-white, but designers may call, ivory. Off-white was selected. There was also a free-of-charge NT$4000 accessory package being offered. Just tick the box.
IDs and driver’s licenses were produced. IDs, plural, as we had not decided in whose name to purchase the scooter. Then a discussion began about the NT$17,000 incentive. Turns out this only applies to Taiwanese citizens. Spouse and APRC visa holders are only entitled to receive NT$10,000. I found nothing online to explain the NT$7,000 difference. 
Well, no problem, we would purchase the scooter through the citizen side of the family. But remember, you only get “one bite at the cherry”. The incentive does not apply with the purchase of further scooters. Again, no problem. If we wanted another one, soon, we would just accept the NT$10,000 incentive. Pragmatic, a little bit jaded, but we were left with little or no choice.
A credit card was produced, and we were set to get the paperwork underway. It must have been the shiny new nature of our IDs that elicited the fateful question. Why so new? As noted, we have recently moved residences. We had in fact moved in December 2022 from New Taipei City to Taipei City, and we had made sure to change our cards to reflect the new address. At that point, things started to unravel. The salesperson regretfully informed us that to be eligible for the NT$17,000 we needed to be residents of Taipei City for a minimum of 12 months. Again, there was no reason for the imposition of these criteria. Did we need to show commitment to Taipei City?
The salesperson tried one last valiant effort. We could still proceed with the purchase and apply for a NT$7,000 incentive from the central government, but the “one bite at the cherry” rule applies in that instance as well.
Quite quickly, it became evident that our ‘go green’ plans were fading. Some will say that if we were truly committed, we should have opted for the NT$7,000 incentive. But we live on a tight budget, and it did not seem like the best deal in those circumstances.
The salesperson was deflated, and we were very much deflated, not only by the 12-month eligibility period but also by the disparity between the NT$17,000 for citizens and the NT$10,000 for visa holders. We both work hard and pay our taxes. Why does it appear a foreign spouse is entitled to less? Answers will undoubtedly never be forthcoming on those issues. Bureaucracy is often a dark, mysterious pool.
So, we will wait. December is not that far away, but will the incentives still exist? If not, then Santa will need to step up his game. The dream still lingers.The decision was made. It had been the subject of months of discussion. We were going to buy a scooter.Not just any scooter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850497,Ukraine's Zelenskyy is 'ready' for Chinese leader to visit,"ON A TRAIN FROM SUMY TO KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president invited his powerful Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit his nation, saying they haven't been in contact since the war began and he is “ready to see him here.”“I want to speak with him,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Tuesday, the week after Xi visited Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. China had no immediate response about whether a Xi visit to Ukraine would happen.China has been economically aligned and politically favorable toward neighboring Russia across many decades, and Beijing has provided Putin diplomatic cover by staking out an official position of neutrality in the war. Xi, a powerful leader who commands the resources of the world's most populous nation, is an important player in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and even China's lack of involvement is a potent statement.Zelenskyy spoke to the AP aboard a train shuttling him across Ukraine, to cities near some of the fiercest fighting and others where his country’s forces have successfully repelled Russia’s invasion. Zelenskyy rarely travels with journalists, and the president’s office said AP’s two night train trip with him was the most extensive since the war began.Zelenskyy has extended invitations to Xi before in recent months, but this explicit call to visit comes days after the Chinese leader visited Putin in Russia last week. But the Ukrainian leader said he hasn't communicated with Xi for the duration of the conflict.“We are ready to see him here,” Zelenskyy said. “I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have.”In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning was asked whether Xi would accept an invitation from Zelenskyy — or whether one had been officially extended. She told reporters she had no information to give. She did say that Beijing maintains “communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked whether a meeting between Xi and Zelenskyy would be useful to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, said Russian authorities “highly appreciate” China’s balanced position on the issue and “have no right to come up with any advice” on whether the two should meet. “The Chinese leader himself decides the appropriateness of certain contacts,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters Wednesday.In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the United States supports talks between Xi and Zelenskyy, ""and my goodness, we’ve been saying that for weeks.”Xi's Russia visit last week raised the prospect that Beijing might be ready to provide Moscow with the weapons and ammunition it needs to refill its depleted stockpile. But Xi’s trip ended without any such announcement. Days later, Putin announced that he would be deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which neighbors Russia and pushes the Kremlin’s nuclear stockpile closer to NATO territory.Zelenskyy suggested Putin’s move was intended to distract from the lack of guarantees he received from China.“What does it mean? It means that the visit was not good for Russia,” Zelenskyy speculated.___Julie Pace is senior vice president and executive editor of The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850498,Pamela Smart’s latest bid for sentence reduction dismissed,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — New Hampshire’s highest court on Wednesday turned away the latest attempt to get a sentence reduction for Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for plotting with her teenage lover to have her husband killed in 1990.Smart, 55, was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old student who later shot and killed her husband, Gregory Smart. Though she denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole.Having exhausted her judicial appeal options, Smart returned for a third time to an elected state council, seeking a sentence reduction hearing last year. The five-member Executive Council, which approves state contracts and appointees to the courts and state agencies, rejected her latest request in less than three minutes, prompting another appeal to state Supreme Court.The justices dismissed the petition Wednesday, saying it would violate the separation of powers to order the council to reconsider a “political"" question.“This ruling by the New Hampshire Supreme Court is a continuing disappointment that devastates our hopes for Pamela Smart finally receiving reasonable and fair process in the State of New Hampshire,” Smart’s spokeswoman, Eleanor Pam, said in an email.She added that Smart “has never been given the opportunity to be heard or allowed to make her case directly. Pamela Smart is fully rehabilitated and is no danger to society.”The state attorney general’s office has opposed commutation for Smart, saying she has never accepted full responsibility for the crimes.Smart, who has earned two master’s degrees behind bars, tutored fellow inmates, been ordained as a minister and is part of an inmate liaison committee, said in her latest petition that she is remorseful and has been rehabilitated. She apologized to Gregory Smart’s family, though relatives said she has failed to take full responsibility.Smart’s longtime attorney, Mark Sisti, argued that the elected council “brushed aside” her chance at freedom, spending no time discussing her voluminous petition — which included many letters of support from inmates, supervisors and others — before rejecting her request.“We will not stop our attempts to free Pam Smart,” Sisti said in a statement. Smart can refile a petition with the council every two years.As governor, Chris Sununu brings forth matters for the council to consider, and did put the commutation request on the agenda, argued Laura Lombardi, senior assistant attorney general. She said there is no requirement for the governor and council to create rules regarding the process.The trial was a media circus and one of America's first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school staff member and a student. Joyce Maynard wrote “To Die For” in 1992, drawing from the Smart case. That inspired a 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix. The killer, William Flynn, and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors, served shorter sentences and have been released.In February, several of Smart’s supporters traveled to New Hampshire to hear the court discuss the case, wearing pink T-shirts with the words “Enough is Enough.”Kelly Harnett, 41, who designed the T-shirts, did time with Smart at the maximum security Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York. She said Smart helped her through legal and personal setbacks, and deserves a hearing.Vanessa Santiago also met Smart in 2003 as a fellow inmate, working with her as a teacher’s aide and participating with her in an arts rehabilitation program. They stayed in touch after Santiago's release from Bedford in 2020, and she too supports her petition.“Pamela is like an icon in a sense, meaning, she has life with no parole, and when things are tough, you remember Pamela,” Santiago said.___Associated Press reporter Holly Ramer contributed to this story from Hopkinton, New Hampshire.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850499,South Africa manhunt for convicted killer who escaped prison,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South African police have launched a manhunt for convicted rapist and murderer Thabo Bester who escaped from a privately-run maximum security prison in the Free State province under bizarre circumstances.Bester, known as the “Facebook rapist,” was found guilty in 2012 of raping two women and killing one after luring them with the social media platform. In March last year officials reported that he had died in a fire in his cell at the Mangaung Correctional Center, near Bloemfontein.But now it appears Bester escaped from his cell amid the fire and has been living lavishly in Johannesburg's posh Hyde Park suburb.According to information first revealed by the South African news outlet GroundUp and confirmed by the police, the body found burned in the cell was not Bester according to DNA results. Autopsy results have determined that the person found dead in the cell died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head before the fire.The fire appears to have been part of Bester's elaborate prison escape which has raised many questions about the possible involvement of prison officials.“A case of murder is under investigation following the outcome of the DNA analysis that confirmed that the body of the deceased which was found was not of Thabo Bester,"" police spokeswoman Motantsi Makhele said.The identity of the man found dead in the cell is still unknown, she said.A case of escape from lawful custody has also been opened as prison officials have confirmed that Bester is not in their custody, Makhele said.“A manhunt has been launched for all persons of interest in this particular case,"" she said.According to media reports, Bester has been spotted shopping in Johannesburg's upmarket Sandton area and has been romantically linked to a prominent celebrity doctor.While in prison Bester used a laptop he had for studies to run an event and production company, according to the GroundUp report. At one point he addressed a conference from his prison cell, wearing a tie and telling other attendees that he was speaking from the U.S., said the report.The Mangaung prison is currently being run by Britain-based private security firm G4S which was awarded a contract to administer the facility until 2026, according South Africa's Department of Correctional Services. The department has no intention to renew the contract, it said in a statement.“No stone will be left unturned in getting to the bottom of Thabo Bester’s escape and there will be serious consequences for any party involved,” said Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850500,US Westinghouse to supply fuel to both Czech nuclear plants,"PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech Republic’s power company on Wednesday signed a deal with U.S. energy giant Westinghouse Electric Co. to supply nuclear fuel for the Dukovany nuclear plant, eliminating the country’s dependence on Russia for such fuel.State-controlled power company CEZ said that Pennsylvania-based Westinghouse will start fuel deliveries to Dukovany next year.Russia’s TVEL, which is part of Russian energy giant Rosatom, was previously the sole supplier of fuel for the Soviet-era plant.CEZ said Westinghouse expedited fuel development for Dokovany at the behest of the Czech government following Russia's invasion of Ukraine 13 months ago.CEZ chief executive Daniel Benes called the deal a significant boost for energy security. The power company said it currently has enough fuel for next three years.”We are proud to be the first Western alternative with a proven fuel design for this type of units,” Tarik Choho, president of Westinghouse Nuclear Fuel, said.CEZ last year selected Westinghouse and France’s Framatome to supply fuel for the Czech Republic's other, Temelin nuclear plant. The country's six nuclear reactors generate more than a third of its total electricity needs.CEZ operates four 510-megawatt units at the Dukovany power plant and another two 1,000-megawatt reactors at the Temelin plant.Unlike its western neighbors Austria and Germany, the Czech Republic is doubling down on nuclear power in conjunction with renewable energy sources after deciding to phase out coal as a fuel for energy generation by 2033.CEZ launched a tender last year for a new reactor at the Dukovany nuclear plant as the country aims to increase nuclear power generation.Russia’s Rosatom and China’s CNG were excluded from the tender on security grounds.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850501,Review: Charming 'Rye Lane' is a rom-com to celebrate,"Yas and Dom meet-cute in the best possible way in the new rom-com “Rye Lane.”They're paired up at a karaoke bar by chance and simply slay, leaving the crowd demanding more and chanting their names. The new couple recognize ""an immediate, deep animal attraction.”No, not really.That's just the made-up story Yas tells Dom's cheating ex-girlfriend to make her jealous and signal he's moved on. It works: Even the ex's new lover calls it “hands-down the greatest hook-up story of all time.”How these two 20-somethings actually hook up is the subject of this sweet, down-to-earth, funny and thoughtful rom-com that shows two strangers moving though London and visibly falling in love over a matter of hours.David Jonsson is Dom, the fresh agony of being dumped and cheated on after six years visible on his broken shoulders. Vivian Oparah is Yas, also newly single, but seemingly stronger. He's a little mousy, an accountant; she's vivacious, a fledgling fashion designer.“Apparently there are two kinds of people in this world,"" she says. ""The ones that wave at boats and the ones who hate joy.” She waves at boats.Director Raine Allen-Miller makes a stunning full-length debut, keeping the action deeply grounded in South London but also capturing pure flights of fancy, like when a stranger in a cowboy outfit suddenly screams out “Boring!” when Dom reveals he’s an accountant or when Yas recreates a breaking point in her old relationship on a fictional theater stage with a hundred Doms in the audience.Screenwriters Nathan Bryon and Tom Melia perfectly capture modern slang, like when Yas describes her ex: “He was trying to dilute my squash. And I was like, ‘Not today, Satan'” or when she calls the boyfriend of Dom's ex a “jobless, useless bin fire.”The movie has a delicious mix of references that viewers can enjoy from both sides of the Atlantic, from “The Wire” and A Tribe Called Quest to sausage rolls and the Crufts dog show. A scene that uses a Terence Trent D’Arby song will have folks laughing, as one with Salt-N-Pepa's “Shoop.”“I don’t know how this day is going to end, but as weird as it’s been, it’s also been one of the greatest days ever,” says Dom.And in a wonderful nod to another English rom-com — “Love Actually” — our would-be couple grab lunch at a Mexican food stall called Love Guac’tually and are served by one of that OG film's stars, Colin Firth.The last third of the film sweeps along like an adrenaline high, with romantic moped rides, minor breaking-and-entering, some brutal words and laughter.How did Dom and Yas really meet? The opening sequence shows an overhead shot of unisex bathroom stalls and finally rests on one man sobbing as he revisits Instagram photos of him and his ex. It's Dom, amid the peeing and tears.“Everything all right in there?” Yas asks. “Yep, fine,” he replies, lying.Some 80 minutes later, he will be. So will you.“Rye Lane,” a Searchlight Pictures release, is rated R for “language, some sexual content and nudity.” Running time: 79 minutes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850528,"Google, others say Uganda anti-LGBTQ bill bad for business","KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — A business group including corporate giants such as Google says it opposes Uganda's anti-LGBTQ legislation, calling it “a concern for global businesses and investors operating or planning to invest” in the East African country.The legislation, which prescribes the death penalty or life imprisonment for some homosexual offenses, would hurt Uganda's economy, the Open For Business coalition said in a statement Wednesday. “Diversity and inclusion are core principles of our coalition partners in the conduct of their businesses,” the statement said.The legislation, if signed into law by President Yoweri Museveni, “would undermine Uganda's attractiveness as a place to do business and invest,” it said.In addition to Google, the Open For Business coalition includes companies such as Microsoft, MasterCard, HSBC and Facebook owner Meta.Uganda's legislature last week passed the anti-homosexuality bill. The legislation is now with Museveni, who can sign it into law or return it back to the parliamentary speaker with proposed changes.The bill has wide support in Uganda, including among church leaders. It was introduced last month by an opposition lawmaker who said his goal was to punish the “promotion, recruitment and funding” of LGBTQ activities in the country. Only two of 389 legislators present for the voting session opposed the bill.Museveni, who has publicly described homosexuals as “disgusting,” faces growing international condemnation of the bill. The United States, the United Nations and the European Union have urged him to block the bill. Washington in particular has warned of possible economic consequences if the legislation is enacted.The bill prescribes the death penalty for the offense of “aggravated homosexuality” and life imprisonment for “homosexuality,"" drawing fears that those who identify as LGBTQ people can be criminally prosecuted. Aggravated homosexuality is defined as cases of sex relations involving those infected with HIV as well as minors and other categories of vulnerable people. Jail terms of up to 20 years are proposed for those who advocate or promote the rights of LGBTQ people.A suspect convicted of “attempted aggravated homosexuality” can be jailed for 14 years and the offense of “attempted homosexuality” is punishable by up to 10 years, according to the bill.The death penalty for some acts of homosexuality “is an egregious violation of human rights,” a group of U.N. experts said Wednesday.“The imposition of the death penalty based on such legislation is per se an arbitrary killing and a breach of article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),” the experts said in a statement.The leader of a Ugandan LGBTQ rights group says that many in the country's gay community fear for their safety.Anti-gay sentiment in Uganda has grown in recent weeks amid press reports alleging sodomy in boarding schools, including a prestigious one for boys where a parent accused a teacher of abusing her son. The recent decision of the Church of England to bless civil marriages of same-sex couples also has inflamed many, including some who see homosexuality as imported from abroad.Homosexuality is criminalized in more than 30 of Africa’s 54 countries.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850529,Pope to be hospitalized for days with respiratory infection,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis was hospitalized with a respiratory infection Wednesday after experiencing difficulty breathing in recent days and will remain in the Rome hospital for several days of treatment, the Vatican said.The 86-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, doesn't have COVID-19, spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement late Wednesday.The hospitalization was the first since Francis spent 10 days at the Gemelli hospital in July 2021 to have 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed.It immediately raised questions about Francis' overall health, and his ability to celebrate the busy Holy Week events that are due to begin this weekend with Palm Sunday.Bruni said Francis had had trouble breathing in recent days and went to the Gemelli hospital Wednesday for tests.“The tests showed a respiratory infection (COVID-19 infection excluded) that will require some days of medical treatment in the hospital,” Bruni's statement said.Francis appeared in relatively good form during his regularly scheduled general audience earlier Wednesday, though he grimaced strongly while getting in and out of the “popemobile.” He nevertheless rode around the square as usual, kissing babies and greeting the faithful.Bruni said Francis, an Argentine Jesuit, was grateful for the prayers and messages wishing him a speedy recovery, including from the Italian bishops conference.President Joe Biden, at the start of an Oval Office meeting with President Alberto Fernández of Argentina, told reporters he had just learned of Francis’s health problems and said he was concerned about his dear “friend.”Francis had part of one lung removed when he was a young man due to a respiratory infection, and he often speaks in a whisper. But he got through the worst phases of the COVID-19 pandemic without at least any public word of ever testing positive.Francis was scheduled to celebrate Palm Sunday this weekend, kicking off the Vatican's Holy Week observances: Holy Thursday, Good Friday, the Easter Vigil and finally Easter Sunday on April 9. He has canceled all audiences through Friday, but it wasn't clear whether he could keep the Holy Week plans.Francis has used a wheelchair for over a year due to strained ligaments in his right knee and a small knee fracture. He has said the injury was healing and been walking more with a cane of late.Francis also has said he resisted having surgery for the knee problems because he didn't respond well to general anesthesia during the 2021 intestinal surgery.He said soon after the surgery that he had recovered fully and could eat normally. But in a Jan. 24 interview with The Associated Press, Francis said his diverticulosis, or bulges in the intestinal wall, had “returned.""",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850530,Permit to buy handgun no longer required in North Carolina,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina residents can now buy a handgun without getting a permit from a local sheriff, after the Republican-controlled legislature on Wednesday overrode the Democratic governor’s veto — a first since 2018.The House voted 71-46 to enact the bill, which eliminates the longstanding permit system requiring sheriffs to perform character evaluations and criminal history checks of pistol applicants. The Senate overrode Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto in a party-line vote on Tuesday.The permit repeal takes effect immediately. Cooper and Democratic lawmakers warned it allows a greater number of dangerous people to obtain weapons through private sales, which do not require a background check, and limits law enforcement’s ability to prevent them from committing violent crimes.Those who purchase pistols from a gun store or a federally licensed dealer are still subject to a national background check, and concealed weapons permits are still required.Bill supporters say the sheriff screening process for handguns was no longer necessary in light of significant updates to the national background check system. They also argue the permit system wasn’t very effective at preventing criminals from obtaining guns.The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association supports the repeal in light of national system updates, but its current president does not.Although Republican seat gains in the midterm elections gave them veto-proof margins in the Senate, they were one seat shy of a similar majority in the House.Wednesday’s House vote tally showed three Democrats — Reps. Tricia Cotham of Mecklenburg County, Cecil Brockman of Guilford County and Michael Wray of Northampton County — failed to vote on the override, creating enough of a margin to meet the constitutional requirement. Republicans needed at least one Democratic member to join them, or as few as two Democrats not to vote.Brockman was in urgent care Wednesday morning, according to a statement released by his office. Cotham said in a statement that she was receiving scheduled hospital treatment and had informed both parties that she would be absent. She said she does not support the permit repeal.A phone message left at Wray's legislative office wasn't immediately returned Wednesday. Republicans gave Wray and Cotham key committee chairmanships this year — a rarity for the majority party in power.A liberal-leaning group called Carolina Forward put out a fundraising tweet soon after the vote targeting the three representatives, vowing to “hold them accountable.”House Speaker Tim Moore, a Cleveland County Republican presiding over the chamber during the override vote, said the provisions contained within the bill “have been long-standing goals of Second Amendment advocates in our state, and we have finally brought this legislation over the finish line.”Moore used parliamentary maneuvers Wednesday to block floor debate before the vote, causing frustration among Democrats.Cooper, who is term-limited from seeking reelection next year, criticized the the move by House leadership, saying in a tweet that arguments to uphold his veto would have been “too compelling for them to hear.”Before the Senate vote Tuesday, some Democrats urged against loosening gun access in the immediate aftermath of Monday's mass shooting at a private Christian school in Nashville, despite Republicans' insistence that lawmakers refrain from politicizing the shooting.“For us to come in this tone deaf about what happened in Nashville and to pretend that it doesn't matter, to pretend that that might not be an issue that we've got to bring up, is disturbing — with a bunch of kids sitting up here,"" said House Minority Leader Robert Reives, referring to the school group watching from the gallery.While Reives said he asked all Democratic caucus members to be present, he refused to criticize those who were absent or didn't vote. The Chatham County Democrat told reporters the permit repeal could allow domestic abusers and mentally ill people at risk of suicide to obtain guns.The enacted bill also will allow guns on some school properties where religious services are held, effective Dec. 1. The new law also creates and funds a two-year awareness campaign on the safe storage of firearms, which will distribute free gun locks.In 2021, Cooper successfully blocked standalone versions of the pistol permit repeal and another provision allowing people with concealed weapons permits to carry openly or under clothing at houses of worship where private or charter schools also meet. At the time, Democrats had enough seats to block any override attempt if they stayed united. Those pistol and religious worship provisions were essentially unchanged when combined into this year’s bill.Guns will not be permitted on campus during school hours or when students are present for extracurricular activities, and houses of worship can opt out by posting signs.Gun-rights advocates celebrated the override after trying for years to pass the pistol permit repeal.“Second Amendment supporters made history today,” said Paul Valone, executive director of Grass Roots North Carolina, which campaigned last year for candidates so that Republican majorities could override Cooper’s gun-related vetoes.Gun-control advocates lamented the override, saying the handgun permit elimination would imperil more people’s lives in the nation’s ninth-largest state.“We will wake up five or 10 years from now and see that our gun homicide and gun suicide rates have risen,” Becky Ceartas with North Carolinians Against Gun Violence said in a news release.___Hannah Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850531,Should U.S. airlines pay passengers for delays like the EU?,"Southwest Airlines spent the early part of 2023 trying to make good after a historic meltdown resulted in more than 16,700 canceled flights during the 2022 holidays. The airline reimbursed passengers for the cost of alternative travel arrangements and sent many travelers additional loyalty points.Southwest wasn’t legally required to. The U.S. has no federal laws mandating that airlines compensate passengers for delays. Airlines are only obligated to offer refund s if they cancel a flight and the passenger decides not to travel.That’s hardly the case in Europe. An EU regulation, commonly referred to as EU261, requires airlines to compensate travelers for cancellations, denied boarding or delays of two or more hours. It went into effect in 2005 and applies to most flights operated by airlines based in the 27 EU countries, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.As long as the flight wasn’t disrupted due to an “extraordinary circumstance” such as weather, passengers are entitled to compensation from 250 euros (about $260) to 600 euros (about $630), depending on the length of flight and delay. Some passengers are also entitled to free meals and accommodations.HAS EU261 ACTUALLY REDUCED DELAYS?Given the financial pressure to pay out passengers, it might seem airlines are incentivized to stay on schedule, but some studies show that it might not help with being on time at all. Even when it does, there might only be marginal improvements. A 2018 study from the European University Institute concluded flights regulated by EU261 are 5% more likely to arrive on time, resulting in an average arrival delay reduction per flight of just 3.9 minutes.NEW PROBLEMS INTRODUCED BY EU261Experts say EU261 has spawned new challenges. For one thing, the definition of “extraordinary circumstances” for delays (upon which airlines don’t have to pay out) remains unclear. After all, the point at which a storm morphs beyond manageable is debatable. The government also never established a consistent process to file claims, and many airlines make it difficult to do so.For airlines, there are also the added administrative costs of processing claims, as well as potentially more idle aircraft and schedule padding to help prevent delays. Some experts worry that financial pressure might compel staff to rush through or ignore potential issues, presenting unnecessary safety and technical risks.WHO LOSES AND WINS UNDER POLICIES LIKE EU261?LOSERS: AIRLINES (ESPECIALLY SMALL, REGIONAL ONES)Some experts suggest that regulations especially hurt small airlines that can’t afford to have spare aircraft on standby or software to handle the compensation claims. The fixed payout amounts to passengers can have an outsized impact on shorter routes or budget airfares.“Compensating 250 euros on a flight that costs 50 euros is clearly absurd,” said former Flybe CEO Christine Ourmières-Widener in a testimonial generated for a 2019 report published by the European Regions Airline Association. Flybe is a now-defunct British regional airline.MOSTLY WINNERS: PASSENGERSDelays can cost passengers via time, inconvenience and stress, and sometimes literal expenses like food and lodging. Government laws mandating compensation can alleviate that burden if passengers are willing to put in the time to file the paperwork.Raj Mahal, founder of PlanMoreTrips, an app that helps travelers find cheap airfares, was flying home to Barcelona after spending the 2022 winter holidays in Portugal. His TAP Air Portugal flight was delayed by three hours, which the airline blamed on weather (though Mahal says other flights were departing).Mahal filed a claim through TAP’s Self Service feature, but the airline initially offered him just half of what he felt he was entitled to. It wasn’t until after he fired off an angry tweet (which the airline responded to) that he felt he received fair compensation.The rate of passengers claiming compensation has increased, suggesting more people are getting money for their inconvenience. In 2018, 38% of eligible passengers claimed compensation, up from just 8% in 2011, according to a 2021 European Commission study.WINNERS: THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS AGENCIESThat uptick in passengers claiming compensation is in part due to the proliferation of claims agencies, such as AirHelp. These third-party claims agencies help passengers navigate the claims process, but often take a cut of compensation. For example, AirHelp typically takes a 35% cut of the traveler’s compensation.While companies such as AirHelp credibly threaten to sue airlines that don’t comply and help customers navigate the claims process, they also charge a fee to distressed passengers — in turn profiting off EU261.SHOULD THE U.S. ADOPT SIMILAR REGULATIONS?If the goal is financial incentives to increase on-time flights, U.S. airlines may already have that. Even without government-required compensation, delays cost airlines $8.3 billion in increased expenses, including crew, fuel and maintenance in 2019, according to the FAA Office of Aviation Policy and Plans.Ten major U.S. airlines have also made customer service commitments for flights canceled or delayed by three hours or more. That includes rebooking passengers and offering meal vouchers. Most promise hotel accommodations, too. However, none are required to do so by law.Southwest reported a revenue loss of $410 million during the 2022 fourth quarter, attributed to the December 2022 disruptions, which was just part of their $800 million overall loss. Factoring in the first quarter of 2023, the meltdown cost Southwest more than $1 billion after accounting for lost revenue and passenger reimbursements.“Southwest is being punished for this,” says Robert Poole, director of transportation policy for the Reason Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank. “Anybody caught up in the 2022 snafu won’t want to take a chance on this airline again. Southwest lost business and market value. That’s more powerful than anything Congress can do.”Meanwhile, Mahal has successfully received compensation for shorter disruptions, such as a two-hour delay on an American Airlines flight last month between Austin and Albuquerque.He emailed American and — within 48 hours — the airline deposited 5,000 miles (worth about $75) into his AAdvantage account.Even still, Mahal, who is American but lives in Spain, says he prefers the EU’s clear passenger protections.“The current U.S. system is extremely broken and a joke,” he says. “There needs to be some basic passenger protection laws because the status quo isn’t working.”The Flight Compensation Regulation of the European Union has aided passengers in receiving more consistent compensation for delays. However, despite calls from advocates for the idea to be implemented in the United States, the regulation does not appear to be making waves.________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850532,"Green groups slam German government's energy, climate deal","BERLIN (AP) — Environmental groups have criticized a deal between Germany’s three governing parties on energy and climate policies, saying Wednesday that it risks watering down essential measures to curb global warming.The agreement announced Tuesday followed three days of intense haggling and weeks of discord that threatened to paralyze Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government. It eases requirements for new home heating systems and allows for the construction and expansion of Germany's highways, while also providing more money for the country's rail network.But Germany's BUND environmental group accused Scholz of giving in to “expensive false solutions” and ignoring warnings contained in a recent U.N. climate report about the need for drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“Accelerating the planning process for up to 144 Autobahn projects is a fatal signal at a time of climate crisis,” the group's head, Olaf Brandt, said.Brandt also criticized planned subsidies for synthetic vehicle fuels, or e-fuels, arguing they would promote a technology that is inefficient and expensive compared to electric cars that run on batteries.The environmental group Germanwatch also expressed disappointment with the agreement, calling it a “step back not forward for climate protection.” The group claimed the government's plans would create loopholes that weaken the rules by which Germany seeks to meet its climate goals.The deal received support from the Federation of German Industries, a powerful lobbying group known by its German acronym BDI. The umbrella group welcomed the government's decision to allow vehicles powered by e-fuels and the installation of conventional gas heaters if they can be converted to use hydrogen or biofuels.Speaking to lawmakers Wednesday, Scholz said the agreement would ensure that “nobody is left alone” as Germany seeks to become climate neutral by 2045.Addressing the center-right opposition party of former Chancellor Angela Merkel, who governed Germany for 16 years, Scholz said, ""The stagnation of the past decades, which we owe to conservative policies, is finally over.""A senior German government official cautioned that the new rules for heating systems should not obscure the fact that electric heat pumps — favored by environmentalists — are cheaper in the long run than gas furnaces because of the predicted rise in fossil fuel prices in the coming years.___Follow AP's coverage of climate issues at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850534,What did players learn about MLB's new rules this spring?,"PHOENIX (AP) — It was the defining moment of the recently finished World Baseball Classic: Japan's star pitcher Shohei Ohtani vs. United States slugger Mike Trout. Ninth inning. Two outs. One-run game.Team USA pitcher Merrill Kelly said the storybook scene was just as dramatic for the players in the dugout as it was for fans watching. But he also admitted there was a thought that crept through his head.“How are we possibly going to put a pitch clock on a situation like this?” Kelly said.Well, we're about to find out.Major League Baseball's new rules package is set for its regular-season debut Thursday when all 30 teams play their first game. For many fans, it'll be the first time seeing the sport's sizable list of rules changes, including a pitch clock, limits on infield shifts and bigger bases. They've been tested in spring exhibitions but weren't used in the WBC.“This is the next level — having the rules applied in games that matter,"" said Diamondbacks three-time All-Star Evan Longoria. ""Nobody's getting numbers stamped on the back of a baseball card during spring training.“I think this is going to be a huge adjustment.”The good news for baseball is that the rules changes have been widely praised during spring training. Games move at a noticeably crisper pace: MLB says spring games averaged about 2 hours, 35 minutes through the first three weeks, 26 minutes shorter than spring games last season.The limitations on the infield shift haven’t been a particularly big concern. The bigger bases — which could help curb collisions and injuries — have hardly been noticed.MLB has also shown a willingness to listen to feedback from players. Last week, the commissioner's office sent a memo trying to clarify some rules issues from spring training.But everyone knows the real test begins Thursday.“I think there will be a lot more gamesmanship during the regular season,"" Cubs pitcher Drew Smyly said.Some of that showed in spring training. New York Mets ace Max Scherzer and other pitchers tried weaponizing the pitch clock, hurrying hitters or waiting them out within the bounds of the 15-second timer — 20 seconds with someone on base — to mess with their timing.“Really, the power the pitcher has now — I can totally dictate pace,"" the three-time Cy Young Award winner said.The cat-and-mouse game between pitchers and would-be base stealers will be particularly intriguing during the season's opening weeks. Pitchers can only disengage from the rubber twice in each at-bat, meaning limited chances for pickoff attempts. If a pitcher disengages a third time and doesn’t record an out, a balk is called and all runners advance one base.Stolen bases and stolen base attempts during spring training increased about 50% over the numbers from last year's spring games.And they could jump again in the regular season.“We didn't want to tip our hand, to be honest with you,” D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said of his team's running strategy. “But trust me, we're working on things behind the scenes.”The emphasis on athleticism is at the core of what MLB wants in its 2023 games, and the sport has been aggressive in its marketing. A recent video on MLB.com — with the cheeky title “Get that shift … outta here!” — featured ‘Breaking Bad’ actor Bryan Cranston celebrating the changes.So far, it seems players and coaches are cautiously optimistic the rule changes will be a good thing.Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw said the idea of a pitch clock was much more scary than the actual pitch clock.“I find myself staring at it and thinking about it more than I probably need to,” the three-time NL Cy Young winner said. ""As we get going into the regular season, I don’t think it will affect me.”San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler said he expects the new rules to take some of the mind games out of baseball.“Before you could step out of the batter’s box and catch your breath, look up at the sky, take your time getting back in,” Kapler said. “The worst you would get is the umpire saying, ‘Let’s go’. Now there is a real penalty for it.""Taking all the thoughts out of your head. I think it will be most advantageous for the athletes.”The Ohtani vs. Trout showdown in the WBC — which ended with Ohtani striking out his Los Angeles Angels teammate to preserve a 3-2 victory for Japan — wasn't subject to this year's rules.Would the pitch clock make that situation move a little more briskly? Sure.But Lovullo — the Diamondbacks manager — said the good of the new rules outweighs the bad. He was watching the U.S. play Mexico during the WBC a few weeks ago when he felt the game dragging a little. At first, he thought it was the eighth inning.Then he realized it was just the third.Suddenly, a pitch clock didn't sound so bad.“I've adjusted and I think everyone's adjusted,"" Lovullo said. “I think the rules are really good.”___AP freelance writer Gary Schatz in Arizona contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850535,Social issues dominate in Women's Hall of Fame's new class,"SENECA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) — A new group of National Women's Hall of Fame inductees includes social justice pioneers, groundbreaking physicians and women who have championed Jewish feminist theology and the financial well-being of Native Americans, the institute announced Wednesday.“When I was a young girl, I wanted above all to be popular. By the time I was 35, I decided I would rather be useful than popular,"" inductee Peggy McIntosh, an activist known for her explorations of privilege, said by email after the honorees were announced.She and the other living inductees — Kimberlé Crenshaw, Judith Plaskow, Loretta Ross and Allucquére Rosanne “Sandy” Stone — have helped drive issues of white privilege, systemic racism, reproductive justice, transgender studies and feminist theology into the public discourse.Three women will be inducted posthumously: Dr. Patricia Bath (1942-2019), an early pioneer of laser cataract surgery and the first Black woman physician to receive a medical patent; Dr. Anna Wessels Williams (1863-1954), who isolated a strain of diphtheria that helped in its treatment; and Elouise Pepion Cobell, known as “Yellow Bird Woman” (1945-2011), who started the first bank established by a tribe on a reservation in Browning, Montana.Located in Seneca Falls, New York, the site of the first Woman's Rights Convention in 1848, the National Women's Hall of Fame inducts a new class every other year to recognize women's contributions in fields like the arts, sports, education and government.“In the five decades since its first Induction Ceremony in 1973, the Hall has continued to lift the voices and stories of exceptional women who changed the world,” Jennifer Gabriel, executive director of the National Women’s Hall of Fame, said in a news release.McIntosh, 88, has written widely about privilege, including in her 1989 essay, “White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack,” in which she described “an invisible package of unearned assets” that white people, but not necessarily Black people, can count on in everyday life.“I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed. ... I can be sure that my children will be given curricular materials that testify to the existence of their race,” she wrote.Crenshaw, 63, helped develop the academic concept of critical race theory, the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions. The academic framework dates back to the 1970s, but the phrase has become a political flashpoint in recent years as parents and politicians debate how race and American history should be taught in public schools.Plaskow, 76, is regarded as the first Jewish feminist theologian for calling out an absence of female perspectives in Jewish history.“We must render visible the presence, experience and deeds of women erased in our traditional sources,” she wrote in her groundbreaking 1990 book, “Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective.”Ross, 69, founded the National Center for Human Rights Education in Atlanta. The Smith College professor and 2022 MacArthur Fellowship recipient has drawn on her experiences as a survivor of rape and nonconsensual sterilization to advocate for reproductive justice — a theory she helped to create — especially among women of color.Stone, a transgender woman born in 1936, is considered a founder of the academic discipline of transgender studies and is founding director of the Advanced Communication Technologies Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. She came to academics after a career as a sound engineer for Jimi Hendrix, the Grateful Dead and other musicians in the 1960s and 1970s. She is the station engineer for radio station KSQD in Santa Cruz.Inductees are nominated by the public and judged by a panel of experts across the nominees' fields, according to the National Women’s Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony is scheduled for Sept. 30.“This wonderful recognition by the National Women’s Hall of Fame honors what the Hall sees as lasting usefulness,” McIntosh wrote. “I admire the values of the Hall in this year’s inductees. Each of us eight women tried to be of use, starting from where we were.”",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850536,Indonesia stripped of hosting Under-20 World Cup by FIFA,"GENEVA (AP) — Indonesia was stripped of hosting rights for the Under-20 World Cup on Wednesday only eight weeks before the start of the tournament amid political turmoil regarding Israel's participation.FIFA said Indonesia was removed from staging the 24-team tournament scheduled to start on May 20 “due to the current circumstances” without specifying details.The decision followed a meeting in Doha, Qatar between Indonesian soccer federation president Erick Thohir and Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, soccer's world governing body.Israel qualified in June of last year for its first Under-20 World Cup. But the country's participation in the official draw for tournament groups, scheduled to be held Friday in Bali, provoked political opposition this month.Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation and does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel, while publicly supporting the Palestinian cause.Indonesia’s host status for the tournament was cast into doubt last Sunday when FIFA postponed the draw.It is unclear who could now host the tournament, which was scheduled to be played in six stadiums in Indonesia. Argentina, which did not qualify for the tournament, is reportedly interested in hosting.“A new host will be announced as soon as possible, with the dates of the tournament currently remaining unchanged,” FIFA said.The Indonesian soccer federation could be further disciplined by FIFA. A suspension could remove Indonesia from Asian qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. The continental qualifiers start in October.FIFA seemed to remove all blame Wednesday from Thohir, the former president of Italian club Inter Milan — the team Infantino supports — and a former co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers.FIFA staff will continue to work in Indonesia in the months ahead, the governing body said, “under the leadership of President Thohir.”Thohir said as a member of FIFA, Indonesia had little choice but to accept the decision.“I have tried my best,” he said in a statement. “After delivering a letter from President Joko Widodo and discussing it at length with the President of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, we must accept FIFA’s decision to cancel the holding of the event that we are both looking forward to.”He said although he'd conveyed all the concerns and hopes of Indonesia's president, soccer lovers as well as the players from the Under-20 Indonesian national team, “FIFA considered that the current situation cannot be continued.”Soccer and public authorities in Indonesia agreed to FIFA’s hosting requirements in 2019 before being selected to stage the 2021 edition of the Under-20 World Cup. The coronavirus pandemic forced the tournament to be postponed for two years.But Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Tuesday evening that his administration objected to Israel’s participation. He told citizens that the country agreed to host before knowing Israel would qualify.However, the removal of the hosting rights by FIFA has raised concerns within Indonesian soccer.Arya Sinulingga, an executive committee member of Indonesia’s national soccer association PSSI, was concerned about further repercussions.“This is a sign that we are not able to carry out what has been asked (by FIFA) ... among other things that there should be no discrimination,” Sinulingga said in an interview with a local television, “What we are most worried about right now is that we will be ostracized from international events, especially from world soccer activities.”He said that “it can happen and it will be very detrimental to us in many ways.”“We have something that is bigger than losing our right to host the Under-20 World Cup. We have to face it in the near future, and that could effect the future of our sport,” Sinulingga said, “We are now fighting not to get sanctioned, but people should know ... this is too hard.”Israel qualified for the tournament by reaching the semifinals of the Under-19 European Championship. The team went on to lose to England in that final.Israel plays in Europe as a member of UEFA after leaving the Asian Football Confederation in the 1970s for political and security reasons.FIFA bills the men's Under-20 World Cup as “the tournament of tomorrow’s superstars.”Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Paul Pogba are previous winners of the official player of the tournament award, and Erling Haaland was the top scorer at the 2019 edition.___Associated Press writers Niniek Karmini and Edna Tarigan contributed to this report from Jakarta, Indonesia.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850635,France's Constitutional Council to rule on pension reform,"France's Constitutional Council is set to issue on April 14 a verdict on the constitutionality of the government's much contested pension reform bill, it said on Wednesday, as protests against the bill continue.The bill, which delays standard retirement age by two years to 64, has been met with wide opposition, though it would still leave France with one of Europe's more generous retirement plans.The government had to pass it by decree, bypassing a vote in the lower house of parliament.This sparked massive protests, yet President Emmanuel Macron continued to back the reform, saying it was necessary to keep France's pension system solvent.The government has expressed willingness to talk to unions, with Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne offering a meeting next Monday and Tuesday.The council has the jurisdiction to scrap some or all of the bill, if it is deemed unconstitutional. In practice, it rarely ever strikes down entire bills.Opposition parties are calling on the council to scrap the bill on procedural grounds. In parliament, the government had set a tight deadline for debating the bill, then bypassed a final vote on it.The government has meanwhile invited unions for talks next week.Laurent Berger, the head of the CFDT union, said he would take part in the meeting, but only to stress the demand of suspending the bill.""Unions are not going to go to discuss something else,"" he told broadcaster franceinfo. ""I'll go there to explain that this reform is a dead end.""Berger added that the government needed to understand the level of rejection of the bill, as well as the resentment regarding the way it was handled.Protests and strikes against the reformms have been ongoing since the beginning of the year. But they intensified after the bill was passed by decree, at times even taking a violent turn.rmt/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/29,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850636,Number of usable nuclear warheads increased in 2022 — report,"The number of nuclear warheads that states could deploy reached a total of 9,576 at the beginning of 2023, up from 9,440 the previous year, according to a report published by the NGO Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) on Wednesday.The Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor report, said that the weaponized nuclear power amounted to a ""collective destructive power of more than 135,000 Hiroshima bombs.""The issue of nuclear weapons has become its most prominent since the end of the Cold War thanks in part to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent aggressive rhetoric, as well as fears over Iran's nuclear program and North Korea's renewed missile tests.Wednesday's report pointed out that the total number of warheads has decreased because the US and Russia dismantle some of their older weapons every year.However, NPA's Grethe Ostern warned that the construction of new warheads may soon outpace the dismantling of old ones.""This increase is worrying, and continues a trend that started in 2017. If this does not stop, we will soon see an increase also in the total number of nuclear weapons in the world for the first time since the Cold War,"" she said.Some five countries are responsible for the increase in ready-to-use warheads, according to Hans M. Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists and contributor to the Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor.""Russia, China, India, North Korea, and Pakistan continued to expand their stockpiles of warheads in 2022, bringing about a corresponding increase of 136 warheads also in the global total of stockpiled warheads available for use by the military,"" Kristensen said.Russian President Vladimir Putin recently ramped up nuclear tensions by announcing that so-called ""tactical"" nuclear weapons would be deployed in Belarus, on the EU's border.He justified the move by pointing to the presence of US nuclear weapons in various countries close to Russia over the years, including Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.Russia has the world's largest nuclear weapons stockpile.The total number of nuclear warheads reached a peak of 70,000 in 1986 at the height of tensions between the US and the Soviet Union, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.This number was down to 12,512 in 2023, but still enough to bring an end to life on the planet as we know it.""The Ukraine crisis has demonstrated that nuclear weapons do not create peace and stability. They don't deter aggression, but enable conventional wars and incentivize risk-taking that could lead to nuclear war,"" NPA's Secretary General Henriette Westhrin said.ab/msh (AFP)",2023/03/29,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850637,Taiwan-China: What's behind ex-leader Ma Ying-jeou's visit?,"The visit to China is not official, but it is historic — this week, former Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou became the first current or former leader from the self-ruled island to travel to mainland China since the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949. Ma has also brought a delegation of students and academics with him to conduct what he has described as a mission to ""improve the cross-strait atmosphere"" through the enthusiasm and interaction of young people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.His 12-day trip is being closely followed in Taiwan, China, and around the world. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which is in charge of cross-strait relations, said Ma should consider expectations from Taiwan's civil society as he embarked on the trip. Some lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) cautioned him not to fall into Beijing's ""cognitive traps.""China views Taiwan as part of its territory and believes the two should one day be unified either through peaceful means or military force if necessary.China's Taiwan Affairs Office has welcomed Ma and expressed willingness to provide assistance during his 12-day tour in China. When the former president landed in Shanghai on Monday, he was greeted by senior officials from the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Taiwan Work Office and the party's Shanghai Municipal Committee. A meeting with President Xi Jinping is not on the cards.Just ahead of the visit, Taipei lost another diplomatic ally, Honduras, to China, reducing the number of countries that recognize Taiwan as an independent nation to 13. On Wednesday, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen started a trip to Central America and the US, during which she is expected to meet US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California and deliver a public speech.The contrast in Ma and Tsai's destinations reflects the two main factors dominating Taiwan's foreign policy agenda. Since taking over from Ma in 2016, Tsai Ing-wen has strengthened bilateral relations with the US. At the same time, tensions between Taipei and Beijing have escalated.Ma's party, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), has been pushing to restart cross-strait exchanges after a three-year interruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, the KMT's deputy chairperson, Andrew Hsia, took a delegation to China and met with several high-level CCP officials in charge of Beijing's Taiwan strategy.""I think the idea that China remains the most important relation for the KMT is still very true,"" said Sana Hashmi, a postdoctoral fellow at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation in Taiwan. ""Ma is trying to form a narrative that the KMT is for peace and restoring cross-strait ties while the ruling party DPP could lead Taiwan to conflicts.""Ma's trip to China also carries a lot of political implications in Taiwan itself. Some analysts say the ex-president may be trying to ""re-establish his political legacy"" with his party carefully balancing political goals.""The KMT wants to show they have meaningful relations with China but that message can't be so strong that it seems they are conceding to China,"" said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at the National Chengchi University (NCCU) in Taiwan. ""They are really trying to strike a balance here.""Other analysts have pointed out that Ma has focused the trip on facilitating exchanges between young people from Taiwan and China. This apparently shows that he hopes to help restore civil interaction and reduce hostility across the Taiwan Strait.""Before he left for China, Ma's office emphasized that he wouldn't go to Beijing and he wouldn't meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping,"" said Da-Jung Li, a professor of international relations and strategic studies at Tamkang University in Taiwan. ""I think he has carefully chosen the places he'll visit in order to avoid excessive political interpretation.""During his presidency from 2008 to 2016, Ma prioritized closer ties between Beijing and Taipei. However, his efforts prompted large-scale protests when he attempted to push through a controversial cross-strait trade pact in 2014. His decision to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Singapore in 2015, the first-ever top-level meeting between China and Taiwan, added to the backlash against him and the KMT.On Tuesday, Ma emphasized that people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are all ethnically Chinese and they share the same ancestors. He also helped complete a banner with a message urging the pursuit of peace and ""Revitalizing China.""While the KMT tries to take initiatives to restart cross-strait exchanges, some analysts say the terms and conditions to fulfill bilateral dialogue are dictated by China. Chen Fang-Yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan, points out that even though Taiwanese authorities continue to view dialogue with Beijing as beneficial to cross-strait relations, Beijing has been the one to cut off communication or exchanges with Taipei over the last few years.""Whether Ma can change Beijing's decision-making pattern through this visit is hard to say,"" Chen told DW. ""Beijing only wants to interact with Taiwanese individuals or organizations if they pledge to oppose Taiwan independence and support unification. These are conditions that Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party won't agree to.""With the next presidential election in Taiwan only 10 months away, Ma's visit to China could become a campaign issue. Over the years, the KMT has advocated for a friendlier relationship with the CCP while the DPP has been a staunch defender of Taiwan's sovereignty. Closer ties with Beijing could be a tough sell in this election cycle, as the level of skepticism and negative views toward China has risen among Taiwanese voters as China's stance has become increasingly aggressive.On the other hand, the KMT's efforts to present itself as a peacemaking party might attract some undecided voters, as they often are less interested in issues like human rights, democracy, or authoritarianism, says Chen from Soochow University.""If the KMT frames the upcoming presidential election as a choice between 'war' and 'peace,' their peacemaker campaign could be appealing to some undecided voters,"" he told DW. ""No one in Taiwan wants war and following the military reform introduced by the Taiwanese government last December, many parents worry whether their children will have to serve in the military. If these factors are combined together, it could be a quite effective strategy to influence undecided voters.""Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/29,,

He is set to review the situation there in a bid to reduce the risk of a major nuclear accident.This is Grossi's  second visit to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station since Moscow's forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.The head of IAEA and his delegation arrived on Wednesday morning and were expected to leave by noon. This is according to the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, which cited an official with Russia's nuclear operator Rosenergoatom.Grossi's second visit to Zaporizhzhia is mainly to ""assess first-hand the serious nuclear safety and security situation at the facility,"" according to the IAEA.The IAEA has had a team of experts in the nuclear power plant since September 2022, but Grossi noted that the situation was ""still precarious.""Moscow and Kyiv have   regularly accused each other of bombarding the power station in the last year.Grossi has been pushing for a safety agreement between Ukraine and Russia to protect the facility.Grossi met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prior to his visit. Zelenskyy said it was not possible to restore safety at the nuclear plant while it remains under Russian control.""Without the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops and personnel from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and adjacent territory, any initiatives to restore nuclear safety and security are doomed to failure,"" Zelenskyy told Grossi.To guarantee essential nuclear safety and security functions, the plant needs a reliable electricity supply. However, the plant has suffered recurrent electricity outages during the war causing alarm in the IAEA and the international community.In an interview in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, Grossi said that his attempt to broker a deal to protect the nuclear plant was still alive. He noted that he was adjusting the proposals to seek a breakthrough.dmn/sms (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/29,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850640,Why do ancient statues have such small penises?,"In the Vatican Museums in Rome, a group of tourists stands in front of one of the showpieces: the statue of Laocoön and His Sons (also known as the Laocoön Group).The around 2,000-year-old sculpture stands at a little over two meters in height, and depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons. He is said to have advised his compatriots against bringing the Greeks' wooden horse into the city because he suspected it was a trick.In fact, warriors were hiding in the horse, which then sealed the downfall of Troy. That was the plan of the gods, and because Laocoön wanted to interfere with them with his warning, they had him and his children killed by snakes.An exciting story from an ancient period, but one detail in particular catches the eye of the tourists: Laocoön's penis is extremely small — and not only that. Throughout the museum, there are statues of muscular men with tiny genitals.The group's tour guide asks them if they know why the sculptors of antiquity endowed men so modestly. One Dutch tourist offers his theory: ""Statistically speaking, southern European penises are supposed to be smaller than those from the north,"" he says with a grin.That was definitely not the reason, clarifies archaeologist and guide Chiara Giatti: ""For the ancient Greeks and Romans, large genitals were considered ugly,"" she explains. ""The stonemasons modeled only small genitals because they wanted to make it clear: This man is a rational intellectual, and as such he has his urges under control.""Thus, the ancient man had a high degree of self-control and knew how to control himself — unlike the barbarians and some gods, including Dionysus, the god of wine, pleasure and ecstasy. He is usually surrounded by satyrs — a short half-man, half-goat (or horse), always naked and depicted as being animalistic and hideous. They celebrated debauched feasts and amused themselves with the nymphs who lived in the forests.""These gods and forest spirits were voluptuous, and their genitals were depicted accordingly,"" Giatti says. Dionysus' son Priapos, whom he fathered with the goddess of love Aphrodite, clearly had the largest. She abandoned the child with the abnormally huge phallus in the mountains. There, shepherds found him, raised him and revered him as a fertility bringer because of his impressive privates.The small penis as an ideal of beauty was initially a Greek affair. Around 2,400 years ago, the comedy poet Aristophanes recorded what the ideal male body should look like: ""A gleaming chest, bright skin, broad shoulders, tiny tongue, strong buttocks and a little prick.""The Romans adopted this idea. And not only them — Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo or Raphael were enthusiastic about the perfectly modeled masterpieces of antiquity and based their work on them.Michelangelo's David, for example, which was created between 1501 and 1504, also has a modest manhood — even though his exposed genitals have been at the center of a recent controversy.The sculpture, which can be admired in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence, became even more famous than it already was in the United States after a school in Florida decided to force the resignation of its principal over parents' complaints that their children were exposed to the ""pornographic"" Renaissance masterpiece in a lesson.Nowadays, society's perception of the male genitalia has changed. Micro penises are no longer perceived as a sign of intellectual eminence, and for many, large penises are considered masculine and represent success.According to a study published earlier this year by Stanford University in California, they are even getting bigger. The male genitalia has grown by 24% in several regions of the world over the past 30 years, the scientific team reported in The World Journal of Men's Health.In ancient times, these proportions would probably have caused aesthetic horror. ""The length doesn't matter, women have known that for a long time,"" comments a tourist from Israel, who is standing in front of the Laocoön group and photographing the ancient appropriately sized genitalia.Incidentally, in Italy penises are colloquially called ""piselli"" — which translates as ""peas.""This article was originally written in German and adapted by John Silk.",2023/03/29,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850642,Capitol riot: FBI informant testifies for Proud Boys defense,"WASHINGTON (AP) — An FBI informant who marched to the U.S. Capitol with fellow Proud Boys members on Jan. 6 testified on Wednesday that he didn't know of any plans for the far-right extremist group to invade the building and didn't think they inspired the violence that day.The informant, who was identified in court and in a court record only as “Aaron,"" was a defense witness at the trial of former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and four lieutenants charged with seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors said was a plot to keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 presidential election.The informant was communicating with his FBI handler as the mob of Trump supporters swarmed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, writing in a text message that police barriers were down and the crowd was almost at the building. He also told his handler that the Proud Boys “did not do it, nor inspire.""“The crowd did as a herd mentality. Not organized,"" he wrote. The handler's response was redacted from a screenshot that a defense attorney showed to jurors.A prosecutor later suggested that the informant sent that text only after it became clear that he and other members could be in serious trouble. The prosecutor also suggested that the informant wasn’t a mere observer to the riot, showing video that captured him helping another Proud Boy use a podium to block a security gate from closing.The presence of government informants in the far-right group has repeatedly come up in the lengthy trial, as defense lawyers seek to undermine prosecutors' claim that the Proud Boys plotted to attack the Capitol to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.“Aaron,” who was allowed to withhold a last name when he testified, is one of several Proud Boys associates who were informants before or after the Jan. 6 attack. He is the first to testify at the trial, one of the most important to emerge from the Justice Department’s massive investigation of the Capitol riot.Revelations about the informants have raised fresh questions about intelligence failures before the riot. A U.S. Senate report examining security failures surrounding the riot found that law enforcement had intelligence leading up to Jan. 6 that some Trump supporters were threatening violence and planning a siege to stop the certification of Biden’s victory.The informant, however, who joined the Proud Boys in 2019, said he wasn’t a group leader and didn’t know any Tarrio or any of the other leaders on trial. He was not in any of the Telegram chats the Proud Boys leaders on trial are accused of using to plot in the days leading up to Jan. 6.Law enforcement routinely uses informants in criminal investigations, but their methods and identities can be closely guarded secrets. Federal authorities haven’t publicly released much information about their use of informants in the far-right group.The informant told jurors that his relationship with the FBI began around 2008 and investigators didn’t ask him to join the Proud Boys or direct him to gather information about the group. The FBI also didn’t ask him to go to Washington on Jan. 6 or march with the Proud Boys that day, he said.The informant planned his travel to Washington with members of a Kansas City chapter of the Proud Boys, including at least four who were charged with conspiring to impede the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6, he said.The informant told jurors that marching from the Washington Monument to the Capitol appeared to be a photo opportunity for the Proud Boys. He said he reached out to his handler when the violence erupted on Jan. 6 because he saw it as an “emergency situation.""“If there was any violence and all that, they would have wanted to know,” he said of the FBI.On cross-examination, prosecutor Conor Mulroe showed videos of the informant near Nordean and Biggs among rioters who breached police lines. In one video, the informant is seen pumping a fist. Asked why he didn’t try to de-escalate the situation, the informant said he couldn’t believe the mob would storm past police officers guarding the building.“At that point, it was almost a circus before things got serious,” he said.The trial was briefly disrupted last week when prosecutors told defense attorneys that another person the defense had wanted to put on the witness stand secretly worked as a government informant for two years after the Jan. 6 attack.Prosecutors said that person, who didn't officially become an informant until after months after the riot, was never told to gather information about the defendants or their lawyers and the FBI ended its relationship with her this past January after it learned she might testify.Tarrio's lawyers ultimately decided not to put her on the witness stand after the judge said attorneys couldn't ask about her relationship with the FBI because it's not relevant to the trial.Tarrio, a Miami resident who served as national chairman of the group, and the other Proud Boys could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of seditious conspiracy. Tarrio wasn't in Washington on Jan. 6. Tarrio had been arrested in a separate case days earlier, but authorities say he helped put into motion the violence that day.Two other former Proud Boys members, who agreed to cooperate with the government, also testified they didn’t know of any specific plan to storm the Capitol.But Bertino, a former regional leader from North Carolina who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy, told jurors that the group plotted to violently prevent Biden from taking office because they were trying to “save the country” from what they feared would be a tyrannical government.Hundreds of privately exchanged messages shown to jurors show the Proud Boys becoming increasingly agitated as Trump’s legal challenges failed in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6 and celebrating the attack on the Capitol and their role in it.“Do what must be done,” Tarrio wrote on social media as the mob stormed the Capitol. Later that day, someone asked in an encrypted group chat what they should do next.“Do it again,” Tarrio responded.Also on trial with Tarrio are Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola. Nordean, of Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter leader. Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, was a self-described Proud Boys organizer. Rehl was president of the Proud Boys chapter in Philadelphia. Pezzola was a Proud Boys member from Rochester, New York.Prosecutors rested their case on March 20. Jurors are expected to hear several more days of testimony from defense witnesses before they hear closing arguments.___Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston contributed to this report.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the Capitol riot at https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850643,A different March Madness: Online hate for the athletes,"HOUSTON (AP) — It wasn’t so much that social media was criticizing his son. That happens sometimes — especially after a loss like THAT.But when a post came up suggesting Terrance Williams II, a junior forward for Michigan, be left for dead in a ditch, his dad decided enough was enough. Terrance Williams Sr.’s profanity-laced response to all the haters was, in many ways, an expected byproduct of social media vitriol that bubbled up after the Wolverines blew an eight-point lead in a one-point loss to Vanderbilt earlier this month — not in the NCAA Tournament but in the NIT.“You actually root for them when they’re good,” Williams Sr. said of the Michigan fans in an interview with The Associated Press two days after the season-ending loss. ""But then they make a mistake, and a game doesn’t go your way and you turn to hate. That’s unacceptable.”The episode was just one of countless examples of the toxic minefield that athletes, coaches, friends and family face all too often on social media, all of it amplified for college basketball players when the calendar flips to March and the madness begins.College administrators and coaches alike have warned for several years that students and athletes are facing increasing mental-health challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. And never have there been more outside voices that not only scrutinize every move players make on the court, but impact their emotional well-being away from it.“The feedback right now, it can be so harsh and it’s so immediate, and I think that’s the hardest part,” said Melissa Streno, a Denver-based mental health consultant for high-level athletes. “It’s the immediacy of the feedback from people they don’t even know. And it can be so impactful on their identity and how they see themselves as a player on the court.”Turning off social media is one option, but it's not really practical, not with the way society interacts in the 21st century. And many athletes use social media to open the door to cash. It comes with a toll.A survey conducted by the NCAA in the fall of 2021 found spikes among athletes who experienced mental exhaustion, anxiety and depression compared with a similar survey two years earlier — before the pandemic, and also before name-image-likeness deals became an everyday reality of college sports. The survey also found that despite a growing recognition of mental health as something to be addressed, fewer than half the respondents felt comfortable seeking support from a counselor on campus.Even so, those counselors have been busy; a growing number of questions they field from the players involve how to manage social media.“For some of them, social media brings pressure to put out information, to create content, build their brand and that can cause anxiety,” said Charron Sumler, a former college basketball player who is now an athletic counselor at Ohio State. “On the flip side, there’s the input where they’re receiving messages. And with phones in the locker room, sometimes they’re receiving that negative feedback and content before they’ve even had a chance to debrief with their coaches or with themselves.”Just this month, Virginia’s Kihei Clark started trending for the wrong reasons when his ill-advised pass at the end of a first-round March Madness game against Furman allowed the Paladins to make the game-winning 3-pointer that sent the Cavaliers home.After the game, Clark sat in the locker room and patiently answered every question. Predictably, social media was destroying him before the final buzzer even sounded.Among those who knew the feeling was Matthew Fisher-Davis. He was the Vanderbilt guard who, thinking the Commodores were trailing, fouled a Northwestern player in the waning seconds of a first-round game in 2017. In fact, Vanderbilt was ahead by one; Northwestern made both free throws after the foul and won by a point.Before the next season, Fisher-Davis released a slickly produced video showing him working out, the main theme of which was: “Everybody’s got something to say.”“It gets to the point where, the stuff coming from outside the locker room doesn’t make anything easier,” Fisher-Davis told the AP in an interview this month.Stanford's Haley Jones was named most outstanding player at the women's Final Four after helping the Cardinal win the national title in 2021. Two weeks ago, when Stanford made an early exit from this year's March Madness, Jones' performance — and her prospects for the upcoming WNBA draft — were being dissected, sometimes cruelly, on social media.“Right after every game. I know what I did well, and I know what I didn’t do well,” said Jones, who is part of a program called Game 4 Good that focuses on mental wellness for athletes. “I don’t need to go and listen to thousands of people who don’t know me tell me these same things, and probably say it in a lot meaner way.”On rare occasions, players get ripped for doing something good.In an episode that illustrates the parallel explosive growth of both social media and online sports wagering, TCU’s Damion Baugh was the object of scorn in the second round this month when he launched a shot at the buzzer from near the halfcourt logo in a game that had already been sealed by Gonzaga.Baugh’s 3 went in. It trimmed TCU’s final deficit to three, which allowed the Horned Frogs to cover the 4.5-point spread. That shot did nothing to change the brackets, but it did flip millions of dollars across the country and Baugh was roundly ripped on Twitter.Baugh barked back: “I don’t get how y’all mad because I played until the last buzzer.""Former Ohio State guard E.J. Liddell also felt compelled to defend himself after he missed a late free throw that was key to an upset loss to Oral Roberts two years ago.“Honestly, what did I do to deserve this? I’m human,” he said in a post in which he posted screenshots of some of the insults directed at him, including a death threat.Even one of social media’s biggest stars, Oregon’s Sedona Prince, who became famous after her video outlining the disparity between men’s and women’s weight rooms at the 2021 NCAA Tournaments went viral, had to take a brief break last year from TikTok.“I’m not any different because I’m on TikTok. I’m still a person,” Prince said in a tearful video since taken down, while acknowledging her mental health had been declining.Streno, the mental health consultant, said social media can exacerbate depression and anxiety.During a three-month stretch last spring, at least five college athletes died by suicide. Among the reasons given by friends and family were the constant pressure of performing at a high level, the pressure to maintain a certain weight or physique, the fear of being perceived as weak because of injuries and the limited social opportunities because of the demands of a sports schedule.Given the amount of daily interaction athletes have with friends and family on social media apps, Streno said it’s more realistic to coach players on how to deal with feedback than simply advising them to shut down everything.“If it were as simple as ‘don’t look at your phone,’ then this wouldn’t be an issue,” she said. “But there’s such a quick, immediate, ‘Oh, this must mean this about me. I’m not good enough, or I’m not living up to this level.’ And then your mind can kind of start going down into this spiral.”Williams, the father of the Michigan forward, said his son does a good job of shutting out social media during the season. After the events of this month, the dad planned on going dark for a while, too.“People said he didn’t play well, and I get that,” Williams said. “But when you say my son, who I’ve raised and who I love tremendously, that you wish him to be dead in a ditch, that’s when I’ve got to turn the switch.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850644,Hurley's rebuild complete as UConn returns to Final Four,"STORRS, Conn. (AP) — Before every home game, UConn's hype man gets on his microphone and greets the crowd with, “Welcome to the basketball capital of the Wooooorrrrld!”With four men's NCAA championship banners hanging from the ceiling at Gampel Pavilion along with 11 women's banners, it's not an entirely empty brag.The Huskies (29-8) are the biggest name left playing basketball this season, making the Final Four as a No. 4 seed, joining Miami (29-7) and San Diego State (31-6), both No. 5 seeds, and ninth-seeded Florida Atlantic (35-3).But while Connecticut can boast the most titles of any school in college basketball over the last quarter-century, this week's trip to the Final Four is the men's first since their last championship in 2014.In between, UConn went through a down period that included three straight losing seasons between 2017 and 2019 while languishing in the American Athletic Conference. It fired coach Kevin Ollie, lost a subsequent legal battle over his salary and endured NCAA sanctions.When Dan Hurley took the job in 2018, his charge was to restore luster to the brand.“The timeline, with the way that we did it, building a culture and doing it without cheating, without lying and doing it with integrity and building it the right way, I mean, we're exactly on time,” Hurley said Tuesday.Hurley credits good recruiting, including the additions this year of freshmen Alex Karaban, a starting forward from nearby Southborough, Massachusetts, and Donovan Clingan, a 7-foot-2 center from Bristol. UConn followers growing up, both have played key roles.And there were the transfer portal pickups, including starting point guard Tristen Newton and role players Joey Calcaterra, Nahiem Alleyne and Hassan Diarra.“I would definitely say the history was a huge component of why I came here,” Karaban said. “Seeing the four banners up there and seeing what coach (Jim) Calhoun had built and for it to be close to home for me as well was a major factor. It was something I wanted to do in my college career. I wanted to win national championships and make it to the Final Four and I wanted to add myself to history, to what was a super-cemented, historical program.”Calhoun, the Hall of Fame coach who built UConn from a regional powerhouse into a national one, winning titles in 1999, 2004 and 2011, said Hurley has done a good job capitalizing on that foundation, including filling the school's practice facility with pictures of past championships and Huskies who went on to the NBA.The school's decision to leave the American and rejoin the Big East in 2020 also was a factor, he said.“It helped, there’s no question,” Calhoun said. “It helped get recruits. The competition, the opportunity to go great places and play great places. Nothing against the American, but the Big East is one of the two or three best basketball conferences in the country. We have teams that traveled very far in the tournament.""The Huskies haven't lost a nonconference game all season, and the battles in the Big East, where they lost eight times, have helped harden them for the tournament, Calhoun said.Hurley said he's been relying heavily on advice from Calhoun and women's coach Geno Auriemma on how to prepare his Huskies for everything that surrounds a trip to Houston and a date with Miami.The Hurricanes are coached by Jim Larrañaga, who rose to fame when he coached 11th-seed George Mason to an upset win over Calhoun's top-seeded UConn team in the 2006 regional finals. Larrañaga sees a lot of similarities in that matchup and this one — a shorter underdog against a much bigger blue blood with a longer history of success.“We’re like 6-4, 6-6, 6-7 and UConn is huge,” he said. ""So, it’s an interesting matchup in terms of contrasting bigs versus smalls.""But while the Huskies are 8-1 in Final Four games, Hurley said the program's tradition won't help his team on Saturday.“Having an incredible brand, it's great, because that means you have a huge fan base and generally there's going to be a pretty good commitment in terms of resources,"" he said. “But if you don't have the right people — if I don't have the right coaching staff — being a blue blood doesn't, I mean, there's a lot of teams at home right now that are blue bloods.”___AP Sports Writer Tim Reynolds in Coral Gables, Florida, contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850645,Latest storm piles more snow on California mountains,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A cold low pressure system spinning off the coast of California sent bands of rain and snow across the state Wednesday, making travel difficult and adding to an epic mountain snowpack.Forecasters said the storm was not as strong as the systems that pounded the state all winter, but that chains were required for vehicles on highways through the Sierra Nevada. A section of U.S. 395 on the eastern side of the range was closed because of the snowfall.The San Francisco Bay Area was hit by gusty winds, hail and periods of heavy rain as multiple storm cells intensified quickly, the National Weather Service said. Flood advisories were issued in the afternoon for three counties south of San Francisco.The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Eastern Sierra declared its snowiest season on record after 28 inches (70 centimeters) of snow since Tuesday afternoon pushed season snowfall totals to 695 inches (17.6 meters) at its main lodge and 870 inches (22.1 meters) at the summit of the 11,053-foot (3,369-meter) peak.“It's deep out there,” the resort wrote on its website.Another foot (30 cm) or more of snow fell at resorts around Lake Tahoe, including 14 inches (35 cm) at Palisades south of Truckee. That resort is now within 11 inches (28 cm) of reaching its record of 701 inches (17.8 meters) and has announced plans to keep some slopes open until the Fourth of July.The storm's effects were more modest in Southern California, where steady rain ended by afternoon and sunshine returned. But forecasters cautioned that there could be evening thunderstorms and overnight snow in the mountains as the very cold low pressure system moved down the coast.California was three years into a drought, with dwindling reservoirs and parched landscapes, until an unexpected series of powerful storms began in late December and continued into spring. While causing widespread damage that forced the declaration of emergencies in dozens of counties, the storms also have raised reservoir levels and built an extraordinary Sierra snowpack, a significant source of California's water.As of Wednesday, the water content of the snowpack was 234% of the April 1 average, a benchmark for its historical peak, according to the state Department of Water Resources.The turnabout has allowed a rollback of some water-use restrictions, although Gov. Gavin Newsom has been careful to not declare the drought over.California is expected to get additional precipitation by Saturday in the north and by Monday in the south. Forecasters said the system will be weaker than the current storm.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850646,Dem senators from 4 states ask NOAA to address whale deaths,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Democratic U.S. Senators from four states want federal environmental officials to address a spate of whale deaths on both coasts, urging “transparency and timeliness” in releasing information about whale deaths and their causes.The call late Tuesday by New Jersey Sens. Robert Menendez and Cory Booker; Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, and Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse for action by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration marked the first large-scale request for action by Democratic federal lawmakers on an issue that has rapidly become politicized.Thus far, mostly Republican lawmakers have called for a pause or an outright halt to offshore wind farm preparation work, which they blame for the deaths of whales along the U.S. East Coast since December.But in their letter to a NOAA administrator, the Democratic senators conspicuously did not blame — or even mention — offshore wind as a potential cause of the deaths. Numerous federal agencies have said there is no evidence linking it to whale deaths, many of which were determined to have been caused by ship strikes or entanglement with fishing gear.In a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday, Booker said he wants the agency to protect whales and communicate quickly about any deaths.“To protect these animals, we must follow the facts and address the known, documented causes of death,” he said. “We know that NOAA’s preliminary findings for many of the whales washing up along the Atlantic coast this year have shown evidence of a vessel strike.""The senators voiced particular concern about two deaths of endangered North Atlantic right whales, although most of the whale deaths involved the more plentiful humpback species.“Without action, the (North Atlantic right whale) will likely go extinct,"" they wrote. ""If we do not act, other whale species may face the same fate.”Lauren Gaches, a NOAA spokesperson, said that as of Wednesday, 30 whale deaths have been recorded on the Atlantic Coast since Dec. 1. They were 21 humpback whales; three sperm whales; three minke whales; two North Atlantic right whales and one sei whale.The senators also expressed concern about the deaths of gray whales on the West Coast, where 298 of the animals have washed ashore since 2019. Some showed signs of emaciation, but NOAA said more research is needed.NOAA has declared “unusual mortality events” involving whales on both coasts, including one on the East Coast dating back to 2016.Gaches said the agency will work directly with Congress to address any concerns it may have about the issue and the agency's response to it.The senators asked NOAA to detail how it plans to address and prevent whale deaths; outline the agency's procedures for notifying the public when a whale deaths is discovered and when the results of necropsy examinations are ready; and list any challenges the agency faces in determining the causes of whale deaths, and whether specific actions by Congress or the administration might help.They noted that since 2008, NOAA has implemented vessel speed regulations to reduce the number of whale deaths caused by boat strikes, and that updated rules regarding the issue are due by June.On March 16, four Republican Congressmen held a hearing in Wildwood, New Jersey to call for a pause on all offshore wind projects.Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey called for a pause on such work until the U.S. Government Accountability Office can investigate the “sufficiency of the environmental review processes for offshore wind projects.” He was joined by fellow New Jersey Republican Jeff Van Drew, Andy Harris, of Maryland; and Scott Perry, of Pennsylvania in promising additional hearings and demands for information, and claiming federal agencies have ignored expressions of concern by one of their own scientists about the effects of wind farms on whales.___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850647,"Musk, scientists call for halt to AI race sparked by ChatGPT","Are tech companies moving too fast in rolling out powerful artificial intelligence technology that could one day outsmart humans?That's the conclusion of a group of prominent computer scientists and other tech industry notables such as Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak who are calling for a 6-month pause to consider the risks.Their petition published Wednesday is a response to San Francisco startup OpenAI's recent release of GPT-4, a more advanced successor to its widely-used AI chatbot ChatGPT that helped spark a race among tech giants Microsoft and Google to unveil similar applications.WHAT DO THEY SAY?The letter warns that AI systems with “human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity” — from flooding the internet with disinformation and automating away jobs to more catastrophic future risks out of the realms of science fiction.It says “recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”“We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4,” the letter says. “This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.”A number of governments are already working to regulate high-risk AI tools. The United Kingdom released a paper Wednesday outlining its approach, which it said “will avoid heavy-handed legislation which could stifle innovation.” Lawmakers in the 27-nation European Union have been negotiating passage of sweeping AI rules.WHO SIGNED IT?The petition was organized by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, which says confirmed signatories include the Turing Award-winning AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio and other leading AI researchers such as Stuart Russell and Gary Marcus. Others who joined include Wozniak, former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Rachel Bronson, president of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a science-oriented advocacy group known for its warnings against humanity-ending nuclear war.Musk, who runs Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX and was an OpenAI co-founder and early investor, has long expressed concerns about AI's existential risks. A more surprising inclusion is Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI, maker of the AI image generator Stable Diffusion that partners with Amazon and competes with OpenAI's similar generator known as DALL-E.WHAT'S THE RESPONSE?OpenAI, Microsoft and Google didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday, but the letter already has plenty of skeptics.“A pause is a good idea, but the letter is vague and doesn’t take the regulatory problems seriously,"" says James Grimmelmann, a Cornell University professor of digital and information law. ""It is also deeply hypocritical for Elon Musk to sign on given how hard Tesla has fought against accountability for the defective AI in its self-driving cars.”IS THIS AI HYSTERIA?While the letter raises the specter of nefarious AI far more intelligent than what actually exists, it's not “superhuman” AI that some who signed on are worried about. While impressive, a tool such as ChatGPT is simply a text generator that makes predictions about what words would answer the prompt it was given based on what it's learned from ingesting huge troves of written works.Gary Marcus, a New York University professor emeritus who signed the letter, said in a blog post that he disagrees with others who are worried about the near-term prospect of intelligent machines so smart they can self-improve themselves beyond humanity's control. What he's more worried about is “mediocre AI” that's widely deployed, including by criminals or terrorists to trick people or spread dangerous misinformation.“Current technology already poses enormous risks that we are ill-prepared for,” Marcus wrote. ""With future technology, things could well get worse.”",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850648,"France, England off to fast start in Euro 2024 qualifying","GENEVA (AP) — Two games into qualifying and both France and England appear to be shoo-ins to reach neat year’s European Championship.For Norway and Erling Haaland, however, it’s already looking like a bumpy road to Euro 2024 in Germany.France and England delivered the standout displays over the past week in the return of international soccer following the World Cup in Qatar, opening group play with victories over their biggest rivals.France and its new captain, Kylian Mbappé, swept aside the Netherlands 4-0 in Paris on Friday. England got off to a fast start by beating Italy 2-1 in a rematch of the Euro 2020 final, which the Italians won in London.Both teams added second victories three days later.Norway, considered one of Europe’s up-and-coming teams because of the presence of Haaland and Martin Odegaard, is still looking for a first win in qualifying.Belgium also impressed twice on the road under new coach Domenico Tedesco, though its 3-2 victory in Germany was only a friendly because the Germans don't have to qualify as hosts.Scotland sprang the biggest surprise, beating 2008 and 2012 champion Spain 2-0, and joined Serbia, Switzerland and Portugal as group leaders with two wins and no goals conceded.HAALAND’S ROUTEHaaland is probably the best current men’s player who never played at a World Cup.The 22-year-old Manchester City scoring phenomenon also never played at a European Championship, and did not take part in Norway’s opening games in a group that also contains Spain.Without their feared forward, nursing a groin injury sustained playing for his club, Norway lost in Spain 3-0 and then drew 1-1 at Georgia.Failing to earn one of the 20 direct qualification places need not be an issue for Norway, which last played at a major tournament at Euro 2000 — one month before Haaland was born. Based on its Nations League standings, Norway is likely to enter the playoff route next March when the last three Euro 2024 places will be decided.With two wins in a six-day spell next year, Norway will be in Germany, although as a low-seeded team with a tough draw.TOP SCORERSFew would have predicted that Rasmus Højlund and Scott McTominay would be at the top of scoring chart alongside Cristiano Ronaldo.Højlund had never started a game for Denmark before last week, and made only two appearances as a substitute in September before being left off the World Cup squad. McTominay had one goal in his five-year Scotland career, playing sometimes in central defense.Højlund scored a hat trick in a 3-1 win over Finland and then gave Denmark a two-goal lead in Kazakhstan in a 3-2 loss.McTominay suddenly became a predator in the penalty area with four goals within 60 minutes of play, twice late in a 3-0 win over Cyprus and two more to stun Spain.Ronaldo started the international break with a men’s record 118 goals and ended it with 122, scoring two in each of Portugal’s routs of Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. He also now has a men's record 198 national team appearances.Harry Kane now stands alone as England’s all-time leading scorer with 55 goals. He scored in Italy and again in a 2-0 home win over Ukraine.BACK IN FORMTwo strikers who were not fully fit in Qatar returned to form.Belgium and Serbia both failed to advance out of the World Cup group stage, when more goals from Romelu Lukaku and Dušan Vlahović might have made the difference.Three months later, each scored three times in qualifying and Lukaku showed why Chelsea could need to welcome him back next season from his loan at Inter Milan.Lukaku got a hat trick in Belgium’s impressive 3-0 win at Sweden to open their group and added another in the friendly against Germany.Vlahović’s goal sealed a 2-0 home win over Lithuania, then the Juventus forward struck twice late in a 2-0 win at Montenegro that lifted Serbia to the top of Group G.A newcomer to watch is Zeki Amdouni, who scored in each of Switzerland’s wins over Belarus and Israel. The Basel forward has family ties to Turkey and Tunisia but turned down their advances to represent the country where he grew up.ONE LOVEThe captain’s armband that caused a soccer diplomacy incident with World Cup host Qatar in November was back in Euro 2024 qualifying.Kane and the Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk both wore the anti-discrimination symbol — a heart with multi-colored, rainbow-like stripes — in recent days.Although FIFA caved to Qatar's wishes and pressured European federations to drop the armband at the World Cup, it is welcomed by UEFA in its competition.Gio Wijnaldum previously wore it as the Dutch team’s captain at a Euro 2020 game in Hungary.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850649,Prince Harry blames royal family for delay in hacking suit,"LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry blamed the royal family for a delay in bringing a phone hacking lawsuit against the publisher of The Daily Mail as lawyers for the newspaper argued Wednesday that the case should be thrown out because he didn't file it soon enough.The Duke of Sussex said “the Institution” — a term he has used in other contexts to refer to the inner workings of Buckingham Palace — had prevented him from learning sooner about the activity of The Daily Mail and related publications by withholding information about phone hacking by other tabloids.“The Institution made it clear that we did not need to know anything about phone hacking, and it was made clear to me that the royal family did not sit in the witness box because that could open up a can of worms,” Harry wrote in a witness statement for his lawsuit.The privacy invasion lawsuits by Harry and six other claimants, including Elton John and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, allege Associated Newspapers Ltd. commissioned the “breaking and entry into private property"" by hiring private investigators to illegally bug homes and cars and record phone conversations.The publisher denies the allegations. Its lawyer argued Wednesday that the litigation based on events dating as far back as 1993 should be thrown out because the cases were not filed within a six-year limitation period.“Whatever claims the claimants had or may have had have been brought far too late,” attorney Adrian Beltrami said. “It is inconceivable that what is claimed to be the key new information leading to each claimant realizing they had a claim arrived unbidden in the past couple of years.""Harry, who showed up for the first two days of the High Court hearing that is set to conclude Thursday, was a no-show Wednesday.This week's hearing came more than a decade after a phone hacking scandal led to the U.K.'s 2012 Leveson inquiry, which examined law breaking by the British press and resulted in criminal convictions of several journalists and private investigators.Beltrami said that given the widespread attention the scandal received, it was hard to believe that ""any reasonably informed member of the public, let alone a figure in the public eye, to have been unaware of these matters.” He suggested they could have brought their lawsuits within the legal timeframe.The prince and other parties, however, claim that they were in the dark because of the covert nature of the snooping. They said they were misled when Associated Newspapers journalists falsely denied phone hacking and other means of gathering information for their articles.The famous claimants said they learned of the unlawful activity after a journalist provided them with ledgers showing how much Associated Newspapers paid investigators. Some investigators have also come forward to admit hacking on behalf of The Daily Mail and related publications.One of those investigators, Gavin Burrows, has since denied the work he had allegedly admitted doing for Associated Newspapers.Harry, who has several lawsuits against the news media, has vowed to make reforming the British tabloids his life's work. He blames an overly aggressive press for the 1997 car crash death of his mother, Princess Diana, and has accused reporters and photographers of hounding his wife, Meghan.""I have always had an uneasy relationship with the press,"" Harry wrote in his witness statement. “However, as a member of the Institution, the policy was to 'never complain, never explain.' There was no alternative; I was conditioned to accept it.”While he said he was aware of some news from the phone hacking scandal, he hadn't realized for years how friends and associates were targeted. His decision to take a more aggressive approach came “in the wake of vicious persistent attacks on, harassment of and intrusive, sometimes racist articles concerning Meghan,” he wrote.Beltrami, however, questioned how closely Harry was paying attention. He noted that the prince's best-selling memoir, “Spare,” describes taking a “keen interest” in the prosecution of News of the World journalists, which was the basis for the 2012 inquiry. Evidence at a related trial showed they repeatedly hacked Harry’s phone.Harry was “overjoyed” at the arrest of an editor and described his “chipper mood” at the “death rattles coming from the most popular Sunday newspaper, (Rupert) Murdoch’s News of the World. The leading culprit in the hacking scandal,” Beltrami wrote in court papers.In addition to seeking summary judgment, which would deliver a victory to Associated Newspapers without a trial, the publisher is also seeking to strike much of the evidence on which the claims are based.Beltrami has argued that the ledgers showing how much private investigators got paid were turned over by Associated Newspapers for the 2012 Leveson inquiry under a confidentiality agreement and therefore could not be used as evidence in court.Attorney David Sherborne, who represents Harry and the other famous claimants, argued that the documents were presumed to be public unless marked confidential. He said many of the documents had been used for investigative news articles about unlawful reporting practices by Associated Newspapers.",2023/03/30,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850652,Times Neighborhood maintains steady development in core businesses of property management services and community value-added services,"Adhering to “longtermism” and “4321” development strategy
HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 29 March 2023 -  Times Neighborhood Holdings Limited (""Times Neighborhood"" or the ""Company"", which together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as the ""Group"", stock code: 9928) announces its annual results for the year ended 31 December 2022 (the ""Year"").   During the Year, the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic seriously affected China's economic development. Meanwhile, the country's property sector was bottoming out but still mired in a difficult operating environment — both investment and sales were in the doldrums as liquidity crises broke out among property firms. All this posed severe challenges to the Group.   For 2022, the Group's revenue was approximately RMB2.606 billion; gross profit was approximately RMB556 million; gross profit margin was 21.3%; the core net profit attributable to owners of the parent company amounted to approximately RMB143.3 million. The Board recommended a final dividend of 2.2 RMB cents per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2022.   Steady development in the two core businesses of property management services and community value-added services   Times Neighborhood persevered with its core strategy of ""4321"" for development despite the difficulties in the business environment. It continued to further develop the markets of the city clusters in the four core regions of mainland China with its focus on areas with fast economic growth. In 2022, the business scale of the Group's property management services grew steadily, with higher concentration of property management projects in target areas. As at 31 December 2022, the total contracted gross floor area (the ""GFA"") for property management service amounted to approximately 134.1 million sq.m., representing an increase of approximately 1.6% compared with the approximately 132.0 million sq.m. as at 31 December 2021. During the Year, Times Neighborhood continued to build up its capability of expanding business independently and the contracted area for property management that it secured from third parties was approximately 19.85 million sq.m. Meanwhile, the property management projects undertaken by the Group in first- and second-tier cities accounted for 75.0% of the total GFA under the Group's management. As at 31 December 2022, the Group was undertaking a total of 956 property management projects under contracts in 88 cities (excluding 27 projects of urban public services), and the GFA of properties under the Group's management totalled approximately 119 million sq.m. In addition, the Group had a total of 108 contracted property management projects which had not yet been handed over to the Group for management, with undelivered GFA of approximately 15.4 million sq.m. The GFA of properties under the Group's management continued to grow on the back of its good reputation for its quality services in the market,   In terms of its business presence in the markets for property management of various types of properties, the Group integrated brand resources to enable its businesses of property management services for three main types of properties (residential properties, industrial parks and public buildings) to develop in synergy. In its business of residential property management services, the Group consistently increased the density of its property management projects in core city clusters. In terms of the property management for industrial parks, the Group continued to deepen its cooperation with major property owners and started serving six new major property owners under contracts in the Year. In terms of the property management services to public buildings, the Group actively broadened the scope of service.   Through the ""technology + service"" platform for the whole life cycle, Times Neighborhood's community value-added services further tapped the market potential of the communities under its management. With its various matrices such as the Neighborhood Services (鄰里邦) APP and mini program, the Group carried out user management, improved user profiling, constantly upgraded its business development models and enriched the scope of its services. In the respect of its renovation business, the Group opened decoration brand image stores to connect offline and online scenarios of spending and facilitate the conversion of website traffic to customers. To actively cope with the downturn in the real estate market, it explored the possibilities of running its own business beyond the existing market. It has developed a number of high-performing shops for complete interior decoration and furnishing. The Group gained insights into the needs of property owners, gave full play to the advantages of property companies' proximity to property owners, began a business of community-based group buying and provided various paid home-based services. It also designed and provided service packages targeted at various scenarios of daily life to provide a rich selection of quality goods and lifestyle services for property owners and customers. During the Year, the revenue from the community value-added services was RMB378.6 million, and the gross profit margin was 32.9%.   Adhering to ""longtermism"" and forging ahead with the ""4321"" development strategy    As to the outlook of the market, the optimization of the government's anti-pandemic measures has created favourable conditions for a recovery in the economy and industries. The government's positive attitude and policy changes towards the property sector have also boosted the market's confidence in the development of the property management sector. It is against this backdrop that the property management sector, which is closely related to people's livelihood, can expect more opportunities for development. Meanwhile, property companies should also consistently improve the standard of professionalism and service quality while exploring the possibilities of finer market segments for services.   2023 will the year marked by China's economic recovery. The Group will seize opportunities by adhering to ""longtermism"" and pressing on with its strategy of ""4321"" for development to expand its business scale, further develop its value-added services and leverage technologies to enhance both the customer experience and the infrastructure for its internal operation. Under the ""4321"" development strategy, the Group will further develop the markets of the city clusters in the four key regions of the Greater Bay Area, Yangtze River Delta, Chengdu-Chongqing area and central China; build up its business presence in the markets for property management services to residential properties, industrial parks and public buildings; aim for growth according to its two ""three-year plans"" for the periods of 2019-2021 and 2022-2024; and build up a ""technology + service"" platform for the whole life cycle. The Group will work hard to reward property owners, shareholders, employees and business partners with the fruits of quality development.  Hashtag: #TimesNeighborhood

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850664,GOP lawmakers accuse Fed of being lax before bank failure,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers accused top bank regulators Wednesday of dawdling as Silicon Valley Bank hurtled toward the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history and questioned whether tougher regulations would have made a difference.Regulators closed the bank March 10, shaking the U.S. financial system and triggering fears of a broader banking crisis. But Federal Reserve supervisors had first raised questions about Silicon Valley's risky practices far earlier — in 2021 — and had warned the bank's management about them in the fall of that year.“That doesn't sound like a very urgent supervisory process,” Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican, said at Wednesday's hearing of the House Financial Services Committee into the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and of New York-based Signature Bank on March 12. Signature Bank's collapse was the third-biggest in the nation's history.In response to the crisis, some Democrats are calling for stricter bank regulations. Specifically, they want to undo a law, championed by the Trump administration five years ago, that rolled back the strictest regulations on all but the very biggest banks — those with assets of more than $250 billion.The 2018 law allowed the Fed to apply tougher oversight only on a case-by-case basis of banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, a category that included both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The Fed official who oversees bank regulation, Michael Barr, agreed Wednesday that the Fed had had ”substantial discretion″ to deal with Silicon Valley Bank.The Fed is conducting its own review of its supervision of Silicon Valley Bank, due May 1. Barr said the review would, among other things, look into why Fed officials couldn't compel the bank's management to fix the problems.Before enacting tough new regulations on banks, said Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, a Missouri Republican, ""How about enforcing the existing ones first?''Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, also questioned Barr about the apparent lack of follow-up by Fed regulators once they had rated Silicon Valley Bank’s management “deficient” in July 2022. Himes suggested that Congress consider requiring banks to respond to concerns raised by supervisors in a timely manner.“We need to tighten up the process,” Himes said. “We need to think about automatic mechanisms that when a finding of deficiency is made... kick in.""Regulators have said that Silicon Valley Bank, the go-to institution for California tech startups, was an ""idiosyncratic'' case and that the overall U.S. banking system remains sound. Silicon Valley had made a high-risk bet that interest rates would fall. When they instead rose as the Fed aggressively increased its benchmark rate to fight inflation, the value of the bank's vast bond portfolio plummeted.News of its financial distress led panicked large depositors to yank money out of the bank — a stunning $42 billion on March 9. Depositors were expected to withdraw an additional $100 billion the next day. In response, regulators intervened to take control of the bank and stop the bank run.The vast majority of Silicon Valley Bank's deposits exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $250,000. Worried that its failure would shake public faith in American banks, the federal government decided to protect all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, even those exceeding $250,000.___AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this report.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850665,Sweden coach in clear-the-air talks with pundit after spat,"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — The coach of Sweden’s men’s soccer team has held clear-the-air talks with a TV commentator after they became engaged in an argument on air following a European Championship qualifier.What began as a post-game discussion between coach Janne Andersson and pundit Bojan Djordjic about the playing time of substitute midfielder Jesper Karlsson after Sweden’s 5-0 win over Azerbaijan on Monday ended with a heated exchange between the pair.Djordjic appeared to be most unhappy with Andersson for asking who he represented. Djordjic was born in Serbia but played for Sweden’s youth teams. Andersson has insisted he was not referring to Djordjic’s origins when saying the word “represent.” The argument ended with Andersson walking away without taking more questions.Describing the spat as a “high-profile controversy,” the Swedish soccer federation published a statement Wednesday saying the pair spoke for over an hour at the offices of Swedish broadcaster Viaplay and have settled the matter. Alongside the statement was a photo of the pair smiling and with their arms round each others’ shoulders.“It was extra nice to meet and clean up this event in an honest way and we did it with heart and understanding for each other,” Andersson said.Djordjic said there was “forgiveness in both directions.”“It was important to me that Janne was genuinely interested in my life story and wanted to understand my reaction and feeling, even though we come from different generations and from different backgrounds,” he said.Andersson has been Sweden's coach since 2016. He had come under pressure ahead of the game against Azerbaijan, with his team having failed to qualify for last year's World Cup and having started qualification for Euro 2024 with a 3-0 home loss to Belgium on Friday.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850666,UN seeks court opinion on climate in win for island states,"The countries of the United Nations led by the island state of Vanuatu adopted what they called a historic resolution Wednesday calling for the U.N.'s highest court to strengthen countries' obligations to curb warming and protect communities from climate disaster.The resolution was adopted by consensus and Vanuatu Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau called it “a win for climate justice of epic proportions.” He reeled off a string of recent disasters including back-to-back Category 4 cyclones in his own country and record-breaking Cyclone Freddy that refused to leave southeastern Africa in recent weeks. “Catastrophic and compound effects like this are growing in number,” he said.U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said he hoped the opinion, when issued, would encourage nations “to take the bolder and stronger climate action that our world so desperately needs.""Saudi Arabia and Iraq sought to soften the resolution, which was co-sponsored by some 132 countries, saying it would increase the workload of the international court.Like many Pacific Island nations Vanuatu is at risk of rising seas engulfing swathes of the islands. Scientists say both extreme weather and sea levels have worsened because of climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The resolution asks the court to pay particular attention to the harm endured by small island states.Youth groups bolstered the effort, citing the need to protect the planet for current and future generations.“I don’t want to show a picture to my child one day of my island. I want my child to be able to experience the same environment and the same culture that I grew up in,” said Cynthia Houniuhi of the Solomon Islands, who is president of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, a group involved in getting the resolution to the General Assembly. “The environment that sustains us is disintegrating before our eyes.”The group's Solomon Yeo said “young people across the world will recall the day when we were able to get the world’s highest court, the International Court of Justice, to bring its voice to the climate justice fight.""While the opinion from the International court of justice would not be binding, it would encourage states ""to actually go back and look at what they haven’t been doing and what they need to do” to address the climate emergency, said Nilufer Oral, director at the Center for International Law at the University of Singapore.The court has other power it can bring to bear, Christopher Bartlett, climate diplomacy manager for the government of Vanuatu, explained. The court can reference other international legal instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and those do have the force of law for the countries that have ratified them.“The International Court of Justice is the only legal authority that has a mandate to look at all of international law. While the advisory opinion itself is not binding, the laws upon which the advisory opinion will be speaking absolutely are legally binding and immediately applicable to states,"" said Bartlett.Bartlett said that some of the questions the ICJ will ask are: What harm to the climate has been done? Should states be forced to take certain actions? And is financial support a legal consequence of causing harm?The resolution now goes to the court.Countries have agreed to aim to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) with an upper limit of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) back in 2015 as part of the Paris Agreement. The agreement asks countries to submit their plans to curb greenhouse gases to the United Nations and regularly revise and update those plans.Clarifying those obligations for states, as well as other promises to protect biodiversity and strengthen domestic policies are the main aims of the advisory opinion, said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's climate change minister.“We are also clear eyed that existing international frameworks have significant gaps,” he said, adding that the opinion could push for stronger legal measures like negotiating a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty or criminalizing “climate destroying activities.”___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850667,Congress to consider new no-fly list for unruly passengers,"U.S. Senate and House members proposed a new no-fly list for unruly passengers on Wednesday, an idea that was pushed by airline unions but failed to gain traction last year.The legislation would let the Transportation Security Administration ban people convicted or fined for assaulting or interfering with airline crew members.It would be separate from the current FBI-run no-fly list, which is intended to prevent people suspected of terrorism ties from boarding planes.The number of incidents involving unruly passengers dropped sharply last year after a judge struck down a federal requirement to wear masks on planes. However, incidents serious enough to be investigated by federal officials remained more than five times higher than before the pandemic.“The violent incidents have not stopped,” said Cher Taylor, a Frontier Airlines flight attendant who said she witnessed a passenger attack another in 2021 in Miami and walk away before police arrived. At a news conference outside the Capitol Taylor said “Strong penalties are needed to curb violent and unacceptable behavior. Bad behavior should not fly.”Civil libertarians vowed to oppose the measure. They say the FBI no-fly list is not transparent and unfairly targets people of color, and that the new list would have the same problems. They also say that the Federal Aviation Administration is cracking down on bad behavior, and that reports of unruly passengers are declining.“If Congress wants to further reduce air-rage incidents on aircraft, it should look at forcing the airlines to make flying a less miserable experience,” said Jay Stanley, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union.The new measure was introduced by Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Reps. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn.The lawmakers said the bill includes guidelines for notifying people that they are being placed on the list, and how to appeal. The bill would let TSA decide how long a person would be banned from flying on commercial planes.Similar legislation failed to get a hearing in Congress last year. Supporters hope their chances have improved because of high-profile incidents like that involving a passenger who stabbed at a flight attendant with a broken-off spoon this month.Individual airlines maintain lists of passengers they have banned but resist sharing names with other airlines, partly out of fear they could violate laws against cooperation among competing carriers.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850668,St. Louis prosecutor to seek reelection despite ouster bid,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — St. Louis' elected prosecutor has said she will run for reelection in 2024, even as she tries to fend off an effort by Missouri's attorney general to force her out of office.Democratic Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner spoke Tuesday night at an often-raucous public forum and made it clear that not only will she not resign, but that she plans to run again.Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey last month filed a lawsuit asking a judge to remove Gardner from office, accusing her of incompetence. Bailey cited a low rate of convictions in homicide cases, accused Gardner of failing to keep crime victims and their families updated, and said her office is too slow to take up cases brought by police.In addition to the lawsuit, a Republican-led bill in the statehouse would give the governor authority to appoint a special prosecutor to take on violent crimes in jurisdictions with a homicide rate over a certain threshold — a measure drafted with St. Louis in mind.Gardner, the city's first Black circuit attorney, told the crowd at West Side Missionary Baptist Church that Bailey and other Republican critics have “made it about race. I didn't make it about race. All these white males attacking a Black circuit attorney. So you tell me who's talking about race?”Bailey, in a statement, said Gardner is the one “injecting race and politics into a legal proceeding” and noted that many Democrats in St. Louis have raised concerns about Gardner's performance.“This isn’t just me saying this,” Bailey said. ""I’m speaking on behalf of the people of the state of Missouri, but her own constituents and elected officials within her jurisdiction have also called for her to resign. So the claim that this is politically or racially motivated is ridiculous.”Gardner, 47, was elected in 2016 and reelected in 2020. She is among several progressive Democratic prosecutors across the country who have taken steps such as ending prosecution of low-level marijuana crimes and seeking mental health treatment over incarceration for non-violent criminals.She has often clashed with police, most notably in 2018 when she announced an “exclusion list” of more than two dozen police officers who were barred from serving as primary witnesses in criminal cases due to what Gardner characterized as credibility concerns.Criticism of Gardner escalated last month after 17-year-old Janae Edmondson, a volleyball standout from Tennessee, was struck by a speeding car following a tournament game in downtown St. Louis. The 21-year-old driver was out on bond on a robbery charge despite nearly 100 bond violations that included letting his GPS monitor die and breaking terms of his house arrest, according to court records.Some questioned why Riley was allowed to remain free despite so many bond violations.Gardner gained national attention in 2018 when she charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens with felony invasion of privacy, accusing him of taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extramarital affair. The charge was eventually dropped. But Greitens, a Republican who was also under investigation by Missouri lawmakers, resigned in June 2018.The case drew scrutiny that led to the conviction of Gardner’s investigator. Gardner received a written reprimand for failing to produce documents and mistakenly maintaining that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850669,Adidas withdraws opposition to BLM trademark application,"Adidas is withdrawing its challenge to a Black Lives Matter trademark application featuring three parallel stripes, two days after it contested the image with the U.S. Trademark Office.Adidas submitted a notice of opposition with the office Monday, saying in the filing that it took issue with Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation's application to trademark the use of three parallel yellow stripes on various items such as clothing and bags.The company said that it felt that if Black Lives Matter was allowed to use the stripes, it would be “confusingly similar” to its usage of a three-stripe mark, something it had been using on its own merchandise since at least 1952.By Wednesday, Adidas said it had changed its mind.“Adidas will withdraw its opposition to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation’s trademark application as soon as possible,” the German athletic gear company said in a prepared statement.It did not provide any further details as to why it was withdrawing the application.Adidas has vociferously protected its triple-stripe trademark for years. In January fashion designer Thom Browne emerged from a New York courthouse victorious over Adidas in a battle over signature stripes. In that case, Adidas had similarly argued that the striped designs used by Thom Browne Inc. were too similar to its own three stripes. The Manhattan federal court jury sided with Browne.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850670,GOP lawmakers override veto of transgender bill in Kentucky,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Republican lawmakers in Kentucky on Wednesday swept aside the Democratic governor’s veto of a bill regulating some of the most personal aspects of life for transgender young people — from banning access to gender-affirming health care to restricting the bathrooms they can use.The votes to override Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto were lopsided in both legislative chambers — where the GOP wields supermajorities — and came on the next-to-last day of this year’s legislative session. The Senate voted 29-8 to override Beshear’s veto. A short time later, the House completed the override on a vote of 76-23.As emotions surged, some people protesting the bill from the House gallery were removed and arrested after their prolonged chanting rang out in the chamber. The protesters, their hands bound, chanted “there’s more of us not here” as they waited to be taken away from the Capitol.Nineteen people were arrested and charged with third-degree criminal trespassing after the sergeant of arms requested assistance in restoring order, Kentucky State Police said. Officers gave each person “the option to leave without any enforcement action or be placed under arrest,” said Capt. Paul Blanton, a state police spokesperson.“I think it’s unfortunate that it reached that level and certainly they were given, as I’ve been told since then, multiple opportunities to either quiet their chants or to leave voluntarily,” Republican House Speaker David Osborne said later.The bill’s opponents framed the issue as a civil-rights fight. Democratic Rep. Sarah Stalker said: “Kentucky will be on the wrong side of history” by enacting the measure.The debate about the transgender bill will likely spill over into this year’s gubernatorial campaign, with Beshear's veto drawing GOP condemnation as he seeks reelection to a second term. A legal fight also is brewing. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky reaffirmed that it intends to “take this fight to the courts” to try to preserve access to health care options for young transgender people.“While we lost the battle in the legislature, our defeat is temporary. We will not lose in court,” said Chris Hartman, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization.In praising the veto override, David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, said the bill puts “policy in alignment with the truth that every child is created as a male or female and deserves to be loved, treated with dignity and accepted for who they really are.”Activists on both sides of the impassioned debate gathered at the statehouse to make competing appeals before lawmakers took up the transgender bill following an extended break.At a rally that drew hundreds of transgender-rights supporters, trans teenager Sun Pacyga held up a sign summing up a grim review of the Republican legislation. The sign read: “Our blood is on your hands.”“If it passes, the restricted access to gender-affirming health care, I think trans kids will die because of that,” the 17-year-old student said, expressing a persistent concern among the bill's critics that the restrictions could lead to an increase in teen suicides.Bill supporters assembled to defend the measure, saying it protects trans children from undertaking gender-affirming treatments they might regret as adults. Research shows such regret is rare, however.“We cannot allow people to continue down the path of fantasy, to where they’re going to end up 10, 20, 30 years down the road and find themselves miserable from decisions that they made when they were young,” said Republican Rep. Shane Baker at a rally.The legislation in Kentucky is part of a national movement, with state lawmakers approving extensive measures that restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ people this year — from bills targeting trans athletes and drag performers to measures limiting gender-affirming care.At least 11 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia. Federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas, and nearly two dozen states are considering bills this year to restrict or ban care.The debate among Kentucky lawmakers reflected the impassioned arguments put forth at rallies.“We are denying families, their physicians and their therapists the right to make medically informed decisions for their families,” Democratic Sen. Karen Berg said in opposing the bill. Berg read what her son, Henry Berg-Brousseau, wrote in advocating for transgender rights shortly before his death late last year at age 24. The cause was suicide, his mother said.Republican Sen. Robby Mills said he supported the bill because of his belief that ""puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, when administered to youth under 18 for the purpose of altering their appearance, is dangerous for the health of that child.”Transgender medical treatments have long been available in the United States and are endorsed by major medical associations.The Kentucky measure will ban gender-affirming care for minors. It will outlaw gender reassignment surgery for anyone under 18, as well as the use of puberty blockers and hormones, and inpatient and outpatient gender-affirming hospital services.Doctors will have to set a timeline to “detransition” children already taking puberty blockers or undergoing hormone therapy. They could continue offering care as they taper a youngster’s treatments, if removing them from the treatment immediately could harm the child.Parts of the bill dealing with gender-affirming medical care will take effect in about three months.The bill will not allow schools to discuss sexual orientation or gender identity with students of any age. It will also require school districts to devise bathroom policies that, “at a minimum,” won't allow transgender children to use the bathroom aligned with their gender identities.It will further allow teachers to refuse to refer to transgender students by the pronouns they use and require schools to notify parents when lessons related to human sexuality are going to be taught.Another trans teenager, Hazel Hardesty, said the potential discontinuation of gender-affirming health care would mean “my male puberty would continue,"" which would “cause a lot of mental distress.”“People don’t even understand how it feels,” the 16-year-old said in an interview at a rally. ""Going through the wrong puberty, every day your body is a little bit farther from what feels like you. And eventually you don’t even recognize yourself in the mirror.”",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850671,Victims of Nashville school shooting honored in somber vigil,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Hundreds gathered Wednesday at a candlelight vigil in Nashville to honor and mourn the three children and three adults who were killed in a shooting at a Christian school this week.The downtown ceremony for the victims of the shooting at The Covenant School was somber and at times tearful, as speaker after speaker read the names of the victims and offered condolences to their loved ones. The family of Mike Hill, a 61-year-old custodian who was among those killed, was in attendance, including his seven children.First lady Jill Biden also was on hand but did not address the crowd. Sheryl Crow sang “I Shall Believe” and ended with the lyrics from a Dionne Warwick song, “What the World Needs Now is Love, Sweet Love.” Margo Price sang an a cappella version of “Tears of Rage."" And Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show led the crowd in the Christian hymn, “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” which brought many to tears.“Just two days ago was our city’s worst day,” Mayor John Cooper said. “I so wish we weren’t here, but we need to be here.”Shaundelle Brooks, who lost her 23-year-old son, Akilah Dasilva, in the 2018 Nashville Waffle House shooting, said she went to the vigil to support the families of those slain at the school.“I know what it’s like to be a parent — what it feels like, like you’re drowning and can’t move, and that weakness and that hole that comes in your stomach,” she said.Police have said a 28-year-old former student drove up to the school Monday morning, shot out the glass doors, entered and began firing indiscriminately.The dead were identified as as students Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9 years old; Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school; substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61; and Hill.Authorities have not yet determined the shooter’s motive but say the assailant did not target specific victims.Price, who has been particularly vocal about Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee’s position on state gun laws, tweeted after the shooting: “Our children are dying and being shot in school, but you’re more worried about drag queens than smart gun laws? You have blood on your hands.” Crow and Secor also called for stricter gun laws in tweets posted after the shooting.But there was no talk of gun control at the vigil, as people steered clear of the political divide between blue-leaning Nashville and ruby red Tennessee. Republicans and Democratic lawmakers stood together in asking for remembrance of the six who died.Lee said Tuesday that Peak was a close friend of his wife, Maria, and that the two had been planning to meet for dinner after Peak’s work that day.“Maria woke up this morning without one of her best friends,” Lee said in a video statement, adding that his wife once taught with Peak and Koonce. The women, he said, “have been family friends for decades.”Earlier Wednesday, Pope Francis sent condolences to Nashville and offered prayers to those affected.George Grant, a pastor and leader with the Nashville Presbytery, also avoided any mention of politics.“As pundits and politicians try to make sense out of the senseless, we’re not really asking why. We know why — we live in a broken, fallen world,” Grant said in a phone interview Tuesday. The church linked to the school is a member of the presbytery, which includes congregations in middle Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky.In a blog post Wednesday, Grant recounted how notifications about an active shooter at the school interrupted a presbytery planning meeting that included Chad Scruggs, Covenant Presbyterian Church pastor and father of one of the shooting victims.“We emptied into the hallway, stricken, eyes clouded with unbelief, horror and grief. ... Our worst fears were realized,” Grant wrote.Police said the shooter, identified as Audrey Hale, was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed emotional disorder and was not on the radar of police before the attack. Hale was fatally shot by police at the school Monday.Authorities have given unclear information on Hale’s gender.For hours Monday, police identified the shooter as a woman. Later in the day, the police chief said Hale was transgender. In an email Tuesday, a police spokesperson said Hale “was assigned female at birth” but used masculine pronouns on a social media profile.Maria Colomy, a former teacher at the Nossi College of Art & Design in Nashville, recalled Hale as a talented artist while a student in Colomy’s social media class in 2017. Colomy remembered Hale “going above and beyond” on projects.""She said she saw postings on Facebook during the past year in which Hale wrote about the death of a romantic partner and asked to be called by a male name and male pronouns.Hale had “been very publicly grieving"" on Facebook, Colomy said. “It was during that grief (Hale) said, ’In this person’s honor, I am going to be the person who I want to be, and I want to be called Aiden.'""On Hale’s first day at the Nossi School, Colomy said she saw Hale become frustrated while trying to log into the student portal and start to cry.“I went up to (Hale) and said, ‘Hey, if you need to step out, it’s totally OK,'"" Colomy said. But after that, Colomy said Hale began to feel safe at school and “really started thriving.""Samira Hardcastle, who attended both middle and high school with Hale, said Hale seemed sweet and socially awkward. Hardcastle said she spoke to Hale briefly last month at an event for a mutual friend, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.“I don’t think we can rationalize irrational actions, so I am just trying to make peace with that,” she said.___AP Religion News Editor Holly Meyer in Nashville and News Verification Reporter Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this report.___This story was first published March 29, 2023.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850679,Russia: Two-year prison sentence for child's drawing,"The quiet little town of Yefremov in the region of Tula, just shy of a three-hour drive south of the capital Moscow, is notorious all over Russia. In particular, people will have have heard about School No. 9 and its erstwhile sixth-grader Maria ""Masha"" Moskaleva. Her story illustrates the harshness of the laws with regard to ""discrediting"" the Russian armed forces.In April last year, Masha and her class were asked to draw pictures in support of the Russian forces in Ukraine. The 12-year-old drew two flags, a Russian one with the inscription ""No to war"" and a Ukrainian flag that read ""Glory to Ukraine,"" and in between, she drew a woman with a child targeted by Russian missiles.The school administration reacted promptly. The very next day, Masha's father Alexei Moskalev was summoned. He and his daughter were questioned by the police and the youth welfare services. Moskalev, a single father, was accused of not having raised his daughter well. The authorities claimed they had found comments criticizing the army on social media, and fined him the equivalent of almost €500 ($541) for ""discrediting"" the Russian army.Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) also interrogated Masha and her father. From that day on, Masha refused to go to school — she was afraid, Moskalev later told the independent Russian site OVD-Info.At the end of the year, the police showed up on their doorstep. ""On the morning of 30th of December I got a phone call at half past six,"" Moskalyov told OVD-Info. ""I was getting ready for work. I looked out of the window and I was stupefied. There were three police cars around the house, two more cars at the side, an MES (Ministry of Emergency Situations) car and a fire truck a little further.About twelve people from the Federal Security Service and some policemen got out of the cars and headed for our entrance. They had an angle grinder. I immediately understood that they were here for us.""Moskalev said that the officers were not delicate during the search, pulling clothes out of the closets, tearing pictures from the walls and overturning furniture. He added that they confiscated savings worth about $3,150 with made them suspicious. During a later interrogation, he was asked where the money was from and whom he was working for. He was knocked against the wall and to the ground.Immediately afterwards the two decided to flee and went into hiding in a neighboring town. Police discovered them on March 1 of this year. Moskalev was placed under house arrest and was charged with repeated ""discreditation of the military."" He was also accused of being responsible for other posts criticizing the army on social media, but he rejected the claims and said that his account must have been hacked. The authorities also started proceedings to revoke Moskalev's right to raise his daughter, who was placed in an orphanage.On March 27, after deliberating for just one day, the court decided on the sentence: two years in a penal colony for the single father.The verdict was announced a day later in the defendent's absence. According to the court, Moskalyov had fled the night before.His whereabouts are currently unknown.Olga Podolskaya, a member of Yefremov's city parliament, was shocked at the verdict. ""A real prison sentence for an opinion on the internet, that's just terrible!"" she told DW. She said that she was particularly concerned about Masha, whom she had repeatedly tried to contact. There has been no trace of her for weeks, except for one letter that she wrote to her father. It ends with the words: ""Dad, you're my hero!""This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/29,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850694,Judge orders US to resume oil lease sales in North Dakota,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A federal judge has ordered the U.S. government to resume regular oil and gas lease sales on federal lands in North Dakota, even as a legal battle continues over the Biden administration's suspension of the leasing program two years ago in an effort to combat climate change.Hailing the ruling as a victory, North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said canceled lease sales have cost North Dakota over $100 million in revenue each year and deprived the nation of “much-needed access to oil and gas during these difficult times of high inflation and threats to our energy security,” the Bismarck Tribune reported.But the judge also denied the state's request to force the Bureau of Land Management, a federal agency, to hold sales that were canceled in 2021 and 2022.“North Dakota has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits and has met the other factors favoring a preliminary injunction,” U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor wrote in his 82-page order filed Monday. “Given this preliminary stage of litigation and the incomplete administrative record, however, not all of North Dakota’s requested relief is appropriate.""Last year's federal climate law included a political compromise among Democrats that was meant to ensure oil and gas lease sales by linking them to the renewable energy development that Biden has promoted. Citing that law, federal officials have proposed a June lease sale totaling 21,000 acres (8,498 hectares) in North Dakota and Montana.But how often future lease sales will be held remains a point of contention.U.S. Department of Justice Senior Attorney Michael Sawyer said in court documents that North Dakota's push to resume quarterly lease sales before the lawsuit was decided would be a “rush to judgment"" and would subject the Bureau of Land Management to increased litigation risk from environmental conservation groups.Department spokesperson Wyn Hornbuckle declined to comment on the ruling.North Dakota's Republican Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement that he applauds the judge's decision to require the bureau to resume ""their lawfully required quarterly oil and gas lease sales.”The state is one of the nation's largest oil producers, behind Texas and New Mexico.Burgum has bashed the White House for trying to shift the country away from fossil fuels, and praised the oil and gas industry for being a “powerhouse” and “game-changer” for the state’s economy.Coal, oil and gas are by far the largest contributors to global climate change, according to the United Nations, and have resulted in more extreme wildfires, storms, hurricanes, droughts and floods in recent years, signaling what the UN calls a “code red for humanity” that could cause trillions of dollars in damage.In September, the Biden administration reached a legal settlement that requires the government to reexamine potential climate damages from oil and gas leases put up for sale under the Trump administration on government land in North Dakota and Montana.Similar deals have been reached for lease sales covering thousands of square miles in public lands under the Trump and Obama administrations in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.About a quarter of U.S. fossil fuels come from federal lands and waters, making them important for industry and a target for climate activists who want to shut down leasing.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850695,"Dangerous storms, tornadoes may target Midwest, South","A seemingly relentless series of severe storms, likely with deadly tornadoes, are forecast to rip across parts of America’s Midwest and South over the next couple weeks, especially Friday, meteorologists said.An unusual weather pattern has set in, last week triggering the devastating tornado that hit Rolling Fork, Mississippi, and meteorologists fear this Friday will be one of the worst days, with much more to come. The National Weather Service said 16.8 million people live in the highest risk zone, and more than 66 million people overall should be on alert Friday.“It’s pretty darn clear that somebody is going to take it on the nose on Friday,” said Northern Illinois meteorology professor and tornado expert and chaser Victor Gensini. “It’s just a matter of where and exactly when.”The weather service is cautioning a large area of the country – including parts of Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, West Virginia, Georgia and Kansas – to be alert for intense thunderstorms, tornadoes and other damaging winds. Big cities in the highest danger area include Memphis, St. Louis, Des Moines and Little Rock.Gensini fears Friday’s onslaught will be deadly.The storms are expected to start Friday afternoon and go overnight, which is particularly dangerous because people can't see them coming and often won't seek shelter, weather service Storm Prediction Center warning coordination meteorologist Matt Elliott said Wednesday.“The storms will be moving very quickly,” Elliott said. “So you won't have a lot of time to react to warnings as well. So now's the time to start preparing.”Though all the ingredients are there for dangerous storms, it's possible they may not combine precisely enough to pose the threat that meteorologists are warning about, Elliott and others said.Another batch of severe storms, powered by a “firehose” of unstable waves in the atmosphere that keep flowing from the cold west and combine with moist air from the east, could hit next Tuesday and the next few days after that, said Walker Ashley, another meteorology professor at Northern Illinois and Gensini’s storm-chasing partner.“You could see these things coming days in advance,” Ashley said. They will be “continual punches, one, two, three, four.”The weather service is already forecasting another batch of intense storms next Tuesday in the same general area as Friday with fairly high confidence, Elliott said.At least the first 10 days of April will be rough, said Accuweather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham.The current persistent pattern of storm ingredients reminds Gensini of the April 2011 tornado onslaught that killed 363 people in six states, hitting Alabama hardest. That was one of the largest, deadliest and most destructive tornado outbreaks in American history, the weather service said.Even before Friday, ""it's been the most active we've seen in several years'' starting around last November, with a large number of winter storms through this year, Elliott said. The deadly storms that hit Rolling Fork were part of that pattern.Buckingham and the other meteorologists said current conditions come along only once every few years to create the potential for a train of supercells, which spawn the worst of the tornadoes and damaging hail.Central to this is a fast-moving rollercoaster-like jet stream, the shifting river of air that moves weather systems, such as storms, from west to east. On the west side of the jet stream is extreme cold air and to the east, parked off Florida and Caribbean, is a very warm and dry high-pressure system.“When you kind of combine the two it kind makes those hairs on the back of your neck stand up,” Buckingham said. “The ingredients are here. They're primed towards the extreme end of things.”Add to that the Gulf of Mexico, which provides moisture heat and energy for storms, is roughly 2 to 5 degrees (1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than average or more, meteorologists said — “on fire,” as Ashley put it.“The additional warmth and humidity really get these thunderstorms firing up,” Buckingham said.The worst weather will be ""underneath the clashing'' of hot and cold air, a battleground of sort, Gensini said. Friday's lunchtime forecast at Storm Lake, Iowa, is around 67 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) but just 140 miles (225 kilometers) to the northwest, Brookings, South Dakota is forecast to be barely above freezing.“The greater the temperature gradient, the stronger the storm systems are,” Gensini said.The winds twirling at opposite directions on the west and east of the jet stream battleground add to the problem, the meteorologists said.Ashley said current conditions are mostly random weather variability, though he said the hotter Gulf of Mexico and human-caused climate change may have made a small contribution.“These events have always occurred,” Ashley said. “The question is are we turning the knob a little bit by contributing more moisture, more heat, more instability?”___ Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850696,Supreme Court grapples with use of confession in joint trial,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday grappled with whether a man serving a life sentence for his role on an international “kill team” should get a new trial.The justices heard 90 minutes of lively arguments about a situation that sometimes arises in criminal trials with more than one defendant, when one person's confession might also implicate someone else on trial.Adam Samia, who was convicted of a killing a real estate broker in the Philippines, was tried with two other men who carried out the attack on the orders of Paul LeRoux, a South African who led an international crime organization and cooperated with federal authorities after his arrest in 2012.LeRoux ordered the killing of the broker, Catherine Lee, because he believed Lee had stolen money from him.One of the men confessed to his role and Samia's lawyer, Kannon Shanmugam, said the confession unfairly implicated Samia as the trigger man, in violation of his constitutional rights. The co-defendant did not testify in his own defense so there was no opportunity for Samia’s trial lawyers to question the co-defendant.The Supreme Court has previously imposed limits on the use of a confession in these circumstances, including that the defendant’s name has to be removed and can't simply be replaced with the notation “redacted.” In Samia's trial, he was described in the confession as “someone” and “the other person.”Not good enough, Shanmugam said. “It is likely, indeed inevitable, that the confession here implicated the petitioner,” he said.Conservative justices appeared generally skeptical of Shanmugam's argument, but they did not seem to entirely embrace the points made by Justice Department lawyer Caroline Flynn, who urged the court to uphold the conviction.Justice Clarence Thomas said it wasn't clear that the portions of the confession that jurors heard pointed unmistakably to Samia. “How do you get from ‘someone’ to the petitioner in the testimony?” Thomas asked.The liberal justices seemed more inclined toward Samia's arguments. Justice Elena Kagan pressed Flynn about how much prosecutors have to do to alter a confession so that it can be used.Flynn said removing a co-defendant's name and replacing it with “the woman” could be sufficient.Kagan was incredulous. ""You can't take the law seriously when it says, 'redacted and I went out and robbed Bill' is inadmissible, but ‘the woman and I went out and robbed Bill’ can be brought in,"" she said.Pennsylvania led 32 states in urging the court to uphold the use of the confession, noting that thousands of trials in the past 10 years have involved multiple defendants and confessions.A ruling for Samia would lead to retrials and cause prosecutors to try defendants separately. “The casualties will, in some cases, be other defendants, and in all cases the victims and witnesses who must run the gamut through trial and retrial,” the states wrote in their Supreme Court filing.The states' brief attracted Justice Brett Kavanaugh's attention. ""We have an amicus brief from a lot of states, a real cross-section of states, saying this would be a huge problem,"" Kavanaugh said.But Shanmugam said that at least three of those states apply the sort of test he was calling for, looking at the confession in a broader context to decide if it would be unfair to the defendant.Samia has denied any involvement in the killing, and his lawyers say no physical evidence links him to the crime.The Justice Department said enough other evidence ties Samia to the crime that the court should leave his conviction in place, even if it finds the confession should not have been used.A decision in Samia v. U.S., 22-196, is expected by late June.",2023/03/30,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850697,"Children lost in shooting were 'feisty,' a 'shining light'","NASHVILLE (AP) — Details from the rich, full lives of the three adults killed Monday at a Nashville elementary school have emerged quickly in the aftermath, but information on the three 9-year-old children — whose lives ended tragically young — has been slower to publicly surface from a community buried in grief.The children slain at The Covenant School were Hallie Scruggs, described by an aunt as “always on the go”; Evelyn Dieckhaus, her family's “shining light”; and William Kinney, who had “an unflappable sprit.”A woman who identified herself as Hallie's aunt, Kara Scruggs Arnold, wrote on Facebook that Hallie was “incredibly smart, feisty enough to keep up with her 3 brothers and my 4 boys.”Hallie had a “love for life that kept her smiling and running and jumping and playing and always on the go,"" Arnold added in her post.Hallie's father Chad Scruggs is the lead pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, which is associated with The Covenant School. The private Christian school has about 200 students from preschool through sixth grade, as well as roughly 50 staff members, according to its website.Evelyn was described as the Dieckhaus family’s “shining light” on a GoFundMe page that has been set up for them. But her family, too, was reluctant to talk about her or the enormity of their loss.Friends of the Kinney family set up an online fundraiser to help them with funeral expenses. A message posted on the GoFundMe page said William had “an unflappable sprit.”“He was unfailingly kind, gentle when the situation called for it, quick to laugh, and always inclusive of others,” the page said. “He loved his sisters, adored his parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and was always excited to host friends of every age. Sweet Will knew no strangers, and our hearts (are) broken for his family as they try to find their way forward.”The adults who were killed were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, Mike Hill, 61, a custodian, and Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher.In a video statement released Tuesday evening, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Peak was supposed to have dinner with his wife, Maria, after filling in as a substitute teacher at Covenant.“Maria woke up this morning without one of her best friends,” Lee said, adding that Peak, Koonce and his wife had once taught together and “have been family friends for decades.”Sandra McCalla, a former administrator at the high school Peak attended in Shreveport, Louisiana, said Peak served as the statistician at girls’ basketball games and track meets before graduating in 1979.“She was busy in the background making good things happen,” said McCalla, who served as the principal of Captain Shreve High School for 30 years.Chuck Owen, who knew Peak from childhood, said Peak’s father was a well-known doctor in Leesville, Louisiana, where the family lived before moving to Shreveport.He said, “everyone knew her, knew her family"" and that she was ""just a sweet person from a sweet family.”Owen added that Peak was a devout follower of God, and it did not surprise him that she was working at a Christian school.“She told me that she got saved in college and that God’s love changed her life,” he said.Nashville songwriter Natalie Hemby posted on Instagram that Peak “taught me how to swim. Keep my head above water… which is what we’re all trying to do right now.""Peak's family issued a statement saying their “hearts are broken,” and called Peak “a pillar of the community, and a teacher beloved by all her students.”“She never wavered in her faith and we know she is wrapped in the arms of Jesus,” the statement said.Koonce, the head of The Covenant School, was a woman of deep faith who saw educating kids as her mission.“It’s what God called her to do,” close friend Jackie Bailey said.“We’re in such shock,” Bailey added. “I was looking around my house, and every piece of cross stitch that I have on the wall, she did – she gave to me.""One of them said: “A friend loveth at all times.”“That’s Proverb 17:17,” Bailey said. ""That’s the kind of person she was. She loved at all times.”Bailey added: “If there was any trouble in that school, she would run to it, not from it. She was trying to protect those kids … That’s just what I believe.”Koonce's family said in a statement Wednesday that she “gave her life to protect the students she loved.”“We are devastated by our loss but depending on our God for comfort and healing,” the family said. ""It is our privilege to honor Katherine’s legacy and to celebrate her remarkable spirit.”Before Koonce took the top role with Covenant, Anna Caudill, a former art teacher, worked with her for almost a decade at Christ Presbyterian Academy, another Christian school in the area connected to a Presbyterian Church in America congregation.“She was an absolute dynamo and one of the smartest women I’ll ever know,” said Caudill, recalling how Koonce excelled at her day job while parenting her children, pursuing her masters and then her PhD, and writing a book.Caudill, who grew up in several male-led Christian denominations, said Koonce was the first woman in such a setting to encourage her to keep learning and pursuing her life goals.“She wasn’t Wonder Woman, but I never saw the two in the same place,” Caudill said.Friends of Hill, the custodian, said they believed he would have died protecting the school's children.Pastor Tim Dunavant, of the Hartsville First United Methodist Church, said in a Facebook post that he hired Hill to work at Covenant more than a decade ago.“I don’t know the details yet. But I have a feeling, when it all comes out, Mike’s sacrifice saved lives,” Dunavant wrote.Hill’s family issued a statement saying, “We pray for the Covenant School and are so grateful that Michael was beloved by the faculty and students who filled him with joy for 14 years. He was a father of seven children ... and 14 grandchildren. He liked to cook and spend time with family.”Another pastor, Jim Bachmann, said Hill was “one of those people you cannot not like” and that he made a point of learning the names of all the students and talking to them.Bachmann was the founding pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, and is the current pastor of Stephens Valley Church, where Hill was a member and sometimes served as a greeter.On those occasions, Hill would “dress up like he was going to meet the president of the United States,” Bachmann said. He added, “Everybody loved Mike, and he loved them back.”___Associated Press reporters Travis Loller in Nashville and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this story.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4850698,"Mexico: Despite ""coup,"" Castillo legal president of Peru","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Wednesday that Peru's ousted president, Pedro Castillo, remains “the legal and legitimate president” of that country and that he was jailed as part of a “coup.”President Andrés Manuel López Obrador also claimed Peru’s current government is “racist” and had jailed Castillo because he is indigenous. The comments were the most forceful indication yet that López Obrador doesn’t recognize current Peruvian President Dina Boluarte.“I maintain that he (Castillo) is the legal and legitimate president,” López Obrador said at his morning press briefing. “He suffered a coup.”“They won't accept Pedro Castillo because he is from the mountains, he is indigenous,” the president said.Boluarte took office on Dec. 7 after then-President Castillo was removed by Parliament and jailed after trying to dissolve Congress to avoid a vote on his removal from office. Castillo, who was Peru’s first leader from a rural Andean background, was plagued by corruption scandals and a revolving-door cabinet.López Obrador’s administration has not said that it would withdraw formal recognition of Boluarte's government. But relations between the two countries have suffered because of the Mexican president’s stance.In February, Boluarte withdrew her country’s ambassador in response to previous comments by López Obrado.Mexico's formal position is that it neither ‘recognizes’ nor withholds recognition from other countries' governments, but has not explained how that policy squares with López Obrador's statements.Street protests in Peru against Castillo's removal began in December and have been answered by police actions that have left 67 dead overall, mostly protesters, according to Peru’s ombudsman.While López Obrador has slammed the killing of protesters in Peru, he has been criticized for saying little about the hundreds of Nicaraguans killed or exiled by the government of President Daniel Ortega.",2023/03/30,,World
