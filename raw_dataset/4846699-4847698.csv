https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846733,Iran-backed fighters on alert in east Syria after US strikes,"BEIRUT (AP) — Iran-backed fighters were on alert in eastern Syria on Saturday, a day afte r U.S. forces launched retaliatory airstrikes on sites in the war-torn country, opposition activists said. The airstrikes came after a suspected Iran-made drone killed a U.S. contractor and wounded six other Americans on Thursday.The situation was calm following a day in which rockets were fired at bases housing U.S. troops in eastern Syria. The rockets came after U.S. airstrikes on three different areas in Syria’s eastern province of Deir el-Zour, which borders Iraq, opposition activists said.While it’s not the first time the U.S. and Iran have traded strikes in Syria, the attack and the U.S. response threaten to upend recent efforts to deescalate tensions across the wider Middle East, whose rival powers have made steps toward détente in recent days after years of turmoil.In the first Syrian comment since the attacks occurred, the foreign ministry condemned the U.S. strikes saying they are “a flagrant violation of Syria's sovereignty.” The ministry added in a statement that Damascus aims to end “American occupation” and spread government control over all parts of the country.“The calm continues as Iran-backed militiamen are on alert out of concern of possible new airstrikes,” said Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor.Omar Abu Layla, an activist from Deir el-Zour who is currently in the U.S. and runs a group that monitors developments in east Syria, said Iran-backed fighters have evacuated some of their posts and moved into trenches in case of any more American strikes. “They are in a state of alert,” he said.President Joe Biden said Friday that the U.S. would respond “forcefully” to protect its personnel after U.S. forces retaliated with airstrikes on sites in Syria used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. The strikes followed an attack Thursday by a suspected Iran-made drone that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded five American servicemembers and a U.S. contractor.“The United States does not, does not seek conflict with Iran,” Biden said in Ottawa, Canada, where he was on a state visit. But he said Iran and its proxies should be prepared for the U.S. “to act forcefully to protect our people. That’s exactly what happened last night.” Activists said the U.S. bombing killed at least four people.In Iran, domestic media outlets quoted a spokesman for the nation’s Supreme National Security Council, Keivan Khosravi, as saying that Tehran would immediately respond to any U.S. attack on Iranian bases in Syria.“Any excuses-seeking attitude for attack on bases that are established at the request of the Syrian government, will immediately face an answer,” Khosravi was quoted as saying. Khosravi rejected U.S charges that Iran is behind attacks on American bases in Syria, suggesting they are attacks against “illegal occupation of part of Syria.”A statement issued late Friday by the Iranian Consultative Center in Syria warned the U.S. not to carry out further strikes in Syria. Otherwise, “we will have to retaliate."" It warned that ""it will not be a simple revenge.”The center, which speaks on behalf of Tehran in Syria, said the U.S. airstrikes targeted places used to store food products and other service centers in Deir el-Zour. It said the strike killed seven people and wounded seven others without giving the nationalities of the dead. An official with an Iran-backed group in Iraq said the strikes killed seven Iranians.The Observatory raised the death toll from the U.S. strikes to 19, saying they were killed in three locations, including an arms depot in the Harabesh neighborhood in the city of Deir el-Zour, and two military posts near the towns of Mayadeen and Boukamal.Iran-backed militia groups and Syrian forces control the area, which also has seen suspected airstrikes by Israel in recent months allegedly targeting Iranian supply routes.According to U.S. officials, two simultaneous attacks were launched at U.S. forces in Syria late Friday. Officials said that based on preliminary information, there was a rocket attack on the Conoco plant, where U.S. troops are stationed, and one U.S. service member was wounded but is in stable condition. At about the same time, several drones were launched at Green Village, in Deir el-Zour province where U.S. troops are also based. One official said all but one of the drones were shot down, and there were no U.S. injuries there. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been suspected of carrying out attacks with bomb-carrying drones across the wider Middle East.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the American intelligence community had determined the drone in Thursday’s attack was of Iranian origin, but offered no other immediate evidence to support the claim. The drone hit a coalition base in the northeast Syrian city of Hasakeh.Iran relies on a network of proxy forces throughout the Mideast to counter the U.S. and Israel, its arch regional enemy. The U.S. has had forces in northeast Syria since 2015, when they deployed as part of the fight against the Islamic State group, and maintains some 900 troops there, working with Kurdish-led forces that control around a third of Syria.The exchange of strikes came as Saudi Arabia and Iran have been working toward reopening embassies in each other’s countries. The kingdom also acknowledged efforts to reopen a Saudi embassy in Syria, whose embattled President Bashar Assad has been backed by Iran in his country’s long war.The State Department said in a statement Saturday that they have been in contact with Saudi officials about their approach to the region, including with Syria adding that Washington’s stance against normalization with Assad’s government “remains unchanged, and we have been clear about this.”The State Department said the U.S.'s consistent message to regional partners who are engaging with the Syrian government has been that “credible steps to improve the situation for the Syrian people should be front and center in any engagement.”According to officials, Iran has launched 80 attacks against U.S. forces and locations in Iraq and Syria since January 2021. The vast majority of those have been in Syria.The U.S. under Biden has struck Syria previously over tensions with Iran — in February and June of 2021, as well as August 2022.Syria’s conflict that began in 2011 has left nearly half a million people dead.___Associated Press writers Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria contributed to this report.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846734,"As South bans abortion, thousands turn to Illinois clinics","FAIRVIEW HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) — Dr. Colleen McNicholas is fresh off performing two abortions when a ringing phone quickly stops her.“Oh, ugh,” she said, eyes widened, before she darted off to another room.Just the day before, 58 women had abortions at the Fairview Heights’ Planned Parenthood clinic, 15 miles east of St. Louis. But the new day is still stacked with appointments; as many as 100 abortion and family planning patients might walk through the doors.Every day is busy now.Hundreds of women travel each week to the southern tip of Illinois to secure an abortion, something that is no longer available to millions living in a 1,800 mile stretch of 11 Southern states that have mostly banned pregnancy terminations since the Supreme Court stripped away constitutional protections for women to end pregnancies.But another barrier awaits them once they reach the clinic in one of the country's most abortion-friendly states. Anti-abortion advocates in neon hazard vests frantically try to wave passersby down at the gates, hoping to talk them out of what they are about to do.The clinic's waitlist for abortions has only grown from two days to nearly three weeks after the Supreme Court ruling last June — even after staffers started working 10-hour shifts and they opened the clinic on Saturdays.“With every piece of litigation, with every new constitutional amendment, with every new abortion restriction in a state that has some access, we are on this teeter-totter of what can we do here to make more space for the people who are going to be fleeing their home state?” McNicholas said.With 10,000 abortion patients expected this year at the clinic, there's talk of opening on Sundays. Staff developed an emergency plan that would convert some patient rooms, normally reserved for birth control consultations or vasectomies, to make more room for abortions. A recreational vehicle has been retooled into a mobile clinic that can travel along the state line for doctors to provide abortions.That still won’t be enough to keep up, McNicholas predicted.She’s eyeing a proposed six-week abortion ban in Florida which could send even more women from the South seeking abortions up north. And she’s closely watching how a Texas judge will rule on a case that seeks to keep the abortion pill mifepristone off the market.“Any additional decision has the potential to really change demand again,” she said. “It’s like crisis management every day of the year.”Months before Roe v. Wade was overturned, Planned Parenthood and the nearby Hope Clinic had already been grappling with a surge of patients from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and elsewhere after Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, signed a bill into law that effectively shut down several abortion clinics in his state and led to long waiting lists in neighboring states’ facilities. Together, the clinics launched a new regional logistics center in January 2022 dedicated to helping out-of-state patients book hotels, flights, gas money, bus rides or rental cars to either facility.Just six months later, on June 24, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was not a constitutionally protected right. Within hours, states such as Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas began enacting trigger laws that banned abortions.Now, about 70 women call the center every day for help getting to an abortion clinic in southern Illinois, said Kawanna Shannon, the director of patient access at the Planned Parenthood clinic. When they reach the line, a navigator first goes over what they can pay toward their abortion. There are other details: How will the patient get to the area? Does she have money for food while she stays there? Will she need child care?When someone cannot afford to pay for hotels, bus tickets or plane rides, the center books the travel for the patient and works with more than 30 nonprofit groups around the country that solicit funds for abortion access to fund the trip.The work doesn’t end there.A staffer is available around-the-clock to answer desperate calls from patients who run into travel issues. Workers raced to arrange a ride to the airport in the middle of the night for one patient to flee her abusive partner. They troubleshoot when a car breaks down on the trip to southern Illinois. They navigated canceled flights during a crushing winter travel season to make sure one woman made it back to her family on Christmas day after an abortion.“It’s not going to slow down,” Shannon said. “We are really taking care of the entire Southern region. All the (patients) in the South are really coming to southern Illinois because we’re the closest. Almost all of them need some type of help – be it travel, be it procedure costs.”Two hours south of the Planned Parenthood clinic, two new abortion clinics opened in Carbondale, Illinois, late last year to give women living in banned states a closer option.After reading the Supreme Court’s leaked draft opinion last May, Andrea Gallegos, the director of the Alamo Clinic, said she hopped on Google and started looking for liberal-leaning cities in rural, southern Illinois.“Illinois was just a state that really stood out in this sea of states that would more than likely ban abortion,” Gallegos said. “It seemed like a good choice to try and get over there.”The Alamo Clinic relocated to the area from Oklahoma last November.Three doctors in a rotation travel from Montana, Tennessee or Texas weekly to perform about 30 abortions daily at the clinic, which will terminate a pregnancy before 18 weeks. Gallegos says fewer than 5% of patients who come to the clinic are from Illinois.Most patients coming to the Fairview Heights clinic are no longer from the region, either. During the final six months of last year, the clinic saw 2,042 abortion patients from outside of Missouri or Illinois — up from just 314 the six months before.Women are now seeking abortions later in their pregnancies at the Planned Parenthood clinic, which offers the procedure through 26 weeks. About one-quarter of patients need a second trimester abortion, McNicholas said.But the hardest change to deal with has been the steady increase in children who are coming to the clinic, hoping to end a pregnancy that was the result of a rape or abuse.“What you use to see was maybe one or two 10-and 11-year-olds a year,” she said. “Now you’re seeing a couple a month because they’re coming from all over the country. Just sitting with that knowledge that this many people are experiencing so much trauma ... There are times where it’s really hard.”___The Associated Press receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for public health reporting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846735,"Biden's moves on Alaska drilling, TikTok test young voters","TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Recent moves by President Joe Biden to pressure TikTok over its Chinese ownership and approve oil drilling in an untapped area of Alaska are testing the loyalty of young voters, a group that’s largely been in his corner.Youth turnout surged in the three elections since Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, helping Biden eke out victories in swing states in 2020, pick up a Democratic Senate seat in the 2022 election and stem potential losses in the House.But the 80-year-old president has never been the favorite candidate of young liberals itching for a new generation of American leadership. As Biden gears up for an expected reelection campaign, a potential TikTok ban and the Alaska drilling could weigh him down.Meanwhile, his plan to wipe out billions of dollars in student loan debt is in jeopardy at the Supreme Court. The effort, announced shortly before last year’s midterms, was an attempt by Biden to keep a promise he made after defeating progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary campaign in 2020.The risk for Biden is less that young left-of-center voters will vote Republican and more that they would sit out an uninspiring election altogether.“I’m a Democrat, but I’m not voting for Biden,” said Mark Buehlmann, a 20-year-old Arizona State University student who said he likely would abstain if Biden is the Democratic nominee, as expected. “He’s maybe capable of doing a good job, but he’s not capable of gathering the troops, rallying the people. Especially the Democratic voter base. I don’t think he’s a strong candidate.”TikTok allows users, 150 million of whom are in the United States, to post short, creative videos for friends and strangers. Its algorithm has an uncanny ability to figure out what interests its users and serve up videos they’ll enjoy. It’s become a supremely popular — some say addictive — place for young people to find entertainment and community.Western governments are growing increasingly worried that TikTok’s owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, might give browsing history or other data about users to China’s government or promote propaganda and disinformation. The U.S. and other nations have banned TikTok from government-owned devices, as have several states.The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, part of Biden's Treasury Department, has threatened to ban TikTok if ByteDance doesn't sell its stake in the app, according to a Wall Street Journal report this month.Trump tried to ban TikTok in 2020, but the move was blocked in court and later rescinded when Biden took office and ordered an in-depth study of the issue.ByteDance says it's working to address security concerns and has plans to route traffic through servers owned by Oracle, a Silicon Valley-based tech company.Biden administration officials insist that political concerns aren’t weighing into the national security review underway, but they’re also not blind to it.Both political parties have reoriented around staking out tougher economic and security positions on China’s rise, and Biden has come under increasing pressure from GOP lawmakers to take action against TikTok.In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo offered hyperbolically, “The politician in me thinks you’re going to literally lose every voter under 35, forever.”But it’s clear that the Biden White House and his likely reelection campaign are keenly aware of the app’s massive domestic reach and demographic skew toward Democratic-leaning younger voters.Highlighting Biden's balancing act, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a progressive New York Democrat popular on the left, held a news conference this past week with TikTok creators who have built popular and profitable channels on the social network “in support of free expression.”Lawmakers grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew for nearly six hours Thursday over data security and harmful content. They responded skeptically during a tense House committee hearing to his assurances that the app prioritizes user safety and should not be banned due to its Chinese connections.“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said.In interviews at Arizona State, one of the largest college campuses in the U.S. and a contributor to Biden's narrow 10,000-vote win in the swing state, young people described a TikTok ban as somewhere between an annoyance and an inevitability — but not something that would change their views of the president.“Most people don’t really think about those kinds of things,” Lucas Vittor, a 19-year-old business administration student from Houston, said of a TikTok ban. “I think that they’ll probably just see it as, ‘He’s an oppressive leader, an old dude, he doesn’t know about social media.’”If TikTok disappears, another app will emerge to capture the attention of young people, Vittor predicted. Other social media platforms, including YouTube and Instagram, have incorporated similar algorithm-driven video features, though some find them clunky compared with TikTok.“It's not really Biden's issue,” said Ginny Xu, a 20-year-old chemical engineering student from Goodyear, Arizona. “It's more of a bipartisan thing — ‘safety’ from China.""Losing access to TikTok would be disappointing, Xu said, but it wouldn't dissuade her from voting for Biden if there's no better Democratic choice.Her friend, 20-year-old chemical engineering student Maddie Bruce, agreed.“I just am not a big Joe Biden fan,” Bruce said. She would prefer to see another Democrat run, but she would still vote for Biden, she said.Forcing TikTok’s Chinese parent to sell its stake in the U.S. company could provide a convenient middle ground: minimizing the national security threat while avoiding having access to the app cut off for tens of millions of users.The young have never voted at the same rates as their parents and grandparents, but their participation has ticked up markedly since the start of the Trump presidency.The 2018 and 2022 midterms brought the highest levels of youth turnout of the past three decades, according to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, which studies young voters.And when they do vote, young people vote overwhelmingly for Democrats.Biden won 63% of voters age 18 to 24, compared with 34% for Trump, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of the electorate. Republican House candidates did better with young voters in last year’s midterms, but Democrats still had a 14-percentage point advantage, winning voters 24 and younger 54% to 40%.“If Democrats are looking for their secret weapon, young voters are it,” said Jack Lobel, spokesperson for Voters of Tomorrow, which organizes young voters online and in person. “For Democrats especially, who already have young voters basically on their side, we are the untapped potential that campaigns are looking for.”A TikTok ban might irritate a lot of young voters, but Biden can point to a strong record of standing up for young people’s interests, Lobel said.Biden has tried to offer relief from student loan debt and has advocated for abortion rights. He signed a massive climate spending bill along with the most sweeping gun violence bill in decades.Marisol Ortega, a 21-year-old journalism student from Glendale, Arizona, said many of her peers are looking for someone younger and more exciting, even if they'll likely hold their nose and vote for him.“Joe Biden has been a name in American politics for a very, very long time,"" Ortega said. “I think people are just kind of ready for something new.”Still, the Biden administration irked environmentalists and young people by approving the huge Willow oil drilling project on Alaska's North Slope.Young activists have been particularly active in pushing to drastically reduce oil drilling and move away from reliance fossil fuels. Before the president's decision, a #StopWillow campaign garnered millions of views on TikTok urging Biden to block the project.“He has delivered a lot for young people, and that’s why our advice to the administration was, ‘This is not the right direction to head on this issue,’” said Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of NextGen America, a youth organizing group.___AP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.__This story was first published on March 25, 2023. It was updated on March 27, 2023, to correct that the 2018 and 2022 midterms, not 2020, brought the highest levels of youth turnout of the past three decades.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846736,Yemen rebels restrict humanitarian flights arriving in Sanaa,"CAIRO (AP) — The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they were imposing severe restrictions starting Saturday on U.N. and other humanitarian flights arriving in the capital, Sanaa.The Houthi-run Civil Aviation Authority said no humanitarian flights would land in Sanaa between March 25-30. It said in a statement they would allow such flights into Sanaa only on Fridays.The Houthis said their decision was in response to what they claimed was a prohibition by a Saudi-led coalition that backs the government on commercial flights to and from the Yemeni capital, and a ban on booking flights from Sanaa.The Houthis provided no evidence supporting their claim of a ban on commercial flights, which were still partly operating as part of last year's cease-fire deal between the warring parties. Yemen's state-run airline operated flights between Sanaa and the Jordanian capital, Amman, as recently as Friday.Yemen’s war erupted in 2014, when the Houthis seized Sanaa and forced the government into exile in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led coalition entered the conflict in March 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government to power.The U.N.’s World Food Program, which manages humanitarian flights to the war-torn country, expressed deep concerns about the Houthi move.“This decision could have significant impacts on the ability of the United Nations and our NGO partners to deliver urgently required support to people in need,” Abeer Etefa, a spokeswoman for the WFP, said in an email.Waleed al-Abarah, a spokesman for Yemen’s Human Rights Ministry in Aden, said the Houthi decision amounts to a “war crime,"" accusing the rebels of weaponizing humanitarian activities to achieve political gains.In televised comments, he warned of a looming famine in Yemen amid funding shortages of the humanitarian response in 2023.The Sanaa International Airport was partly reopened for commercial fights last year as part of a U.N.-brokered cease-fire deal between Yemen’s warring parties. The cease-fire expired in October when the two sides failed to reach a compromise to renew the truce.The Houthi move comes amid an escalation in fighting in the central province of Marib, where the Houthi rebels in recent days attacked government-held areas.On Saturday, a suspected Houthi attack targeted the convoy of Nabil Shamsan, the governor of government-held province of Taiz, as he was returning from a visit to the city of Mocha on the Red Sea, according to Yemen’s Minister of Information Muammar al-Eryani.The attack killed one of Shamsan’s companions and wounded two others, al-Eryani said on Twitter. The provincial governor survived the attack, he added.While, al-Eryani said that attack was by an explosive-laden drone, the state-run SABA news agency later reported that the rebels used a missile and mortar shells in the attack.A Houthi spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.The escalation comes after Iran and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement earlier this month to restore bilateral relations, reviving hopes of a political settlement to Yemen’s conflict, where the two regional powerhouses support opposing sides.The Houthi restrictions on humanitarian flights is likely to exaggerate the suffering of Yemenis in Houthi-held areas, including the capital.Yemen’s conflict has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 21 million people in Yemen, or two-thirds of the country’s population, need help and protection, according to the U.N.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846737,Tuchel ready for tough start at Bayern after surprise move,"MUNICH (AP) — New Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel acknowledged Saturday he faces a challenging start to his new job after his surprise hiring Friday to replace Julian Nagelsmann.Tuchel goes straight into crucial games, starting with German title rival — and Tuchel’s former club — Borussia Dortmund on April 1.“The challenge can’t be any greater,” Tuchel said.Ten days later, Bayern plays Manchester City in the quarterfinals of the Champions League.There will be little time to rest or practice new tactics, with many Bayern players currently away with their national teams and then seven games in the first 22 days of April.""I was relatively naive in the first conversation (with Bayern). In the first 30 seconds I didn't know what we were discussing or what it was about,” Tuchel said.Once it became clear Bayern wanted him to take charge immediately, “it occurred to me that it actually begins right away with Dortmund with an international break beforehand.”Bayern against Dortmund is “the"" game in German soccer, he added.Tuchel said the move came as a surprise and that as recently as Tuesday he had no contact with Bayern. He imagined his next job would be outside of Germany, he added, but that he had been following Bayern's season with interest.Tuchel hasn’t worked in Germany since 2017. When he left, the only major trophy he’d won was the German Cup with Dortmund. He returns having won two French titles at Paris Saint-Germain and the Champions League and Club World Cup with Chelsea.Bayern can still win three titles this season — the Bundesliga, the German Cup and the Champions League.Consistency is a concern after Bayern chief executive Oliver Kahn highlighted that as a reason for getting rid of Nagelsmann.Bayern is likely to be looking for Tuchel to get the best out of players like Leroy Sané and Serge Gnabry, whose form has dropped off this season, and Sadio Mané, who has rarely been at his best in an injury-disrupted season since joining from Liverpool.Sporting director Hasan Salihamidžić said the club backed Nagelsmann as concerns grew over the team's performance but decided on a change at a meeting Monday, a day after a loss to Bayer Leverkusen cost Bayern the Bundesliga lead.“When you see that this curve of performance is going down, you’re forced to react,"" he said, asked if Bayern had reacted to the possibility Tuchel might take a job elsewhere. “Fortunately, there was a top option on the market and it happened quickly.""___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846738,Vice President Harris' trip aims to deepen US ties in Africa,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris will try to deepen and reframe U.S. relationships in Africa during a weeklong trip that is the latest and highest profile outreach by the Biden administration as it moves to counter China's growing influence.Harris plans to visit Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia, focusing on economic development, climate change, food security and a rising youth population. She is scheduled to arrive in Accra, Ghana’s capital, on Sunday. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, is traveling with her.“For too long, the U.S. foreign policy establishment has treated Africa like some kind of extra credit project and not part of the core curriculum,"" said Michelle Gavin, an Africa expect at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana. ""I see a big effort to change that thinking now. But it takes time.”In Africa, Harris will be closely watched as the first person of color and first woman to serve as America's vice president. Her mother was born in India and her father was born in Jamaica; Harris was raised in California.“Everybody is excited about Kamala Harris,” said Idayat Hassan, director of the Centre for Democracy and Development in Abuja, Nigeria. “You can be anything that you can think of — that’s what she represents to many of us.”A centerpiece of Harris' trip will be a speech in Accra and a visit to Cape Coast Castle, where enslaved Africans were once loaded onto ships for America. Harris also plans to meet with leaders of each country she visits and lay a wreath to commemorate the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.Her itinerary also includes several less traditional stops intended to highlight the dynamic future of a continent where the median age is just 19.Harris plans to visit a recording studio and meet with female entrepreneurs in Accra and stop by a tech incubator in Dar es Salaam. In Lusaka, Zambia’s capital, Harris is expected to meet with business and philanthropic leaders to talk about expanding access to digital and financial systems.Emhoff has a similar focus for his events. While in Ghana, he plans a town hall meeting with actors from a local television show, will attend a girls basketball clinic and tour a chocolate company owned by women.The hope, administration officials said, is to portray Africa as a place for investment, not just aid packages, a theme that Harris emphasized in December during a U.S.-Africa summit in Washington.“I am an optimist about what lies ahead for Africa and, by extension, for the world because of you — because of your energy, your ambition, and your ability to transform seemingly intractable problems into opportunities,"" she said. ""Simply put: your ability to see what can be, unburdened by what has been.”The trip includes three nights in Ghana, two nights in Tanzania and one in Zambia, before Harris returns to Washington on April 2.“It’s a trip about supporting reformers,” said Vanda Felbab-Brown, co-director of the Africa Security Initiative at the Brookings Institution. “All three countries have been going through significant challenges and significant changes.”Ghana faces a debt crisis and high inflation, dragging down an economy that was once among the region’s strongest. It’s also wary about instability from Islamist militants and Russian mercenaries who operate in nations north of Ghana.Tanzania has its first female president, and she’s lifted bans on opposition parties and rallies. Zambia has made its own changes, such as decriminalizing defamation of the president. However, democratic progress is believed to be fragile in both places.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and first lady Jill Biden have already been to Africa on their own trips. President Joe Biden is expected to go later this year.Harris will be returning to Zambia for the first time since she visited as a young girl when her maternal grandfather worked there. He was an Indian civil servant who helped with refugee resettlement after Zambia achieved independence from Britain.Harris writes in her book that “grandpa was one of my favorite people in the world and one of the earliest and most lasting influences in my life.”The U.S.-Africa summit held in December was the only one since 2014, which was hosted by President Barack Obama. Although Washington's approach to Africa has featured some historic success — for example, President George W. Bush's initiative to fight HIV/AIDS has saved millions of lives — there's also been periods of neglect.“There’s huge doubt and skepticism about American staying power,"" said Daniel Russel, a former State Department official who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “They’re very familiar with American promises that peter out and don’t amount to much.”It's a sharp contrast with China, which has led far-reaching infrastructure projects and expanded telecommunications operations there as well.John Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said this past week that African leaders are “beginning to realize that China is not really their friend.”“China’s interests in the region are purely selfish, as opposed to the United States,"" he said. ""We are truly committed to trying to help our African friends deal with a spate of challenges.”Senior administration officials have been careful not to portray Harris’ trip as another move in a geopolitical rivalry, an approach that could alienate African leaders who are wary of taking sides between global superpowers.Now they wait to see what Harris and the United States can offer over the next week.“She has a very good reputation in Africa, because of her profile,"" said Rama Yade, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center. ""But beyond that, very quickly, the public opinion in the three countries will have expectations.”__This story was first published on March 25, 2023.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846766,Thai Prime Minister Prayuth kicks off reelection campaign,"NONTHABURI, Thailand (AP) — Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Saturday officially accepted his party’s nomination as its main candidate to keep the job in the upcoming general election, promising to build a new political climate that does away with decades of conflict.The 69-year-old former general led a military coup in 2014, following months of violent street protests in Bangkok against the elected government. Thailand has suffered from political instability since the army in a 2006 takeover ousted the government of billionaire populist Thaksin Shinawatra.“We will create a new political climate,"" Prayuth said in a speech before 1,000 supporters at a convention center on the outskirts of Bangkok, less than a week after he dissolved Parliament to set a May 14 election date.""We will have policies that address issues of the people and the country, and most importantly – and I only need to say one word, I don’t need to expand or anything – we will move beyond conflict,” he said.Prayuth was the banner attraction at a meeting of the recently formed United Thai Nation party, where its full slate of 400 lawmaker candidates was unveiled.“We cannot have any more conflict,"" he said. ""In the decades that have passed, there have been problems. Don’t forget. Don’t have short term memory. We cannot let it happen again.”Prayuth’s seizure of power in 2014 brought in five years of military enforced stability. But after he was selected prime minister following the 2019 election, there were new outbursts of violence as his government used heavy-handed measures to try to curb student-led pro-democracy demonstrations.Prayuth’s path back to the top looks challenging. Opinion polls put him far behind the opposition Pheu Thai party’s Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Thaksin's daughter, as well as a candidate from a progressive party.Populist parties linked to Thaksin have won the most seats in every election since 2001.Prayuth also faces a challenge from Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, who is known as a formidable political operator. The former army comrades recently drifted apart, with Prayuth joining the new United Thai Nation party and Prawit staying with Palang Pracharath, the largest party in the government coalition.The prime minister is not directly chosen by the popular vote but is selected by a joint session of both houses of Parliament. The 250-strong upper house, or Senate, is likely to vote as a bloc in favor of a conservative candidate. In 2019, the Senate unanimously backed Prayuth.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846767,"German bishop resigns, cites responsibility in abuse scandal","BERLIN (AP) — Pope Francis on Saturday accepted a resignation request from a German bishop who asked to step down because of his mistakes in handling sexual abuse cases.Franz-Josef Bode, who has been the bishop of Osnabrueck, Germany, since 1995, said in a personal statement that his decision to resign “has matured in me in recent months” and he hoped it would have a liberating effect on the diocese.Bode explained that an interim report released in September on abuse by clergy in the diocese had revealed his mistakes. He acknowledged his responsibility as a bishop and said, “Today, I can only ask all those affected again for forgiveness.”Abuse survivor groups have accused Bode of failing to respond appropriately to some cases of abuse, German news agency dpa reported.The head of the German Bishops’ Conference, Bishop Georg Baetzing, issued a statement that noted Bode's resignation with “great regret and respect.”With his resignation, Bode “also takes responsibility for the topic of sexual abuse in the church, which has accompanied ... all of us for a long time,"" Baetzing said.""Your will to come to terms, to improve the treatment of victims and perpetrators in your diocese, and also to bring about systemic change in our church have not let you go since,” he added, addressing Bode directly in his statement.A church-commissioned report on sexual abuse inside the Catholic Church in Germany in 2018 said 3,677 people were abused by clergy between 1946 and 2014. More than half of the victims were 13 or younger, and most were boys. Every sixth case involved rape, and at least 1,670 clergy were involved.Bode became auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese of Paderborn in 1991, and had been bishop of Osnabrueck since 1995, making him Germany's longest-serving active bishop.Irme Stetter-Karp, the president of the Central Committee of German Catholics, an influential German lay group, expressed respect for Bode's decision.“His resignation from office certainly marks an important step from the point of view of those affected, in order to make real progress in dealing with the abuse scandal,” she said.The pope has not yet responded to a resignation request from a German cardinal who also was accused of mishandling sexual abuse cases. The request from Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki stemmed from a crisis of confidence in the Cologne archdiocese that started in 2020.The crisis began when, citing legal concerns, Woelki kept under wraps a report he commissioned on how local church officials reacted when priests were accused of sexual abuse. The withholding of the report infuriated many Cologne Catholics. A second report, published in March 2021, found 75 cases in which high-ranking officials had neglected their duties.The report absolved Woelki of any neglect of his legal duty with respect to abuse victims. He subsequently said he made mistakes in past cases involving sexual abuse allegations but insisted he had no intention of resigning.Two papal envoys were dispatched to Cologne a few months later to investigate possible mistakes by senior officials in handling cases. Their report led Pope Francis to give Woelki a “spiritual timeout” of several months for making major communication errors.In March 2022, after his return from the timeout, the cardinal submitted his offer to resign but so far Francis has not acted on it.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846768,"Russia 'largely stalled' in Bakhmut, shifting focus, UK says","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The top commander of Ukraine's military said Saturday that his forces were pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut, and British military intelligence says Russia appears to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine.“The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defense forces, the situation is being stabilized,” Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi said in a post on Telegram giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm. Sir Tony Radakin, Britain's chief of defense staff.The seven-month fight for Bakhmut, where Russian forces have closed in on three sides, is the longest battle of the war, with Russia deploying both regular soldiers and fighters of the mercenary Wagner Group.Russian forces must go through Bakhmut to push deeper into parts of the eastern Donbas region, though Western officials say the capture of the city would have limited impact on the course of the war.Britain's Defense Ministry said in its latest intelligence update that “Russia's assault on the Donbas town of Bakhmut has largely stalled. This is likely primarily a result of extreme attrition of the Russian force.”Russia is likely shifting its focus toward two other sectors, which “suggests an overall return to a more defensive operational design after inconclusive results from its attempts to conduct a general offensive since January,” the U.K. ministry wrote on Twitter.However, the Ukrainian military cautioned that a change in strategy was not yet clear and that Bakhmut remained Russia's main point of attack for now. A spokesman for Ukraine's eastern forces, Serhii Cherevaty, said the Russian forces were still hitting the town with artillery and airstrikes, although the number of daily clashes had dropped to fewer than 20, down from 30 to 50 not long ago.“The coming week will tell,” Cherevaty said on Ukrainian television.Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk province, where Bakhmut is located, said one civilian was killed in the fighting on Friday and another civilian was killed elsewhere in the province. Russian rockets hit the town of Kramatorsk during the night, but caused no injuries, Kyrylenko said.On Saturday, Russian artillery struck Chasiv Yar, a city west of Bakhmut, and Toretsk to the south, killing two civilians, the Ukrainian presidential office said.Two people were killed and six injured in Russian firing on the southern Kherson region, the local administration said.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846794,Taliban want control of more Afghan diplomatic missions,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — The Taliban government is trying to take charge of more Afghan embassies abroad, a spokesman said Saturday, amid their continued international isolation because of restrictions on women and girls.The Taliban initially promised a more moderate rule after their takeover in August 2021, but instead imposed sweeping bans and other measures curtailing basic freedoms.The U.N. and foreign governments have fiercely condemned the restrictions on female education and employment, and the international community remains wary of officially recognizing the Taliban, although some countries retain an active diplomatic mission in Afghanistan, including Pakistan, Turkey, Qatar, and China.“The Islamic Emirate has sent diplomats to at least 14 countries and efforts are underway to take charge of other diplomatic missions abroad,” the government’s main spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a video. “Diplomats of the former government are continuing their activities in coordination with the Foreign Ministry.”The administration has sent its diplomats to Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Russia, China, Kazakhstan and other Arab and African countries, according to Mujahid. He gave no further details.In February, authorities handed over control of Afghanistan’s embassy in Tehran to envoys of the Taliban government. It was previously staffed by envoys from the former U.S.-backed Afghan government.The deputy spokesman for the government, Bilal Karimi, was unable to immediately provide figures on how many Afghan diplomatic missions are active overseas or how many the administration has taken charge of since August 2021.“There are many embassies abroad. The Islamic Emirate wants to have diplomatic relations with all countries and move forward with good interactions,"" he told The Associated Press. ""It is our hope that embassies will be opened in all countries as soon as official relations begin with the Islamic Emirate.”The Foreign Ministry spokesman did not respond to the AP's questions on embassies.In January, the highest-ranking woman at the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, said the Taliban want international recognition and Afghanistan’s U.N. seat, which is currently held by the former government led by Ashraf Ghani.“Recognition is one leverage that we have and we should hold on to,” she said, after meeting Taliban ministers in Kabul and Kandahar to try to reverse their crackdowns on women and girls.They have banned girls from middle school, high school and university and banned women from most fields of employment, including at nongovernmental groups. Women have also been ordered to wear head-to-toe clothing in public and are barred from parks and gyms.Schools reopened for the new academic year last week without teenage girls, more than 18 months after the ban on secondary education came into effect.Universities reopened after the winter break in early March without their female students, and the ban on NGO work is still in place, although some aid agencies have partially resumed their activities through exemptions.Jan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Friday that more than three months have passed since the “intolerable ban” on female aid workers in Afghanistan. “We have made some local progress, allowing women’s return to work, but still await national permits.”",2023/03/25,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846820,India: Rahul Gandhi defiant after removal from parliament,"The leader of India's opposition, Rahul Gandhi, said on Saturday that his sentencing and disqualification from parliament were due to him poking at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's relationship with the embattled Adani conglomerate.In a press conference at his Congress party headquarters in New Delhi on Saturday, Gandhi said he was removed from parliament to be silenced on his allegation regarding the infusion of an estimated $3 billion (€2.78 billion) into shell companies owned by the Adani group.""I have been disqualified because the prime minister is scared of my next speech, he is scared of the next speech that is going to come on Adani,” Gandhi said. ""They don't want that speech to be in parliament, that's the issue.”The 52-year-old opposition leader was sentenced on Thursday to two years in prison. A court found him guilty of defamation over a speech he gave in 2019 in which he referred to people with the surname Modi — such as the current Prime Minister — as thieves.The court granted him bail and suspended the jail sentence for 30 days, opening a window for appeal.The opposition leader told reporters that he would do everything he could ""to defend the democratic nature"" of India.""They are used to everybody being scared of them,"" he said, in reference to the ruling party. ""I am not scared of them.""Supporters of the Congress party took to the streets on Friday, rejecting Gandhi's disqualification from parliament.Gandhi, the scion of India's most famous political dynasty and the great-grandson of independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, was set to face Modi at the ballot box next year, an election in which Modi will be seeking his third term in office.Although Congress dominated politics in post-independence India, their number of elected seats in the lower house has fallen to less than 10%, having been thwarted by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in the last two elections.Even before the disqualification of the main opposition party, Modi was expected to win the upcoming general election and remains India's most popular politician.Gandhi continued on Saturday his attack on the Adani Group, accusing Modi of helping it get contracts in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The opposition lawmaker had already demanded a parliamentary committee probe into the conglomerate.Adani came under scrutiny after a report by US financial research firm Hindenburg, which accused it of stock price manipulation and fraud. The group dismissed the allegation as an ""attack on India.""Group founder and Chairman Gautam Adani's net worth has skyrocketed nearly 2,000% since Modi became prime minister in 2014, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. He became among the world's top three richest men, securing contracts for several national projects in various fields.Modi's rivals have long pointed at his purported ties to the Adani Group, which they say go back to when Modi was chief minister of the western state of Gujarat, nearly two decades ago. The state is the hometown of both Modi and Adani.rmt/wd (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846821,Ukraine updates: Russia likely shifting focus from Bakhmut,"The United Kingdom's Defence Ministry says Russia appears to have shifted its operational focus away from the Donbas town of Bakhmut to areas to the north and south.The ministry's daily report on Saturday says that, with the offensive on Bakhmut itself looking to have stalled, Russia's forces are redirecting their efforts to Avdiivka, south of Bakhmut, and to the Kremina-Svatove sector in the north.Here, the British analysts suggest Russia is likely only seeking to stabilize its front line — an overall return to ""a more defensive operational design after inconclusive results from its attempts to conduct a general offensive since January.""Russian forces had been posting painstakingly gradual gains around the city, the symbolic importance of which surpasses any military significance.The ministry points out the ""extreme attrition of the Russian force"" is a likely reason for the switch but acknowledges that Ukraine has also suffered heavy casualties during its defense.""The Russian situation has also likely been made worse by tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defence and Wagner Group, both of whom contribute troops in the sector,"" the report adds.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Saturday, March 25:The founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary group says more than 5,000 former inmates of Russian prisons have been pardoned after completing military service contracts in Ukraine.Yevgeny Prigozhin, dubbed Putin's chef over his past lucrative catering contracts with the Kremlin, recruited thousands
of men from prisons, offering them the chance of freedom in return for serving in Ukraine.The Wagner Group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, has taken on an increasingly prominent role in the Ukraine war. That came after the regular Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says an expected counteroffensive against Russian forces cannot happen now because his country still lacks the necessary weapons, equipment, and ammunition.His assessment appeared in a report on Saturday in the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.""We cannot start yet,"" Zelensky said. Without tanks and artillery, ""no brave soldiers"" can be sent to the front, Zelensky told the paper in an interview conducted on Thursday, on a train on his way back to Kyiv from visiting the front.Polish ammunition maker Dezamet, a unit of state arms producer Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa (PGZ), is set to dramatically ramp up its capacity to supply EU-funded ammunition to Ukraine.The announcement by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki comes ahead of a visit by EU Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton, to the manufacturer on Monday.Seventeen EU member states and Norway have agreed to jointly procure ammunition to help Ukraine rebuild its stockpiles.Dezamet produces ammunition for artillery, mortars, and grenade launchers, and is one of more than 50 armaments enterprises that make up PGZ.""This plant can count on new orders and funds, we will be launching new production lines at this company and the others to produce ammunition,"" Morawiecki told Radio RMF when asked about Breton's visit to the factory.""We want to multiply the output severalfold as quickly as possible,"" he said.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has spoken to Russia's Vladimir Putin and thanked him for his ""positive attitude"" in extending the Black Sea grain deal.The Turkish presidency said the leaders had discussed steps to improve relations between Ankara and Moscow and and developments regarding the war in Ukraine.It said Erdogan had expressed the importance of ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine with negotiations as soon as possible.The speaker of Russia's parliament, the Duma, has proposed banning the activities of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Russian soil — and beyond — after the court issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin.The Hague-based court indicted Putin, accusing him of the war crime of deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. It says there are reasonable grounds to believe that he bears criminal responsibility.Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of the Russian leader, said legislation must be amended to prohibit ""any activity of the ICC on the territory of our country.""He also said any assistance or support for the court inside Russia should be punishable under law.Volodin pointed out that the United States had legislated to prevent its citizens from ever being tried by the court and that Russia should do the same.In a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta has expressed concern to China over any provision of lethal aid to support Russia in its war against Ukraine.Mahuta's press office on Saturday detailed her cautionary remarks in Beijing, days after Chinese President Xi Jinping wound up his trip to Moscow.Mahuta reiterated her government's condemnation of Moscow's ""illegal invasion"" to her counterpart Qin Gang. Wang said the pressing task was to establish a ceasefire and resume talks, adding that China would seek to further play a constructive role after drafting its peace proposal.Figure skating has been Russia's pride for decades if not centuries. But faced with bans from international competitions, young Russian skating talents are leaving the country in search of a better future.Ukraine's ombudsman on children's rights, Daria Gerasymchuk, explains how Russia has managed to transport at least 16,000 Ukrainian children out of the country, and how Ukraine is trying to get them back.Denmark plans to recover an object found near the previously sabotaged Nord Stream pipelines. Russia has said it is important to establish what it is, noting any investigation must be transparent.Plans for Ukraine's counteroffensive emerged with Russia struggling to capture Bakhmut. Meanwhile, Medvedev threatened that Russia might attack Kyiv or Lviv. Catch up with Friday's updates.rc/wd (dpa, AFP, Reuters, AP)",2023/03/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846822,North Carolina treasurer running for governor in 2024,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina State Treasurer Dale Folwell announced on Saturday he will run for governor in 2024, a bid that will likely require him besting Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to earn the Republican nomination.While Republicans have controlled North Carolina's legislature since 2011 and won a majority on the state Supreme Court last November, they have struggled to enter the Executive Mansion. The GOP has won just one gubernatorial general election since 1992, and 2012 winner Pat McCrory served for just four years.Folwell, a former legislator, school board member and state unemployment office chief who was first elected treasurer in 2016, said he would bring competence to operating government in a fiscally sound manner and look out for working people if elected.“The root word of ‘governor’ is to govern, and what that means is to be the CEO of the biggest business in the state,” Folwell told The Associated Press in an interview. “And based on my track record of saving lives, minds and money, I’m uniquely qualified to do that.”The state constitution prevents Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper from seeking a third consecutive term.Folwell had said in September that he was strongly considering a run for governor after encouragement from several Republicans. He revealed his plans first at Saturday's Republican Party convention for Forsyth County, where he lives.The disclosure came two days after Robinson said he’d hold an April 22 rally at an Alamance County race track, where he’d make a “special announcement” about 2024.Robinson's campaign adviser declined to reveal his specific plans, but Robinson has said previously that he was fairly certain that he’d run for governor.Robinson, who was elected the state's first Black lieutenant governor in 2020 in his first run for office, released an autobiography last year and is a popular speaker at conservative churches and events.Attorney General Josh Stein announced his bid for the Democratic nomination for governor in January, taking direct aim at Robinson for speeches in which critics say he disparaged LGBTQ+ people, women and abortion rights. Last Sunday, Robinson criticized churches that fly a “rainbow flag.”Robinson hasn’t apologized for certain remarks, saying he wasn’t attacking the LGBTQ+ community -- but rather it was a judgment on reading materials in the public schools. He also said he can separate his religious views from his governmental responsibilities. But some Republicans are worried about whether Robinson can win the general election in the closely divided state.Folwell had already criticized Robinson's governing style months ago.With his announcement, Folwell pointed out that the public didn't even know who Robinson was a few years ago. Since then, Folwell told AP, Robinson has “spent all this time attacking people instead of attacking the important problems that our citizens are facing.”Folwell, meanwhile, said he's attractive to voters because they feel like as an elected official “I’m doing the right thing on their behalf.”“They're going to respond to somebody who speaks to them like adults,"" he added.Folwell said his timing to get in the race had nothing to do with Robinson's upcoming announcement — he wanted to reveal his plans first to his fellow local Republicans.Robinson or his campaign didn't immediately respond to an email Saturday seeking comment about Folwell's entry.Folwell, 64, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2012 before winning his current statewide job four years later.While treasurer, he’s focused upon efforts to curb health care costs for state employees and retirees and for the poor as a way to improve their well-being. As McCrory's unemployment office chief he helped carry out system reforms and implement new technologies.The state treasurer manages the state’s investments and its massive government employee pension funds. His office also oversees the health insurance program for state workers and teachers and their dependents.The State Health Plan has been sued over its decision — defended by Folwell — to decline covering gender-affirming treatments for transgender employees and their children.While delivering the Republican response to Cooper’s State of the State address earlier this month, Robinson focused on his life story while promoting fiscal responsibility and respect for law enforcement and public school teachers.Folwell also talks about growing up in poverty. Folwell said his young adulthood included working as a trash collector and in motorcycle shops before going to college and becoming a CPA. He then worked for an investment firm.Former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., also has expressed interest in a gubernatorial bid. Candidate filing for the March 2024 primary is held in December, but anyone else seeking to challenge Robinson will feel pressure to enter this spring.At the end of 2022, Folwell reported $47,000 in cash in his campaign account, compared to $2.2 million held by Robinson’s campaign, according to state filings.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846823,"Piquet fined for racist, homophobic comments about Hamilton","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Retired Formula One champion Nelson Piquet has been ordered by a Brazilian court to pay $950,000 in “moral damages” for making racist and homophobic comments about Lewis Hamilton.The 70-year-old Brazilian had referred to seven-time champion Hamilton as “neguinho,” a racially offensive term which means “little Black guy,” in 2021. In another interview, Piquet used racist and homophobic language.The court in Brasilia on Friday ordered Piquet to pay 5 million Brazilian reals “in collective moral damages, to be allocated to funds for the promotion of racial equality and against discrimination of the LGBTQIA+ community.”The charges were filed by several human rights groups, including Brazil’s National LGBTI+ Alliance.In their complaint, the human rights groups said that Piquet violated the norm of human dignity enshrined in the country’s constitution. The judge said Piquet’s comments corresponded to the definition of racial discrimination outlined in Brazil’s 2010 Statute of Racial Equality.Hamilton had condemned “archaic mindsets,” and the Mercedes driver said he had been “surrounded by these attitudes and targeted (my) whole life.” He is the only Black driver in F1 and received honorary citizenship from Brazil last year.Piquet, who won three F1 titles in the 1980s, was discussing a crash between Hamilton and Red Bull driver Max Verstappen that took place during the British Grand Prix in 2021. His daughter Kelly Piquet is Verstappen’s girlfriend.Piquet later apologized in a statement for the “ill thought out” racial term but said it “is one that has widely and historically been used colloquially in Brazilian Portuguese as a synonym for ‘guy’ or ‘person’ and was never intended to offend.”In his decision, judge Pedro Matos de Arruda said “subtlety is one of the characteristics of contemporary Brazilian racism” and that the word is “not an affectionate nickname.”Piquet had used racist and homophobic language in the other interview when discussing Hamilton missing out on a previous championship.Piquet’s comments implied if Hamilton hadn’t been gay, “he would have won the championship. ... Therefore, being gay would be a negative characteristic,"" the judge said in his decision.The retired driver has the right to appeal the ruling.Piquet had angered some F1 fans for his support of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.

(AP) — New Mexico State has hired longtime Sam Houston coach Jason Hooten to try to restore a program that was shut down in the middle of the season after one player was involved in a fatal shooting and another accused teammates of hazing.Aggies athletic director Mario Moccia called Hooten, who had a 261-169 record in 13 seasons at Sam Houston, a tremendous fit and someone who can build hard-nosed, defensive-minded teams.“Importantly, his programs are always modeled on character and integrity,” Moccia said.It's not clear what sort of roster Hooten will inherit.The school is conducting an investigation into a player's accusation that three teammates ganged up on him multiple times in hazing episodes. The school has not revealed the status of the accused players. Two reserve players quit after the hazing allegations surfaced.New Mexico State also hasn't divulged the status of Mike Peake, the forward who brought a gun on a road trip to Albuquerque and shot and killed a student at University of New Mexico after that student pulled a gun on him.Peake was suspended by the team. Surveillance video shows Peake acting in self-defense and he has not been charged by police.New Mexico State is moving from the Western Athletic Conference into Conference USA next season.“I appreciate this opportunity to restore New Mexico State University’s basketball program to a position as one of the top mid-major programs in the country as we enter into Conference USA,"" Hooten said.The Aggies have made the NCAA Tournament 10 times since 2007.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846825,Jehovah's Witnesses mourn victims of Hamburg shooting,"BERLIN (AP) — Members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany held a memorial service Saturday for the six people killed during a mass shooting at a religious service in Hamburg this month.A 35-year-old German man who opened fire during the March 9 service killed himself as police arrived at a Jehovah's Witnesses hall where the service was taking place. The attack wounded nine people, including a pregnant woman who lost her unborn child.“We are speechless in the face of the violence and brutality. There’s no word for this,” Dirk Ciupek, a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, said in his sermon. “This was an attack not just on a few of us, but an attack on all of us.”Ciupek expressed gratitude to the police officers who he said prevented more deaths and to the medical personnel who tended to the wounded with dedication and empathy.“Do not let evil defeat you,” he said, addressing the family members of those who died. He spoke about each victim individually, including the unborn baby.“We miss them, their love, their smiles, everything,” Ciupek said.All of the victims were German citizens apart from two wounded women, one with Ugandan citizenship and one with Ukrainian.The gunman, identified by authorities only as Philipp F. due to German privacy laws, was a former member who left the Jehovah's Witnesses two years ago. Investigators have said his departure was “apparently not on good terms.”German prosecutors said they were investigating whether there was a religious motive for the crime, but that there were no indications he was involved in any network or had far-right views.The Hamburg congregation that was holding the service has about 60 members and is one of 47 in the port city, which is home to almost 4,000 denomination members, according to the Jehovah’s Witnesses.About 3,300 people attended Saturday's memorial service, which took place in a gymnasium in Hamburg, German news agency dpa said. The event also was livestreamed for Jehovah’s Witnesses who couldn't be there in person.Mark Sanderson, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, traveled to Hamburg from the United States and addressed the mourners.“Our hope, our faith, our love, can survive tragedy, they can overcome hatred and violence,” he said. “If we show our love to those around us, we reflect our faith to God.”Jehovah’s Witnesses are part of an international church founded in the United States in the 19th century and headquartered in Warwick, New York. The church claims a worldwide membership of about 8.7 million, with about 170,000 in Germany.Members are known for their evangelistic efforts that include knocking on doors and distributing literature in public squares. The denomination’s practices include a refusal to bear arms, receive blood transfusions, salute a national flag or participate in secular government.",2023/03/26,,World

After the game, one of her players punched a Bowling Green player in the handshake line and was charged with assault, according to the Falcons’ athletic department.“I’m elated to come back to the University of Cincinnati as the head coach of the women’s basketball program,” she said. “My time as a student-athlete and as a Bearcat were some of the greatest years of my life, and I’m excited to give back with everything I have to our current players like so many did for me. This is home for me, and I’m honored to wear the C-Paw once again.”Merriweather took over a four-win Memphis team and immediately produced 16 wins in the 2021-22 season before a 22-victory season in which the Tigers clinched the two seed in the American Athletic Conference championship. In her two seasons, the Tigers went 28-23.Cincinnati director of athletics John Cunningham said Merriweather's “track record of success at both Wright State and Memphis speaks for itself. She’s been an outstanding recruiter, program builder and developer of talent.”Cincinnati moves from the AAC to the Big 12 on July 1.""As an alumna of Cincinnati and one of the winningest players in school history, she knows the potential this program has and understands what it will take for us to compete at the top of the Big 12. She’s the perfect fit and I’m thrilled to welcome her back to the program.”Prior to coaching at Memphis, Merriweather spent five seasons as the head coach at Wright State. There, she took the Raiders to two NCAA Tournaments, got them their first NCAA win in 2021 over four-seed Arkansas and was named Horizon League Coach of the Year three times.Cincinnati will hold a formal news conference to introduce Merriweather on Tuesday.__AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846837,Hungary: Criticism makes it hard to cooperate with West,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The West’s steady criticism of Hungary on democratic and cultural issues makes the small European country’s right-wing government reluctant to offer support on practical matters, specifically NATO’s buildup against Russia, Hungary’s foreign minister said.In an interview with The Associated Press, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó also said Friday that his country has not voted on whether to allow Finland and Sweden to join NATO because Hungarian lawmakers are sick of those countries' critiques of Hungarian domestic affairs.Lawmakers from the governing party plan to vote Monday in favor of the Finnish request but “serious concerns were raised"" about Finland and Sweden in recent months ""mostly because of the very disrespectful behavior of the political elites of both countries towards Hungary,” Szijjártó said.“You know, when Finnish and Swedish politicians question the democratic nature of our political system, that’s really unacceptable,” he said.A vote on Sweden is harder to predict, Szijjártó said.The EU, which includes 21 NATO countries, has frozen billions in funds to Budapest and accused populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban of cracking down on media freedom and LGBTQ rights. Orban’s administration has also been accused of tolerating an entrenched culture of corruption and co-opting state institutions to serve the governing Fidesz party.In a European Parliament resolution, EU lawmakers declared last year that Hungary had become “a hybrid regime of electoral autocracy” under Orban’s nationalist government and that its undermining of the bloc’s democratic values had taken Hungary out of the community of democracies.That criticism raised objections within Hungary and made it hard for the government to support Finland and Sweden's bids to join NATO, Szijjártó said. Skeptics insist that Hungary has simply been trying to win lucrative concessions.When it comes to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Szijjártó said that his country's advocacy of peace does not mean accepting that Russia would keep the territory it currently controls.""You know, stopping the war and sitting around the table does not mean that you accept the status quo,"" he said. ""When the war stops and the peace talks start, it’s not necessary that the borders would be where the front lines are. We know this from our own history as well ... Cease-fire has to come now.""As for relations with the United States, Szijjártó said they had a heyday under former President Donald Trump. His government found things more difficult under President Joe Biden.In perfect, nearly unaccented English, Szijjártó explained that Hungary is “a clearly rightist, right-wing, Christian Democratic, conservative, patriotic government.” He then went on in terms that would be familiar to millions of Americans.“So we are basically against the mainstream in any attributes of ours. And if you are against the liberal mainstream, and in the meantime, you are successful, and in the meantime, you continue to win elections, it’s not digestible for the liberal mainstream itself,” he said. “Under President Trump, the political relationship was as good as never before.”Key to that relationship was Trump's acceptance of Hungary's policies toward its own citizens. The government has banned the sharing of materials with minors that it regards as a display or promotion of homosexuality or gender reassignment.The law has been condemned by human rights groups and politicians from around Europe as an attack on Hungary’s LGBT community.Szijjártó said Trump was more welcoming of such measures than the Biden administration.“He never wanted to impose anything. He never wanted to put pressure on us to change our way of thinking about family. He never wanted us to change our way of thinking about migration. He never wanted us to change our way of thinking about social issues,” Szijjártó said.He also said Trump's attitude toward Russia would be more welcome by some parties today.During Trump's term in the White House, Russia did not start ""any attack against anyone,"" Szijjártó said.___Associated Press Writer Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, contributed to this report.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846838,Teen striker Ferguson raises Irish hopes with early success,"Teenage striker Evan Ferguson isn't getting carried away after scoring his first goal for his national team. The rest of Ireland will gladly do that for him.The 18-year-old Ferguson is having a breakout season with Premier League club Brighton and now for Ireland, which hosts France on Monday in European Championship qualifying.His first-half strike in Ireland's 3-2 win over Latvia in a friendly on Wednesday at Aviva Stadium made him Ireland's youngest goalscorer since Robbie Keane netted as a teenager in 1998 against Malta.It was Ferguson's first start and just his third appearance for Ireland, which has lacked a consistent scoring threat since Keane's retirement. Keane remains the country's all-time scorer by a wide margin.“It’s all just talk isn’t it, at the end of the day, people getting excited,” the 6-foot-2 (1.9-meter) Ferguson said.Ferguson scored twice last Sunday to help Brighton beat fourth-tier Grimsby 5-0 to advance to the FA Cup semifinals. His seven goals for Brighton this season make him “the top-scoring teenager for a Premier League club across all competitions in 2022-23,” stats provider Opta said.So, yeah, there's some hype.“It really doesn’t bother me. It’s just a game of football,"" said Ferguson, who made two appearances for Ireland as a substitute last November.The teenager exploits spaces well, uses his physicality to hold off defenders and scores comfortably with both feet and his head. He tucked it home from close range in the 17th minute on Wednesday.“You dream about it as a kid to score at home. A crowd like that, and family and friends watching, I don’t think there’s a better feeling,” he said.Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi calls Ferguson “a special striker” who will only get better. The Brighton coaches are working “to improve him in terms of understanding the play, (when) to receive the ball or to attack the space... to complete the player.”Irish fans will want to see Ferguson in the lineup Monday night when World Cup star Kylian Mbappé and the French squad visit in a Euro 2024 qualifier. The “Boys in Green” haven’t beaten France since a 3-2 win in Dublin in 1981.Ireland coach Stephen Kenny sought to downplay expectations, noting that “injuries can take their toll” on young players sometimes.“The demands are high in the leagues they are in and sometimes that happens,” Kenny said. “He’s only 18. You can’t predict things in the future.”Ferguson has drawn attention ever since coming off the bench for Dublin club Bohemians at age 14 in a friendly against Chelsea in 2019. He switched to Brighton two years later.This season has gone by in a flash, he said, and there's no time to think about expectations or pressure.“At the end of the day, it’s just a game of football. I’ve played it for years now.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846839,Voting rights effort targets those held in jails across US,"CHICAGO (AP) — The voting precinct could have been any one of hundreds throughout Chicago, except that these voters in the first round of the mayoral election were all wearing the same beige smocks. And the security at this polling place wasn’t intended to keep disrupters and campaigners out, but the voters in.When first-time voter Tykarri Skillon finished studying the list of nine candidates, looking for those who shared his priorities on jobs and affordable housing, he marked his ballot and then was escorted with other voters back to their cells in the Cook County Jail.The 25-year-old, awaiting trial on a weapons charge, is part of a group not always mentioned in discussions about voting disenfranchisement. People serving sentences for felony convictions lose their right to vote. Detainees awaiting trial or serving misdemeanor sentences do retain that right, but face barriers to exercising it in many parts of the United States.The Cook County Jail, with more than 5,500 inmates and detainees, is one of the largest such facilities in the nation. It is one of several lockups where voting rights advocates have worked with local election and jail officials to offer voting for those held there. The list includes jails in Denver; Harris County, Texas; Los Angeles County; and the District of Columbia.Expanding jailhouse voting is one of the latest steps to combine voting rights with criminal justice changes.“It feels good to have a voice,” Skillon said after casting his ballot during early voting, before the race went to an April 4 runoff. “We’re going home someday, so we should have a voice in our community.”Candidates he chose from included the current mayor, Democrat Lori Lightfoot. Among the issues that damaged her politically was rising crime. She eventually came in third in the election, bumping her from an April 4 runoff between the two top vote-getters, also Democrats.The most recent survey from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, released last December, showed that 451,400 of the 636,300 people held in jails across the country had not been convicted and thus should retain their right to vote.Voting rights for pretrial detainees and inmates serving sentences for misdemeanors were upheld in a U.S. Supreme Court decision from 1974, in a case from New York, O'Brien v. Skinner.Despite that ruling, voting rights advocates say a “de facto disenfranchisement” exists because of mistakes over eligibility and the difficulties that detainees and prisoners face in registering or voting.In a 2020 report, the Prison Policy Initiative focused on three main reasons: registration is difficult due to issues such as mail-in ballot deadlines and voter ID laws; detention does not meet the criteria for absentee voting in some jurisdictions; and the churn of the jail populations.At least one state, Tennessee, had a bill introduced this year to address one of the barriers. Being in jail as a pretrial detainee is not one of the reasons considered valid for granting a mail ballot request, said Democratic state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, the bill's sponsor. Yabro, who recently announced he was running for mayor of Nashville, wants that changed.“Being a full citizen should be the default,"" he said. ""Everybody ought to have the expectation of fully participating in a democracy.""In Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, about 75% of the nearly 10,000 people held in jail are pretrial. The sheriff's department established a polling place there in 2019, working with the county elections office, and has allowed voting during the past two election cycles. Before that, detainees voted only by mail.The move started in 2017 with the Houston Justice Coalition and an initiative known as Project Orange that has helped register thousands of detainees and taught them how to navigate the mail ballot process, Nadia Hakim, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Elections Administration, said in an email.“Previously if detainees wanted to vote, they had to do the legwork,” she said. “They had to know their registration status and make the request for the mail ballot application.”In-person voting has multiple advantages. The mail ballot application deadline is April 25 for this year's May 6 election. Someone booked after the deadline would not be able to request a mail ballot, Hakim said. With the in-jail polling place, all detainees can vote, as well as members of the staff and public because machines are available in secure and public spaces. In last November's election, 528 people checked in to vote there, including detainees, employees and members of the public, she said.In California, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Capt. Roel Garcia said staff members let pretrial detainees know they can register and vote and hold voter registration drives. Garcia, who oversees the inmate reception center, said the department works with groups such as the League of Women Voters to get information to the detainees about candidates and issues on the ballot.The department and the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk have teamed up on a pilot program since 2020 that allows voting in two jails. There are plans to expand it to all eight county jails in 2024.Registrar Dean Logan said as many as 11,700 people could be eligible at a given time when the voting goes countywide. He said it could serve as a model for other counties.“I think the in-person vote centers is something where people are watching to see how that’s going to work and whether or not they have the infrastructure, the equipment and the capacity to offer that,” Logan said.Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said in an interview that giving detainees a sense of empowerment and finding ways to get them to rethink their place in the world and to inspire them to change are constant challenges. He said engaging them as elections approach presents an opportunity to accomplish that.“If you are trying to get inside someone’s head … what better way to do that than to say we want you to be a real decision-maker?"" he said. “I’m not saying it is magic fairy dust. … But all (these) things start moving the dial.”A 2019 state law required that jails take steps to enable voting by detainees who have not been convicted. Smaller jails aren't required to have polling stations but must arrange for absentee ballots.Dart said the jail helps organize classes overseen by university staff and other organizations to instruct inmates and detainees, before they vote, on everything from the electoral process to the rationale behind judicial elections. Detainees also are able to tune into televised debates between candidates.“Their election IQ is off the charts,” Dart said. “Participation level, turnout — is higher than it is outside.”The sheriff's office said about 1,500 inmates and detainees — or roughly 27% of the jail's population — voted during the first round of the Chicago mayoral election.The Chicago Board of Elections brought in several voting booths this year along with a large ballot-collection machine and put them in a section of the jail called “the chapel,” which is normally used for religious services and small concerts.With just a few guards looking on, half a dozen board of elections staff managed the jail polling stations, first helping with registration.Among the voters was 20-year-old Tony Simmons, who marked his ballot while a dozen others sat in an adjoining room, waiting their turn. For safety reasons, just four were brought into the polling station at a time.Simmons, who is awaiting trial on burglary, robbery and other charges in Cook County, said he had seen campaign ads on jail televisions featuring tough-on-crime messages. It didn’t bother him, he said, adding that crimes rates should come down.Asked what kinds of candidates he voted for, he answered: “Ones who were more lenient” on issues surrounding the law and crime.First-time voter Skillon, the one awaiting trial on a weapons charge, said he believed what many jaded voters outside the walls don't.“Your vote matters,"" he said. ""One vote can most definitely make a difference.”___ Fields reported from Washington.___Associated Press coverage of democracy receives support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846840,"Miami's mad March sees men, women programs in Elite 8","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Nijel Pack understands why the question gets asked. He plays for a school that’s won five national championships in football.How did Miami become so good in basketball?“I've heard of all the great football players that have been here,” Pack said, “but the basketball program has been coming up the last few years and people respect both now.”The Hurricanes have doubled down on their basketball success with the men's and women's teams reaching the Elite Eight — and both knocking off No. 1 seeds along the way.They will play Sunday for the opportunity to go to their first Final Fours. Jim Larrañaga's men (28-7) will face second-seeded Texas in the afternoon in Kansas City and Katie Meier's women (22-12) will meet three-seed LSU in the evening in Greenville, South Carolina.“The two programs have a lot in common,” Meier said. ""We’re very competitive, like a big brother-little sister or big sister-little brother, depending on who won that week. We get that way with each other and I love it. ...“Whether you’re laying on the training table next to somebody, one player next to the other player saying, ‘Why did you miss that shot?’ — they’re right there competing with each other in a very loving way. I think it’s elevated both of our programs.”Miami's mutual success comes as it has established itself as a model of the new era in college sports.Like other programs, transfers have played a major role, but Miami also — very publicly — has gone full-steam ahead into name, image and likeness with mega booster John Ruiz providing lucrative deals to Pack and twins Haley and Hanna Cavinder.The ninth-seeded women have never before advanced so far in the tournament, and it's been a thrilling ride. They erased a 17-point halftime deficit to beat No. 8 Oklahoma State, beat No. 1 Indiana on Destiny Harden’s tie-breaking basket with 3.3 seconds left and eliminated No. 4 Villanova on Friday after squandering a 21-point lead in the second half.The fifth-seeded men's run to their second straight regional final has been no less exciting. They rallied from an eight-point deficit with under 5 minutes left to beat No. 12 Drake before posting a 16-point win over No. 4 Indiana. On Friday, they toppled No. 1 Houston by 14 points.A version of the football-basketball question was the first to be asked at Larrañaga's postgame news conference Friday. He detoured into paying homage to the school's academic reputation and lauding the work of the women's team.Men's player Wooga Poplar said he gets the question frequently when he's on campus but was surprised it came up when he was talking to local fans in Kansas City.“I just tell them football does football and we do basketball,” Poplar said, “and we're both pretty good.”Pack said he and his teammates have followed the women closely during this especially mad Miami March.“It was really fun watching their game, seeing them beat Villanova, when they were expected to lose,” Pack said. “Making the Elite Eight for the first time in their program history is something that people didn’t think about at the beginning of the year.”At the start of the year, Miami's programs were in the spotlight mostly for their plunge into the NIL arena. Pack made headlines last spring when he left Kansas State and landed a deal with Ruiz; Ruiz says it pays $800,000 over two years and provides Pack with a car.About the same time, the Cavinder twins, who built their bank accounts at Fresno State thanks to more than 4 million TikTok followers, transferred to Miami.Their recruitment was instantly scrutinized and led to Meier missing the first three games of this season through a university-imposed suspension that was handed down in anticipation of NCAA sanctions. Last month, Miami was placed one year of probation after the school and the NCAA agreed that coaches arranged impermissible contact between Ruiz and the Cavinders.But the talk now has shifted to what's happening on the basketball courts.Pack, who had 26 points and seven 3-pointers against Houston, is averaging 19.7 points per game in the tournament. ACC player of the year Isaiah Wong, who reportedly has a six-figure NIL deal, had 20 points against Houston and is averaging 17.3 in the tournament.Haley Cavinder has led the women's balanced offense with 12.5 points per game for the season. Jasmyne Roberts, an 8.4-point scorer for the season, went off for 26 against Villanova and is averaging 18 in the tournament.Hanna Cavinder said she's savoring everything the men and women are achieving.“I think it’s cool to see us both doing this together in a sense, and bringing Miami more of like a basketball-school realm,” she said. “It’s just super exciting to be a part of. I know it’s probably something that might not be done again.""___AP Basketball Writers Aaron Beard and Tim Reynolds contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846841,Idaho governor signs firing squad execution bill into law,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Republican Gov. Brad Little signed a bill allowing execution by firing squad, making Idaho the latest state to turn to older methods of capital punishment amid a nationwide shortage of lethal-injection drugs.The Legislature passed the measure March 20 with a veto-proof majority. Under it, firing squads will be used only if the state cannot obtain the drugs needed for lethal injections.Pharmaceutical companies increasingly have barred executioners from using their drugs, saying they were meant to save lives. One Idaho death row inmate has already had his execution postponed repeatedly because of drug scarcity.The shortage has prompted other states in recent years to revive older methods of execution. Only Mississippi, Utah, Oklahoma and South Carolina have laws allowing firing squads if other execution methods are unavailable, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. South Carolina’s law is on hold pending the outcome of a legal challenge.Some states began refurbishing electric chairs as standbys for when lethal drugs are unavailable. Others have considered — and, at times, used — largely untested execution methods. In 2018, Nevada executed Carey Dean Moore with a never-before-tried drug combination that included the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. Alabama has built a system for executing people using nitrogen gas to induce hypoxia, but it has not yet been used.“While I am signing this bill, it is important to point out that fulfilling justice can and must be done by minimizing stress on corrections personnel,” Little wrote in a transmittal letter after signing the bill. “For the people on death row, a jury convicted them of their crimes, and they were lawfully sentenced to death. It is the responsibility of the state of Idaho to follow the law and ensure that lawful criminal sentences are carried out.”During a historic round of 13 executions in the final months of Donald Trump’s presidency, the federal government opted for the sedative pentobarbital as a replacement for lethal drugs used in the 2000s. It issued a protocol allowing firing squads for federal executions if necessary, but that method was not used.Some lawyers for federal inmates who were eventually put to death argued in court that firing squads actually would be quicker and less painful than pentobarbital, which they said causes a sensation akin to drowning.However, in a 2019 filing, U.S. lawyers cited an expert as saying someone shot by firing squad can remain conscious for 10 seconds and that it would be “severely painful, especially related to shattering of bone and damage to the spinal cord.”President Joe Biden’s attorney general, Merrick Garland, ordered a temporary pause on federal executions in 2021 while the Justice Department reviewed protocols. Garland did not say how long the moratorium will last.Idaho Sen. Doug Ricks, a Republican who co-sponsored that state’s firing squad bill, told his fellow senators Monday (3/20) that the state’s difficulty in finding lethal injection drugs could continue “indefinitely,” that he believes death by firing squad is “humane,” and that the bill would help ensure the rule of law is carried out.But Sen. Dan Foreman, also a Republican, called firing-squad executions “beneath the dignity of the state of Idaho.” They would traumatize the executioners, the witnesses and the people who clean up afterward, he said.The bill originated with Republican Rep. Bruce Skaug, prompted in part by the state’s inability to execute Gerald Pizzuto Jr. late last year. Pizzuto, who now has terminal cancer and other debilitating illnesses, has spent more than three decades on death row for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors.The Idaho Department of Correction estimates it will cost around $750,000 to build or retrofit a death chamber for firing squad executions.Agency Director Jeff Tewalt has said he would be reluctant to ask his staffers to participate in a firing squad.Both Tewalt and his former co-worker Kevin Kempf played a key role in obtaining the drugs used in the 2012 execution of Richard Albert Leavitt, flying to Tacoma, Washington, with more than $15,000 in cash to buy them from a pharmacist. The trip was kept secret by the department but revealed in court documents after University of Idaho professor Aliza Cover sued for the information under a public records act.Biden pledged during his campaign to work at ending the death penalty nationwide, but he has remained silent on the issue as president. Critics say his hands-off approach risked sending a message that he’s OK with states adopting alternative execution methods.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846842,Brazil's Lula cancels trip to China because of pneumonia,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has canceled his trip to China after contracting pneumonia, the presidential palace said on Saturday.Lula, 77, was admitted to a hospital in the capital of Brasilia with flu-like symptoms and was diagnosed with “bacterial and viral bronchopneumonia due to influenza A,” the palace said in a statement, quoting a medical note signed by Dr. Ana Helena Germoglio.The leftist leader’s health was reassessed on Saturday and, despite improvement, he was advised to “postpone the trip to China until the cycle of viral transmission ends,” the medical note said. His press office later confirmed that the trip had been canceled.Chinese authorities have been informed, “with the reiteration of the desire to schedule the visit on a new date,” the palace said.Lula had been expected to leave for China on a multi-day visit on Friday or Saturday, but the trip was pushed back on Friday.A delegation composed of ministers, senators, lawmakers and hundreds of businessmen - including more than 100 from the agricultural sector - had been set to accompany Lula during his first state visit to Brazil’s biggest trade partner since taking office in January.The trip’s cancellation is “bad news” for the government as the visit was “an opportunity for Lula to reconnect with business elites, especially in the agribusiness, who have been very much pro-Bolsonaro,” said Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist from the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank.The Brazilian president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were scheduled to meet next Tuesday. Trade, investment and climate change were on the agenda and 20 bilateral agreements had been expected to be signed, according to a statement Thursday from the presidential palace.Lula, who rarely postpones or cancels trips due to health reasons, traveled to Argentina in January and the U.S. in February, marking a departure from Brazil’s foreign policy under former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who showed little interest in international affairs or travel abroad.The cancellation “will raise questions about to what extent Lula can sustain the very intense diplomatic activism” seen in the first three months of his presidency, Stuenkel said.Pedro Brites, an international relations expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said the postponement of the trip was a lost opportunity to switch the focus to more positive issues for the government “after a turbulent week.”On Wednesday, federal police cracked down on a gang accused of plotting assassinations and kidnappings of public officials including Sen. Sergio Moro, who was the lead judge in the Carwash trials which led to the arrest of prominent politicians including Lula.The then-former president spent over a year in jail before his conviction was annulled. In 2019, Moro became Bolsonaro’s Justice Minister.The leftist leader on Thursday suggested the police operation was a setup by Moro, prompting fierce criticism by opposition politicians and discomfort among allies.Rescheduling Lula’s visit to China will be a challenge due to the very crowded agendas of both leaders, said Stuenkel, but he predicted Lula “will really try to make this happen during the first half of the year” due to the high domestic and international importance of the trip.Lula had been intending to normalize and strengthen ties with China after a rocky period of tensions under former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro.Commercial ties continued but political relations with China soured during Bolsonaro’s term -- a particular low point came when Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo blamed the COVID-19 pandemic on the Chinese Communist Party in March 2020.",2023/03/26,,World

(AP) — Miami was only a few hours removed from pushing deeper in the women's NCAA Tournament than ever before. Another big matchup loomed. Yet coach Katie Meier needed some time.“First thing I said is, like, give me an hour to be human,” the coach said.That's why she followed the program's first-ever trip to the Elite Eight by spending time with her mother and nieces in her hotel room afterward. It was an example of how the Hurricanes are savoring a wild March Madness ride even while determined to keep winning — next against LSU on Sunday to reach the Final Four.The ninth-seeded Hurricanes (22-12) can join Arkansas in 1998 as the lowest-ever seed to get there.""There's a balance,"" but I think just being where our feet are,"" Hurricanes guard Hanna Cavinder said. “I mean, obviously we have a lot to celebrate, but we're not done. And I think we all understand that.”The Greenville 2 Region final presents the first ticket to Dallas for the national semifinals, and it's a matchup between teams with vastly different postseason histories.Third-seeded LSU (31-2) is one of eight programs to reach at least five Final Fours. Coach Kim Mulkey won three national championships at Baylor and is in her second year with the Tigers, who pushed past 2-seed Utah on Saturday to reach their first Elite Eight since 2008.“You’d better listen,” Tigers star forward Angel Reese said. “Kim Mulkey not playing. We listen to her, we respect Coach. She knows better than anybody else.”Still, Mulkey has cautioned her team is “overachieving” in its rapid rise so early in her tenure with nine new players, noting LSU “might be feeding that monster too quickly” with outside expectations.Still, her players “want to please.”“They allow me to coach them, and I’ve got some strong personalities on this team,"" Mulkey said. ""I’ve said it all along: I don’t care, just bring me a competitor. I can handle a strong personality. ... If they love basketball and they’re a competitor, I can coach them.”For Miami, the rise is sudden: Its only previous Sweet 16 came in 1992.The Hurricanes first rallied from 17 down to beat Oklahoma State. Then they won at 1-seed Indiana on a late shot by Destiny Harden. And they hung on late against Villanova despite blowing a 21-point lead.“Every game gets bigger,” Harden said. “And we expect that. ... I think to be the best, you've got to beat the best.”ANOTHER ALL-AMERICANReese will be the third straight Associated Press first-team All-American to face Miami in this tournament. Reese ranks among the national leaders in scoring (23.5, fifth), rebounding (15.6, second) and double-doubles (31, first).The Hurricanes have beaten Indiana's Mackenzie Holmes and Villanova's Maddy Siegrist, the national scoring leader who had 31 points and 13 rebounds Saturday.Reese had 17 points and 12 rebounds against Utah.TOUGH CLUB TO CRACKWhile eight teams seeded fifth or lower have reached a Final Four, only two — 5-seed Louisville in 2013 and 7-seed Washington in 2016 — have come in the past 17 tournaments. Top seeds made up 14 of 20 teams in the last five Final Fours, five were 2-seeds and one was a 3.Miami could be the first to get there with more than 10 losses.CAMP MIAMIThe Hurricanes entered the NCAAs having lost three of five, including a blowout loss to eventual No. 1 NCAA seed Virginia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament.Meier said “Camp Miami” changed that, referencing competitive back-to-basics workouts covering fundamentals and conditioning.“We were going at each other. But it was fun,” said guard Jasmyne Roberts, who had a career-best 26 points against Villanova. “We all got our love back for the game a little bit because we were kind of drained.”ROOTING INTERESTAmong the questions leading into Sunday's regional final: Who is rapper Lil Wayne rooting for?The rapper FaceTimed with twins Hanna and Haley Cavinder to congratulate Miami after the Villanova win, with players in the locker room shrieking and gathering around the phone. The New Orleans native also tweeted a shoutout to Reese after LSU's win.“I think he likes women's basketball and that's a win for women's basketball,” Haley Cavinder said. “Hopefully he comes to the game if he likes Angel Reese and our team.”MULKEY'S THREADSMulkey generated a buzz with her her flamboyant look for the Utah win: a multi-colored patterned jacket that had bright pink feathers and frills running the length of both sleeves.Mulkey said afterward she has a stylist who picks out her look.“We know she's coming with something spicy,” Reese said, adding: ""It's a surprise to her as well.""And since Mulkey proudly proclaimed herself as nothing about social media, freshman guard Flau'jae Johnson later said: “They're going to drag her on Twitter and she ain't going to know.”As for Meier?“I don't know what Kim is going to wear,” she said, “but I'm going to wear overalls.”___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846844,Canada pledges Great Lakes funding after Trudeau-Biden talks,"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — Canada has pledged a significant increase in spending to improve water quality in the Great Lakes following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, whose administration also has boosted funding for the shared waters.Following their discussion Friday in Ottawa, Trudeau said his government would spend $420 million — about $306 million in U.S. dollars — over the next decade on the lakes, still suffering fron 20th century industrial pollution and newer challenges such as climate change, PFAS chemicals and microplastics.The announcement came weeks after U.S. Congress members prodded Biden to seek more support for the lakes from Canada, which critics have accused of doing too little.“The Great Lakes are a source of drinking water for 40 million people, and this shared resource needs to be protected,” Trudeau said. “This is why Canada will make a major new investment ... to continue safeguarding the Great Lakes for generations to come.”The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River are the world's largest surface freshwater system, providing drinking water for some 40 million people and supporting a regional economy in eight U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.Trudeau's father, then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, signed an agreement with President Richard M. Nixon in 1972 to restore and protect the lakes. It has been updated several times since.In addition to toxic residues in harbors and river mouths, the lakes are ravaged by invasive species such as quagga mussels, loss of nearshore fish and wildlife habitat, and farm and urban runoff that fuels harmful algae blooms.The U.S. Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, started by President Barack Obama in 2010, has pumped some $4 billion into projects aimed at fixing those problems, with annual spending averaging between $300 million to 400 million.Congress has authorized $425 million for fiscal year 2024. An additional $1 billion from Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law will be devoted largely to completing work on longstanding industrial site cleanups.Canada, meanwhile, had committed just $33 million in U.S. dollars to cleanup efforts between 2017 and 2022.In a March 8 letter, nine U.S. House members urged Biden to “emphasize the importance of our binational institutions and investments for the Great Lakes from the Canadian government” during his visit.Trudeau's pledge Friday drew praise from those who had pushed for a bigger Canadian contribution.""This increased funding commitment to help preserve and strengthen the Great Lakes is a welcomed announcement from our neighbors in Canada,” said Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican.Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, said the lakes “are a resource both nations share, and it is incumbent on us all to invest in its health and future.”A University of Michigan analysis has found that each $1 spent under the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative generated $3.35 across the region and more in some areas.Canada's promised increase is ""a significant step towards ensuring the longterm health and sustainability of our freshwater resources,” said Gino Moretti, Mayor of Saint-Anicet in Quebec and Vice-Chair of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, which represents waterfront cities in the region.",2023/03/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846864,Putin says Russia will station tactical nukes in Belarus,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans on Saturday to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus, a warning to the West as it steps up military support for Ukraine.Putin said the move was triggered by Britain’s decision this past week to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium.Tactical nuclear weapons are intended for use on the battlefield and have a short range and a low yield compared with much more powerful nuclear warheads fitted to long-range missiles. Russia plans to maintain control over those it sends to Belarus, and construction of storage facilities for them will be completed by July 1, Putin said.He didn’t say how many nuclear weapons Russia would keep in Belarus. The U.S. government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by tactical aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds.Putin argued that by deploying its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia was following the lead of the United States, noting that the U.S. has nuclear weapons based in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.“We are doing what they have been doing for decades, stationing them in certain allied countries, preparing the launch platforms and training their crews,” Putin said, speaking in an interview on state television that aired Saturday night. “We are going to do the same thing.”Russia has stored its tactical nuclear weapons at dedicated depots on its territory, and moving part of the arsenal to a storage facility in Belarus would up the ante in the Ukrainian conflict by placing them closer to the Russian aircraft and missiles already stationed there.Some hawkish commentators in Russia long have urged the Kremlin to put the tactical nuclear weapons close to the weapons to send a signal to the West about the readiness to use them.The U.S. said it would “monitor the implications” of Putin's announcement.“We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. ""We remain committed to the collective defense of the NATO alliance.”Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine had Soviet nuclear weapons stationed on their territory but handed them over to Russia after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.Putin said Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has long asked to have nuclear weapons in his country again as a counter to NATO. Belarus shares borders with three NATO members — Latvia, Lithuania and Poland — and Russia used its territory as a staging ground to send troops into neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.Putin noted that Russia helped modernize Belarusian military aircraft last year to make them capable of carrying nuclear warheads. He said 10 such planes were ready to go. He said nuclear weapons also could be launched by the Iskander short-range missiles that Russia provided to Belarus last year.Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is living in exile, said the agreement to transfer the tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus “underlines the threat to regional security” from Lukashenko's regime.“Europe won’t be safe until Belarus dictator is removed & brought before tribunal to face justice for crimes against our country & Ukraine,"" Tsikhanouskaya wrote in English on Twitter.Lukashenko’s support of the war has drawn international criticism and sanctions. But he has publicly stood by Russia, which has pumped billions of dollars into shoring up his Soviet-style, state-controlled economy with cheap energy and loans.Putin had initially objected to the depleted uranium rounds that Britain promised to ship to Ukraine by making the false claim that they have nuclear components.He subsequently toned down his language, but insisted Saturday that the ammunition posed an additional danger to both troops and civilians in Ukraine by leaving a radioactive trace and contaminating agricultural land.“Those weapons are harmful not just for combatants, but also for the people living in those territories and for the environment,” he said.Putin added that Russia has vast stockpiles of similar ammunition but so far has refrained from using it.Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the uranium enrichment process needed to create nuclear weapons. The rounds can't generate a nuclear reaction but they do emit low levels of radiation. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has warned of the possible dangers of exposure.Such rounds were developed by the U.S. during the Cold War to destroy Soviet tanks, including the same T-72 tanks that Ukraine now faces in its push to break through a stalemate in the east.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846865,Israeli defense minister calls for halt to judicial overhaul,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's defense minister became the first ally in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition to break ranks on Saturday as he called for an immediate halt to the far-right government's contentious plan to overhaul the country's judiciary.In a televised address, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant expressed concern over the turmoil within Israel's military that he said posed a threat to the country's security. Citing the need for dialogue with the opposition, Gallant asked that Netanyahu’s coalition wait until after Parliament reconvenes from its holiday break next month before pushing ahead with its divisive plan to weaken the Supreme Court.“For the sake of Israel’s security, for the sake of our sons and daughters, the legislative process must be stopped at this time,” Gallant, a top official in Netanyahu's Likud party, said.The government's plan to increase its control over the judiciary has sparked the largest protest movement in Israeli history and triggered a grave national crisis, including even warnings from the president of civil war.On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets as they have every week since the start of the year — in many cases bringing parts of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to a standstill. It has also raised the hackles of Israel's closest allies, testing its ties with the United States.Police unleashed water cannons on masses of protesters who whistled and waved Israeli flags as they marched down Ayalon highway in Tel Aviv on Saturday night. “Shame! Shame!” they chanted in Hebrew. As the protesters advanced, officers on horseback violently rammed into the crowds. “Haven't the Jewish people suffered enough?” read one protester's sign.The judicial proposal has drawn intensifying criticism from across Israeli society — including from former prime ministers and defense officials, high-tech business leaders, Israel’s attorney general and American Jews.In recent weeks, discontent over the overhaul has even surged from within Israel's army — the country’s most popular and respected institution, which has historically been an apolitical unifier. A growing number of Israeli reservists have threatened to withdraw from voluntary duty in the past weeks, posing a broad challenge to Netanyahu as he defiantly plows ahead with the judicial changes while on trial for corruption.“The events taking place in Israeli society do not spare the Israel Defense Forces — from all sides, feelings of anger, pain and disappointment arise, with an intensity I have never encountered before,” Gallant said. “I see how the source of our strength is being eroded.”In security-minded Israel, the unrest has prompted concern about the Israeli military's stability as it maintains its 55-year-old occupation of the West Bank and faces threats from Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group and from its archenemy Iran.Violence both in Israel and the occupied West Bank has escalated over the past few weeks to heights unseen in years. On Saturday, a Palestinian shot and wounded two Israeli soldiers in the northern West Bank town of Hawara, the site of a violent settler rampage last month.“This is a clear, immediate and tangible danger to the security of the state,” he said, referring to the judicial plans. “I will not take part in this.”Gallant stopped short of saying what, if anything, he would do if Netanyahu ignored his plea. But his strong statement of concern for the polarized nation marked the first crack in Netanyahu’s coalition, the most right-wing and religiously conservative government in Israeli history.Despite mounting dissent, the government passed a key part of the overhaul on Thursday, approving legislation that would protect the Israeli leader from being deemed unfit to rule because of his trial and claims of a conflict of interest. Critics say the law is tailor-made for Netanyahu and encourages corruption.That day, Gallant met with Netanyahu, reportedly to voice concerns that protests by Israeli reservists and other security forces were hurting Israel’s international image and power of deterrence. After the meeting, Netanyahu nonetheless announced that he would become directly involved in the overhaul, declaring his hands “untied.""Israel's attorney general issued a sharp rebuke on Friday, warning that Netanyahu had broken the law by announcing his direct involvement in the overhaul while facing criminal charges — a stern statement that raised the specter of a constitutional crisis.Netanyahu is on trial for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals involving wealthy associates and powerful media moguls. He denies wrongdoing and dismisses critics who say he could find an escape route from the charges through the legal overhaul his government is advancing.Supporters of the judicial overhaul — which includes plans to increase the coalition's control over judicial appointments and diminish the Supreme Court's ability to strike down laws passed by Parliament — say it will restore power to elected legislators and make the courts less interventionist. Critics say the move upends Israel’s system of checks and balances and pushes it toward autocracy.In spite of the backlash, Netanyahu has dismissed offers for a compromise, including from Israel's mainly ceremonial president earlier this month.“For the sake of our security, for the sake of our unity, it is our duty to return to the arena of dialogue,” Gallant said.___Associated Press writer Sam McNeil in Tel Aviv, Israel contributed to this report.",2023/03/26,,World

Around 20 helicopters and firefighting planes have also been deployed.Emergency services said the fire had intensified near the village of Villanueva de Viver, forcing more than 1,500 residents to flee their homes since the fire began.They described the fire as being a ""highly complex blaze taking place in weather conditions similar to those of the summer.""With a perimeter of about 35 kilometers (22 miles), the blaze has burned more than 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) of forest.The fire is not spreading to other areas, but has yet to be extinguished, Ximo Puig, leader of the Valencia region, which incorporates Castellon, told reporters.While the cause of the fire was not yet known, the fire was still ""very early in the spring, very voracious from the beginning,"" Puig explained on Friday.Puig added the effects of climate change ""are undeniable, so the perspective of firefighting must be considered on an annual basis.""Extreme heat and drought have made wildfires even more challenging — some 785,000 hectares were destroyed last year in Europe.The figure represents more than double the annual average for the past 16 years, according to statistics from the European Commission.In Spain, 493 fires destroyed a record 307,000 hectares of land, according to the Commission's European Forest Fire information system.rm/kb (Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846869,Putin says Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus,"Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said on Saturday, according to TASS state news agency.Putin said he reached an agreement with Belarusian president, and his closest regional ally, Alexander Lukashenko.""We agreed with Lukashenko that we could place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus without violating the nonproliferation regime,"" Putin said, according to the TASS report.""There is nothing unusual here either: The United States has been doing this for decades. They have long placed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allies,"" Putin added.Tactical nuclear weapons refer to those used for specific gains in the battlefield and transfer of the weapons would mark the first time Russia will have based them outside the country since the mid-1990s.The announcement comes as the battle for Bakhmut goes on, with Ukrainian top generals claiming that Kremlin's forces are depleted on the ground.Putin said that Lukashenko had long raised the issue of stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus and that Russia has already stationed 10 aircraft in Belarus capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons.While Belarus does not have nuclear weapons of its own and Lukashenko has previously raised concerns about a potential future threat from neighboring Poland, a member of NATO, the relationship between Putin and Lukashenko is one-sided.The Russian leader said that Russia will have completed the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by July 1, but did not specify when the transfer of weapons would take place.Moscow would not actually be transferring control of the arms to Minsk, Putin clarified.Putin used Belarus to launch his invasion of Ukraine last year.Even though they were growing fears at the end of last year over whether Belarus would join Russian forces on the ground, Lukashenko made clear earlier this year they would only join the war in Ukraine if its forces were attacked in Belarus.Putin made a rare trip last year December to Belarus, telling reporters that he and Lukashenko discussed forming ""a single defense space"" in the region.While Belarus is heavily dependent on Moscow for economic and military aid, Putin rejected claims that Moscow was poised to swallow its neighbors, saying, ""Russia isn't interested in any kind of merger, it's not feasible.""The Russian leader said he supported Lukashenko's proposal to train the crews of Belarusian warplanes that already had been modified for using special warheads — a reference to nuclear weapons.The two allies then announced a plan to modernize Belarusian aircraft to make them nuclear-capable.Lukashenko also thanked Putin during the meeting last year for providing his military with nuclear-capable Iskander short-range missiles and S-400 air defense systems.rm/kb (Reuters, dpa)",2023/03/25,,

Fain's slate of candidates won control of the big union, as workers rejected most incumbents in the wake of a bribery and embezzlement scandalIt was the 372,000-member union’s first direct election of its 14-member International Executive Board, which came in the wake of the wide-ranging scandal that landed two former presidents in prison.The vote count had been going on since March 1, and the outcome was uncertain going into Saturday because of challenges against several hundred ballots.Curry had filed a protest alleging election irregularities and campaign-financing violations. But he conceded Saturday and said Fain would be sworn in on Sunday.Fain said members clearly wanted the union to become more aggressive in dealing with the auto makers.“Today we put the companies on notice the fighting UAW is back,” Fain said in a video.Fain vowed to end two-tiered contracts that provide lower pay and fewer benefits for some workers. He said the UAW will fight against factory closures that result in lost union jobs.“We've seen plant after plant close without any serious fight from our union,” he said. “We've lost 40% of our active membership over the past 20 years. That ends here.”Fain also promised to clean up the union.Fain, 54, now an administrator with the international union in Detroit, had 69,459 votes, or 50.2%, while Curry had 68,976 votes, or 49.8%, according to an unofficial tally as the counting neared completion.Earlier, Curry had asked court-appointed monitor Neil Barofsky to hold another runoff election because of the alleged irregularities, but Barofsky denied the request.Fain’s UAW Members United slate now holds seven of 14 seats on the board, with one independent member siding with his slate. The Curry Solidarity Team slate has six board members. Four of five top officers are from Fain’s slate, including the secretary-treasurer and two of three vice presidents.The new leadership will have to move quickly to gear up for what are expected to be contentious contract talks coming up this summer with Detroit’s three automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.Many in the industry expect strikes against the companies by the union.Fain will have little time to prepare for the union’s bargaining convention, which is scheduled to start Monday in Detroit. Delegates to the convention decide what the union will want in upcoming contract talks.In the past, contracts with the Detroit Three set the standard for manufacturing wages nationwide. Fain's statement said he wants to return to the union setting the wage and benefit standard for other sectors of the economy.Fain and his slate will have to deal with member demands to restore concessions made when the automakers were headed into financial trouble starting in 2007. Many want cost-of-living pay raises, general raises, defined-benefit pensions for all workers, and eliminating tiers of workers so they all get the same pay and benefits.Automakers prefer annual profit-sharing checks instead of raises so they pay workers when times are good and can cut expenses during economic downturns.In a February draft of a transition plan, Fain wrote about a big shakeup coming in his first 30 days in office. Jobs will change, and new things will be expected of workers, some of whom will leave, it said.“Everything we do, at every stage, must be reinforcing the message: there is a new sheriff in town,” Fain’s memo said.The memo talks about a campaign to prepare workers for strikes.Mike Booth, one of the new vice presidents, said the automakers are starting to argue that they are financially strapped because they have to fund the development of new electric vehicles. “You can’t develop an electric vehicle product on the backs of UAW members,” he said.Strikes are possible as the union pushes to organize joint-venture battery plants being built by the companies, and to reverse a Stellantis decision to begin closing a plant in Belvidere, Illinois. Under Curry’s leadership for nearly the past two years, the UAW has taken a more aggressive stance in labor talks, having gone on strike against Volvo Trucks, John Deere, the University of California and CNHI, a maker of agricultural and construction equipment.When asked about new UAW leadership on Friday, Ford CEO Jim Farley said his company gets along with the union. “Whomever is leading the UAW, we’ll have a great relationship with, and we’ll work hard to improve our industry ... We’ll welcome whoever leads UAW,” he said.Curry, who was not part of the scandal, was elected to the UAW’s top post by the executive board in June 2021.The leadership change came after union members decided to directly vote on leaders for the first time in the union’s 87-year history. Under the old system, leaders were picked by delegates to a convention who were selected by local union offices. The new slate of officers was picked by the current leadership, and rarely was there serious opposition.The direct voting came after 11 union officials and a late official’s spouse pleaded guilty in the corruption probe, including the two former presidents who were sentenced to prison. The first criminal charges in the probe were filed in 2017.To avoid a federal takeover, the union agreed to reforms and Barofsky’s appointment to oversee the UAW and elections of the executive board.____This story has been corrected to say that it was Shawn Fain, not Ray Curry, who said he wants to return to the United Auto Workers setting the wage and benefit standard for other sectors of the economy.___Associated Press writers Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee, and David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846871,2 dead in rail car; human smuggling investigation indicated,"Two people found dead in a railroad car in south Texas were Honduran men, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Saturday, indicating it was investigating the case as possible human smuggling.“We will continue to address the serious public safety threat posed by human smuggling organizations and their reckless disregard for the health and safety of those smuggled,” department spokesperson Nina Pruneda said in the statement.Pruneda declined to comment beyond the statement, which said the investigation is ongoing but did not say whether any of the migrants were in custody.The two dead were among 17 people — 15 men and two women — found Friday in what Union Pacific railroad said were two rail cars near Knippa, Texas, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) west of San Antonio and less than 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the U.S. border with Mexico, according to Pruneda’s statement.Union Pacific said in a statement Saturday that it is working with authorities to determine what happened and how the migrants boarded the train. The statement said the company is “deeply saddened” by the loss of life.“Safety is our focus, and we have strict policies in place to prevent unauthorized access of our trains,” the statement from company spokesperson Robynn Tysver said.Four of the survivors found in the cars were taken to hospitals, Pruneda said. Their nationalities and conditions were not released.University Health in San Antonio tweeted that two male survivors were in critical condition Saturday.Spokesperson Leigh Strope from Christus Health in San Antonio said one survivor was hospitalized there in undisclosed condition.Officials at other hospitals in the area either had no patients from the train or did not respond to messages seeking comment Saturday.Uvalde police Chief Daniel Rodriguez had said dispatchers received a 911 call about 3:50 p.m. Friday from an unknown person seeking help for “numerous undocumented immigrants ‘suffocating’ inside of a train car.”Rodriguez told local media it was believed the call came from inside one of the two rail cars where the migrants were found, a shipping container where the two dead men were found and a freight car.A suspected cause of the deaths has not been released. Highs in the area neared 90 F (32 C), and shipping containers often get much hotter than the surrounding temperature.Last summer, more than 50 migrants died after dozens of people were found in the back of a sweltering tractor-trailer that had been abandoned on the outskirts of San Antonio. The tragedy was the nation’s deadliest smuggling episode on America’s southern border, which led to officials vowing to step up policing efforts.Migrants routinely travel through Uvalde, leading to high-speed vehicle pursuits that put schools in the area on lockdown. After the Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde last May, when a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers, Texas lawmakers concluded in a report that the frequency of the lockdowns may have led to a “diminished sense of vigilance” about security.On the other side of Texas, a 17-year-old was charged Friday with kidnapping two migrants whose rescue this week from a Houston hotel by FBI agents ended in gunfire that killed another suspect.The migrants were stopped on a highway northwest of Houston on Saturday and were forced into another vehicle by the kidnappers, according to a prosecutor. Officials have said little about what happened between then and Thursday morning, when the FBI says its agents rescued two migrants following the shooting in north Houston.",2023/03/26,,World

But the Flyers have 26 goals in the current seven-game homestand, which ends Tuesday against Montreal when they will try to tie their season high for consecutive victories.The 21-year-old Foerster’s emergence has boosted Philadelphia’s offense. He has seven points in eight games since his call-up from Lehigh Valley of the American Hockey League.“He has played really good,” Philadelphia coach John Tortorella said.Hart has been Philadelphia’s best player all season. He recorded his second shutout of the season and fifth of his career.“I just think he’s in a little bit of a zone,” Tortorella said. “He just stays within himself. He hasn’t skipped a beat this year. He’s kept his consistency and never changes how he goes about his business. Really important.”The Philadelphia goalie’s best save came 2:04 into the third period when he robbed Jonatan Berggren with a glove save on a wrist shot from the slot. He denied Berggren again with a sprawling, glove save on the man-advantage with 3 ½ minutes left.“Trying to get my body in front of it,” Hart said. “The last one hit me, so I was glad it stayed out of the net.”The Flyers went up 2-0 with a pair of goals in the second period.Bellows netted his third of the season on a rebound of Owen Tippett’s shot with 9:50 left in the period.Laughton increased the advantage to two by scoring a 4-on-4 goal with 35.7 seconds left before the break. After stealing the puck in the Detroit zone, he elected to shoot on a 2-on-1 with Joel Farabee. Laughton’s wrister sneaked just inside the post, beating Alex Nedeljkovic on the glove side.“You like his feistiness,” Tortorella said. “He’s an easy guy to follow behind for some of our guys.”Nedeljkovic made 19 saves.“Overall I thought we were fine,” he said. “It wasn’t great. It wasn’t bad. Pretty decent hockey game. (Hart) made some good saves. They got what they deserved. We were right there. That game was there for the taking the entire night.”NOTES: Detroit’s Adam Erne went to the locker room in the first period after a high stick from Tony DeAngelo, who received a double-minor penalty.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846875,NHL-best Bruins clinch Atlantic with 2-1 win over Tampa Bay,"BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Bruins are winning so much that clinching their division didn't merit any celebration. Captain Patrice Bergeron didn't even realize it had happened.Garnet Hathaway scored the tiebreaking goal late in the second period and the NHL-best Boston Bruins wrapped up first place in the Atlantic Division with their sixth straight victory, 2-1 over the Tampa Bay Lightning, on Saturday.The win was the Bruins’ 56th and moves them one behind the club record set in 1970-71. It also keeps them on pace to set the NHL record for victories in a regular season with 10 games left. The Detroit Red Wings won 62 in 1995-96 and Tampa Bay matched it in their final regular-season game (at TD Garden in Boston) in 2018-19.“I forgot because things were happening so quickly,” Bruins first-year coach Jim Montgomery said when asked what he told his team about winning the division. “We didn't actually talk about the Atlantic Division, but its a tremendous feat with 10 games left.”Bergeron added a power-play goal for the Bruins and Linus Ullmark made 26 saves, raising his record to 36-5-1.“Last game, you mean?” Bergeron said when asked about winning the division. Informed it had happened Saturday, he said: ""Oh really.""Victor Hedman had a shorthanded score for the Lightning and Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 32 shots. Tampa Bay has lost four straight.“I thought we played physical. I thought we played the way we want to play,” Hedman said. “That's kind of the mindset we went in with and talked (about) before the game. I'm proud of the guys the way we battled today.”Hathaway, positioned in front of the net, batted the rebound of Matt Grzelcyk’s shot from the left point out of the air and into the net before Vasilevskiy could control it with 2:28 left in the period.Ullmark stopped Anthony Cirelli’s backhander on a partial breakaway with about seven minutes left.With Lightning winger Pat Maroon in the penalty box with an unsportsmanlike conduct for something he did on the bench, Bergeron was credited with his 27th goal when Brad Marchand’s pass hit his skate before caroming into the net off Hedman’s skate 6:46 into the opening period.Hedman beat Ullmark with a slap shot from the top of the left circle for his goal just under three minutes later.EARLY DUSTUPSMaroon and Hathaway had to be separated before the opening puck drop. It didn’t matter, they still dropped their gloves just nine seconds into the game. The scrum started when Tampa Bay center Ross Colton, who got a double minor for roughing, went after Boston center Jakub Lauko.Asked if he thought the game would be physical at the start, Tampa Bay's coach Jon Cooper said: “I did,” before ending his brief postgame news conference.WELL DONEThe Bruins killed a two-man, power-play advantage midway into the second, holding the Lightning to one shot on goal — and then just one shot before the second penalty expired.Tampa Bay was shorthanded five times in the opening period, holding the Bruins to one goal.NOTES: Bruins forward A.J.

Raikkonen won the F1 championship in 2007. England's Button won it two years later. They have 36 career F1 victories between them.“It’s nice to be back,” Raikkonen said Saturday. “It’s a lovely place here in Texas.”Raikkonen will driving Trackhouse Racing's Project91 entry that is designed to give a seat in NASCAR to drivers from others disciplines. Button will drive the No. 15 Mobil 1 Ford Mustang for Rick Ware Racing.Many of the regular NASCAR drivers welcome the Europeans.Ryan Blaney said he wants to meet Button because he was a huge fan as a kid. Cup eries leader Joey Logano is impressed they are climbing into cars that must feel unusual.“We don’t ever get the opportunity to stack up against those guys. They grow up racing completely different cars in different countries,” Logano said. “Put me in an F1 car and I’m going to be lost. It’s great for our sport.""And there's another “road course ringer” in the field: Sports car driver Jordan Taylor makes his NASCAR debut with Hendrick Motorsports. He qualified fourth driving for injured Chase Elliott, who is still recovering from fractured tibia in a snowboarding accident.“Jordan is really strong,” said William Byron, a two-time winner this season who qualified in pole position for Sunday. “It's impressive. The other guys too.”Some drivers have questioned whether Taylor and the F1 guys really know what they are in for in the the rough-and-tumble racing in the Cup series.Raikkonen has some experience with that. He made his Cup series debut last season at Watkins Glen, and was competitive until getting run off course on a restart. His race ended with a crash into a tire barrier.“In F1, open wheels if you touch somebody you usually lose a part or lose a wheel, you can’t really take that risk ... In NASCAR, you can have a bit more closer racing,” Raikkonen said. “It makes it exciting I guess at the end of the races when people can be quite aggressive.”Button said he’s ready for it: ""I get to race against 30 other crazy guys out there. I’ll roll with the punches.”Button noticed some big differences right away in Friday's practice. First, he forgot how to start the car.“There were a few other switches I had to put up,” Button said, laughing at himself.Then he had to avoid some heavy traffic.“People don’t move out of the way when they’re on a slow lap, and you're on a quick lap,” he said.Button's NASCAR debut is part of a three-race deal to drive road courses this season. And he's not done switching things up. He's already been named one of three drivers for NASCAR's entry in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June. Taylor will be the backup driver and driver coach for Le Mans.Button still spends part of the year following F1 as part of Sky Sports broadcast race coverage.He said it was his wife, Brittny Ward, who nudged him into trying to find an entry into NASCAR. She's an American and knew more about NASCAR than F1 when they first met over dinner in Los Angeles years ago.When Button told her he was an F1 driver, Button said she asked, “Is that like NASCAR?’”“I’m like, ‘It’s just like NASCAR. It's so similar, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart,'"" Button said.FEELS LIKE HOMEMexican driver Daniel Suarez said he's happy to be racing so close to his home country. He hasn't seen his mother and sister for several months and both made the six-hour driver from his hometown of Monterrey to see him.“It feels like home,” Suarez said. “I have my family here. We have fast cars too. Everything is looking great.”Suarez's victory on the road course at Sonoma, California, last season made him the first Mexican-born winner at NASCAR's top level.PENALTY APPEALNASCAR announced that April 5 will be the day Hendrick Motorsports can appeal the largest combined fine on one team in series history. The team was hammered with a total of $400,000 in fines, suspension for four crew chiefs, and loss of 100 regular-season points and 10 playoffs points for modifying air-deflecting pieces at Phoenix Raceway. HMS driver Alex Bowman was the Cup Series points leader prior to his 100-point deduction. He's now 20th.FRUIT SMASHRoss Chastain earned his first Cup series win at COTA last season and celebrated by smashing a watermelon off the top of his car.On Friday, Chastain threw fruit from much, much higher: the observation deck of the racetrack's 251-foot tower. At that height, the fruit hit the pavement with a smack that sounded like a rifle shot and and practically disintegrated on impact.He hit the target all four times.“The key is to imagine someone's face right there,"" said Chastain, who sits third in the standings and qualified 12th for Sunday's race. “I'm just not going to say who I imagined.”ODDS & ENDSTyler Reddick is the betting favorite to win, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. He'll start second ... Seven-time series champion Jimmie Johnson, owner and driver at Legacy Motor Club, will make Austin his second start in a 10-race part-time schedule. Johnson called the Circuit of the Americas a “bucket list” track for him and said he’s wanted to race here since it opened ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846877,Mexico sanctioned for not protecting endangered porpoise,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico acknowledged Saturday it faces sanctions from the international wildlife body known as CITES for not doing enough to protect the vaquita marina, a small porpoise that is the world’s most endangered marine mammal.The sanctions have not yet been announced, but they could make it difficult for Mexico to export some regulated animal and plant products like crocodile or snake skins, orchids and cactuses. Commercial seafood species like shrimp would not be affected, but the ruling sets a precedent and some groups are pushing for seafood import bans.""While no one relishes economically painful sanctions, all other efforts to prompt Mexico to save the vaquita have failed,” said Sarah Uhlemann, international program director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “We hope these strong measures wake up the Mexican government.”Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department said in a statement that CITES had ruled that Mexico’s protection plan for the vaquita was insufficient.Studies estimate there may be as few as eight vaquitas remaining in the Gulf of California, the only place they exist and where they often become entangled in illegal gill nets and drown.The Foreign Relations Department said CITES had ruled the protection plan “inadequate” and said the full ruling — and possible sanctions — “will be officially announced next week.”The Department called the ruling an “unequal treatment of our country, because its did not take into account the many and exhaustive actions that have been taken.”Mexico recently submitted a revised protection plan to CITES, after the body rejected an earlier version. Mexico's plan lists establishing “alternative fishing techniques” to gillnet fishing as one its top priorities. But in reality, the government’s protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and face often violent opposition from local fishermen.The administration of President Andrés Manuel López has largely refused to spend money to compensate fishermen for staying out of the vaquita refuge and to stop using gill nets. The nets are set illegally to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladders are a delicacy in China worth thousands of dollars per pound.The government has also sunk concrete blocks with hooks to snare illegal nets in the last bit of the Gulf — also known as the Sea of Cortes — where the vaquitas have been seen.The activist group Sea Shepherd, which has joined the Mexican Navy in patrols to deter the fishermen and to help destroy gill nets, says the efforts have successfully reduced the gillnet fishing. But with so few vaquitas remaining, that may not be enough.Moreover, experts say the Mexican government has not spent the money needed to train and compensate fishermen for using alternate fishing techniques such as nets or lines that won’t trap vaquitas.“There is no alternative fishing gear” being offered, said Lorenzo Rojas, a marine biologist who has headed the international committee to save the vaquita. “The fisheries authorities have been notable for their absence,” leaving the effort to change practices up to civic groups and fishermen.The Mexican government banned the use of gill nets in the area in 2017, with the understanding it would provide support payments and training on using less dangerous fishing methods.CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, signed by 184 countries; it regulates trade and protection for protected species.a resolución de la Secretaría General de la Convención Internacional sobre el Comercio de Especies Amenazadas de Fauna y Flora Silvestres (CITES) que será dada a conocer oficialmente la siguiente semana, respecto a que no considera adecuado el Plan de Acción para el combate al tráfico ilícito de totoaba, presentado por nuestro país el pasado 27 de febrero, el Gobierno de México informa que aunque considera un trato inequitativo hacia nuestro país al no tomar en cuenta el esfuerzo exhaustivo y las múltiples acciones que se han realizado, está en la disposición de discutir las observaciones y solventarlas de manera satisfactoria.",2023/03/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846891,"Venezuela: 21 officials, businessmen arrested in oil scheme","CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela’s attorney general said Saturday that 21 people, including senior officials in the government of President Nicolás Maduro and business leaders, have been arrested in connection with a corruption scheme involving international oil sales.Prosecutor Tarek William Saab said the alleged scheme involved selling Venezuelan oil through the country’s cryptocurrency oversight agency in parallel to the state-run Petróleos de Venezuela SA.The oversight agency allegedly signed contracts for the loading of crude on ships “without any type of administrative control or guarantees,” violating legal regulations, Saab said, without mentioning the amounts involved. Once the oil was marketed, “the corresponding payments were not made” to the state oil company.The attorney general’s statement comes five days after Venezuela’s once-powerful oil minister, Tareck El Aissami, resigned amid allegations of corruption against some of his closest associates.El Aissami said he resigned to “accompany and fully support” the investigations. For now, El Aissami, who was one of Maduro’s trusted ministers, is not facing charges.The U.S. government designated El Aissami a narcotics kingpin in 2017 in connection with activities in his previous positions as interior minister and governor. El Aissami's resignation was announced two days after the Public Ministry appointed five prosecutors to probe the alleged crimes investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Police.Among the 10 officials arrested, according to the attorney general, are Col. Antonio Pérez Suárez, the vice president of trade and quality supply at PDVSA; Hugbel Roa, the former minister of food; and Joselit Ramírez, the national superintendent of cryptocurrencies.Also arrested were 11 businessmen, who will be charged with appropriation or diversion of public assets, influence peddling, money laundering and criminal association, Saab said, adding that the crime of treason against the country will be added to public officials’ charges.Corruption has long been rampant in Venezuela, which sits atop the world’s largest petroleum reserves. But officials are rarely held accountable — a major irritant to citizens, the majority of whom live on $1.90 a day, the international benchmark of extreme poverty.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846892,Protests erupt in NYC — not for Trump but for 'The Joker',"NEW YORK (AP) — Throngs of protesters gathered at the courthouse steps, chanting for freedom for their embattled hero. Police kept watch as passions flared and voices roared. Squad cars and television trucks encircled the commotion.It’s a scene New York City authorities have been bracing for as prosecutors consider an indictment against former President Donald Trump, who has invited followers to rally on his behalf. But on Saturday, it was just a movie shoot — for the “Joker” sequel to be precise.The roars faded and the crowds dispersed — on command — when the director yelled, “Cut!”The New York City shoot for the upcoming “Joker” sequel had been planned for months; but in recent days, production crews wrestled with the possibility that filming could be disrupted by real-life protests over the Trump case — none of which have so far materialized.In the end, film workers forged ahead, said Leo Maniscalchi, a production assistant, who was taking a break at a nearby coffee house.“They needed to do what they needed to get this done,” he said.In the film, the Joker, played by Joaquin Phoenix, inspires protests against Gotham’s elites.In real life, Trump has inspired protests, too. In recent weeks, the former president has called on his supporters to protest what he said was an impending indictment accusing him of paying $130,000 to buy the silence of porn actor Stormy Daniels.“They can’t stop production for anything, really,” Maniscalchi said. “The scene didn’t call for rain, but we’re still out here.”For the past week, crowds — mostly news media — have been staking out another courthouse up the street from filming. Earlier in the week, a band of young Republicans staged a protest but its numbers were dwarfed by a crush of journalists. A rumored caravan of Trump adherents also did not take place, neither did a march dozens of blocks from the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue to the Manhattan courthouse in the lower city.When we last saw the Joker, he was running down the halls of a mental asylum with Frank Sinatra singing “That’s Life.”In the sequel, called “Joker: Folie à Deux,” Lady Gaga joins the cast as Harley Quinn, his love interest. Fittingly, the new movie, expected to be released late next year, is being billed as a musical.Siris Pagan, 30, arrived in lower Manhattan with his friend, Marissa Perez, to watch the filming.“When some of the shots were being filmed, we started hearing loud chanting in the background and everybody was just turning around,"" Pagan said.Just a block away, both sides of the abortion issue were competing for attention.He thought it might have been part of the movie, but soon realized: “Oh, no, it’s a whole different thing going on.”Reality and make-believe were suddenly colliding, he said.Jaymie Robinson, a 24-year-old extra from Newark, New Jersey, recounted how she heard one bystander who seemed confused about whether she was part of a real protest. The cameras and phony police cars — and signs saying “Free Joker” — should have been a dead giveaway, she said.Laurie Allard, who was visiting from Montreal, Canada, came upon the outdoor movie set while touring downtown Manhattan and initially didn’t know it was related to filming.She was vaguely familiar with the Trump case — and knew it was happening nearby. So when she saw the throngs, she was a bit startled.“I didn't want to be trapped in a protest or something ... if there's one happening,” Allard said.Filming continues Sunday.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846893,"Boston, South Carolina women overpower UCLA in March Madness","GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's defenders chased ballhandlers and used their length to disrupt any flow. Its bigs continued to snag just about every miss coming off the rim.It's an unwavering combination, one that at times has the Gamecocks' push for a second straight national championship flirting with a vibe of inevitability.Three-time All-American Aliyah Boston had 14 boards and two blocks while reigning national champion South Carolina turned in its latest overwhelming defense-and-rebounding-first performance to beat UCLA 59-43 on Saturday in the Sweet 16 of the women's NCAA Tournament.Kamilla Cardoso added 10 points and Boston had eight for the Gamecocks (35-0), the top overall tournament seed and the headliner in the Greenville 1 Region. It marked South Carolina's 41st consecutive victory, securing the program's sixth trip to the Elite Eight under coach Dawn Staley.“We definitely do a lot of (defensive) work in practice, whether it’s ball-screen, whatever the case may be,” said Brea Beal, who had 10 points for South Carolina. “I think for games like this when offensive scoring is very low, we definitely rely on our defense to keep their scoring lower than ours.""Three games into the NCAAs, the Gamecocks have yet to surrender more than 45 points or let an opponent hit even 30% of its shots. They next face 2-seed Maryland in Monday's regional final in a rematch of the Gamecocks' 81-56 win from the season's opening week.It wasn't an easy offensive operation for South Carolina, with UCLA sagging defensively to pack the paint in hopes of negating the Gamecocks' size advantage behind Boston. But South Carolina turned nearly every look into a difficult one for the fourth-seeded Bruins (27-10).“It was the lowest point total that anyone had held them to in a half in the first half,” UCLA coach Cori Close said, “and we couldn't even take advantage of that because we were struggling so much offensively.”The Gamecocks won the first meeting with UCLA 73-64 in November, with the Bruins shooting 32% in that game. Things got worse this time, with UCLA going shooting 29% — including 3 for 18 from 3-point range.“I feel like everything was rough,” UCLA guard Camryn Brown said, adding: ""We were a little frantic out there.”By the final horn, UCLA had committed 15 turnovers on 63 possession, a nearly 25% rate.Charisma Osborne scored 14 points to lead UCLA, which was in the Sweet 16 for the eighth time. The Bruins were trying to reach the regional finals for the first time since 2018 and only the third time in program history while pursuing their first Final Four appearance.But in a sign of what was to come, the Bruins kept missing shots that they needed for any chance at a stunning upset. Worse, they failed to grab even a few of those misses to keep possessions alive early, with the Gamecocks taking a 9-0 edge in offensive rebounds in the first half.Meanwhile, the Gamecocks led 25-15 at halftime before matching their game-long point total in the third quarter.That included a couple of way-too-familiar sequences for Close. Twice the Gamecocks managed to lob a pass inside to the 6-foot-7 Cardoso, who used her long arms to reach over 6-2 fronting defender Christeen Iwuala and snag the ball for easy under-the-rim finishes in traffic.Or there was Beal using her right hand to tap out a loose rebound over Gabriela Jaquez before securing it, then dumping it immediately inside to Victaria Saxton inside for a soft hook.It was all the same often-demoralizing sequences that has overwhelmed teams all season, this time coming with the home-state Gamecocks as the main draw here in the new double-regional format.They drew loud cheers from the crowd just for making their way into the locker-room tunnel during the Notre Dame-Maryland game with their game to follow. The roars returned as each player who lingered to wrap up pregame shootaround came off the court — several waving two arms high in acknowledgement — in a mostly full arena.The cheers were louder, of course, as the Gamecocks spent the final minutes closing out a win to advance again.WORD OF THE DAYThe key for South Carolina's offense was patience, and making sure to keep working the ball to find seams inside.“That's something Coach emphasized at halftime,” Boston said. “She was like ... ‘Just take our time, we’re taking great shots but taking a split-second longer could help us out.”CLASSY GESTUREStaley showed a noteworthy bit of sportsmanship in the third quarter.UCLA's Emily Bessoir fell awkwardly after trying to beat Boston to a rebound, and the Bruins forward was down on the baseline as the Gamecocks took possession across half-court. But instead of continuing to run the play 5-on-4, Staley burned a timeout and pointed for officials to tend to Bessoir at the far end.“I think these kind of moments in games, they reveal people's character,” Close said, “and I think it just revealed a layer of her character, of what she deems most important. And that's always the kids.”Staley said: “It was the right thing to do to make sure the young lady was OK.”___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846895,"After tornado, harrowing tales of survival in Mississippi","SILVER CITY, Miss. (AP) — Nothing remained of William Barnes’ home in the tiny western Mississippi town of Silver City after a killer tornado tore it off its foundations. He stood in disbelief Saturday as he surveyed the lot where he'd lived for 20 years, twisted debris of cinder blocks and mangled wood siding scattered across where his home once stood.“We lost everything but got out alive,” he said, holding his young granddaughter in his arms.Stories were similar throughout the town of just over 200 people, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of the state capital of Jackson. Devastating accounts of utter destruction, incredible survival and tragic deaths followed Friday’s twister that killed at least 25 in Mississippi and one in Alabama as it surged nearly 170 miles (274 kilometers) across the Deep South.Residents sat in folding chairs outside the mud-splattered ruins of beloved family homes as people came by in all-terrain vehicles and golf carts packed with bottles of water to distribute. A line of cars was parked on the road from first responders and family who had driven in to help with clean up and rescue efforts.Remnants of the storm and reminders of its ferocity were everywhere.A child’s Shrek doll lay face down in the dirt next to a pile of broken plywood and branches, feet from a busted-up refrigerator with its back torn clean off. Limbs from several fallen trees blocked a school bus. Outside the wall of what used to be a house, a bike lay upside down in another pile of debris.Lakeisha Clincy, Yaclyn James and Shaquetin Burnett had just returned to their Silver City home from an evening out in the nearby town of Belzoni when the tornado struck. They parked in their driveway and opened the car doors, but it was too late.“I saw houses flying everywhere,” Burnett said. “The house on the corner was spinning.”They closed the car doors and waited.“It only lasted about three minutes, but it was the longest three minutes I’ve ever had,” Clincy said. “This I will never forget.”They exited the car to find their house destroyed. Officials later transported them by bus to a hotel, where they fell asleep sometime after 4 a.m. They didn’t know where they would sleep Saturday night.Christin George said her parents and grandmother narrowly escaped when the tornado blew out the windows and ripped off part of the roof of their home.She said her parents huddled behind a door that hadn’t been hung yet and threw a blanket over her grandmother to shield themselves from the glass that “shot down the hallway and peppered everybody.”“Everything else around them is just gone,” she said, at times clutching her hand to her chest. “They were lucky. That’s all there is to it.”Christine Chinn, who’s lived in Silver City her whole life, sought refuge with her husband and son in the hallway, covering themselves with a blanket as they desperately sought to protect themselves. After the storm, the roof was gone on the home where she's lived for 17 years and cars were upended in her yard.“It just got calm and all of sudden everything just — like a big old train or something coming through,” she said, adding that much of her belongings weren't salvageable.She said she was very scared and had never experienced anything like it.That same fear gripped residents of Rolling Fork, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away, as the twister flatted the town of just under 2,000 people.Derrick Brady Jr., 9, said he tried to cover his 7-year-old sister Kylie Carter with his body as the tornado moved over their home. He had to dive in the bathtub as his mom pushed herself up against the bathroom door, trying to keep it closed. He described the sensation of feeling both pushed and pulled by the twister's force.“I was scared, but I was brave that time,” he said. “We had to say our own prayers in our heads.”Wanda Barfield, grandmother of Derrick and Kylie, said she was running around the devastated town Friday night and Saturday trying to account for loved ones. After the storm hit, she kept calling family members’ cell phones, but no one answered. She found her sister-in-law dead amid the wreckage, she said.She said her family is doing the best they can to survive.“Our life is more important than anything else. You can get a job, money, car, clothes, shoes — you can get all that,” she said. “For me, and for my house, we’re going to serve the Lord.”James Hancock was helping with search and rescue efforts in Rolling Fork late Friday as the storm tore through town.He was part of a crew who forced open a store that community members started using to care for injured people. It took two hours for ambulances to maneuver through debris-filled streets to get to the store to start tending to them, he said. As he moved from the ruins of one home to the next, he said he could hear people crying out in the dark.“You could just hear people needing help, and it was just devastating,” he said.___Rush contributed from Portland, Oregon.

(AP) — Eeli Tolvanen scored twice, Philipp Grubauer made 14 saves and the Seattle Kraken defeated the Nashville Predators 7-2 on Saturday.Jared McCann had a goal and two assists, and Daniel Sprong, Adam Larsson, Matty Beniers and Oliver Bjorkstrand also scored for Seattle, which entered Saturday holding the top spot in the Western Conference’s wild-card race. Vince Dunn had two assists.Matt Duchene and Tyson Barrie each had a goal and an assist and Juuse Saros made 32 saves for Nashville, which had its two-game winning streak snapped. The Predators began Saturday five points behind the Winnipeg Jets for the West’s second wild-card berth.“They were the better team from right off the start,” Predators coach John Hynes said. “They just looked faster, more competitive on the puck.”Tolvanen’s two-goal performance was particularly painful for the Predators, as they waived the talented Finn in early December. Tolvanen has scored 15 goals since joining Seattle.“He just keeps working hard,” Seattle coach Dave Hakstol said. “What he did today is what he’s been doing for us all along.”Much like in Thursday night’s matchup between the teams, Sprong scored the game’s first goal early in the opening period. Sprong has scored in three straight games, equaling a career high.Tolvanen doubled the Seattle lead at 17:37 of the first with a power-play goal. The Kraken had not scored on the man-advantage in the last five games, going 0-11 over that stretch.“I feel like the last couple of games we struggled a little bit getting shots on net and getting scoring chances,” Tolvanen said. “Today we did a pretty good job on the power play. We got shots through and we got some traffic, too.”Barrie halved the Seattle lead at of the 1:43 of the second, tapping in the rebound of a Philip Tomasino redirect.Tolvanen struck again at 17:16 of the second. Saros came way out of his crease to try to prevent a Bjorkstrand breakaway. Unfortunately for Saros, he passed it right to Tolvanen just inside the blue line, where he sent a long wrist shot into the vacated net.Duchene scored at 53 seconds of the third to draw Nashville briefly to back within a goal, but Seattle scored four unanswered to put the game out of reach.“Yeah, it was kind of a weird game,” Duchene said. “We were not at the level we needed to be. We were a little flat. So I’m not sure. It’s hard to put your finger on why. Execution wasn’t great at times.”FRANCHISE RECORDSNashville was credited with just one shot on goal in the first period, equaling a franchise record for fewest shots in one period.On the other side, it was the first time in Seattle franchise history in which it allowed a single shot against in a period.“It’s a mental game, one shot there,” Grubauer said. “That’s the period you want to have. I think it was 2-0 after the first period, one shot on net. That’s a hell of a road game.”DACCORD REASSIGNEDEarlier Saturday, the Kraken reassigned goaltender Joey Daccord to the Coachella Valley Firebirds of the AHL. The goaltender went 1-0-1 in the two games he played this week.RINNE HONOREDPrior to the game, the Predators unveiled a statue of retired goaltender Pekka Rinne.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846898,"Louisville women in familiar March Madness spot, face Iowa","SEATTLE (AP) — By this point, Louisville resume of women’s NCAA Tournament success should have the Cardinals getting mentioned in the same breath as South Carolina, UConn and the other powers in the sport.Instead, Jeff Walz feels like the Cardinals are regularly a team picked to get bounced early in March Madness.“We’re not always the sexy choice, we’re not the one that everybody’s like, ‘Oh, you got it, this is a shoe-in, put them in your bracket, pencil them in,’” Walz said. “We’re normally the one that everybody’s like, ‘Oh, I think they’re going to lose in the first round, they might get beat in the second round,’ and then they’re pissed that we keep winning.”Walz and the No. 5 seed Cardinals will play in their fifth straight regional championship game facing high-scoring Caitlin Clark and No. 2 seed Iowa in the Seattle 4 Regional on Sunday.The Elite Eight has become the expected destination for Louisville, even in a season like this one where that didn’t seem a likely result. After a rough start to the season that didn’t match preseason expectations, the Cardinals (26-11) have found their stride winning 11 of their past 14 with the only losses during that stretch to Notre Dame and Virginia Tech.The Cardinals outlasted upstart Mississippi in Friday’s Sweet 16 and continued the quest for a second straight Final Four and fifth overall.“You work your whole life for to be playing on a national stage in the Elite Eight with a packed house. You can’t trade it for any other scenario,” Louisville standout Hailey Van Lith said. “So it’s going to make or break you. That type of pressure, it forms diamonds or it crushes you. So we’ll see which side we come out on.”Louisville’s streak of five straight Elite Eight appearances became the longest active streak in the country on Saturday after UConn lost to Ohio State in the Seattle 3 Regional semifinal. The Huskies had made 14 straight Final Fours and every Elite Eight since 2006.Iowa (29-6) would love to start the kind of run Louisville is on. For all their success with Lisa Bluder as head coach, the Hawkeyes have just one Elite Eight appearance in the past 30 years. The Hawkeyes reached the regional finals in 2019 only to get overrun by Baylor.Iowa’s only Final Four trip came in 1993.“I think that experience is a great teacher, and so definitely I think that experience that they have had is on their side,” Bluder said. “Each game you play, a little bit more pressure mounts, right? I think when you have been there a lot, you know how to handle that a little better. So I think that’s to their advantage.”But while Louisville has more experience being in this spot, Iowa has Clark.The first-team All-American had 31 points in Iowa’s 87-77 win over Colorado in the Sweet 16. The victory put aside two years of disappointment after the Hawkeyes lost in the round of 16 and round of 32 in the previous two NCAAs with Clark on the floor.“This group hasn’t been to the Final Four or the Elite Eight for us, but we’ve had the opportunity to play with each other for three years, so it’s not anything we’re going to shy away from. We’ve been in plenty of big games,” Clark said. “But I think that’s the biggest thing about (Louisville), they have experience being in this situation, they’re really well coached.”IN THE PASTPlenty of attention will be on the clash between Van Lith and Clark, even if they are not likely to be matched up on each other very often. The pair have history playing together for USA Basketball, including the under-19 team that won the FIBA World Cup and was coached by Walz.“I played the point guard spot with her on USA Basketball. We were roommates for a while on part of the trip, so I know her pretty well,” Clark said. “A great person, but also a really good basketball player.”ELITE EXPERIENCEThe Hawkeyes aren’t completely void of experience reaching this point of the tournament. Iowa’s Monika Czinano was a freshman for the Hawkeyes when they reached the regional finals in 2019. Czinano was a bench player for the Hawkeyes then and played just 2 minutes in the loss to Baylor.On Sunday, she could be a difference maker on the interior for Iowa. Czinano has scored at least 14 points in 10 of the last 11 games.“She’s phenomenal. I just love the demeanor she plays with. She’s a competitor, she’s fierce, but she puts a smile on, she has fun, and I love that about players,” Walz said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World

He struck out 112 in 102 innings.Boone said the issue arose after Severino made his last start on Tuesday.“Afterwards when he was kind of doing his workout, arm-care stuff, he just felt some tightness in there,” Boone said. “He came in the next day and it was a little tight, and then yesterday he was going to go out and throw and that tightness was still there enough to where he wanted to go get it looked at.”The Yankees already won’t have right-hander Frankie Montas or left-hander Carlos Rodón for the start of the season.Rodón, who joined the Yankees by signing a $162 million, six-year contract in the offseason, has a left forearm strain that will cause him to open the season on the injured list. Rodón has been an All-Star the last two seasons, in 2021 with the Chicago White Sox and in 2022 with the San Francisco Giants.Montas is recovering from shoulder surgery and won’t begin throwing until at least late May.The only projected starters from the Yankees’ rotation likely to be ready for the beginning of the season are five-time All-Star right-hander Gerrit Cole and 2022 All-Star left-hander Nestor Cortes.DEGROM SHARPJacob deGrom struck out six over 3 2/3 shutout innings against the San Diego Padres in his final start before making his Texas Rangers regular-season debut.The Rangers had announced Friday that deGrom would get the start Thursday when the Rangers open their season against Aaron Nola and the Philadelphia Phillies. The two-time Cy Young Award winner signed a five-year, $185 million contract with the Rangers in the offseason after spending nine seasons with the New York Mets.GREINKE WORKS 5 1/3 INNINGSZack Greinke pitched 5 1/3 innings in his final test before he gets the ball against the Minnesota Twins in Kansas City on Thursday.It will be Greinke’s seventh opening day start. At 39 years old, he will be the oldest opening-day starter in the history of the Royals franchise, breaking his own record set last year. He will be the the oldest opening day starter in the American League since a 40-year-old Curt Schilling started against the Royals in 2007.Greinke allowed two runs on five hits against the Dodgers with no walks and two strikeouts.“He was great today,” first-year manager Matt Quatraro said.“It certainly looked like the way they (Dodger batters) were taking those pitches, he was just dotting the plate on both sides. His two-seamer and changeup looked really good. It was encouraging.”VOIT OPTS OUTFirst baseman Luke Voit has opted out of his minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers, giving the veteran slugger the opportunity to negotiate with other teams. He also could still return to the Brewers on a major league contract.In other Brewers news, right-hander Adrian Houser left his start Saturday after 1 2/3 innings due to groin tightness.WALKER MAKES CARDS' OPENING ROSTERJordan Walker has made enough of an impression this spring to earn the 20-year-old outfielder a spot on the St. Louis Cardinals' season-opening roster.The Cardinals announced that Walker and infielder Taylor Motter had made the 26-man roster to start the season. The Cardinals optioned left-handed pitchers Génesis Cabrera and JoJo Romero and infielder/outfielder Juan Yepez to Triple-A Memphis.Walker, the 21st overall pick in the 2020 draft, turns 21 on May 22.METS ADD DYLAN BUNDYThe New York Mets have reached agreement with right-handed pitcher Dylan Bundy to a minor league deal.Bundy, 30, went 8-8 with a 4.89 ERA in 29 starts for the Minnesota Twins last season. He owns a 54-65 career record with a 4.74 ERA.“I'm excited,” Bundy told reporters. “It was a long offseason, and I'm happy I found a home.”___AP freelance writer Gary Schatz contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World

The Senate is scheduled to be on break for the weeks of April 3 and April 10.McConnell was at dinner on March 8 after a hotel reception for a campaign committee aligned with him when he tripped and fell. In addition to the concussion, he also had a rib fracture.He was released from the hospital on March 13 and, upon the advice of his doctor, moved to an inpatient rehabilitation facility for physical therapy and to continue his recovery.Concussions can be serious injuries and take time for recovery. Even a single incident of concussion can limit a person’s abilities during that period.“I’m going to follow the advice of my physical therapists and spend the next few days working for Kentuckians and the Republican Conference from home,"" McConnell said in the statement. ""I’m in frequent touch with my Senate colleagues and my staff. I look forward to returning in person to the Senate soon.”Almost four years ago he tripped and fell at his home in Kentucky, causing a shoulder fracture that required surgery. The Senate had just started a summer recess, and he worked from home for some weeks as he recovered.In his early childhood, he had polio and he has acknowledged some difficulty as an adult in climbing stairs.McConnell was first elected in 1984.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846902,Israel: 2 soldiers wounded in West Bank drive-by shooting,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military said two soldiers were wounded, one severely, Saturday evening in a drive-by shooting in the occupied West Bank, the latest in months-long violence between Israel and the Palestinians.The attack was the third to take place in the Palestinian town of Hawara in less than a month. One soldier was seriously wounded and the second was in moderate condition, the military said. A manhunt was launched as forces sealed roads leading to Hawara.The armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the second largest faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has claimed responsibility for the attack, and Hamas, the militant group ruling the Gaza Strip, praised it.“The resistance in the West Bank can surprise the occupation every time and the occupation cannot enjoy safety,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said.Violence has surged in recent months in the West Bank and east Jerusalem amid near-daily Israeli arrest raids in Palestinian-controlled areas and a string of Palestinian attacks.U.S.-backed regional efforts to defuse tensions have led to the meeting of Israeli and Palestinian officials in Jordan and Egypt respectively, where parties hoped to prevent a further escalation during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.On Feb. 27, when Israeli and Palestinian officials met in Jordan’s Aqaba, a Palestinian gunman shot and killed two Israelis in Hawara. Another shooting attack in Hawara took place as the parties met again in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh, wounding two Israelis.Eighty-six Palestinians have been killed by Israeli or settler fire this year, according to an Associated Press tally. Palestinian attacks have killed 15 Israelis in the same period.Israel says most of those killed have been militants.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846903,"Texas seeks 1st Final Four in 20 years, Miami its 1st ever","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Texas coach Rodney Terry was not more than 20 minutes removed from a resounding win over Xavier in the Sweet 16 when he was asked about the next mammoth task during what is becoming an improbable run toward a home-state Final Four.How do you slow down Nijel Pack and high-scoring Miami?“You're not going to let me enjoy this for one night, huh?” Terry replied.He was joking, of course. Terry and his second-seeded Longhorns — the best seed left in an upset-filled NCAA Tournament — have been savoring every moment of March Madness. It began two weeks ago with a run through Kansas to the Big 12 Tournament title on the same floor inside T-Mobile Center, and with a win over the No. 5 seed Hurricanes on Sunday night, it would end with a trip to Houston and Texas' first Final Four appearance in 20 years.“This has been a very resilient team all year long,” said Terry, the longtime assistant who epitomized that resolve by keeping the Longhorns together after coach Chris Beard was suspended and ultimately fired early in the season.“When you play in the Big 12,"" Terry continued, ""you've been battle-tested. There's not really anything you haven't faced all year long — foul trouble, an injured guy. You just keep playing and keep working.”The latest injury for the Longhorns involves Dylan Disu, the Big 12 tourney MVP, who hurt his left foot in the second-round win over Penn State. Disu had been a revelation during the NCAA Tournament's opening weekend, but the 6-foot-9 senior had to watch most of their regional semifinal win over the Musketeers from the bench in a walking boot.Terry called him “day to day” on Saturday, though it appears unlikely Disu will be available against Miami.That won't help when it comes to stopping Pack and Co.The transfer from Kansas State, whose $800,000 deal with LifeWallet made him an early poster child for an era of name, image and likeness compensation, dropped seven 3-pointers and scored 26 points in leading the Hurricanes to an easy win over Houston on Friday night — thus eliminating the last No. 1 seed in the tourney.Miami coach Jim Larrañaga called Pack's performance “a joke,” one that left only his own team laughing, and it came after the Kansas State transfer scored 21 points in the Hurricanes' NCAA opener against Drake and 12 in a second-round win over Indiana.“I wanted to be part of something special, something great,” Pack said. “We're doing something special right now.”Even if the Longhorns and their own spectacular guards, Marcus Carr and Tyrese Hunter, manage to limit Pack's looks in the Midwest Region final, they still have to deal with ACC player of the year Isaiah Wong, ruthless rebounding machine Norchad Omier and a group trying to reach the Final Four for the first time in school history.“Their guard play is really good,” Terry said. “They share the basketball really well. Their interior players played really well against a really physical Houston team. Nothing but respect for Coach Larrañaga and what he has been able to do over the course of his career. His teams just win. We know we have our hands full.”Terry's feeling of admiration is quite mutual.“When Rodney had to step into his role,"" Larrañaga said, ""he had to command the respect of his players first. And they bought into whatever he said, whatever he did — hook, line and sinker. ... They're an outstanding team. They’ve played very hard and very well together at both ends of the court. I was extremely impressed with how they've played.”Larrañaga has been to the Final Four once already. And if he could take George Mason to the national semifinals, perhaps reaching the same point with what some pundits still carelessly call ""a football school” — one that dropped its basketball program for a 14-year stretch in the 1970s and '80s — doesn't seem quite so far-fetched.“The culture is changing,” the Hurricanes' Anthony Walker said. “Coach brings a winning mentality, and it drips onto us. It's the culture, man. We come out and play hard, Miami basketball. The outcome speaks for itself.”The outcome is all that matters at this point for Texas, too.The Longhorns have taken the season in 40-minute bites, one game at a time, never gazing too far down the path. It was an approach that helped them deal with an abrupt change in leadership, injuries along the way to Timmy Allen and now Disu, and a brutally difficult Big 12 that also advanced Kansas State to the NCAA Tournament's final eight.The next 40 minutes will decide whether Texas reaches its first Final Four since 2003, when the 54-year-old Terry was just an up-and-coming assistant on the staff of Rick Barnes, and how many of the Longhorns will be remembered.“I think my one constant message to our guys was, ‘Be where your feet are. Stay in the present right now. And we’re going to control what we can control,’” Terry said. “All the goals we had for the season are still in front of us.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846904,"Great debuts for De la Fuente, Joselu as Spain beats Norway","MALAGA, Spain (AP) — A winning debut for coach Luis de la Fuente with Spain. And a magical one for striker Joselu.Joselu scored in the 84th and 85th minutes — shortly after coming off the bench — to help seal Spain’s 3-0 win over Norway on Saturday in De la Fuente’s first game in charge.Dani Olmo had scored early as Spain opened its qualifying campaign for the 2024 European Championship with the victory over a Norway squad that was without star forward Erling Haaland because of a groin injury.“I still don’t believe it. I scored twice in my debut,” the 32-year-old Joselu said. “This is everything a player can ask for. Hard work has its rewards. I feel like an 18-year-old kid.""Before entering the match in the 81st, Joselu kissed his shin guards, which have a picture of his late father on one of them and his wife, kids and mother on the other.""They all give me strength,” he said.The Germany-born Espanyol striker became the first Spain player to score twice on his debut since Fernando Morientes in 1998.“It's our job to know the players, but all credit goes to Joselu,” De la Fuente said. “We gave him the opportunity and I'm happy for him and for all the players.”It was Spain's 23rd straight win in a European qualifier at home.Norway, trying to make it to a major tournament for the first time since Euro 2000, remains with only one win in nine matches against Spain.La Roja arrived with a squad overhauled by coach De la Fuente after he was promoted from Spain’s under-21 team to replace Luis Enrique in December following the team’s elimination against Morocco in the round of 16 of the World Cup.De la Fuente made it a priority to solve the scoring problems of a squad that managed only one win in Qatar after dominating possession in most games but failing to create many significant scoring opportunities.Spain again struggled against Norway, though, and was unable to capitalize on its chances during most of the match as the visitors played solidly from the start.“It's normal to suffer in matches at this level,” De la Fuente said. “I'm happy with the attitude that we showed, it gives me reason to be very optimistic. We will keep improving.”Olmo put Spain ahead in the 13th minute by redirecting Alejandro Balde's low cross. Joselu, who replaced starting striker Álvaro Morata, sealed the victory with a header and a close-range shot.One of Norway's best opportunities to equalize had gone to Real Sociedad striker Alexander Sorloth. His volley from inside the area went just wide in the 80th.Spain has won four of its last five games against Norway. The sides are paired together in Euro qualifying for the second tournament in a row.Spain’s next match is on Tuesday at Scotland. Norway will be at Georgia. Group A also includes Cyprus.

(AP) — Coco Gauff let a big lead slip away and wound up dropping the last five games of a mistake-filled 6-7 (8), 7-5, 6-2 loss to Anastasia Potapova in the third round of the Miami Open on Saturday.The No. 6-seeded Gauff, a 19-year-old from Florida, was critical of herself afterward, saying that her footwork wasn't great, that her mindset was off and that she played too defensively after serving for the victory at 5-3 in the second set.“That’s kind of been where I’ve been messing up in all my matches this year. All the ones I’ve lost I think I lost because of that. I think it should be more used as a tool in a toolbox than as a weapon,” Gauff said. “I think I have to change my mentality in the game about not relying on that too much because I think sometimes I play a little bit too passive because I know I can get to balls.”She heard chants of “Let’s go, Coco!” from spectators at the hard-court tournament as she overcame a 5-2 deficit in the opening set, then erased a pair of set points for Potapova in that tiebreaker. Gauff grabbed the set on her second chance with a cross-court backhand winner.The 2022 French Open runner-up then seemed to be pulling away, going up a break in the second set at 5-3. But Gauff eased up and Potapova became more aggressive in their lengthy baseline back-and-forths, taking four games in a row on a sunny afternoon with the temperature above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (nearing 30 degrees Celsius).When the 27th-seeded Potapova forced a third set with a backhand winner, she dropped her racket, clenched both fists, leaned forward and yelled.“It was a very tough match. It was very physical and it was very hot out there,"" Potapova said. ""I was trying to stay cool and just fight for every point and (not) think about the score, especially in the second set.”Gauff briefly went up 2-1 in the deciding set, but would not collect another game. She wound up with 34 unforced errors -- compared to 20 winners -- and was broken six times in a match that lasted more than 2 1/2 hours.“My mind just wasn’t all the way in today,” Gauff said.When Gauff dumped a backhand return into the net to fall to 1-5 against seeded opponents this season, Potapova covered her mouth with a hand and shook her head. She had been 0-2 against Gauff previously, but now will move on to face No. 23 Zheng Qinwen in the fourth round.Zheng beat No. 12 Liudmila Samsonova 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-3. Other third-round results included reigning Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, who won the title at Indian Wells last weekend, coming back to beat Paula Badosa 3-6, 7-5, 6-3; No. 3 Jessica Pegula's 6-1, 7-6 (0) win over No. 30 Danielle Collins; No. 20 Magda Linette's 7-6 (3), 2-6, 6-4 victory over three-time Miami Open champion Victoria Azarenka; and 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko’s 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 victory against No. 13 Beatriz Haddad Maia.Several seeded men lost in second-round action, including No. 11 Cam Norrie, No. 15 Alex de Minaur, No. 17 Borna Coric, No. 18 Lorenzo Musetti, No. 19 Matteo Berrettini, No. 23 Dan Evans, No. 27 Sebastian Baez, No. 28 Yoshihito Nishioka and No. 32 Ben Shelton, the 2022 NCAA champion from the University of Florida who reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in January.Coric was beaten 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 by 119th-ranked American qualifier Christopher Eubanks, who earned his first career victory over someone inside the top 50.In the longest ATP match this season, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz saved five match points and got past Thanasi Kokkinakis 6-7 (10), 7-6 (7), 7-6 (6) in 3 hours, 31 minutes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846916,Mourners gather for American killed by cartel on Mexico trip,"LAKE CITY, S.C. (AP) — Photos of a peewee football player flashed across a slideshow. The image of a smiling young man adorned memorial T-shirts. But the body of the American gunned down three weeks ago by the Gulf cartel in Mexico was kept shielded from funeral-goers.Over 100 people gathered Saturday to remember Shaeed Woodard at the first funeral service for the two people killed in the attack in the border town of Matamoros. The sendoff came at the end of a month that should have featured birthday celebrations for the man slain just days before he turned 34 during a tightknit group's road trip to help Woodard's cousin get cosmetic surgery.Instead, friends and family shuffled across the maroon carpeting of Good News Deliverance Temple on an overcast afternoon in Lake City, South Carolina. The 6,000-person town was thrust into the international spotlight in early March when Woodard and three friends with ties to the area were attacked over 1,400 miles away.On March 2, just a few miles across the border, a vehicle crashed into the group's van as they made their way to a medical appointment for Latavia McGee. Several men with tactical vests and assault rifles surrounded them and shots rang out.Woodard and Zindell Brown died; McGee and Eric Williams survived.The cartel’s Scorpions faction apologized in a letter obtained by The Associated Press through a Tamaulipas state law enforcement official.At the funeral, spiritual leaders rejected vengeful thinking.“We are asking you to give us a clean heart. Because no cartel, no demon, no evil spirit, no hellmaker, no one... We won’t seek retribution,” Minister Dearest Price said. “But, Lord, we ask you to deliver us from evil.”There, Nisheeka Simmons read a letter poem for her cousin whose “untimely departure” brought everyone together “in solidarity.” She recalled his sweet nature, strength of mind, and the safety others felt around him.A handout featured another poem suggesting Woodard “wanted to celebrate this birthday far different from before” with music, laughter and jokes “out on the open road.”“If any of you knew the outcome, you would have cautioned me to stay,” the poem continued. “But those plans were of my Master and could not be delayed.”The day contained mixed emotions.Pastor Hugh Samuels shared words of consolation for the family shocked by the sudden loss of Woodard and heartened by the return of his cousin, McGee, who survived the brutal kidnappings. A reading from the Old Testament Book of Ecclesiastes reminded attendees that there is “a time to weep and a time to laugh” and “a time to mourn and a time to dance.”Hands clapped and voices rang out during powerful medleys of songs.Samuels thanked God for bringing people together in Woodard's death, which he said should remind people of the future's uncertainty.“Brother Shaeed and three others went to Mexico. But the Son of Man called Brother Shaeed down,” Samuels said. “We are not promised to walk out of this place today. You don't know when God is going to call your name.”State Cemetery marked the final resting place for Woodard, whose body had been handed over to U.S. authorities on March 9 after crossing the international bridge to Brownsville, Texas.Since then, the Woodards have received an outpouring of support, said Colin Ram, an attorney for the family. Local officials' sympathy cards were read at the funeral. A nearby activist network promised to raise money. Ram pledged to guide them through the injustice's fallout.“Make no mistake, what happened in Mexico was an act of terrorism that affected the lives of four Americans, of four South Carolinians,” Ram told The Associated Press.___James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

I mean, it’s not if it’s going to happen. It’s just a matter of time when it’s going to happen. And it was going to happen sooner rather than later.”Cotie McMahon scored 23 points for the Buckeyes, who snapped their three-decade Elite Eight drought. The Buckeyes hadn’t made a regional final since 1993, when they eventually lost in the title game to Texas Tech.“When I had the opportunity to come to Ohio State, this was certainly the goal and the vision to go farther than they have been going,” said coach Kevin McGuff, who had never beaten UConn. “It’s not easy to get here, obviously. But I’m really proud of our team and our program of how we’ve evolved to be able to get to this point.""Like I said, I mean, I have so much respect for Geno and his staff and all that they have accomplished. So for us to be able to win this game in the Sweet 16 is obviously extremely significant. They’re just hard to beat. They’re so well-coached. So this is a great win for us.”The third-seeded Buckeyes (28-7) forced No. 2 seed UConn (31-6) into 25 turnovers, ending the Huskies' season before the national semifinals for the first time in 14 seasons. UConn hadn't been eliminated this early since 2006.“It’s an impossibility to do what we have done already,” Auriemma said. “What’s the next highest streak? ... And you take that in stride and you say, yeah, it was great while it lasted and it’s a credit to all the players that we had and all the times that you have to perform really, really well at this level.”Ohio State will play Virginia Tech on Monday night in the Seattle 3 Region final with a trip to Dallas at stake. The Hokies beat Tennessee 73-64.Ohio State, which had to rally from a double-digit deficit in the first round against James Madison, used full-court pressure to disrupt the Huskies' offense.“Our press is what we rely on, and sticking together and talking through it,” said Ohio State’s Jacy Sheldon, who had 17 points and went 10-for-10 from the foul line. “We knew UConn was going to be ready for us, so we knew we were going to have to stay consistent throughout the game.”This has been the most trying year of Auriemma’s Hall of Fame career. UConn was beset by injuries and illnesses to both players and coaches, including a torn ACL that sidelined star Paige Bueckers all season. It got so bad the Huskies had to postpone a game when they didn’t have enough scholarship players. They also saw their unbelievable run of 30 years without consecutive losses come to an end.“We picked the worst day to actually be doing the things that we’ve been struggling with all year long,” Auriemma said in a sideline interview during the game.Lou Lopez Senechal scored 25 points for the Huskies, Azzi Fudd had 14, and Ohio State transfer Dorka Juhasz finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.The Huskies led 17-9 before Ohio State started scoring and turning UConn over with its full-court press. The Buckeyes scored the next 17 points, forcing 11 turnovers during that stretch, which spanned the first and second quarters. UConn had eight turnovers to start the second quarter, leaving Auriemma exasperated on the sideline.McMahon was converting those turnovers into points for the Buckeyes as the freshman finished the half with 18 points — equaling the number of turnovers the Huskies had in the opening 20 minutes. Ohio State led 36-26 at the break.This was only the sixth time UConn had trailed by double digits at the half in an NCAA Tournament game, according to ESPN. The Huskies lost all of those.UConn did a better job of taking care of the ball in the second half and cut the deficit to 44-39 on Senechal’s layup with 3:53 left in the third quarter. Ohio State responded and still led by 10 after three quarters.The Buckeyes didn't let the Huskies make any sort of run in the fourth quarter. UConn got within nine with 4:30 left, but McMahon had a three-point play to restore the double-digit lead. The Huskies never threatened after that.Now the Huskies will start their offseason sooner than anytime in the past 17 years.TIP-INSThis was the first win for Ohio State over UConn in seven tries. The teams' last meeting was in the 2019-20 regular season. ... UConn was a paltry 7-for-15 from the foul line while Ohio State went 22-for-30. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846919,No Haaland as Spain beats Norway; Wales draws with Croatia,"New faces dominated European Championship qualifying on Saturday as Spain coach Luis de la Fuente swept aside Norway in his first game in charge and a Wales forward rescued a dramatic draw in his first international match.Best known until now for coaching Spain's youth teams, De la Fuente didn't have to deal with Norway's striker Erling Haaland, who missed the game with a groin injury. The 3-0 victory extended Spain's record of 23 consecutive home wins in qualifying games for the European Championship.Spain was in control after Dani Olmo's 13th-minute opening goal but didn't close out the game until substitute Joselu scored twice in quick succession late on in his international debut.For Norway, it was a frustrating reminder of the difference Haaland can make. The Manchester City striker has scored 21 times in 23 games for his country since his debut in 2019, but has now missed seven of Norway's last 15 games with various injury and fitness concerns.In the other game in Group A, Scotland beat Cyprus 3-0 in coach Steve Clarke's first match since extending his contract through to the 2026 World Cup. Scotland is aiming to qualify for consecutive European Championships for the first time since 1996.Scotland led by a single goal for most of the game after John McGinn scored in the 21st before Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay scored twice in the final minutes to ensure the win.WALES RESCUES DRAWNathan Broadhead had a dream debut for Wales as the substitute salvaged a 1-1 draw with a goal in stoppage time against World Cup semifinalist Croatia.Broadhead, who plays for Ipswich in the third tier of English soccer, was first to the ball when a long throw was flicked on in the third minute of stoppage time. Wales was playing its first game since Gareth Bale retired following the World Cup.Andrej Kramarić gave Croatia the lead after latching on to a long pass from goalkeeper Dominik Livaković in the 28th. Luka Modrić, still playing for his country at age 37, played in Ivan Perišić to a good position late on but the Tottenham midfielder hit the crossbar.Also in Group D, Turkey recovered from conceding an early own-goal to beat Armenia 2-1.QUICK HAT TRICKRenato Steffen needed less than a half-hour to score a hat trick as Switzerland demolished Belarus 5-0 in Group I. No fans were there to see the feat.Steffen scored in the fourth, 17th and 29th minutes, with all the goals from inside the six-yard box. Steffen had scored just once for his country in 29 previous games.Russia was banned from Euro 2024 qualifying by UEFA but its close ally Belarus was allowed to keep playing on condition of hosting its games in neutral countries with no fans allowed. Belarus chose Novi Sad in Serbia.Israel and Kosovo drew 1-1, and Romania beat Andorra 2-0.GERMANY WINSHansi Flick and his team don't have to go through qualifying because Germany is the host nation of the European Championship next year. Following a disappointing group-stage elimination at the World Cup, Germany started its rebuild Saturday with a 2-0 win over Peru in a friendly.Niclas Füllkrug opened the scoring off a pass from Kai Havertz in the 12th minute and made it 2-0 in the 33rd off a cross from right back Marius Wolf, who was making his debut for Germany. Havertz missed a penalty in the second half. Apart from Wolf, Flick gave debuts to Brentford winger Kevin Schade and Augsburg forward Mergim Berisha off the bench.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World

""We feel like we got to protect the goaltenders and help them out. … That we will acknowledge and keep preaching, for sure.”Viktor Arvidsson had two goals and Drew Doughty had a goal and an assist for Los Angeles, which has gone 9-0-2 during its streak. The last time the Kings had an 11-game point streak was 2013-14, when they won their second Stanley Cup championship.Coincidentally, the current streak started with a 6-5 shootout win over the Jets on Feb. 28.“I think that for the majority of these games we’ve won, we’ve kind of outplayed the other team for almost 60 minutes, and that’s an important thing to be able to do, to take into the playoffs,” said Doughty, who has found the net in four of the last five games.Alex Iafallo also scored for Los Angeles and Joonas Korpisalo stopped 25 shots.Pierre-Luc Dubois scored for Winnipeg and Connor Hellebuyck made 25 saves. The Jets are four points in front of Calgary for the final wild-card spot in the Western Conference, but are 5-5 in their last 10 games.“I think everyone is frustrated right now. Everyone wants to win. We can’t drop too many points,"" Dubois said. ""It was a big game for us to see where we’re at. We did some good things but can do a lot better.”Arvidsson — who has 22 goals on the season — has four in the last four games.His first goal came 82 seconds into the game. Trevor Moore won the faceoff in the offensive zone and made a backhand pass to Arvidsson, who snapped it into the net from the back of the left faceoff circle.Arvidsson added an empty-net goal late in the third period.The Kings extended their lead to 2-0 five minutes into the second period on the power play. Phillip Danault made a great pass between Jets defenseman Brenden Dillon and Hellebuyck as Iafallo buried it into the short side of the net.Doughty extended the lead to 3-1 27 seconds into the third period with a wrist shot from outside the right faceoff circle near the boards after Anze Kopitar won the faceoff.POWERING UPWinnipeg got its first power-play goal in seven games with 1:23 remaining in the second period when Dubois took a cross-ice pass from Kyle Connor and scored from the left faceoff circle to get the Jets within 2-1.The Jets got a five-minute power play after Los Angeles' Blake Lizotte received a five-minute match penalty for a vicious cross-check to Josh Morrissey’s face. The goal came with 33 seconds left in the man advantage.Morrissey said he had been going at it with Lizotte as the two skated up the ice and was expecting to fight him when the cross-check happened.“It was a careless play. I thought we were going to go and took a cross-check to the chin,"" Morrissey said. ""It could have been my teeth so thankfully not.”NOTES: Danault picked up his 300th career point and 200th assist. ... Winnipeg's Connor set a career high for most assists in a season when he got his 47th on Dubois' goal.UP NEXTJets: Travel to the San Jose Sharks on Tuesday.Kings: Host the St. Louis Blues on Sunday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846921,Miami coach Jim Larrañaga asks for transparency on NIL deals,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Miami coach Jim Larrañaga wants to know how much money athletes at other schools are making through name, image and likeness deals.It's only fair, he said, since no school has had the values of its athletes' deals publicized more than Miami.“I think everybody should be transparent,” he said at a news conference Saturday ahead of his team’s NCAA Tournament Midwest Region final aganst Texas. “Why is it hidden behind the curtain? Why? You can go on a website and check out anybody’s salary in the NBA.“There are a lot of schools that do the same thing we do. We just don’t know about it because it’s not public knowledge. Why not? Why are we afraid of sharing that information?”Larrañaga said full disclosure is important for competitive reasons and also so the NCAA or Congress can have more information at their disposal when, and if, they bring clarity and uniformity to NIL rules.Nijel Pack's two-year, $800,000 contract with Miami booster John Ruiz is the most publicized NIL deal since the NCAA began allowing college athletes to make money off their popularity. ACC player of the year Isaiah Wong’s $100,000 deal with Ruiz also became public knowledge.Though the terms of twins Haley and Hanna Cavinder’s deals have not been publicized, the two reportedly have made millions of dollars during their time playing women's basketball at Fresno State and now Miami.Larrañaga said television networks, shoe companies, universities, athletic directors and coaches make lots of money off college sports and that the athletes deserve a cut.“I hope they get as many great deals as they can because I think eventually they have to learn how to handle money,” he said. “So at their young age, if they learn it, maybe they’ll find out. I don’t know how many of these guys are spending every cent they get, but I know a lot of NBA guys did that and ended up bankrupt. I think that’s a learning experience. That’s why you’re in college anyway.”There have been concerns raised that publicizing the amount of money athletes make could cause jealousy and splinter locker rooms.Larrañaga said NIL hasn't changed the dynamic, as far as he's concerned.“These guys have to get along on the court and off the court,” he said. “If you can’t handle that as a coach, you probably couldn’t handle it when a guy was complaining about playing time or ‘I didn’t get enough shots.’”Wong disputed a report last year that, upon learning of Pack's deal, he threatened through his agent to transfer if his NIL deal wasn't beefed up.Larrañaga said he's seen no problems between the two.“They hit it off day one,” he said. “Why? Because they love playing basketball.""Jordan Miller vouched for his coach, especially when it comes to Pack's deal.“At the end of the day, he’s our teammate, and everybody’s happy for him,” Miller said.Larrañaga said he couldn't speculate on whether athletes would be paid as employees of universities some day.For now, the most important thing is to set firm guidelines for NIL and to make sure athletes are educated about how to manage their money.“Guys like Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson and LeBron (James), they make life-changing money, life-altering money,” Larrañaga said. “These young kids, they might not get that chance beyond this. So they need an education about it.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World

Young was immediately called for a technical foul and ejected.Only seconds earlier, Young had an apparent 3-pointer disallowed when he was called for a technical foul for sticking out his leg and tripping Aaron Nesmith.“It's just a play he can't make,” Hawks coach Quin Snyder said after the game. “I told him that. He knows it.”Snyder said Young acknowledged his mistake.“There wasn't a single part of him that tried to rationalize what happened,” Snyder said.The technical foul was Young's 15th of the season. A 16th technical foul results in an automatic one-game suspension.Young, who leads Atlanta with his averages of 26.8 points and 10 assists, had 14 points and five assists when he was ejected.The game was tied at 84 when Young was ejected.“We didn't allow it to turn into a negative,” Hawks guard Dejounte Murray said. “We turned it into a positive and got the win.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846923,"Scheffler, McIlroy at their best to reach Match Play semis","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The golf was as good as it gets. Rory McIlroy made 17 birdies in the 36 holes he played Saturday. Defending champion Scottie Scheffler rallied with six birdies in his last nine holes to reach the semifinals for the third straight year.A little luck never hurts in the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play. And as great as McIlroy played, he needed some of that, too.McIlroy never led in his quarterfinals match against Xander Schauffele. They came to the 18th hole all square, and McIlroy slumped slightly when he saw his drive headed left toward the trees. Schauffele hit his shot and quickly picked up his tee.Imagine their surprise. McIlroy came upon a golf ball behind a tree and figured it was his. Schauffele was walking behind him and was stunned when McIlroy kept going.“He hit a worse drive than I did and he ended up fine,” Schauffele said.He got no argument from McIlroy.“I expected my ball to be Xander’s ball on 18 behind that tree, and I got fortunate that mine trundled down the hill and obviously made the chip shot a lot easier,” McIlroy said. “Look, you need a little bit of fortune in these things, and that was a bit of luck for me today.”McIlroy won with a 12-foot birdie putt, the proper ending to a match that both said was a testament to the quality of golf required. Schauffele applauded all the pivotal putts McIlroy made to stay in the fight.It was like that all over Austin Country Club. The final version of Match Play lived up to its edge-of-the-seat reputation, with wild turns of momentum until four players remained.Sam Burns advanced by beating Patrick Cantlay in 17 holes and then overcoming an early deficit to beat Mackenzie Hughes of Canada, 3 and 2, to reach the semifinals.Burns advances to meet Scheffler, his best friend on tour with whom he often shares a house when they’re on the road. Their last encounter was at Colonial last year, when Burns made a 45-foot birdie putt to beat Scheffler in a playoff.Cameron Young looked as if he had an easy time, until it wasn't. He was 3 up at the turn, missed a chance to go 4 up on the 12th and then had to go to the 18th hole before he could dispatch of Bay Hill winner Kurt Kitayama.Scheffler, who lost in the final in his Match Play debut in 2021, now has won 10 straight matches. He was 2 down against J.T. Poston in the morning with five holes left when he birdied the 17th to square the match and won the 18th with a par.He was 3 down against former Match Play champion Jason Day through seven holes in the quarterfinals when he battled back, taking his first lead with a birdie on the 13th and then pulling away. He closed it out with a wedge to 2 inches on the 17th.Scheffler said he and caddie Ted Scott had a chat when Day went birdie-birdie-eagle on the front nine to go 3 up. The eagle came on a 5-wood from 282 yards to 5 feet on the par-5 sixth hole at Austin Country Club.“Just ride out the heater,” Scheffler said. “I had to stay patient.”Day began to struggle with allergies on the eighth hole, and then Scheffler had a heater of his own by making six birdies over their final nine holes.McIlroy reached the quarterfinals by making nine birdies against Lucas Herbert, and it still wasn't decided until the 18th hole.“I got to beaten by the best player in the world probably playing the best golf of anyone in the world would today,” Herbert said. “Pushed him all the way to the end. I just didn’t feel like there was a hell of a lot more I could have done.”Schauffele made seven birdies against McIlroy and it wasn't enough.“I needed to dig deep,” McIlroy said. “He's one of the best players in the world. I knew I was going to need to produce something similar to this morning. I was 16 under for two rounds of golf. That shows the caliber you need to play out there.”Next up for McIlroy is Young, who finished ahead of him at St. Andrews last year with a 31 on the back nine. Young has made 31 birdies and two eagles in his five matches this week. He won his group on Friday with a 5-and-3 win. He made it through Saturday morning with a 5-and-4 rout of Billy Horschel. He was on his way to another romp against Kitayama.But he missed a 5-foot birdie putt on the 12th that would have put him 4 up. Kitayama won the next two holes with birdies. Young missed from 10 feet for birdie, 15 feet for eagle and 10 feet for birdie on the next three, all three putts burning the edge.Ultimately, he only needed two putts from 15 feet on the 18th for the win. That was about the only easy part of his back nine.“I don't think I made a bogey today and I was biting my nails trying to win my match,” Young said. “I think it just shows you the quality of golf that’s played out here and how hard it is to get through even just one day like today, never mind that today was our fifth match.”Day earlier on Saturday beat Matt Kuchar, leaving the 44-year-old American one match short of the tournament record. Kuchar leaves sharing the mark of 36 wins with Tiger Woods.Now it's Scheffler's turn. Woods is the only player to win Match Play back to back. One day remains, and it feels like a long way to go.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846924,Nets aren't expecting Ben Simmons to return this season,"MIAMI (AP) — The Brooklyn Nets are not expecting guard Ben Simmons to play again this season, though no final decision will be made until the three-time All-Star meets with a back specialist, coach Jacque Vaughn said Saturday.Simmons is currently sidelined with what the Nets say is a nerve impingement — the condition where tissue or bone compresses nerve fibers — in his back.Saturday’s game at Miami marked the 16th in a row that Simmons has missed, and his 32nd absence in 74 Nets games this season.“For me as a coach, there’s some things that I can control, some things that I can’t control,” Vaughn said. “What I can’t control is the impingement. What I can control is getting this group ready to play. And then in all honesty, the realism that he’s probably not going to join us for the rest of the year ... certainty will come once he continues to be looked at by specialists.”The Nets announced Friday that Simmons will continue being sidelined “while we determine the best long-term course of treatment.” What that means still isn't fully clear, and the Nets won't know until Simmons is further examined.“We’re going to lean into the specialist and the consultation and I think those answers will come from the specialists,” Vaughn said.Simmons is a three-time All-Star who didn’t play at all last season, first citing mental health issues and then a back injury. He started last season with Philadelphia, then was sent to Brooklyn in the trade that brought James Harden to the 76ers.He has missed games this season for a variety of reasons, including left knee soreness, a left calf strain and the back problem.Simmons’ numbers this season are, by far, the worst of his career. He’s averaging only 6.9 points — he’s never been below 14.3 points per game in any of the other four seasons in which he played — and is shooting 44% from the foul line.He last played Feb. 15, around the time he told reporters that he was uncertain about his role with the team and prompting Vaughn to say in response that the team also wasn't sure how it would be able to use Simmons with new lineups following the trades of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.Simmons is making $35.4 million this season, and is due $78.2 million more over the next two seasons.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World

Ukrainian refugees will be among the fans at Wembley. England manager Gareth Southgate will be without Reece James after the Chelsea full back left the squad “for assessment on an ongoing issue,” and Luke Shaw is suspended after he was sent off against Italy. Being drawn against England and Italy means qualification is a tough task for Ukraine, which reached the quarterfinals of the European Championship in 2021 before losing 4-0 to England. Only the top two teams in the group qualify. Italy visits Malta in the other game in Group C.GROUP HDenmark opened its group campaign with a 3-1 win over Finland on Thursday thanks to a rising star. Rasmus Hojlund scored all three goals for the Danes on his first international start and will look to build on that impressive display in an away match at Kazakhstan. Hojlund is a 20-year-old striker who joined Italian team Atalanta in August after starting out at FC Copenhagen and having a half-season at Sturm Graz in Austria. Denmark's national team is in its strongest state for a generation — it reached the semifinals of Euro 2020 — but has been lacking a clinical striker. “This was very big for me,” Hojlund said of his hat trick against Finland. “I’ve never experienced anything like it before.” Northern Ireland looks to follow up a win over San Marino by beating Finland, while Slovenia hosts San Marino.GROUP JPortugal visits Luxembourg in the second game of the Roberto Martínez era as its coach. Portugal got off to a good start by routing Liechtenstein 4-0 in Cristiano Ronaldo's record-breaking 197th appearance with the national team. Martínez replaced Fernando Santos after Portugal's disappointing elimination to Morocco in the quarterfinals of the World Cup last year in Qatar. Luxembourg also started its qualifying campaign with a good result, earning a 0-0 draw at Slovakia. Slovakia will host Bosnia-Herzegovina, which opened with a 3-0 win over Iceland. Iceland will visit Liechtenstein.FRIENDLIESRussia is excluded from European Championship qualifying because of its invasion of Ukraine. After playing a series of friendlies in Central Asian countries last year and drawing 1-1 with Iran on Thursday, Russia hosts its first men's national team since the invasion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846926,Seniors take Aztecs to new heights on Elite Eight journey,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — San Diego State's recruiting pitch to Darrion Trammell certainly sounded intriguing.Coach Brian Dutcher asked the former Seattle University guard to come to Southern California and play in a Final Four.What Trammell found was a mature, talented group of players with two NCAA Tournament appearances — a team that convinced him it was possible. Now, after matching his season high with 21 points in Friday's 71-64 win over No. 1 seed Alabama, Trammell and his teammates are one win away from fulfilling their ambitious goal.""I felt like we were going to a make deep run, so yeah, I did believe it,"" Trammell said Saturday. “I felt as a team, we were the only people to believe that, but that's ultimately what matters is the confidence and the belief that we have in our own team.”The fifth-seeded Aztecs (30-6) don't look like many other teams.In an era when one-and-dones and the ever-swirling transfer portal threaten to break up teams and keep rosters young, San Diego State has relied on size, strength and experience to keep dancing through March Madness, right into the South Region final against No. 6 Creighton.Seven of its 12 players, including Trammell, are seniors. Five have only played at one school and everyone was sold on the same Final Four pledge. To Dutcher, the son of a former Big Ten coach who's in his 24th season at San Diego State and sixth as the head coach, it was more than a dream. It was a quest.And now this veteran lineup, which endured everything from a canceled postseason to a tournament bubble to last March's excruciating 72-69 first-round overtime loss to Creighton, can earn its ticket to Houston on Sunday.Those who have followed the Aztecs — or listened to Dutcher — are not surprised.“I think at Cal, we were really young and nobody really had any kind of leadership and experience winning, but I came into a program where I think a culture was already established,” said Matt Bradley, a two-year starter who played his previous three seasons with the Golden Bears. “Aguek (Arop), he reminds me all the time what it takes to win games at San Diego State.”Together, these seniors have played in three straight NCAA Tournaments, won three Mountain West regular-season titles and two conference tourney titles, and made the deepest postseason run in school history.Over the last four seasons, only two Division I teams have a better winning percentage than San Diego State at 82.8% — Gonzaga (91.0%) and Houston (84.1%). It's a sterling resume that hasn't elicited much national attention until now.“I said before the year our plan is to make it to a Final Four, to win a national championship, so we can't act surprised we're sitting up here,"" Dutcher said. “This is what the goal has been.""How did the Aztecs reach this point?Playing perfect complementary roles, for starters.Trammell is the playmaking guard who was an all-conference defender at Seattle. Adam Seiko is the thick, gritty guard who prides himself on being a fearless 3-point shooter and a strong defender with 118 career wins.Forwards Keshad Johnson, Jaedon LeDee and Arop provide the brawn and skill in the post against beefier, more touted opponents, and at 6-foot-10 and 230 pounds, Nathan Mensah is second on the school's career blocks list (231).Then there's Bradley, the Mountain West tourney MVP and first-team all-league selection. He's one of the nation's most prolific active scorers with 2,294 points but had just six points on 2-of-9 shooting against the Crimson Tide.“Anybody who appreciates basketball understands how good San Diego State is,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. “They play a brand of basketball that's built on toughness, built on intelligence. They don't take many bad shots and they're very physical when the ball goes up.""Building that culture requires more than just vision or commitment. It takes patience, a trait lacking at many schools and among many fan bases.Nobody can quibble with the results, not even the 2019-20 team that was in line for a top-two seed and may have been Dutcher's best team. The oldest players have not forgotten how the COVID-19 pandemic derailed that potential Final Four run and now they're playing just as much for those seniors as they are to fulfill their own aspirations.“I felt bad for the seniors that didn't have this, the opportunity that went by them,” Mensah said. “I feel like now we are here, trying to represent them also, make them feel proud of what we have accomplished and what we are capable of doing in this tournament.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846927,F1: Court fines Piquet for racist Lewis Hamilton comments,"Retired three-time Formula 1 world champion Nelson Piquet was fined 5 million Brazilian reals (roughly $950,000 or €890,000) for using racist derogatory language to describe British driver Lewis Hamilton in a 2021 intterview.He had also used racist and homophobic language describing Hamilton in another interview.The court in Brasilia handed down its verdict late on Friday.It ordered Piquet pay the sum ""in collective moral damages, to be allocated to funds for the promotion of racial equality and against discrimination of the LGBTQIA+ community.""Several human rights groups including Brazil's National LGBT+ Alliance had brought the civil case, arguing Piquet's comments had violated the norms of human dignity as described in Brazil's constitution.The judge said Piquet's comments matched the definition of racial discrimination put forward in a 2010 statute.Piquet later apologized for the comments, which courted international criticism.In a statement, he said he regretted using the ""ill thought-out"" racial term but said it was ""one that has widely and historically been used colloquially in Brazilian Portuguese as a synonym for 'guy' or 'person' and was never intended to offend.""Judge Pedro Matos de Arruda said that ""subtletly is one of the characteristics of contemporary Brazilian racism"" and that the word is ""not an affectionate nickname,"" when explaining his decision.In a separate allegation of using homophobic language in his bid to explain why he thought Hamilton had lost the 2016 world championship to Nico Rosberg, the judge said Piquet had implied that if Hamilton had not been gay, ""he would have won the championship. Therefore being gay would be a negative characteristic.""Hamilton has never said anything to indicate he is gay, but Piquet has a track record of calling people he dislikes homosexuals.Piquet was discussing a crash at the 2021 British Grand Prix between Hamilton and his championship rival that season, Max Verstappen.Verstappen, who was taken to hospital for checks after the incident but was not seriously hurt, and his Red Bull team were furious after the crash, allocating the blame to Hamilton. Piquet felt the same.Hamilton received a 10-second stop-go penalty for causing the collision — a fairly severe penalty but not the toughest available — but was nevertheless able to win the race.Piquet's daughter Kelly is Verstappen's girlfriend and the pair had comparatively recently made their relationship public at the time.Hamilton responded by condemning the ""archaic mindests"" on show and said he had been ""surrounded by these attitudes and targeted [my] whole life.""Hamilton, currently the only Black F1 driver and someone who often professes his admiration for the next Brazilian F1 champion after Piquet, Ayrton Senna, was given honorary Brazilian citizenship last year.Piquet also had a reputation in the paddock as a prickly and difficult character, dating all the way back to his fierce animosity with his 1980s teammate at Williams, Nigel Mansell. He had serious personal run-ins, usually involving public insults, with several other drivers over the years.Contemporary rivals Senna and Piquet cast something of an unofficial dividing line in Brazil in the 1980s and 90s.Although Senna was not formally politically affiliated, his charitable endeavors working with impoverished children and repeated appeals for work to bridge the gap between the wealthy elite he hailed from and Brazil's poor stood in sharp contrast to Piquet's more hard-nosed opinions.Piquet would often describe Senna, who was single or in a relationship kept out of the public eye for much of his career, using homophobic slurs.He's become a polarizing figure in modern Brazilian politics, too, and faced criticism for donating around $100,000 to former President Jair Bolsonaro's failed re-election campaign last year.Piquet claimed it was the first time in his life he'd become truly partisan on the question of a national election. He was one of several prominent sports stars, past and present, whose support Bolsonaro courted.In November, the human rights commission in Brazil's senate recommended Piquet face another legal investigation for comments released in a social media video soon after President Luiz Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva's election, in which Piquet said he wished to see Lula ""in a cemetery."" The video appeared to have been recorded while Piquet was taking part in a pro-Bolsonaro demonstration against Lula's narrow election victory.msh/ar (AFP, AP)",2023/03/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846928,Flick's fringe players make case as Germany beat Peru,"In the modest setting of Mainz, hosting only its third ever men's national team game, a similarly modest opponent, Peru, gave Germany the chance to take risks. Some of which were rewarded.A first-half brace from Niclas Füllkrug sealed a comfortable 2-0 win in Germany's first match after their failed World Cup campaign. But crucially, Hansi Flick's team, at times, showed an intensity and energy which has been lacking during the coach's tenure.In the absence of star names such as Thomas Müller, Ilkay Gündogan and Jamal Musiala, supporters saw some of the squad's fringe players inject some much-needed life into a previously lackluster attack.Flick called up six new players to his squad for this first of a run of friendlies ahead of Euro 2024. Having previously crashed out of the Nations League, Germany are left with no competitive fixtures before they host the tournament.However, the only new face to start was Dortmund right wingback Marius Wolf who, along with David Raum on the opposite flank, pushed up to great effect, winning possession and harrying the opposition. The rangy former winger was rewarded with an assist, as his dynamism and overlapping runs perfectly complimented Germany’s narrow roaming attacking midfielders.In his postmatch press conference, Flick praised Wolf, whose whipped low cross set up Füllkrug's second. The forward was certainly grateful: ""I don't know if I can get him nice cold drink as we're playing again in two days,"" Füllkrug said. ""The move for the second goal shows what we've been working on in training. I tried to hold the center back to give Kai space. Marius and I have been talking about that sort of delivery ahead of the game. He plays it perfectly and I have the perfect timing.""The Werder Bremen striker once again made his case for leading the line. The 30-year-old was a surprise call-up to the Qatar World Cup, but was woefully underused despite scoring two goals. ""I always get my opportunities in the box here and get the service. I'm well integrated into the system now,"" Füllkrug told German broadcaster ZDF after the match.The most interesting role was played by Emre Can, who was playing for Germany under Flick for the first time. The coach has dabbled with a back three during his tenure, mainly sticking to a 4-2-3-1. But he used this occasion to field a 4-2-2-2 formation, in which Can fluidly moved between a central midfield role and the heart of defense to form a back three when needed.Meanwhile, Germany's attack was set off its leash, with players showing an eagerness to move off the ball and switch positions which has been a rare sight during Flick's tenure. The team looked more disjointed later on as a barrage of second half substitutions upset their rhythm, but for Flick there is a clear lesson to be learned.At Bayern Munich, he relied on star power to secure a boat load of titles. Now he would be well advised to focus on the fringe players best suited to this glimpse of a free-flowing and energetic playing style.Further debutants Mergim Berisha and Kevin Schade are unlikely to break into the starting eleven. But Flick went into the World Cup not knowing his best team, a mistake he cannot repeat at the Euros. Along with the usual suspects, he has a chance to put his trust in a selection of outsiders who may lack clout but could turn Germany into a well-oiled machine.A friendly match against Peru is hardly the litmus test that will determine the future of this team. The opposition, a 21st-ranked team which missed out on the 2022 Qatar World Cup, rarely threatened and couldn't capitalize on its opponents', at times, sloppy play.However, the setting of Mainz with its humble Bundesliga club could serve as an inspiration. In modest surroundings, Germany showed bravery, intensity and a willingness to take risks. Qualities much needed to galvanize success starved supporters ahead of a home tournament.Edited by: Matt Pearson",2023/03/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846929,"Creighton, San Diego State each aim to reach 1st Final Four","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Creighton and San Diego State have dreamed of being in this situation for years. And it's not the first time each team has stood in the other's way.The sixth-seeded Bluejays and the fifth-seeded Aztecs are each seeking their first Final Four when they meet in Sunday's South Region final. Last year, they met much earlier in the NCAA Tournament — Creighton won 72-69 in overtime in the first round.“It was a game they really controlled for 37 minutes, and then we had an incredible run at the end to get it to overtime and found a way to win it,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said Saturday. “So, besides a trip to the Final Four on the line, I’m sure they’ve been looking forward to this game as well.”The Bluejays were one of the final eight teams in the tournament once before, in 1941, but it wasn't called the Elite Eight at the time because, well, there were only eight teams in the entire event.After Friday's 86-75 win over No. 15 Princeton, the Bluejays (24-12) can truly be called Elite.All San Diego State (31-6) had to do to advance was beat No. 1 overall seed Alabama.The veteran-laden Aztecs are the first Mountain West Conference team to reach a regional final and believe they have more to prove after ousting the Crimson Tide.“Nobody ever believes when you set big goals,” San Diego State forward Jaedon LeDee said after the game. “We believe, and that’s why we’re in the position we are, and just keep pushing.”The teams have been together once since last year's first-round thriller. They shared a round-trip flight to Hawaii for the Maui Invitational last fall. But only one of them will be flying to Houston for the Final Four.ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTSan Diego State’s physical defense held the Crimson Tide to 32% shooting, blocked eight shots and made nine steals. On the other hand, the Aztecs shot just 38%, were outrebounded 52-48 and missed nine of 22 free throws against Alabama.“That can be really costly in March for sure,” guard Darrion Trammell said. “But just staying consistent and running our offense, playing multiple sides, is something we can definitely work on. Make teams guard us on both sides of the floor to help our efficiency on offense is something that can take a step forward.”SIBLING MATCHUPThe game pits Creighton sophomore forward Arthur Kaluma against brother Adam Seiko, a San Diego State senior guard. Kaluma described the upcoming meeting as a “surreal experience,” adding that both have come a long way since their previous meeting.“He plays pretty good defense,” Kaluma said. “He is a good shooter. We can run him off the line, force him to take some tough 2s. Just try to contain him, you know, make sure he doesn’t get no open looks.”OPPOSITE STRENGTHSCreighton entered Friday’s Sweet 16 game against Princeton ranked 41st nationally in shooting at 47%. The Bluejays shot 58.2% to overwhelm the Tigers.San Diego State ranks 36th in field-goal defense at 41% and its last three opponents haven't topped 32% from the floor.“They obviously just play really, really physical, and that can make up for some height at times,” 7-foot-1 Creighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner said of the Aztecs. “Going into a game like that, you just have got to know what you are getting yourself into and don’t be surprised when they hit you really hard or try to be super physical with you.”MORE TO ACHIEVEAsked about earning his 300th victory with Creighton on Friday night, McDermott acknowledged all the steps to the milestone before quickly downplaying it.“It’s 301 I’m worried about right now,” he said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846930,Toffoli’s 2-goal effort leads Flames in 5-3 win over Sharks,"CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Led offensively by two guys with Stanley Cup rings, the Calgary Flames kept their faint playoff hopes alive on Saturday.Tyler Toffoli scored two goals and Nazem Kadri notched the game-winner as the Flames won 5-3 over the San Jose Sharks to climb two points closer to a playoff berth.“They’re a desperate team, they have some skill. And obviously with (Erik) Karlsson on the back end, he can take over games, and I thought we did a good job sticking together and finding a way to win,” said Toffoli, whose 31 goals equals a career high.Combined with Winnipeg’s 4-1 loss to Los Angeles, the Flames moved to within four points of the Jets, who occupy the final wild-card spot in the Western Conference. Both teams have eight games remaining including one head-to-head.“We can’t really worry about what other people are thinking,” Toffoli said. “We just have to win every game we can, and every game we win keeps us in it and gives us a chance.”Toffoli played for Flame coach Darryl Sutter in 2014 when he was the coach of the Stanley Cup-winning Los Angeles Kings.“He’s a winner,” said Sutter. “Can’t teach it, thankful to have him.”Kadri won his Stanley Cup last season with Colorado.“Ideally you want to find yourself to not be in this position this late in the season,” Kadri said. “But it’s hard to win in months like these leading up to the playoffs and we’ve given ourselves a chance so that’s really all that matters.”MacKenzie Weegar and Walker Duehr added the others for Calgary, which won for just the second time in its last nine games at the Saddledome (2-5-2). Jacob Markstrom made 28 saves.Logan Couture, Nico Sturm and Martin Kaut replied for San Jose, which had its winless skid extended to nine games (0-6-3). Kaapo Kahkonen had 25 stops.“Losing sucks,” said Couture. “Tonight was one of our better efforts. We’re realistic in here. We know where we’re at. We lost a bunch of guys at the deadline. We moved out six or seven of our full-time players. I liked our compete. We fought to the end. We can be proud of that.”Karlsson’s two assists helped him reach 68 on the year to surpass his previous career-high of 66 in 2015-16 and break the Sharks record for helpers by a defenseman. Brent Burns previously held it with 67 in 2018-19.“We just want to come every day and work hard and make the most out of a bad situation,” said Karlsson. “Today everybody showed up and we tried to play the way we need to to be competitive and I think we were for the most part of 60 minutes.”Tied at 3, Kadri scored the go-ahead goal 5:45 into the third period. He banged in a rebound from the side of the net after Kahkonen stopped Milan Lucic and Duehr. It was Kadri’s second goal in as many games after a 16-game goal drought.Toffoli put the game away scoring his team-leading 31st of the season into an empty-net with 1:10 remaining.MILESTONE FOR BACKLUNDMikael Backlund played in his 900th career game Saturday. A first-round pick by the Flames in 2007, the 34-year-old center is third on the franchise’s all-time games played list behind Jarome Iginla (1,219) and Mark Giordano (949).BLUELINE SHUFFLEThe Sharks made two changes on the blue line welcoming back Matt Benning (undisclosed) and Jacob MacDonald (upper body) from injuries that had sidelined them for one and nine games, respectively.UP NEXTSharks: Host Winnipeg Jets on Tuesday.Flames: Host Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday in finale of a three-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846931,Collins leads deep Hawks attack in 143-130 win over Pacers,"ATLANTA (AP) — John Collins led eight Atlanta scorers in double figures with 21 points and the Hawks' overcame Jordan Nwora's season-high 33 points to beat the Indiana Pacers 143-130 on Saturday.The Hawks set a season scoring high despite the loss of Trae Young, who was ejected in the third quarter. Four Atlanta backups scored in double figures, led by Saddiq Bey with 18 points.“Our bench was unbelievable,” said Hawks coach Quin Snyder, who added the backups “raised the level of competitiveness in the game.”Dejounte Murray had 20 points in his return after missing two games with a non-COVID illness. Bogdan Bogdanovic, who had nine points, just missed giving the Hawks a ninth player in double figures.That's bad news for Indiana's defense.“We gave up well over 30 a quarter,” said Pacers coach Rick Carlisle, who added that playing without starting center Myles Turner, who was held out with a sore lower back, was a factor.“But it's not an excuse,” he said. ""We've got to be better than that.”The Hawks (37-37) protected their shaky hold on the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference playoff standings. They began the day a half-game ahead of No. 9 Toronto and one game ahead of No. 10 Chicago in the tight competition for position in the play-in tournament.Young was ejected after firing an unusually hard pass to referee Scott Wall during a timeout. Wall caught the ball. Young was immediately called for a technical foul and ejected.“It's just a play he can't make,” Snyder said. “I told him that. He knows it.”Only seconds earlier, Young had an apparent 3-pointer disallowed when he was called for a technical foul for sticking out his leg and tripping Aaron Nesmith. The technical foul was Young’s 15th of the season. A 16th technical foul results in an automatic one-game suspension.Young had 14 points and five assists.The game was tied at 84 when Young was ejected. The Hawks outscored the Pacers 21-14 the remainder of the period for a 105-98 lead.Nwora, a second-year player, was acquired by Indiana from Milwaukee as part of a four-team trade on Feb. 9. He scored 21 points for the Bucks against Cleveland on Nov. 16 for his previous season high and topped that with 25 points in just the second quarter against Atlanta.Nwora's scoring outburst led the Pacers to 39 points in the quarter for a 74-72 halftime lead.Tyrese Haliburton scored 19 points and Buddy Hield had 16 for Indiana.NWORA'S BIG GAMECarlisle said it wasn't a complete surprise to see Nowra break out with his big game.“He has the ability to get going,” Carlisle said. “We saw it when he was with Milwaukee against us. ... The thing I loved is he did it in the most efficient way. ... He's got the touch and he's got the range. He's a good player.”Nwora, a 6-foot-9 forward from Louisville, started in four of his first 16 games with Indiana but came off the bench against Atlanta. He nailed a 3-pointer to open the third quarter and kept shooting, making 9 of 11 shots and four of four free throws in the period.A BRIEF TOUCH OF DEFENSEThere was a brief display of defense in the third quarter, when the Hawks outscored the Pacers 33-24. It was the only period in which both teams did not score more than 30 points.“I think we just executed the game plan,” said Murray of the defense in the period.TIP-INSPacers: F Isaiah Jackson scored 14 points with five rebounds and three steals as the fill-in for Turner. ... G Chris Duarte (left ankle) played only 5 minutes after missing five consecutive games. ... Haliburton (right ankle) and F Bennedict Mathurin (right ankle) started after being listed as questionable. ... Nwora's career high is 34 points for the Bucks at Chicago on May 16, 2021.Hawks: Clint Capela had 17 points and 17 rebounds. ... G De'Andre Hunter (left knee contusion) did not play. ...

The rest of the field settled behind, setting up a sprint to the finish around the final turn, during which Kingsbarns pulled away comfortably to remain unbeaten in three races.“The horse jumped pretty well out of the gate and was able to get himself into the lead right away,"" Prat said. ""From that point, we were able to get a pretty soft pace and he was really comfortable, in a good rhythm, breathing well.""He sprinted home really well,” Prat added.A 9-2 second favorite in the field of 12, Kingsbarns paid $11 to win.The result virtually assures the 3-year-old colt a spot in the 20-horse field for the Kentucky Derby on May 6.Kingsbarns made it five career Louisiana Derby wins for Pletcher, who already has the early Kentucky Derby favorite in Forte, winner of the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream. Forte is set to race again in next weekend’s Florida Derby.Disarm, which went off at 7-1, charged through the field late to finish second and Jace’s Road, at 6-1 odds, was another two lengths back in third after challenging for the lead from the first turn until the beginning of the homestretch.Disarm earned 40 points for the Kentucky Derby, likely enough to make the field.

(AP) — Ryan Hartman scored with 1:11 remaining in the third period and the Minnesota Wild beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 on Saturday.Ryan Reaves and Frederick Gaudreau also scored for Minnesota, and Filip Gustavsson made 22 saves in goal.The Wild have points in four straight after their franchise-record 14-game point streak was snapped on March 18. Minnesota started the day a point behind Dallas, which hosts Vancouver, for the lead in the Central Division.“This is a game we should win,” Gustavsson said. “That’s what we said before, these two points are our points if we don’t play the wrong way. It was tight out there today. It didn’t feel like we really had the speed in the first period and it was kind of slow. We got a goal and we tried to ride it out, but they scored 1-1. And then Hartsy bailed us out today.”Lukas Reichel scored for Chicago, which has lost four in a row. Former Minnesota goaltender Alex Stalock made 22 saves for the Blackhawks. Chicago is 3-9-2 since trading star Patrick Kane to the New York Rangers.“Yeah, I thought the guys skated really hard,” Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. “Disappointing that they didn’t get at least a point, get to overtime. But you know, it was just an unfortunate bounce to the end. I think right from the start we played really in their way and frustrated them quite a bit.”Without leading scorer Kirill Kaprizov, the Wild has gotten scoring from unexpected spots, including Reaves, the big enforcer who was acquired from the Rangers in November. He has four goals in the past seven games and five for the season.“Just knowing that he’s out, I think everybody knows we’ve got to contribute a little bit more,” Reaves said. “I think it’s going to help us going to the playoffs that up and down the lineup we can contribute. It doesn’t all just have to rest on his shoulders.”A slow start by both teams in the rare afternoon contest turned Minnesota’s way midway through the second period when Reaves used a backhand wraparound to open the scoring, with the puck deflecting off Stalock’s pads and then a skate into the goal.Reichel scored his fourth goal in 26 games in his rookie season 1:15 into the third period.Chicago had been outscored 11-1 in two previous losses.“That’s too many goals we give up,” Reichel said. “So it was good that we, I mean, not good, but two goals that we give up, it was better in the D-zone. In our case, we got to move on and maybe learn how to win those games.”Hartman broke the tie late with his 13th goal and Gaudreau added an empty-net goal for his 14th tally of the season.“Personally, I think (last game against Philadelphia) was one of, at least, my worst game of the year and I think, to be honest, I followed it up with my second worst,” Hartman said. “Obviously the ending was great, so I’m not going to dwell on it too long. But, I’d like to get going a little bit more here.”The Wild have won eight straight games against Chicago, their former playoff nemesis.BACKSTOPPINGOne reason for Minnesota’s surge has been the goaltending of Gustavsson and Marc-Andre Fleury.Gustavsson has been a surprise all season while ranking second in the NHL in goals-against average (2.01) and save percentage (.932) among qualifying goaltenders entering the day.

The Sabres remained six points behind Pittsburgh for the final wild card in the tightly-contested Eastern Conference playoff race after the Penguins beat Washington later Saturday night.“It was a very mature game, I thought from us,” Okposo said. “We played the game that needed to be played today and we didn’t get frustrated. We just continued to play our game. We didn’t get sucked into trying to make too many plays or taking things that weren’t there. That’s obviously a very frustrating team to play against, they know how to win, they know how to lock it down. We just did a great job staying patient.”Semyon Varlamov finished with 33 saves for New York, which lost its second straight. The Islanders had won 11 straight at home against the Sabres.Comrie made a key third-period save with a stellar right-pad stop on Pierre Engvall from in close to keep the game scoreless midway through the final period.“I found his stick blade early and saw that he is on his backhand,” Comrie said. “He’s either going to try and chip it really fast or pull it. I saw his left shoulder dip and knew he was going to pull it (to his forehand).”Okposo opened the scoring with 6:29 left as he notched his 10th of the season. Islanders defenseman Scott Mayfield failed to clear the puck and Buffalo capitalized. Sabres defenseman Ilya Lyubushkin sent a fluttering puck across the slot and Okposo controlled the pass and fired a wrist shot past Varlamov’s right pad, off the post and in.Okposo spent the first nine years of his NHL career with the Islanders before signing a seven-year $42 million contract with the Sabres in the summer of 2016.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846936,Allmendinger beats Byron to Xfinity road course win at COTA,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A.J. Allmendinger dominated early, then had to fight to retake the lead at the start of the final stage to earn his 11th career NASCAR Xfinity series road course victory Saturday at the Circuit of the Americas.Allmendinger bumped Sheldon Creed out of the lead with 14 laps to go, then held off William Byron over the next couple of laps before pulling away late for the victory, his second in a row at the Texas track. Byron will be starting Sunday's NASCAR Cup series race from the pole position.“I spent a lot of years not winning anything, so I’m going to celebrate everything like its my last one, because you never know,” the 41-year-old Allmendinger said. “We fought hard.”Allmendinger and Kaulig Racing had the dominant car for much of the race and started Saturday from the pole. He built a big lead early before a pit stop strategy misstep and getting caught in some caution flag restart traffic dropped him to the back.“I feel like I'm on vacation,” Allmendinger told his garage in an early radio message as he steadily pulled away from the pack in the first stage.The race got much harder from there.With NASCAR running a new format that doesn't have breaks at the end of the road course race stages, Allmendinger pitted from the front. That dropped him to 27th and turned a 3.5-second lead into deficit of about 37 seconds. He then got stuck in the pack on a restart, one of four in stage two, and the car in front of him got bumped and spun around, forcing Allmendinger into a complete stop.“I wasn't sure how the race was going to play out,” Allmendinger said. “I knew we had a really fast car, it was about getting back up there.”Creed won the second stage, giving the Richard Childress driver a chance to race for his first career Xfinity series win. But another restart saw Allmendinger launch from sixth to second and right on Creed's bumper.With those two battling for the lead and Byron waiting behind them for an opening, Allmendinger tagged Creed's left rear wheel and pushed him sideways. Creed fought back to finish ninth.“He turned. I was trying to stay off him. I hate that happened,"" Allmendinger said. “(Creed) has all the right to be mad ... It's the way it goes. It's not they way I wanted to take the lead.""Creed noted Allmendinger had the speed to eventually pass him, but was frustrated by the contact that cost him a podium.“I don’t know if I had his pace in the long run,” Creed said. “I thought I gave him enough room, but I don’t know. I need to watch it.”Byron, who will have a chance to grab yet another Cup series win for Hendrick Motorsports on Sunday, pushed Allmendinger until the last two laps, before a wobble through the track's S-curves forced him to pull back for second.“I was getting one final run at him,” Byron said. “He’s just so good on these road courses.”Ty Gibbs finished third for Joe Gibbs Racing. Austin Hill, who won at Daytona, Las Vegas and Atlanta, for the Richard Childress, retired early after reporting gear change problems in the opening laps.UP NEXTThe series moves to short track racing next Saturday at Richmond Raceway in Richmond, Virginia.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World

(AP) — Patrick Kane scored the tiebreaking goal early in the third period as the New York Rangers rallied from two goals down to beat the Florida Panthers 4-3 on Saturday.Kaapo Kakko, Alexis Lafreniere and Filip Chytil each had a goal and an assist to help New York win for the eighth time in 10 games. Jaroslav Halak stopped 31 shots to snap a four-game skid (0-2-2) and get his first win since Feb. 11 at Carolina.The Rangers trailed 2-0 after one period while getting outshot 12-3. They picked it up in the second and scored four straight goals.“Three shots in the first was not good enough but we were here for a day and a half with no ice, no morning skate,’’ New York coach Gerard Gallant said. “It was a tough start for us, but after that, I thought we played well.”Aleksander Barkov had two goals and Ryan Lomberg also scored for Florida, which has lost three straight and dropped three points behind Pittsburgh for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference after the Penguins beat Washington later Saturday night. Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 38 saves.Barkov got things started for the Panthers, following up a loose puck and sweeping it past Halak at 9:15 of the opening period.Lomberg picked up his 11th goal of the season on a shot from the left circle with 5:14 left in the first.The Rangers picked up their game in the second, outshooting Florida 21-8 and tying the score.“They took over,” Barkov said. “Playing against good teams, they're going to have their momentums and stuff. They played well in the second period and third period they defended well. They didn't give us that much. ... Now we have to regroup and move on.”New York scored on its 11th shot of the period at 8:50 as Kakko got behind the Florida defense and put in a rebound for his 14th.Lafreniere tied the score at 2 with 1:45 remaining in the second as he walked in on Bobrovsky and scored his 15th.The Rangers had their first lead 1:22 into the third when Kane fired off a long shot that caught the stick of Florida forward Carter Verhagehe and went past Bobrovsky. It was Kane's 20th of the season and gave him four goals and eight points in 12 games since being acquired from Chicago before the trade deadline.For Kane, it was his 450th career goal.“I think if you play long enough, sometimes you reach these milestones, so obviously not the prettiest one, but i'll take it,"" Kane said.Chytil made it 4-2 nearly five minutes later with his 21st as all three players on the Kid Line got on the scoreboard.“All three played real well and when they play like that, it is pretty exciting,’’ Gallant said. “They attacked and were a big part of our win. They were excellent, were confidence and that is great to see.”Chytil agreed, adding: “Our line, if felt great today. I think we're playing good consistently the whole season. Sometimes there's a game we have so many chances and it doesn't go in, and today we score three important goals. I'm very happy for all three of us.”The Panthers cut their deficit to a goal at the seven-minute mark as Barkov scored off a pass from Sam Reinhart for his second of the night and 20th of the season.NOTESThe Panthers continue to be without C Sam Bennett as he has missed the past three games. Bennett left a game in Detroit in the third period on Monday night and has not played since. ... Barkov played in his 655th NHL game, pulling into second place for most played in franchise history behind former linemate Jonathan Huberdeau (671).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846954,Back home: Bobby Wagner returning to Seahawks on 1-year deal,"SEATTLE (AP) — Bobby Wagner is headed back to the Seattle Seahawks to rejoin the team with which he became one of the top linebackers in the NFL.The team announced Wagner's return Saturday night, filling a major need on Seattle's remodeled defense. It's a one-year contract, according to a person who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the team didn't announce terms.“BOBBY. IS. BACK,” the Seahawks posted on their Twitter account. “We’ve agreed to terms with the future Hall of Famer.”Seattle teammates Quandre Diggs and Tyler Lockett first broke the news on Twitter, and NFL Network and ESPN said the deal was worth up to $7 million.“Glad to be back in Seattle! It means a lot to be able to come back!” Wagner tweeted.Wagner spent the first 10 seasons of his career with the Seahawks after being selected in the second round of the 2012 draft by Seattle. He became a six-time first-team All-Pro selection during his tenure in Seattle, where he was regularly regarded as one of the best middle linebackers in the league.Wagner was released by Seattle just over a year ago in a salary cap move. Wagner was due nearly $17 million and Seattle wanted to give Jordyn Brooks the opportunity to step into the middle linebacker role.But Brooks suffered a torn ACL late last season and is expected to miss a significant chunk of the 2023 season. Seattle signed Devin Bush to a one-year deal earlier in free agency, but still needed additional answers.Enter Wagner, who was a second-team All-Pro selection last season playing for his hometown Los Angeles Rams. Wagner started all 17 games and had 140 tackles for the Rams, but was let go by the Rams earlier this offseason with Los Angeles entering a rebuild phase.Wagner is the latest addition to what will be a significantly altered defense in Seattle. The Seahawks have already signed Bush, defensive tackle Dre'Mont Jones and Jarran Reed, and safety Julian Love as part of their offseason makeover.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/26,,World

The Owls are the third No. 9 to get that far since seeding began in 1979.“Honestly, all the things people say just fuels us to go out there and play even harder,” said Bryan Greenlee, who scored 16 points before fouling out. “They can say whatever they want, say we're a Cinderella team, say we don't belong, but we've constantly proven people wrong all season.”Nowell, the 5-foot-8 native New Yorker — @MrNewYorkCityy on Twitter — was incredible again at Madison Square Garden, with 30 points, 12 assists and five steals. In the Sweet 16, Nowell set the NCAA Tournament record with 19 assists in an overtime win against Michigan State. He didn't get enough help this time.Nae’Qwan Tomlin was the only other player in double figures for Kansas State (26-10) with 14 points. Keyontae Johnson, the Wildcats’ leading scorer, fouled out with nine points.“Keyontae played 18 minutes, and that's why he was neutralized,” said first-year Kansas State coach Jerome Tang, who took over a team that went 14-17 last season.Martin scored 17 points, including a huge 3 down the stretch, the 7-foot-1 Vladislav Goldin had 14 points and 13 rebounds, and Michael Forrest made four clutch free throws in the final 20 seconds for the Owls, who held steady as the Wildcats made one last push.Cam Carter made a 3 from the wing with 22.8 seconds left to cut FAU’s lead to 75-74 and Kansas State sent Forrest to the line with 17.9 seconds left. The senior made both to make it a three-point game.Nowell found Tomlin inside for a layup with 8.6 seconds left to cut the lead to one again, and again K-State sent Forrest to the line. With 6.9 remaining, he made them both.With no timeouts left, Nowell rushed down the court, gave up the ball to Ismael Massoud outside the 3-point line —- and never got it back. FAU's Johnell Davis swiped it away and time ran out.“I was trying to get Ish a shot,” Nowell said. “Coach wanted Ish to set the screen, and I waved it off because I felt like on the right side of the court, that’s where Ish hits most of his shots. And they closed out hard to him, and he didn’t get his shot off.”Nowell was named the most outstanding player of the region after his final collegiate game, but FAU turned out to be the best team.“I gave my heart and soul to this university, to this team,” Nowell said. “I maximized everything I had inside of me to see these guys happy.”As the Owls built their lead in the final minutes, Kansas State fans who had packed the building became anxiously quiet and the “F-A-U!” chants started to rise.The Owls rushed the floor to celebrate a historic moment for the school. FAU didn't even have a basketball program until the late 1980s and has only been in Division I for the last 30 years.“I'm living the dream right now,” Forrest said.FAU held up to Tennessee’s bully ball in the Sweet 16 and dropped a 40-point second half on the best defense in the nation to eliminate the Southeastern Conference team.Against one of the Big 12’s best, FAU dominated the boards, 44-22, and became the first team from C-USA to to reach the Final Four since Memphis in 2008.The Owls aren’t hanging around much longer.

On Sunday, an attorney for Majors said there's evidence that he is “entirely innocent.""New York City police said that Majors, star of the recently released “Creed III"" and “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania,” was involved in a domestic dispute with a 30-year-old woman. Police responded around 11 a.m. Saturday to a 911 call inside an apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea.“The victim informed police she was assaulted,"" a spokesperson for the NYPD said in a statement. ""Officers placed the 33-year-old male into custody without incident. The victim sustained minor injuries to her head and neck and was removed to an area hospital in stable condition.”A representative for Majors denied any wrongdoing by the actor.“He has done nothing wrong,"" the representative said in an email to the AP on Saturday. ""We look forward to clearing his name and clearing this up.”On Sunday, an attorney for Majors, Priya Chaudhry, came out more forcefully, saying Majors “is provably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows"" and blamed the incident on the woman having “an emotional crisis.”Chaudhry said there was evidence clearing Majors, including “video footage from the vehicle where this episode took place, witness testimony from the driver and others who both saw and heard the episode, and most importantly, two written statements from the woman recanting these allegations.”An email seeking additional comment from the NYPD based on Chaudhry's assertions was not immediately returned Sunday.Majors was arraigned Sunday on a complaint involving misdemeanor charges for assault and aggravated harassment, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. A judge ordered Majors released on his own recognizance on Saturday night with a limited order of protection. He was scheduled to appear in court on May 8.In the meantime, the U.S. Army suspended its TV ad campaign featuring Majors that was intended to target younger audiences. The Army Enterprise Marketing Office said in a statement Sunday that the U.S. Army is “deeply concerned by the allegations surrounding his arrest.”“While Mr. Majors is innocent until proven guilty, prudence dictates that we pull our ads until the investigation into these allegations is complete,” the office said in a statement.Majors is one of the fastest rising stars in Hollywood. After breaking through in 2019's “The Last Black Man in San Francisco,” Majors has starred in “Da 5 Bloods,” “The Harder They Fall"" and last year's “Devotion.” He also stars in the recent Sundance Film Festival entry “Magazine Dreams,” which Searchlight Pictures is to release in December.",2023/03/27,138,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846958,"Virginia Tech keeps rolling in March Madness, tops Tennessee","SEATTLE (AP) — Throughout this historic season for Virginia Tech, coach Kenny Brooks has repeated the belief that Elizabeth Kitley is the best player for the Hokies, but Georgia Amoore is the most important.It was proven again Saturday with Amoore carrying Virginia Tech to a level it’s never reached before in program history.Amoore scored a career-high 29 points and the top-seeded Hokies advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time in school history with a 73-64 win over No. 4 seed Tennessee.“I just want to win. All we have to do is keep winning to get people to talk about us, so we’ll keep trying to win,” Amoore said.The Hokies (30-4) won their 14th straight game overall and advanced to a matchup with No. 3 seed Ohio State in the Seattle 3 Regional final on Monday night. Ohio State topped UConn in the first semifinal, ending the Huskies’ streak of 14 straight Final Four appearances.Amoore and the Hokies used a dominant stretch spanning the end of the second quarter and beginning of the third that built enough of a cushion to hold off Tennessee’s valiant rally over the final 12 minutes.Amoore attempted 19 3-pointers in the Hokies’ second-round win, but shot only 14 this time around.“She’s only doing now what we see all the time. When the kids have to go out and guard her, they really tighten up their shoestrings because they know that there’s something that can happen,” Brooks said. “But she’s phenomenal. She’s as good as anybody in the country, in my opinion. She’s playing with the utmost confidence and she’s been playing like this ever since we really started this stretch.”Kayana Traylor added 14 points and Kitley scored 12 points despite sitting a big chunk of the first half with foul trouble. The ACC Tournament champions had reached the Sweet 16 only once previously in school history and are now one win away from the Final Four.“I’m just so happy that I landed at such an amazing spot where we did exactly what we wanted to,"" Kitley said. ""And it hasn’t been easy and it’s taken coach Brooks a few years, but what he’s done with the program and the amount of time is incredible.”Jordan Horston led Tennessee (25-12) with 17 points. Rickea Jackson scored 15 and Jordan Walker added 12.The Lady Vols reached the regional semifinals for the second straight season, but haven’t been to the Elite Eight since 2016. And it was their offense that was so impressive in the first two rounds that disappeared against the Hokies.“I felt like we were locked in and focused before the game. We had good energy in warmup, so nothing with that. But we just were a little stagnant on the offensive end,” Walker said.The Lady Vols scored 95 points in their first-round win over Saint Louis and followed up with 94 in an impressive blowout of Toledo. But Tennessee relied too much on perimeter shots early on, to the point coach Kellie Harper yelled at her team “who are we?” after attempting their 12th 3-pointer of the first half.Tennessee made just 3 of 17 attempts from beyond the arc against the Hokies after making 11 of 22 in the win over Toledo.“They did a good job with our first attack and we got really impatient,” Harper said. ""I thought we were really stagnant offensively, and therefore we were settling. We took way too many threes for us in the first half.”The Hokies closed the first half with a flourish, scoring the final eight points to take a 35-22 lead at the break. Amoore started the second half with her fourth 3-pointer of the game and Kitley scored on the interior and quickly a five-point game ballooned to a 40-22 Virginia Tech lead.Tennessee trimmed the deficit to nine by the end of the third quarter and its surge continued into the fourth quarter. The Lady Vols capped the 19-4 run with Jasmine Powell’s 3-pointer with 6:05 left and pulled with 53-52.But turnovers and fouls started to mount and for the Lady Vols and Virginia Tech pushed its lead back to 11 on Amoore’s jumper with 2:10 remaining.“It was a challenge. I’m glad we pulled away from it,” Amoore said. “It’s what we’re going to see with Ohio State with their press. Glad we got a little taste of it today. Now we know.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846970,Honduras establishes ties with China after Taiwan break,"BEIJING (AP) — Honduras established diplomatic ties with China on Sunday after breaking off relations with Taiwan, which is increasingly isolated and now recognized by only 13 sovereign states.Foreign ministers from China and Honduras signed a joint communique in Beijing — a decision the Chinese Foreign Ministry hailed as “the right choice.""The diplomatic victory for China comes as tensions rise between Beijing and the United States, including over China’s increasing assertiveness toward self-ruled Taiwan, and signals growing Chinese influence in Latin America. The new China-Honduras relationship was announced after the Honduran and Taiwanese governments made separate announcements that they were severing ties.China and Taiwan have been locked in a battle for diplomatic recognition since they split amid civil war in 1949, with Beijing spending billions to win recognition for its “one China” policy.China claims Taiwan is part of its territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, and refuses most contacts with countries that maintain formal ties with the island democracy. It threatens retaliation against countries merely for increasing contacts.China's Foreign Minister Qin Gang said the establishment of ties proved that adhering to “one China” policy is winning people's hearts and is “the general trend.""“We inform sternly the Taiwan authorities that engaging in separatist activities for Taiwan independence is against the will and interests of the Chinese nation and against the trend of history, and is doomed to a dead end,” he said.The Honduran Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Twitter that its government recognizes “only one China in the world” and that Beijing “is the only legitimate government that represents all of China.”It added that “Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and as of today, the Honduran government has informed Taiwan of the severance of diplomatic relations, pledging not to have any official relationship or contact with Taiwan.”Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told a news conference Sunday that Taiwan had ended its relations with Honduras to “safeguard its sovereignty and dignity.""Wu said that Honduran President Xiomara Castro and her team always had a “fantasy” about China and had raised the issue of switching ties before the presidential election in Honduras in 2021. Relations between Taiwan and Honduras were once stable, he said, but China had not stopped luring Honduras.Honduras had asked Taiwan for billions of dollars of aid and compared its proposals with China's, Wu said. About two weeks ago, the Honduran government sought $2.45 billion from Taiwan to build a hospital and a dam, and to write off debts, he added.“The Castro government dismissed our nation's longstanding assistance and relations and carried out talks to form diplomatic ties with China. Our government feels pained and regretful,” he said.Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said her government would not “engage in a meaningless contest of dollar diplomacy with China.”“Over these past few years, China has persistently used various means to suppress Taiwan’s international participation, escalate military intrusion, and disrupt peace and stability in the region,” she said in a recorded video.Her office spokesperson Olivia Lin said in a statement that relations between the sides had lasted for more than 80 years.Analysts have warned over the implications of the newly formed ties between China and Honduras. Political analyst Graco Pérez in Honduras said Beijing's narrative would highlight the benefits, including investment and job creation, “but that is all going to be illusory.""Pérez noted that some other countries have established such relations, but “it didn’t turn out to be what had been offered.”For decades China has funneled billions of dollars into investment and infrastructure projects across Latin America. That investment has translated to rising power for China and a growing number of allies.In Honduras, it has come in the form of construction of a hydroelectric dam project in central Honduras built by the Chinese company SINOHYDRO with about $300 million in Chinese government financing.Honduras is the ninth diplomatic ally that Taipei has lost to Beijing since the pro-independence Tsai first took office in May 2016.Taiwan still has ties with Belize, Paraguay and Guatemala in Latin America, and Vatican City. Most of its remaining partners are island nations in the Caribbean and South Pacific, along with Eswatini in southern Africa.Some of these diplomatic recognitions were earned through Taiwan's financial and technical aid in the 1980s and '90s following its exceptional economic growth, Lorenzo Maggiorelli, a professor at the political science and international relations department of Jorge Tadeo Lozano University in Bogotá, Colombia, wrote in his research.In 1998, Taiwan set up a $240 million aid fund for its Central American allies in a hope of retaining their support. Taiwanese businesses were also encouraged to invest in Central America to consolidate political ties, Maggiorelli wrote.Tsai is set to begin a 10-day trip on Wednesday with visits to Guatemala and Belize. Her delegation will also stop in New York and Los Angeles, Lin said last week. Taiwan's Vice Foreign Minister Alexander Yui earlier said the purpose of Tsai's trip is to highlight the island's friendship with the two Latin American countries.Wu said he did not have any evidence that the timing of the announcement was related to Tsai's trip but noted “China seems to be doing this intentionally.”Despite China’s campaign of isolation, Taiwan retains robust informal ties with more than 100 other countries, most importantly the United States. The U.S. doesn’t have diplomatic relations with Taiwan but has maintained that Taipei is an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846971,Boutier 1st at Superstition Mountain as Jutanugarn struggles,"GOLD CANYON, Ariz. (AP) — Celine Boutier of France had an eagle and six birdies in a round of 7-under 65 and moved atop the leaderboard when Moriya Jutanugarn of Thailand stumbled down the stretch in Saturday's third round of the LPGA Drive on Championship.Boutier, a 29-year-old two-time tour winner, made an eagle 3 on the par-5 second hole and added two birdies that offset a bogey at the par-3 eighth. She played the back nine in 4 under for a 16 under total and a one-stroke lead over three others heading into Sunday's final round.“I feel like I had a lot of birdie opportunities today,” she said. “I didn’t even make all of them, but I feel like because I was playing really steady and focusing on hitting good shots and having the birdie chances, I feel like I made a few.”If the opening three rounds of the tour’s first full-field event of the season are any indication, the finale should be a scramble. There are 17 golfers within three shots of the lead after nine players posted rounds of 7- to 9-under par in a birdie-filled Saturday.Boutier, whose last win came at the 2021 Shoprite Classic outside Atlantic City, New Jersey, figures she'll have to go low in the final round with the course's firm fairways and speedy greens.“There is definitely a lot of opportunities, so I think I’m going to have to shoot a pretty low score to be able to have a chance,” Boutier said.Jutanugarn (69), American Alison Lee (67) and South Korean rookie Hae Ran Ryu (64) were tied for second at 15 under.Ariya Jutanugarn of Thailand and rookie Celine Borge of Norway are another stroke back after vaulting up the leaderboard with third round 63s.Two-time major champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea carded a 4-under 68 and finished in a 12-way tie for seventh place at 13 under.Moriya Jutanugarn appeared to be taking control of the tournament in the middle of her back nine with four birdies between Nos. 11 and 15 before stumbling on the closing holes. She made bogey at the first and, after moving into the lead at 17 under with two holes remaining, made bogey out of a greenside bunker at the par-3 17th and hit her second shot into a lake that borders the left side of the closing hole. She made bogey 6 at the last, yet looked ahead.“As long as I’m still in contention, I’m pretty happy with that,” said Moriya Jutanugarn, the 2013 Rookie of the Year who has two tour wins. “I know it’s not the finish I want, but it’s still there.""Lee overcame a bogey at the third with six birdies through the rest of the round in pursuit of her first LPGA victory. The 28-year-old made the cut in 22 of her 24 events last season with a T-5 as her best finish at the Women’s Scottish Open.“I definitely have some work to do tomorrow,” Lee said. ""I know that for a fact. ... Before teeing off, I saw Amy Yang shot 9 under. I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve got a lot of work to do today.’“With that in mind, I don’t feel at ease, because like I said, I know I’m going to have to step on the gas pedal tomorrow.""Ryu built momentum through her round, making six birdies and closing with an eagle-3 at the par-5 18th. The first-year tour player hopes to draw on some of her previous experience in the final round.“I played in the final groups a lot when I played in Korea, but first time in the LPGA, so I really do feel like a rookie-rookie,” the 22-year-old said. “I’ll take each and every shot carefully tomorrow.”No. 2-ranked Nelly Korda, the highest-ranked player in the field with top-ranked Lydia Ko not competing, was at 10 under after a third-round 70. Defending champion Leona Maguire shot a 69 and was at 9 under.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846972,Biden's pick to lead FAA withdraws amid shaky Senate support,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden’s choice to run the Federal Aviation Administration has withdrawn his nomination, a setback for the administration that comes after Denver International Airport CEO Phillip Washington appeared to lack enough support in the closely divided Senate.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg confirmed Washington’s withdrawal in a tweet Saturday night, calling him “an excellent nominee” and blaming undeserved and partisan attacks.Republicans were united in opposition to Washington, calling him unqualified because of limited aviation experience. Democrats and allied independents still might have pushed the nomination through, but key senators on their side balked at supporting Biden’s pick.Washington’s fate appeared settled when Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., abruptly called off a scheduled vote last Wednesday — a sign that she lacked enough votes to move the nomination out of committee. She said some senators wanted more information about Washington.Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who was a Democrat until switching to independent in December, and moderate Democrat Jon Tester of Montana declined to say how they would have voted. A person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Sinema was holding up the nomination and had indicated her opposition. The person was not authorized to discuss the process publicly and insisted on anonymity.Before the White House announces a new nominee, it likely will want assurances of support from Sinema, Tester and other moderates.The FAA has lacked a Senate-confirmed administrator since March 2022. The agency is trying to reassure Americans that air travel is safe despite a surge in close calls between planes this year. It is also struggling with aging technology that failed in January, briefly canceling all takeoffs around the country. And it is still trying to repair its reputation after approving Boeing planes that crashed in 2018 and 2019.“The FAA needs a confirmed Administrator, and Phil Washington’s transportation & military experience made him an excellent nominee,” Buttigieg tweeted Saturday night. “The partisan attacks and procedural obstruction he has faced are undeserved, but I respect his decision to withdraw and am grateful for his service.”Washington ran transit agencies in Denver and Los Angeles, but his only aviation-related experience is serving as CEO of the Denver airport for less than two years. He has strong ties to the administration, however — he led Biden’s 2020 transition team for the Transportation Department, which includes the FAA.Biden nominated Washington last July, but he didn’t get a committee hearing for eight months. Republicans attacked his resume and seized on disclosures that his name appeared in search warrants related to a corruption investigation in Los Angeles. Washington said he did nothing wrong and had not been contacted by law enforcement.The agency is being led by an acting administrator, Billy Nolen, a pilot who has held safety jobs at three airlines and the FAA. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who led opposition to Washington, said Nolen could win bipartisan support.In a statement Saturday night, Cruz said Washington's lack of necessary experience was obvious.“Given the significant challenges facing the FAA, this wasn’t the time for an administrator who needed on-the-job training,” he said. ""The Biden administration must now quickly name someone to head the FAA who has an extensive aviation background, can earn widespread bipartisan support in the Senate, and will keep the flying public safe.” ___Koenig reported from Dallas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846973,Aho's late goal lifts Hurricanes past Maple Leafs 5-3,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Sebastian Aho scored his team-leading 32nd goal of the season with 2:26 remaining to rescue the Carolina Hurricanes in a 5-3 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday night.Aho’s goal came 32 seconds after Auston Matthews’ second goal for Toronto tied the game. Teuvo Teravainen added an empty-net goal.“We found a way,” said Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour, whose team was outshot for the first time in 14 games. “The first two games we played that team, I thought we deserved much better. (This game) we didn’t deserve that, but sometimes it evens out.”Brent Burns, Jordan Staal and Stefan Noesen also scored for Carolina, which won for the fourth time in its last eight games to maintain in first place in Metropolitan Division. Jesper Fast and Martin Necas both had two assists.Pyotr Kochetkov made 41 saves for his first victory in his last three outings. The Hurricanes relied heavily on Kochetkov, who became just the second rookie in franchise history with 41 or more saves in a victory.“They took over and we weren’t smart enough,” Aho said. “Koch-ie can’t stop all of them.”Calle Jarnkrok had Toronto’s first goal. Matt Murray made 23 saves. Reilly Morgan provided two assists. Matthews has 36 goals this season, including eight in the last nine games.Despite the outcome, it ranked high on a list of top performances for the Maple Leafs.“I find it in a lot of ways to be our best game,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. “The back half of the first period, much of the entire second and third period, I think that’s as good as we played all season.”The Maple Leafs outshot Carolina 28-12 across the last two periods.“Their world-class talent took over and we just watched it happen,” Brind’Amour said.Jarnkrok and Matthews scored eight minutes apart in the second period as Toronto erased a 2-0 deficit.Jarnkrok notched his 18th goal, including six this month. Matthews’ unassisted tally at 12:41 of the second period gave him his 35th goal of the season.Noesen’s go-ahead goal with 11:47 left in the third resulted when his wrap-around attempt was denied by Murray. But Noesen was persistent and poked the puck across the goal line.“That’s a typical Noesen goal there,” he said of his effort.SHOT CHARTSThe 44 shots on goal matched a season-high mark for the Maple Leafs. Matthews had plenty to do with that.Matthews registered nine shots on goal in the second period. He finished with 15 shots, tying the franchise single-game record.“He’s right back to being one of the most dominant players in the league,” Keefe said.The Hurricanes had no player with more than three shots.Toronto had 33 shots through two periods, marking the most for any Carolina opponent in a full game in the last 15 games.“Unless you have a goalie making saves, you’re going to be in trouble,” Brind’Amour said.GET READYIn a four-day span, the Hurricanes’ schedule calls for matchups against three of the other four top teams in the Eastern Conference.“Great teams we play in a short period of time,” Aho said. “I like it. It’s a good time of year.”The Hurricanes faced the New York Rangers on Thursday night and collide with the NHL-leading Boston Bruins on Sunday.“This is probably the toughest all year by a mile,” Brind’Amour said.NOTES: Aho has nine game-winning goals this season. … The Hurricanes have won 36 of 45 games when scoring first this season. … The Maple Leafs won the first two meetings this season, including by 5-2 on March 17 at home.UP NEXTMaple Leafs: At Nashville on Sunday.Hurricanes: Host Boston on Sunday. ___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4846974,Boeser helps Canucks top Stars 3-1,"DALLAS (AP) — Brock Boeser scored the go-ahead goal in the second period and the Vancouver Canucks held the Dallas Stars scoreless on four power plays, including one late in the third period, for a 3-1 win Saturday night.Jack Rathbone and Dakota Joshua also scored for Vancouver, which swept the three-game season series against Dallas and has won the past six meetings dating to last season. The last time the Stars beat the Canucks was Nov. 19, 2019, in Dallas.“They’re going to the playoffs, they have a great team,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said of the Stars. “It’s a good confidence builder for the guys when you can beat teams like that. I think it goes a long way with the culture.”Thatcher Demko made 25 saves, including six on Stars power plays, to help the Canucks open a three-game road trip with a victory.Ryan Suter scored the lone goal for Dallas, which closed out a 1-1-1 homestand.“I don’t know what to tell you,” Demko said of his 6-0 record in starts against the Stars. “I just try to do the same thing every game, so it’s just kind of the way it’s worked out. It’s funny that way. … I thought our (defense) eliminating second chances and boxing those guys out.”With the game tied at 1, the Canucks took control with two goals in the second period. Boeser’s goal four minutes into the period made it 2-1. Rathbone increased the lead just 1:33 later on a straightaway shot past third-stringer Matt Murray.It was Rathbone’s second NHL goal and first since May 6, 2021.Murray was giving the Stars’ Jake Oettinger a night off. Usual backup Scott Wedgewood has been injured the past month. Murray is 1-2 in his first three career starts over the past month. He saved 21 of 24 shots, including 5 of 5 on power plays against the Canucks.Stars coach Peter DeBoer defended his young goalie’s performance.“I thought Murray was fine,” he said. “You put a young guy in like that you’d like to give him some run support. That’s on us, that’s not on him. He did what he’s supposed to do.”It could have been worse for the Stars, who survived a power play that included a stretch of 5-on-3 toward the end of the second. The Canucks outshot the Stars 11-4 in the period.The Stars took a 1-0 lead on Suter’s goal from the blue line despite the Canucks controlling the action for much of the first 10 minutes, including a 5-0 advantage on shots.Vancouver tied it with a short-handed goal by Joshua with 1:30 left in the opening period. It was the 14th short-handed goal for the Canucks, the most in the NHL. Vancouver has scored 10 short-handed goals in their past 17 games.“Obviously, disappointing, for sure,” DeBoer said. “I didn’t think a lot of guys had much tonight. We still found a way to score the first goal and then we handed the momentum with the short-handed goal. We know they’re dangerous short-handed — we talked about it — and still gave one up. We didn’t execute all night.“They were the hungrier team, and that’s inexcusable this time of year for us.”STINGY CANUCKSThe Stars' Miro Heiskanen set a franchise record with 20 points — four goals, 16 assists — in his previous 12 games, but was held without a point Saturday.

Taiwan remains unbowed & continues to work as a force for good in the world.Pressure from China is leading more countries to switch allegiances and further Taiwan’s political isolation. The latest move by Honduras leaves Taiwan with 13 diplomatic allies, down from 21 in 2017.Today’s announcement comes days before Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) March 29 trip to visit Belize and Guatemala. The question was addressed by MOFA Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) at the press conference by a member of the foreign media.“I don’t have any evidence that these actions are coordinated. But the Chinese always try to thwart our diplomatic relations,” said Wu.Later, he addressed the potential of losing yet another diplomatic partner, Paraguay, which is in the midst of a competitive presidential election scheduled for April 30. Paraguay’s current president is sympathetic to Taiwan and considered an ally, though other candidates may be swayed by China.Wu noted that relations with Paraguay remain stable and a Paraguayan delegation headed by veteran Senator Blas Antonio Llano Ramos visited Taiwan last week to dispel rumors that diplomatic relations were in peril. Wu also called upon diplomatic allies to be aware of the false promises that China may offer.Wu said 61 Taiwanese nationals and family stationed in Honduras, including their family members, will leave the country or transfer to other countries as soon as possible.Despite the loss of Honduras, Wu said Taiwan has been fortunate to benefit from the support of the U.S. and other countries despite near constant pressure from China to suppress Taiwan’s international status.",2023/03/26,1875,Politics

(AP) — Jack Hughes had a goal and an assist, Mackenzie Blackwood had 25 saves and the New Jersey Devils defeated the Ottawa Senators 5-3 and clinched a playoff berth on Saturday night.“It means everything to the group. I went into the dressing room after the game and just said that I was proud of the work that was put in, proud of where we got to clinch tonight to be one of three teams that have an X next to their name,” Devils coach Lindy Ruff said. “All the work that’s been put in, the adversity they face during the year. The adversity they face right at the start of the season to where we’ve got to now.”New Jersey could have clinched its first postseason berth since 2018 with a win, but it happened before their first intermission when the Florida Panthers lost to the New York Rangers in regulation.“I had a lesser role then,” said Jesper Bratt, who was a rookie for the Devils in 2017-18. “I would say at a younger age, it’s kind of like you think that just because it happened your first year that it might happen every year. And then it goes pretty fast with reality that was not the case and you got to work extremely hard for it.“It’s a really tough league. So this feels really good. It’s been a lot of years with struggle, not winning, and it’s just awesome coming out now playing these kinds of games and getting that.”Bratt, Dawson Mercer and Dougie Hamilton scored for the Devils and Tomas Tatar scored an empty netter with 42.3 seconds left to put things away.Brady Tkachuk, Thomas Chabot and Mark Kastelic scored for the Senators and Dylan Ferguson had 30 saves.Tkachuk scored his 33rd goal of the season to give the Senators the 1-0 lead 3:14 into the first period. The Devils responded midway through the first period with Hughes’ 40th goal of the season on a breakaway, going five-hole to tie it.Nick Holden gave the puck away and Bratt scored his 31st goal of the season on the breakaway 2:24 into the second period to give New Jersey the 2-1 lead. Mercer’s 23rd of the season came just over a minute later.The Senators answered midway through the second period when Thomas Chabot scored his 11th goal of the year to cut the deficit to 3-2.

Mike Matheson had three assists and Johnathan Kovacevic had two.Harvey-Pinard, a Quebec native received a standing ovation following his third goal and another one after being named the first star of the game. In the dressing room, a player had covered up part of his name plate. It read: “R. Hatty-Pinard.”“Honestly, it’s tough to describe,” Harvey-Pinard said. “I had chills. I was just hearing the crowd, it was so loud. That was a good moment. I was enjoying it at 100%.”Gallagher had a few words of encourage for his young teammate.“I was trying to get him to stand up and salute the crowd,” Gallagher said with a grin. “He’s a little smarter than that, he didn’t fall for it. It was fun to see him smiling.”Sam Montembault stopped 21 shots to help Montreal win for the third time in 13 games (3-8-2).“I think we gave a good show tonight and our fans deserve it,” said Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. “I’ve been here for 15 months and I’ve always felt them behind us. Of course we’d like to be in a better spot to give them playoff hockey but to have that support is fantastic and we don’t take that for granted.”Lane Pederson and Kirill Marchenko scored for the Blue Jackets, who snapped a two-game win streak and lost for the fourth time in six games. Elvis Merzlikins was pulled late in the second period after giving up six goals on 24 shots. Michael Hutchinson came on and finished with seven saves.“I don’t even know if it was an energy thing, it’s more that we shot ourselves in the foot time and time again,” Pederson said. “Obviously, a frustrating second period and we’re chasing the rest of the game.”Harvey-Pinard scored 13 seconds into the second period as he knocked in a loose puck after Merzlikins stopped Matheson's driving backhander to put Montreal up 3-2.Harvey-Pinard then got his second of the night seven minutes later as he beat Merzlikins from the left circle.Gallagher scored in front off a pass from Jake Evans to push the lead to 5-2 with 6:52 remaining in the second period.Harvey-Pinard then completed his hat trick as he redirected a feed from Hoffman on a power play with 3:18 left in the middle period to make it 6-2. It was his 12th of the season.“The second period killed us, that’s what it was,” Columbus coach Brad Larsen said. “We didn’t skate enough, we didn’t manage the puck at all.”Merzlikins left with about three minutes remaining in the second.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847001,"Nets embarrass Heat, roll to 129-100 win, move back into 6th","MIAMI (AP) — All the Brooklyn Nets needed, coach Jacque Vaughn insisted, was one win.They got it, and made it look easy.Mikal Bridges scored 27 points, and the Nets opened the third quarter on a 31-6 run on the way to rolling past Miami 129-100 on Saturday night and leapfrogging the Heat back into the No. 6 spot in the Eastern Conference.Cam Johnson added 23 points and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 15 for the Nets (40-34), who snapped a five-game slide. They’re only a half-game up on Miami (40-35) in the race for the sixth and final guaranteed playoff berth, but swept the Heat 3-0 this season and would also own a head-to-head tiebreaker.“We had the mindset coming in that this was a playoff game,” Johnson said.Max Strus scored 23 for the Heat, all of them in the first half. Tyler Herro scored 23, Jimmy Butler had 18 and Bam Adebayo finished with 16 for the Heat. Miami was outscored 64-31 after halftime.“We have not been defending at a world-class level, the way we're capable of ... and the second half just became an avalanche,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.Strus came off the bench and made his first nine shots, one of them putting Miami up 51-37 midway through the second quarter. Over the next 14 minutes, the Nets outscored Miami 54-24 — completely turning the game around, eventually leading by 32 and, for now, putting Brooklyn in position to escape the play-in tournament that’ll decide the final two East playoff berths.“You see how this March Madness is and you’re one and you’re done,” Vaughn said. “And that’s part of it. I have not discussed any of the standings with this group. Really, we have gone day to day and tried to get a win.""The Heat could have moved 1 1/2 games up on Brooklyn for sixth with a win.""There has been nothing easy about this season and that doesn't necessarily mean that has to be a negative thing,"" Spoelstra said. “You have to embrace the struggle. You have to figure out ways to stay together ... but we just got categorically outplayed tonight.”It was Brooklyn’s second trip to Miami this season. The first was Jan. 8 — which ended up being the last time Kevin Durant played for the Nets, and the last time Durant and Kyrie Irving played together. Durant left that game with a knee injury, then got traded to Phoenix, and Irving has since been dealt to Dallas, as well.The Nets were 27-13 after that night, second in the East, just a game behind Boston for the best record in the NBA. They’re 13-21 since, yet still have the Heat looking up at them in the standings — which Vaughn insists he hasn’t discussed with his team.“You need the momentum, the confidence, the reassurance that you can get it done,” Vaughn said. “So, haven’t tried to complicate it more than that.”TIP-INSNets: Brooklyn has six wins in March and erased double-digit deficits in three of them. The Nets trailed Boston by 28 on March 3, trailed Minnesota by 12 on March 10, and were down by 14 on Saturday. ... The Nets were without Seth Curry (personal reasons) and Ben Simmons (back). The Nets don’t expect Simmons to return this season, though that decision has not been finalized.Heat: Kyle Lowry turned 37 on Saturday. He’s the 12th player to appear for the Heat at the age of 37 or higher. ... The last time a Heat player had more points off the bench before halftime than Strus did on Saturday was Feb. 27, 2019, when Goran Dragic had 25. ... Miami shot 81% in the first quarter, the first time the Heat shot that well in any quarter since March 11, 2020, against Charlotte – also in a loss.NOVA NATIONSpoelstra watched Nova Southeastern — located in Davie, Florida, about a half-hour north of Miami — win the Division II national championship Saturday, with the Sharks finishing 36-0. “That was a year for the ages and something they’ll take for the rest of their lives,” said Spoelstra, who visited the Sharks and watched some practices before the season.CLEVELAND WAITSBrooklyn’s win meant Cleveland will have to wait until at least Sunday to clinch its first playoff berth since 2018 — and its first without LeBron James on the roster since 1998.UD NIGHTMiami’s primary area code is 305, and Heat captain Udonis Haslem — a Miami native who is in his 20th and final season with the team — now has his own section at the arena that he called home for his entire NBA career.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847043,Nowell's heroics not enough to get K-State to Final Four,"NEW YORK (AP) — Playing in front of a Madison Square Garden crowd that was riveted every time he touched the ball, Markquis Nowell did everything he could to carry Kansas State to its first Final Four since 1964.The 5-foot-8 Harlem native had 50 points, 31 assists and 10 steals in two games at the famous New York City arena and was named the East Region's most outstanding player.But it wasn't enough against a hard-driving Florida Atlantic team that beat Kansas State 79-76 in a nip-and-tuck game Saturday night to earn a trip to the national semifinals in Houston.Nowell finished with 30 points, 12 assists and five steals. On the Wildcats' final possession, he gave the ball to Ismael Massoud, who failed to get off a tying 3-point attempt.“I always dreamed of something like this, just playing here, being here, playing my heart out,” Nowell said. “I feel like I gave my heart and soul to this game for these past couple games because I wanted to see these guys win and smile and know what the standard is for winning.”In the Wildcats' Sweet 16 win over Michigan State, Nowell got plenty of help from star forward Keyontae Johnson. But Johnson wasn't much of a factor against the Owls, playing only 18 minutes because of foul trouble.The former Florida star — who transferred to Kansas State this season after missing two years following his shocking collapse on the court during a game — scored nine points and had two rebounds. He came in leading the Wildcats in scoring at 17.7 points per game.“I’m just going to look back at it as, if I never fouled, we would not be in this situation,” Johnson said as he sat in front of his locker, his eyes swollen and red.Johnson walked off the court with his head down.“I was trying to not show my emotion on the court,” Johnson said, adding his emotions got the best of him when he got to the locker room, where coach Jerome Tang waited and cheered the team that made his first season so memorable.Massoud, who also grew up in Harlem, had his own regrets about failing to put up a last-second shot. He took a pass from Nowell but was quickly surrounded by two Owls, and the ball got loose.“I should have probably put a shot up,” Massoud said. “That's probably something I am going to have to live with.”Massoud said he will always remember Nowell's performance in New York.“There's not enough words to explain what he is able to do,” Massoud said. “That was probably the best performance in the NCAAs this season and for years to come. He was breaking records. He really worked for this. Without him we would not have been in the game.”Tang experienced two previous Elite Eight losses during his time as an assistant coach at Baylor. He said he'll take only positives from his first season leading the Wildcats.“Tough things are going to happen in our life, and we don’t get to wallow in it,” he said. “We’ve got to keep moving forward. This is more of a lesson for them of becoming men than it is about basketball.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847044,UConn routs Gonzaga 82-54 for first Final Four in 9 years,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The critique of UConn under coach Dan Hurley had been the program’s inability to win in March.Consecutive first-round NCAA Tournament exits meant the Huskies were good, not great — certainly not anywhere in league with the UConn women’s program.In perhaps the maddest March of all, Huskies proved they are elite again, putting in another dominating performance a few hours after the UConn women had a rare misstep.Jordan Hawkins scored 20 points and UConn overwhelmed its fourth straight NCAA Tournament opponent, earning its first trip to the Final Four in nine years with an 82-54 blowout of Gonzaga on Saturday night.“I think it becomes a little bit of a mental hurdle, especially like early rounds of the NCAA Tournament where you feel like maybe the burden of the history and tradition and first-round games, maybe even second-round games,” Hurley said. “The climb to get to this point has been real and it's been more challenging than I thought.""The Huskies (29-8) have felt right at home in their first extended March Madness run since winning the 2014 national championship, playing their best basketball of what had been an up-and-down season.UConn controlled the usually efficient Bulldogs at both ends in the West Region final, building a 23-point lead early in the second half to waltz right into the final section of the bracket.Those first-round exits are now well in the rearview mirror. So is that midseason funk.These elite Huskies did what the UConn women couldn't for once and are headed to Houston, where they will play Texas or Miami.UConn has a pretty good track record once it gets this far, too: The Huskies are 8-1 all-time in Final Four games.“We've got a lot to prove,” said Andre Jackson Jr., who had eight points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. “We still have a chip on our shoulder.”The Bulldogs (31-6) didn’t have the same second-half magic they had in a last-second win over UCLA in the Elite Eight.Gonzaga allowed UConn to go on a late run to lead by seven at halftime and fell completely apart after All-American Drew Timme went to the bench with his fourth foul early in the second half.The Zags shot 33% from the field — 7 of 29 in the second half — and went 2 for 20 from 3 to stumble in their bid for a third Final Four since 2017.“UConn was just terrific tonight and we didn’t have any answers, especially when kind of everything really didn’t bounce our way,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. “And we can’t absorb a game like that when our offense is as bad as it was tonight.”Alex Karaban scored 12 points and Adama Sanogo had 10 points and 10 rebounds for UConn.Timme had 12 points and 10 rebounds, receiving a warm ovation after being taken out of his final collegiate game with 1:50 left.“I'm just so thankful that the program and the place took me for who I was,” said Timme, who shared a long embrace with Few when he exited. “They didn’t ask me to be anybody but myself.”The Zags started off like they had a Vegas hangover, firing off two air-balled 3-pointers and a wild runner by Timme. Once Gonzaga shook out the cobwebs, the Bulldogs kept the Huskies bridled with defense, with hard hedges on screens and Timme sagging off Jackson to protect the lane.UConn countered by getting the ball into the strong hands of Sanogo, the facilitator. The UConn big man picked apart Gonzaga’s double-teams for five first-half assists, including two for layups.“We figured that out,” Hurley said. “That doesn't work anymore.”Karaban hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to put the Huskies up 39-32 at halftime, and it got worse for Gonzaga to start the second half.UConn pushed the lead to 12 and Timme picked up his third and fourth fouls in the opening 2 1/2 minutes — one on a charge, another on a box-out under the rim.“We brought the team together and tried to keep positive thoughts and try to keep chipping away at that lead,” Gonzaga forward Anton Watson said. “But it's hard when Drew goes out.”The Huskies really got rolling when Timme took a seat, using their defense to get out in transition and set up 3-pointers. A 14-3 run put UConn up 60-37 and Few took the calculated gamble of bringing Timme back in.It made little difference.UConn kept up the pressure and kept making shots, looking an awful lot like the favorite to win it all.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847045,Nuggets beat Bucks 129-106 in clash of conference leaders,"DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic had 31 points and 11 assists, Jamal Murray finished with 26 points and nine assists, and the Denver Nuggets beat the Milwaukee Bucks 129-106 on Saturday night in a late-season showdown of the NBA’s conference leaders.Michael Porter Jr. scored 19 points for West-leading Denver (50-24), which outscored East-leading Milwaukee 68-40 in the second half.Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 31 points -- just seven in the second half -- and grabbed nine rebounds for the Bucks (53-20).“It’s better to win games, but our goal is to do something in a playoffs,” Jokic said.The battle of the top teams in each conference -- and two strong MVP candidates -- was more competitive than the teams’ first meeting, won by the Bucks 107-99. Then, the Nuggets held out four starters -- Jokic, Murray, Porter and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- in the game in Milwaukee on Jan. 25. Denver had played the night before in New Orleans and opted to rest its stars.The circumstances were reversed, with the Bucks having played in Utah on Friday night.“We still play, still got to be better, there’s no excuses about that,” Khris Middleton said. “But I’m sure for a lot of fans, a lot of people out there, they’d love to see healthy teams, or not coming off back to backs.”Antetokounmpo scored 24 points on 11-for-14 shooting in the first half, with all but one of those field goals coming at the rim. Murray (20 points) and Jokic (17 points) kept Denver within three at the break, and then the Nuggets outscored Milwaukee 34-19 in the third quarter to take a 97-85 lead.Jeff Green dunked on Antetokounmpo to open the fourth as the Nuggets’ lead swelled to 15 points. Grayson Allen hit a 3-pointer to cut it to 103-91 with 9:54 left, but Milwaukee went scoreless for 4:10 while Denver built a 111-91 lead.“It was an amazing dunk,” Jokic said of Green’s dunk. “I didn’t think he was going to do it. He almost fell down, so it was a really nice dunk.”Antetokounmpo went to the bench with 5:54 left and didn’t return.GETTING TECHNICALThe Bucks lost some composure in the third quarter. Bobby Portis Jr. was called for a take foul on Jokic and, immediately after, a technical. Denver hit both free throws and Bruce Brown hit a 3-pointer for a 84-76 lead. Minutes later, Brook Lopez got a technical while sitting on the bench.Antetokounmpo picked up Milwaukee’s third technical with 6:41 left in the game.“It was a night where we were grumpy, and it happens,” coach Mike Budenholzer said.TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAMDenver coach Michael Malone got a technical late in the first quarter, and it was to prevent Jokic from getting one. Jokic was frustrated by the physical play, so during a timeout Malone told him he would get the technical.“I can get kicked out, he can’t. I understand the pecking order here,” Malone said.TIP-INSBucks: Middleton finished with 13 points and six rebounds after missing Friday’s game for injury management. ... It was Milwaukee’s fourth loss since Jan. 21.Nuggets: Green was down on the court for several minutes after fouling Antetokounmpo with 11:14 left, but returned to the game.UP NEXTBucks: At Detroit on Monday night.Nuggets: Host Philadelphia on Monday night.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847046,"Malkin's late goal lifts Penguins past Ovechkin, Caps 4-3","PITTSBURGH (AP) — Evgeni Malkin remains a live wire. Even now, 17 seasons into a career that is likely destined for the Hall of Fame, there's an unpredictability the Pittsburgh Penguins star plays with that can be both endearing and exasperating to teammates and coaches alike.The latest proof came against Washington on Saturday.An untimely roughing penalty in the third period helped spark a Capitals' rally from a three-goal deficit. Malkin made up for it by burying a breakaway with 1:20 left in regulation that lifted the Penguins to a 4-3 victory.“His care factor and his compete level for me is off the charts and that’s what I love about him and usually when the stakes are high that’s when he’s at his best,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. ""He gets a huge goal for us tonight at a key time.”Malkin's 25th goal of the season — a low wrist shot to the far post — helped the Penguins avoid a potentially messy collapse. Pittsburgh appeared to be ready to cruise to victory after Jake Guentzel's power-play goal 27 seconds into the third period made it 3-0.Washington instead stormed back, with Alex Ovechkin right in the middle of it. Ovechkin scored his 42nd goal of the season and 822nd of his career from his favorite spot in the left circle with 6:42 to go in regulation. Washington drew even when Dylan Strome flipped the puck into an open net with 2:44 to go in regulation.Yet instead of sagging, the Penguins surged. Malkin stripped Washington's Anthony Mantha near center ice and broke in alone on Kuemper. Seconds later, the puck was in the net and Malkin was on one knee celebrating while pumping his fists, the kind of display of raw emotion that's become one of his trademarks.“It’s a huge goal for me, and two points for the team,” Malkin said.Pittsburgh moved three points clear of Florida after the Panthers lost to the earlier Saturday. Both teams have nine regular-season games left.Ryan Poehling and Chad Ruhwedel scored a little over two minutes apart in the second period for Pittsburgh. Jake Guentzel added his team-high 32nd goal early in the third before Washington scrambled back. Casey DeSmith played spectacularly at times while finishing with 31 saves.Tom Wilson started the Capitals' comeback with his ninth goal of the season 5:19 into the third. Kuemper stopped 36 shots, but was outplayed by DeSmith as Washington's hopes of making a late push for a playoff berth took a serious hit. The Capitals are six points behind Pittsburgh with only eight games remaining.“It’s a tough one,” Washington center T.J. Oshie said. “I don’t think that last play was the only thing that lost the game for us. I know that (Mantha) feels terrible about it, but we trust him with the puck. It just wasn’t a good enough 60 minutes against a good hockey team over there.”It felt like old times for much of the night for teams that usually enter late March battling for a spot near the top of the Metropolitan Division.Not this season.While the 35-year-old Crosby is averaging over a point a game as usual and the 37-year-old Ovechkin is steadily making inroads on Wayne Gretzky's all-time goal record, their teams have spent most of the year skating in place.Pittsburgh has been wildly uneven thanks in part to goaltending that has fluctuated between solid and shaky, the main reason a 17th straight playoff appearance is hardly assured. Washington, meanwhile, appears to be pointing toward the future after injuries and a small sell-off at the trade deadline.Pittsburgh put itself on slightly firmer footing with DeSmith making a compelling case that he should supplant Tristan Jarry as Pittsburgh's top goaltender down the stretch.DeSmith was spectacular at times, including stoning Ovechkin on a breakaway near the end of the second period in which Ovechkin deked DeSmith to his knees, only to see DeSmith extend his left leg just enough to knock the puck out of harm's way.“I’m not very tall,” the 6-foot DeSmith said. ""But I had that one inch that I needed.”UP NEXTCapitals: Host the New York Islanders on Wednesday.Penguins: Visit Detroit on Tuesday.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World

They’re only a half-game up on Miami (40-35) in the race for the sixth and final guaranteed playoff berth, but swept the Heat 3-0 this season and would also own a head-to-head tiebreaker.Max Strus scored 23 for the Heat, all of them in the first half. Tyler Herro scored 23, Jimmy Butler had 18 and Bam Adebayo finished with 16 for the Heat.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847066,Taiwan’s Presidential Office cuts diplomatic ties with Honduras,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s Presidential Office Spokesperson Olivia Lin (林聿禪) issued a statement today (March 26) stating Honduran negotiations to establish diplomatic relations with China led Taiwan with no choice but to cut diplomatic ties to safeguard national sovereignty and dignity.Effective immediately, Taiwan will suspend all diplomatic relations and bilateral cooperation with Honduras, including the imminent closure and evacuation of the Taiwan embassy in Honduras, and the recall of technical missions and health center personnel.Lin said in a statement that Taiwan’s government has expressed goodwill and assistance to Honduras for 80-plus years, assisting in public infrastructure construction and economic development. Despite this long-term help, relations between Taiwan and Honduras could not withstand Chinese meddling.Lin warned Honduras not to be swayed by China's false promises, noting that continued negotiations with China regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations have seriously impacted Taiwan’s government and its people, leading the Presidential Office to express strong regret and condemnation.“The severance of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Honduras is part of a series of Chinese attacks and intimidation. China has suppressed the international space of Taiwan for a long time, unilaterally endangering regional peace and stability,” said Lin.Lin added that nothing can change the fact that, “Taiwan and China are not affiliated to each other, nor can they destroy the will of the people of Taiwan to love freedom and democracy, and embrace the world.”Furthermore, Lin said that recent events such as the COVID pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the earthquake in Turkey, have been aided by Taiwan’s participation. In the future, Taiwan will continue to cooperate with countries who share similar ideals, such as global peace, stability, prosperity and development.",2023/03/26,2040,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847083,Daunting recovery underway in tornado-devastated Mississippi,"ROLLING FORK, Miss. (AP) — Help began pouring into one of the poorest regions of the U.S. after a deadly tornado tore a path of destruction for more than an hour across a long swath of Mississippi, even as furious new storms Sunday struck across the Deep South.At least 25 people were killed and dozens of others were injured in Mississippi as the massive storm ripped through more than a half-dozen towns late Friday. A man was also killed in Alabama after his trailer home flipped over several times.“Everything I can see is in some state of destruction,” said Jarrod Kunze, who drove to the hard-hit Mississippi town of Rolling Fork from his home in Alabama, ready to help “in whatever capacity I’m needed.”Kunze was among volunteers working Sunday at a staging area, where bottled water and other supplies were being readied for distribution.Search and recovery crews resumed the daunting task of digging through flattened and battered homes, commercial buildings and municipal offices after hundreds of people were displaced.The storm hit so quickly that the sheriff's department in Rolling Fork barely had time to set off sirens to warn the community of 2,000 residents, said Mayor Eldridge Walker.“And by the time they initiated the siren, the storm had hit and it tore down the siren that’s located right over here,"" Walker said, referring to an area just blocks from downtown.The mayor said his town was devastated.“Sharkey County, Mississippi, is one of the poorest counties in the state of Mississippi, but we’re still resilient,” he said. “We’ve got a long way to go, and we certainly thank everybody for their prayers and for anything they will do or can do for this community.”President Joe Biden issued an emergency declaration for Mississippi early Sunday, making federal funding available to hardest hit areas.“Help is on the way,” Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said at a news conference with local, state and federal leaders.Recovery efforts in Mississippi were underway even as the National Weather Service warned of a new risk of more severe weather Sunday — including high winds, large hail and possible tornadoes in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.A tornado touched down early Sunday in Troup County, Georgia, near the Alabama border, according to the Georgia Mutual Aid Group. Affected areas included the county seat of LaGrange, about 67 miles (108 kilometers) southwest of AtlantaAbout 100 buildings were damaged, with at least 30 uninhabitable, and five people suffered minor injuries, officials said. Many roads, including Interstate Highway 85, were blocked by debris.Two tigers briefly escaped from their enclosures at Wild Animal Safari in Pine Mountain, Georgia, after the park sustained extensive tornado damage. “Both have now been found, tranquilized, and safely returned to a secure enclosure,” the park said on Facebook. None of its employees or animals were hurt, it said.Outside of Rolling Fork, a tornado ripped apart the home where Kimberly Berry lived in the Delta flatlands. The twister left only a foundation and a few belongings — a toppled refrigerator, a dresser and nightstand, a bag of Christmas decorations, some clothing.Berry said she and her 12-year-old daughter huddled and prayed inside a nearby church as the storm roared outside.“I didn’t hear nothing but my own self praying and God answering my prayer. I mean, I can get another house, another furniture. But literally saving my life — I’m thankful,” she said.Following Biden’s declaration, federal funding will be available for recovery efforts in Mississippi’s Carroll, Humphreys, Monroe and Sharkey counties, including temporary housing, home repairs, loans covering uninsured property losses and other individual and business programs, the White House said in a statement.The twister flattened entire blocks, obliterated houses, ripped a steeple off a church and toppled a municipal water tower.Based on early data, the tornado received a preliminary EF-4 rating, the National Weather Service office in Jackson said in a tweet. An EF-4 tornado has top wind gusts between 166 mph and 200 mph (265 kph and 320 kph).In Rolling Fork, the tornado reduced homes to piles of rubble and flipped cars on their sides. Other parts of the Deep South were digging out from damage caused by other suspected twisters.The Federal Emergency Management Agency said 25 people were confirmed killed in Mississippi, 55 people were injured and 2,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. High winds, hail and strong storms were expected for parts of Alabama and Georgia on Sunday, the National Weather Service said.The tornado that slammed into Rolling Fork tore across Mississippi for about 59 miles (95 kilometers) over a period that lasted more than one hour, the National Weather Service said in a preliminary report Sunday. The tornado was an estimated three-quarters of a mile wide at some points, according to the preliminary estimate.The supercell that produced the deadly twister also appeared to produce tornadoes causing damage in northwest and north-central Alabama, said Brian Squitieri, a severe storms forecaster with the weather service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.In Georgia, Rachel McMahon awoke Sunday to news from her father that the Troup County motel he’d been staying in was destroyed. She said her dad, who is disabled, took shelter in the bathtub when the tornado hit.He was badly shaken up, but not injured. She had to walk the last half-mile to his motel because of downed trees.“SO thankful my dad is ok,” she posted on Facebook, along with photos and videos of the damage: houses with gaping holes in roofs, massive tree trunks snapped in half and powerlines dangling every which way.___Associated Press journalists Leah Willingham in Charleston, West Virginia; Jim Salter in O’Fallon, Missouri; Lea Skene in Baltimore; Jeff Martin in Woodstock, Georgia; Christopher Weber in Los Angeles, and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed to this report.",2023/03/27,,World

The Sixers have lost three of their past four.Biyombo — starting for the injured Deandre Ayton — was a force on both ends of the court, getting interior buckets on offense and making life difficult for Sixers star Joel Embiid on defense. It was his constant energy that boosted the Suns, particularly after a frustrating loss to the Kings one night before.“Bizzy plays hard,” Suns guard Chris Paul said. “That's a talent. He's in the right spot at the right time and his energy — we feed off it. He covers up a lot of our mistakes on the defensive end.”The game was tight through most of the first three quarters, but the Suns used a 26-11 run to turn a tied game into a 15-point advantage early in the fourth quarter. Phoenix got good minutes from most of their bench players, particularly Terrence Ross and T.J. Warren.Warren finished with 16 points, while Ross had 15.“Our bench production — it was huge,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “We had to dig deep.”Booker shot 9 of 18 from the field and hit all nine of his free throws.The Suns won despite a huge game from Sixers guard Tyrese Maxey, who finished with 37 points on 14-of-19 shooting, including 7 of 11 from 3-point range. Embiid added 28 points and 10 rebounds.“We didn’t play well,” Sixers coach Doc Rivers said. “We didn’t move the ball today. The ball was stagnant offensively. That's not how we play.”The road-weary Sixers have played 10 of their past 13 on the road.“I thought I missed a lot of shots I usually make,” Embiid said. “They loaded up a lot so I barely had any driving lanes.”Both teams were missing key pieces. The Suns were without Ayton (hip) and Kevin Durant (ankle), while the 76ers didn't have James Harden (achilles).The Suns had a 58-53 halftime lead. Maxey led all scorers with 21 points before the break, while Booker had 18 for the Suns.HOT BOOKBooker is on one of the best scoring streaks of his career. He came into Saturday's game averaging 33.8 points on 58.5% shooting over his past 11 games.TIP-INS76ers: Harden missed his third straight game and fourth of the past five.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847087,Zags' Strawther may jump to NBA after sad ending in Vegas,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Two nights after Julian Strawther exuberantly stormed through the tunnel at T-Mobile Arena following his 3-pointer from the March Madness logo that lifted Gonzaga past UCLA, his walk to the locker room Saturday night was somber.Strawther and Drew Timme embraced one another, with towels draping their heads while tears welled their eyes, after the third-seeded Bulldogs were throttled by No. 4 seed Connecticut 82-54 in the West Region final.It wasn't the ending the pair envisioned to their final game together with the Zags.“We love each other,” said Strawther, who finished with 11 points and six rebounds. “We had a lot of great moments on the court together and we were able to share this jersey. Being that it’s his last game in a Gonzaga jersey and that it’s the last time we share the court together, it was obviously a sour feeling.”Strawther didn't discuss his own future, but there's a chance the Las Vegas native’s college career also came to an end in his hometown.Strawther considered leaving for the NBA last season, but after attending the draft combine and doing private workouts for several teams, he announced he was returning to Gonzaga.Now, after a stellar junior campaign that saw him average 15.2 points and 6.2 rebounds, Strawther is sure to be on the NBA radar again.“I’ll definitely be thinking about that at a future time. It’s in the back of my mind right now,” said Strawther, who has been represented by the Los Angeles-based Wasserman agency since last summer. “It’s the last thing I’m thinking about. I’m just thinking about sharing this moment with me and my team.“Just knowing that that specific group of guys will never share the court again, it’s just the worst feeling coming into this locker room and it’s dead silence. We’ve just been through so much together. We’ve been going at it since the summertime and just building up for these moments and when it all comes to an end so abruptly, it’s so quick. It just hurts.”The athletic 6-foot-7 swingman has been projected as a late first-round or second-round pick in the draft.“Unbelievably proud of him and his journey,” said Strawther's father, Lee. “Three Sweet 16s, two Elite 8s, one Final Four and one championship game — not too many players get to say that. Proved he is a real player and an even better young man. He has a great future ahead of him and I’m proud to be his father.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847088,Pelicans ride 21 3-pointers to 131-110 win over Clippers,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Trey Murphy III scored 32 points, Brandon Ingram had 32 points and 13 assists, and the New Orleans Pelicans never trailed in a 131-110 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night.New Orleans tied a franchise record with 21 3-pointers and shot 61.8% from behind the arc. Murphy was a major reason for that success, making a career-high 10 3s in 12 attempts.“I just see his confidence going up and up,” Ingram said. “He’s the best shooter on the team”C.J. McCollum had 21 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Pelicans, who have won four in a row.“Our execution was off the charts,” New Orleans coach Willie Green said.Bones Hyland scored 18 points and Kawhi Leonard added 12 points and six rebounds for the Clippers, who have lost three of four.“I thought they really came out to attack us tonight, and they did that,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “On the offensive end, 20 turnovers with 28 points (off turnovers) is too many, especially for a fast team like this.”At risk of falling out of the play-in tournament with a loss, the energized Pelicans started out hot, scoring the first eight points, and never let up.New Orleans made seven of its first eight 3-point shots and nine of 11 in the opening quarter to build an 11-point edge.Murphy was nearly indefensible from deep, making his first five 3s to help the Pelicans open a 19-point lead, their largest of the half, early in the second quarter.“Trey shot the cover off the ball,” Green said, unable to stifle a laugh. “And it was good to see him make shot after shot after shot. He’s capable, our team is capable, and that’s the standard in which we want to play.”Ingram realized early on that Murphy was locked in, en route to becoming the second-youngest player in NBA history to make 10 3s at 22 years and 280 days old. Anthony Edwards did it as a 20-year old in his second season with Minnesota.“I felt like he was going to shoot no matter who was in front of him, so I just wanted to keep feeding him the ball,” Ingram said of Murphy. “It just makes our team tougher to stop when he's a threat on the floor.”The Clippers made pushes, including scoring 11 straight points to pull within 47-40, but the Pelicans connected from distance when needed to break their momentum.“It’s tough to dig yourself a hole and try to climb out every single night,” Lue said.New Orleans ended up 14 for 22 from long distance (63.6%) in the first half.“We took care of the basketball, and we got some stops on the defensive end and we ran in transition,” Ingram said. “I think the pace was good for us.”Although the Clippers were down by 14 points going into the fourth, Leonard did not play in the final quarter. Lue declined to say why Leonard did not return to the game.TIP INSPelicans: New Orleans had a 45-31 rebounding advantage. … G Herbert Jones was elbowed in the face by Clippers G Eric Gordon in the second quarter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847112,Gonzaga's Drew Timme ends storied career in loss to UConn,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Gonzaga was down 10 points early in the second half Saturday night in the West Region final against UConn, but Julian Strawther had just secured a defensive rebound, and perhaps the Bulldogs had a run in them.But then came a whistle. Zags forward Drew Timme had picked up his fourth foul. Shortly thereafter, it became clear that Gonzaga's NCAA Tournament run would end.Without him, the third-seeded Bulldogs weren't a match for No. 4 seed UConn, which pulled away to win 82-54 and end Timme's college career.Timme, who gained fame for his masterful inside moves and world-class mustache, put together perhaps the finest college career in recent memory. He was a throwback for his crafty low-post game and for spending four years at the same school.“I’m just so thankful that the program and the place took me for who I was,” Timme said. ""They didn’t ask me to be anybody but myself. I’m forever in debt for Gonzaga, just the love I have for just everyone that helped me and made this journey so special and so fun. I just don’t think I could ever repay that.“I’d do anything for Gonzaga. I always will. This isn’t a goodbye; it’s a see-you-later.”The emotions were clear on Timme's red face, which he covered with a towel a handful of times. He sniffled as the postgame news conference was about to begin.But Timme held it together when the questions came, including about the fourth foul less than three minutes into the second half. That came after he was whistled for a charge just 26 seconds into the half.“The bottom line is they were the better team tonight,” Timme said of UConn. “They made more shots. They got the 50-50 balls. Regardless of whether we want to say what-ifs, the refs didn’t control that game.”Timme, who had 12 points and 10 rebounds against the Huskies, departs knowing he left a mark not only at Gonzaga but on college hoops.He owns the Gonzaga record with 2,307 points and led the Zags to the Sweet 16 in each of the past three seasons and the national title game in 2021.“I think he’s one of the greatest college players in this modern era,” coach Mark Few said. “He’s won at the highest level. We leaned on him as hard as we’ve ever leaned on a player, and he delivered time and time and time again.“But that’s just a small piece of it. He’s a bigger-than-life character. It was a blast to coach him.”Gonzaga will have a new man in the middle next season, and the Bulldogs got a taste of that experience will be like when Timme sat for about three minutes and UConn rolled to a 58-37 lead.By the time Timme re-entered the game, the Huskies were well on their way to their fourth double-digit victory in as many games.Had Timme never picked up that fourth foul, the Huskies likely still would have pulled away, but the call altered the tone of the game and sped up the rout.“You try to stay positive,” Bulldogs forward Anton Watson said. “We brought the team together and tried to keep positive thoughts and try to keep chipping away at that lead, but it’s hard when Drew goes out.”It was another disappointing end to the season for Gonzaga, which is still searching for its first national championship. Expectations were low it would happen this year, so making the Elite Eight was a win in itself.The Zags can thank Timme, who entered the game leading the team with averages of 21.5 points and 7.5 rebounds, for helping get them there.“I don’t think anybody thought we would make it this far this year,"" Timme said. “Just the stuff we overcame as a group and how we stayed together, I think, speaks volumes to who we are as people, more than players.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/26,,World

(AP) — Brayden Schenn and Kasperi Kapanen had two goals and an assist apiece in the St. Louis Blues' 6-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday night.Jakub Vrana and Sammy Blais also scored during a three-goal first period in St. Louis' fourth win in five games. The sixth-place Blues are all but certain to miss the playoffs for only the second time since 2011, but they routed the Ducks while scoring at least five goals for the third time in their last six games.“The team played an outstanding game,” said Kapanen, who matched his career high with his fifth three-point game. “I think we've got a great core. It was a good example today, and hopefully it will look like that in the future.”Jordan Binnington made 22 saves in his first game action after a two-game suspension for unsportsmanlike conduct — namely, hitting Minnesota's Ryan Hartman in the head with his blocker during a melee with the Wild on March 15. Binnington returned from his suspension two games ago, but sat behind AHL callup Joel Hofer.Binnington gave up goals on Anaheim's first two shots, but recovered in plenty of time for his 23rd victory.“Early on, I just wanted to find that rhythm, and I think it took a little bit,” Binnington said. “I was just happy to be playing hockey. ... We're just going to continue to build, and guys are just using this time to develop their game and then carry it with us.”Schenn secured his seventh career 20-goal season with his first score.Nikita Nesterenko scored his first NHL goal and John Gibson stopped 30 shots for the Ducks, who have lost four straight. Troy Terry and Ryan Strome also scored as lottery-bound Anaheim dropped to 1-5-1 on its eight-game homestand in the final weeks of its franchise-record fifth consecutive non-playoff season.Anaheim had another miserable night that underlined its status as the NHL's worst defensive team this year and one of the worst in recent seasons. The Ducks have already set a franchise record for goals allowed, with the number now up to a league-high 297, and their goal differential dropped to an NHL-worst minus-108.“For whatever reason, we wanted to get into a track meet,” Anaheim coach Dallas Eakins said. “And we're just not built to outscore our mistakes. ... We could have had much more (offensive) zone time, much more chances if we would have been more responsible.”Terry scored his 21st goal just 1:46 after the opening faceoff on a power play, but the Ducks gave it right back 15 seconds later when their poor spacing allowed Vrana to walk in alone for his seventh goal.Nesterenko, the Ducks’ 21-year-old rookie, then scored his first goal in his third NHL game, converting a short-angled shot off a pass from Mason McTavish just 4:05 into the first period.Nesterenko is a Brooklyn native who played at Boston College. Minnesota drafted him in the sixth round in 2019, and Anaheim acquired him three weeks ago in the trade sending John Klingberg to the Wild.Blais and Schenn put the Blues ahead with goals 19 seconds apart late in the first, capitalizing on blown coverage by Anaheim's hapless defense for both scores.St. Louis went ahead 5-2 just 91 seconds into the second period when Schenn and Kapanen scored 29 seconds apart.Terry, the Ducks' two-time All-Star forward, missed the third period for undisclosed personal reasons.UP NEXTBlues: At Los Angeles on Sunday.Ducks: Host Colorado on Monday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World

It felt a little bit like a playoff game, for sure.”Zach Hyman, Leon Draisaitl and Warren Foegele scored for the Oilers, who had their five-game winning streak snapped.“It was a tight game. It was what you expect in the playoffs,” Draisaitl said. “It is obviously a team that we could face. I think we know how to handle these types of games. Obviously tonight didn’t go our way, but we will take the point.”Vegas scored on the first shot of the game 61 seconds in when Eichel took a feed on a 2-on-1 from Ivan Barbashev and beat the Oilers’ starter stick-side for his 27th goal.Not to be outdone, the Oilers also scored on their first shot on Knights goalie Laurent Brossoit 3:28 into the opening frame, as Draisaitl put it right on the tape of Zach Hyman’s stick in front of the net and he redirected in his 31st. Draisaitl set a career high for points on the play with 111 after having 110 the past two seasons.The Golden Knights regained the lead on the power play with 3:33 to play in the first period when the puck came to Dorofeyev on a broken play.Edmonton tied it on the power play midway through the middle period as Connor McDavid sent the puck to Draisaitl in the slot. Draisaitl took it on the backhand before spinning around and scoring his 45th goal of the season. It was also Draisaitl’s 28th power-play goal, the most by any player in a season since Mario Lemieux in 1995-1996.Vegas went ahead 3-2 almost seven minutes into the third period when Marchessault beat Skinner with a one-timer.Edmonton tied it again with 8:41 to play in the third when Foegele tied his career high by scoring his 13th on a long wrist shot.“It’s disappointing we didn’t get the two points,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said. “Some of the goals we gave up were preventable. We’re going to take the lessons from tonight and learn from it.”NOTES: Edmonton won both previous meetings between the teams this season, both by 4-3 scores. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847145,Israeli FM: UAE pardons Israeli citizen after drug sentence,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli officials said Sunday the United Arab Emirates has pardoned an Israeli woman after initially sentencing her to death for drug possession, a case that tested the nascent ties between the two countries.Fida Kiwan was arrested in early 2021 with half a kilogram (over 1 pound) of cocaine that she claimed did not belong to her, Israeli media reported. The UAE, which has harsh drug laws, later commuted the death sentence to life in prison.Lior Haiat, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, said Kiwan had returned to Israel overnight Saturday after the pardon.The office of Israel's ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, said the pardon came following a request by Herzog to UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who agreed “as a gesture of good will,” to release her.There was no immediate comment from officials in the UAE.Kiwan's arrest came shortly after Israel and the UAE normalized ties under U.S.-brokered agreements known as the Abraham Accords.Ties between the countries have flourished since, with trade growing and Israeli tourists flocking in droves to glitzy Dubai.According to Israeli media, Kiwan, who is said to own a photography studio in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, came to Dubai for work at the invitation of a Palestinian acquaintance. She was arrested a short while later after a search of her apartment turned up the drugs.The United Arab Emirates maintains the death penalty for several offenses, including drug smuggling. However, executions remain rare in the federation of seven sheikhdoms, with the last death sentence carried out by firing squad in 2017 against a man convicted of abducting, raping and killing an 8-year-old boy.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847146,New Russian campaign tries to entice men to fight in Ukraine,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Advertisements promise cash bonuses and enticing benefits. Recruiters are making cold calls to eligible men. Enlistment offices are working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed.A new campaign is underway this spring across Russia, seeking recruits to replenish its troops for the war in Ukraine.As fighting grinds on in Ukrainian battlegrounds like Bakhmut and both sides prepare for counteroffensives that could cost even more lives, the Kremlin's war machine badly needs new recruits.A mobilization in September of 300,000 reservists — billed as a “partial” call-up — sent panic throughout the country, since most men under 65 are formally part of the reserve. Tens of thousands fled Russia rather than report to recruiting stations.The Kremlin denies that another call-up is planned for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now more than a year old.But amid widespread uncertainty of whether such a move will eventually happen, the government is enticing men to volunteer, either at makeshift recruiting centers popping up in various regions, or with phone calls from enlistment officials. That way, it can “avoid declaring a formal second mobilization wave” after the first one proved so unpopular, according to a recent report by the U.S.-based think tank Institute of the Study of War.One Muscovite told The Associated Press that his employer, a state-funded organization, gathered up the military registration cards of all male employees of fighting age and said it would get them deferments. But he said the move still sent a wave of fear through him.“It makes you nervous and scared — no one wants to all of a sudden end up in a war with a rifle in their hands,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal. “The special operation is somewhat dragging on, so any surprises from the Russian authorities can be expected.”It's been more than a week since he handed in his card, he said, and exemptions usually get resolved in a day or two, heightening his anxiety.Russian media report that men across the country are receiving summonses from enlistment offices. In most of those cases, men were simply asked to update their records; in others, they were ordered to take part in military training.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that serving summonses to update records in enlistment offices is “usual practice” and a “continued undertaking.”Other unconfirmed media reports say authorities have told regional governments to recruit a certain number of volunteers. Some officials announced setting up recruitment centers with the goal of getting men to sign contracts that enable them to be sent into combat as professional soldiers.Ads have appeared on government websites and on the social media accounts of state institutions and organizations, including libraries and high schools.One of them, posted by a municipal administration in the western Yaroslavl region, promised a one-time bonus of about $3,800 to sign up, and if sent to Ukraine, a monthly salary of up to $2,500, plus about $100 a day for “involvement in active offensive operations,” and $650 “for each kilometer of advancement within assault teams.”The ad said the soldier would also get tax and loan repayment breaks, preferential university admission status for his children, generous compensation for his family if he is wounded or killed in action, and the status of a war veteran, which carries even more perks.In the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, officials asked universities, colleges and vocational schools to advertise for recruits on their websites, said Sergei Chernyshov, founder of a private vocational school there.Chernyshov posted the ad on his social media account “so that everyone knows what our city hall is up to,” but he told the AP that he doesn't plan to put it on the school website. “It’s weird” to target vocational school students, he said.Other efforts include enlistment officials meeting with college students and unemployed men, or phoning men to volunteer.A Muscovite who spoke on condition of anonymity for his own safety said that he received such a call and was surprised at how polite it was: “After my ‘No,’ there were no threats or (attempts to) convince me -– (just) ‘Thanks, goodbye.’”There have only been isolated cases of enlistment officials really pressuring men to sign up, said Grigory Sverdlin, founder of a group called Go by the Forest that helps men avoid mobilization.The group gets up to 100 messages a day from men seeking advice on dealing with summonses or enlistment officials, he said, compared with dozens per day in recent months. In most cases, the officials wanted to update their records with addresses and phone numbers, and they might try to recruit men during that process.But Sverdlin said some cases stand out.In the Vologda region, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Moscow, the group received messages saying that almost everyone going to the enlistment office after receiving a summons ""is forced to sign a paper barring them from leaving the region,” he said.Lawyer Alexei Tabalov, who runs the Conscript’s School legal aid group, believes there's nothing unusual in authorities handing out summonses now. Some of the notices are traditionally served before Russia's spring conscription draft, scheduled to begin April 1 for those eligible for mandatory service.All Russian men from age 18 to 27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoid the draft for health reasons or get student deferments. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities, and many simply evade enlistment officials bearing conscription summonses.Tabalov said that men have reported going to enlistment offices to update their records but have officials there who “beat around the bush and promote the idea of signing the contract, talk about how one should love their motherland and defend it.”He doubted anything could make volunteering attractive after 13 months of a war that has killed and wounded tens of thousands.""People already understand what it means to sign a contract,” he said. “Those who got burned once are unlikely to fall into the same trap.”Tabalov said that his group continues to get messages from soldiers who want to terminate their contracts, but that isn’t legally possible until President Vladimir Putin ends the partial mobilization, which began in September, with a new decree.“Getting out of the war automatically means criminal prosecution,” Tabalov said, adding there have been a flurry of criminal cases since December, with prosecutions of soldiers who desert or go AWOL.The news outlet Mediazona counted 247 verdicts in 536 criminal cases on these and similar charges, adding that over a third of those convicted got suspended sentences, which allows authorities to send them back to the front line.The current recruitment campaign is similar to one enacted last summer, before the September call-up, said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst with the Institute of the Study of War.Back then, authorities also used financial incentives, and various volunteer battalions were formed, but the effort clearly wasn't successful, because Putin eventually turned to the partial mobilization.Whether this one will succeed or not is unclear.“They’ve already recruited a significant portion of people that were financially incentivized last summer. And they struggled to do so last year,” Stepanenko said.The current recruitment effort shows the military's awareness of manpower needs in Ukraine.“What the mobilization campaign of 300,000 servicemen told us is that it's not enough to form a sufficient strike group for Russia to push forward with its offensive operations,"" she said.___Associated Press writer Yuras Karmanau contributed to this report.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847181,Tensions on the rise at revered Kyiv monastery complex,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The courtyards of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra have been busy with more than just the usual worshippers, going to and from its churches in the sprawling monastic complex that is Ukraine’s most revered Orthodox site.Also busy Friday were people in civilian clothes, loading cars with plasma televisions, furniture and other items from the buildings — helping the resident monks remove belongings of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, or UOC, before a threatened government eviction on March 29.There also were police officers checking the cars to make sure no one was removing items that belong to the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra preserve, which oversees the complex.The Russian invasion of Ukraine is reverberating here in a struggle for control of the Lavra, known in English as the Monastery of the Caves. The complex contains church, monastic and museum buildings; its oldest parts date back to the dawn of Christianity here a millennium ago.The dispute is part of a wider religious conflict playing out in parallel with the war.The government of Ukraine has already been cracking down on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church over its historic ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader, Patriarch Kirill, has supported Russian President Vladimir Putin in the invasion of Ukraine.The parliament is considering a “draft law on making it impossible to operate in Ukraine religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation” — which could impact the UOC, depending on how it’s interpreted.The UOC has insisted that it's loyal to Ukraine, has denounced the Russian invasion from the start and has even declared its independence from Moscow.But Ukrainian security agencies have claimed that some in the Ukrainian church have maintained close ties with Moscow. They’ve raided numerous holy sites of the church and later posted photos of rubles, Russian passports and leaflets with messages from the Moscow patriarch as proof that some church officials have been loyal to Russia.The raids started after a Nov. 12 service at the Pechersk Lavra complex, where a Ukrainian Orthodox priest was filmed talking about the “awakening” of Russia.The Ukrainian government has said the Lavra, including a UOC seminary and offices, is a hub of “Russian world” propaganda — an ideology touting Moscow’s political and spiritual hegemony over neighboring Slavic lands such as Ukraine.The government also has sanctioned the Lavra’s abbot for alleged pro-Moscow activities. It already allowed the rival Orthodox Church of Ukraine, or OCU, to use one of the Lavra’s churches for a Christmas service.But now it’s ordering the Ukrainian Orthodox Church out of the premises entirely.The stakes are high. The complex has been called the “pearl of Ukraine” and the “Vatican” of Ukrainian Orthodoxy.The site is owned by the government, and the agency overseeing the property notified the UOC earlier this month that as of March 29, it was terminating the lease allowing the free use of religious buildings on the property. The government claims that the monks violated their lease by making alterations to the historic site and other technical infractions.“There are many new buildings there, and this is a UNESCO site, which do not have relevant documents and permits. The legality of such new buildings also raises legitimate questions,” Ukraine’s minister of culture, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said on Ukrainian television. “The state must manage what belongs to it.”The monks of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church dispute this, saying these claims are a pretext, and they refuse to leave.Still, they’re moving out what possessions they can in preparation for a possible forcible eviction.“We understand that we will not be given the opportunity to function properly and therefore we need to remove certain things and prevent their destruction,” said Metropolitan Clement, the head of the UOC press office.Earlier, the monks said they won’t leave Lavra under any circumstances.Metropolitan Clement, in an interview with The Associated Press, said lawyers for the UOC appealed to the Ministry of Culture to provide documents explaining its reasons for breaking the agreement.However, according to Clement, the ministry informed them that such documents won't be provided, because they have been marked for official use, as if they are classified.The government’s eviction order doesn’t explicitly say the monastery could be turned over to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.But that church’s leader, Metropolitan Epiphany, issued a statement directed at the Lavra monks, indicating knowledge of changes to come.The eviction won’t put an end to monastery worship and ministry at the complex, he said.Metropolitan Epiphany said services will continue and be conducted in their ancient Slavic language along with modern Ukrainian.“The current affairs of the monastery will be managed by those who know the traditions and life of the monastery … and who have not tarnished themselves with devotion to the ‘Russian world,’"" the metropolitan said.Epiphany claimed that the UOC is a “tool of hybrid aggression against Ukraine.”Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture sought to offer similar assurances that Lavra’s monastic life would continue.The Kremlin, however, cites the termination of the UOC’s lease as further proof that Russia’s actions over the past year in Ukraine are justified — claiming that Russia is defending a beleaguered Orthodox population.Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church who backed Moscow’s invasion last year, has asked Pope Francis and other religious leaders to intervene in the Lavra controversy.The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has been ultimately loyal to the Moscow patriarch since the 17th century, though it has had broad autonomy and has strongly denounced the Russian invasion.The independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine received formal recognition in 2019 from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, who has the top position of honor in Orthodoxy but not the universal power of a pope. Kirill hasn't recognized the OCU as legitimate.The UOC itself declared full independence from Moscow last year. But the OCU and its supporters say that the UOC retains strong ties and sympathies to Moscow.The changes in the works at the Lavra received mixed reactions from frequent visitors who were at the complex on Friday.For Oleksandr, 32, who refused to be identified with his last name, it was upsetting. He said that the UOC is clearly connected to Russia, but he personally hadn't heard any church propaganda, and he plans to attend UOC services elsewhere.But the changes were welcomed by Oksana Naumenko, who has been working for years in the academy located in the Lavra complex. She said it fulfilled one of her lifelong dreams of having the singing and prayer at Lavra happen in the Ukrainian language.“It is very large-scale and global event in our history. It is possible that not everyone realizes this,” she said. “But perhaps our children will know at what price our religion and language are being acquired.”___Peter Smith contributed to this report from Pittsburgh.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847182,Hong Kongers hold first protest in years under strict rules,"HONG KONG (AP) — Dozens of people on Sunday joined Hong Kong's first authorized protest since the lifting of major COVID-19 restrictions under unprecedentedly strict rules, including wearing a numbered badge around their necks.The rules set out by the police, who cited security reasons, came as the financial hub was promoting its return to normalcy after years of anti-virus controls and political turmoil.During the pandemic, protests were rare due to COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, many activists have been silenced or jailed after Beijing imposed a national security law following massive protests in 2019. Critics say the city's freedom of assembly that was promised Hong Kong when it returned to China from Britain in 1997 has been eroded.Sunday’s demonstration against the proposed reclamation and construction of rubbish-processing facilities was the first police-approved march of its kind after the city scrapped its mask mandate and social distancing limits.But organizers had to comply with police requirements such as taking measures to ensure the number of participants would not exceed the expected turnout of 100 people and asking for proof of a “reasonable excuse” from protesters who wore masks during the event. At the height of the 2019 anti-government movement, Hong Kong’s government invoked emergency powers to ban masks from public gatherings so it can identify protesters who officials accused of illegal acts.On Sunday, about 80 people expressed their opposition to the plans in Tseung Kwan O, a residential and industrial area, the organizer said. They had to walk in a cordoned-off moving line in the rain amid heavy police presence.Theresa Wang described the new restrictions as “a bit weird” but said they were still acceptable because the city was adjusting to “the new Hong Kong.”“I’m not happy but we have to accept it. We have to accept what is deemed legal now,” the 70-year-old retiree said, adding that she hoped the protest would be a sign the government is more open to discussion.Protester Jack Wong said he would prefer not to wear the badge printed with a number. Police said earlier the requirement aims to prevent lawbreakers from joining the march.“But if it is a requirement, what can I say? I prefer not to comment further. You know what I mean,” he said.In granting its approval, police also requested that organizers ensure there would not be any acts that might endanger national security, including displaying anything seditious.Cyrus Chan, one of the march organizers, said demonstrators had communicated with police on their promotional materials and slogans. Officers earlier had told him that participants should not wear all-black outfits, he said. Protesters commonly wore black during the 2019 protests.“It's definitely strict,” Chan said. “We hope this is just an individual case. We hope to show them that Hong Kong society has the ability to have peaceful marches and they do not need to set that many conditions to restrict us.""Earlier this month, the Hong Kong Women Workers’ Association planned a march to call for labor and women’s rights but canceled it at the last moment without specifying why.Days later, the association said on its Facebook page that police had invited it for further meetings after granting it the approval and that it had tried its best to amend the agreement. But it still could not launch the protest as it had wished, it wrote at that time.A pro-democracy group separately said national security police had warned four of its members not to participate in the association’s march._____Associated Press photographer Louise Delmotte contributed to this report.",2023/03/26,,World

The requests included aid for a hospital, a hydropower dam, and sovereign debt assistance and totaled more than US$2.4 billion (NT$74.3 billion), per Storm Media.According to Wu, the requests were unreasonable and potentially linked to negotiations with China for a similar economic assistance package. He said the release of false or misleading information potentially harms Taiwan’s international image.In the past, Wu said MOFA carefully planned all economic aid to allies and typically did not provide direct “cash assistance.""A Honduran economic assistance request was received on March 13. (CNA photo)Before severing diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Honduras requested US$45 million in aid for the construction of a hospital, which was raised to US$90 million in the second appeal.In addition, Honduras asked for assistance to build a hydroelectric dam, initially US$300 million then raised to US$350 million. Honduras also asked Taiwan to help cover the Honduran sovereign debt of US$2 billion.Wu said turning over US$90 million to build a hospital was akin to bribery, especially since a second request to build a hospital had inflated prices. Wu said it felt like Honduras was “simply asking for money, and not a hospital.”According to Wu, China may fail to hold up its end of the bargain with Taiwan's former allies after they switch political recognition.",2023/03/26,2366,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847245,Mass protests erupt after Netanyahu fires defense chief,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets of cities across the country Sunday night in a spontaneous outburst of anger after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly fired his defense minister for challenging the Israeli leader's judicial overhaul plan.Protesters in Tel Aviv blocked a main highway and lit large bonfires, while police scuffled with protesters who gathered outside Netanyahu's private home in Jerusalem.The unrest deepened a monthslong crisis over Netanyahu's plan to overhaul the judiciary, which has sparked mass protests, alarmed business leaders and former security chiefs and drawn concern from the United States and other close allies.Netanyahu's dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant signaled that the prime minister and his allies will barrel ahead this week with the overhaul plan. Gallant had been the first senior member of the ruling Likud party to speak out against it, saying the deep divisions were threatening to weaken the military.But as droves of protesters flooded the streets late into the night, Likud ministers began indicating willingness to hit the brakes. Culture Minister Micky Zohar, a Netanyahu confidant, said the party would support him if he decided to pause the judicial overhaul.Israeli media said leaders in Netanyahu's coalition were to meet on Monday morning. Later in the day, the grassroots protest movement said it would hold another mass demonstration outside the Knesset, or parliament, in Jerusalem.In a brief statement, Netanyahu’s office said late Sunday the prime minister had dismissed Gallant. Netanyahu later tweeted, “We must all stand strong against refusal.”Tens of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets in protest after Netanyahu's announcement, blocking Tel Aviv's main artery, transforming the Ayalon highway into a sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags and lighting a large bonfire in the middle of the road.Demonstrations took place in Beersheba, Haifa and Jerusalem, where thousands of people gathered outside Netanyahu's private residence. Police scuffled with protesters and sprayed the crowd with a water cannon. Thousands then marched from the residence to the Knesset.Inon Aizik, 27, said he came to demonstrate outside Netanyahu’s private residence in central Jerusalem because “bad things are happening in this country.” He called the judicial overhaul “a quick legislative blitz.”Netanyahu's decision came less than a day after Gallant, a former senior general, called for a pause in the controversial legislation until after next month’s Independence Day holidays, citing the turmoil in the ranks of the military.Gallant had voiced concerns that the divisions in society were hurting morale in the military and emboldening Israel’s enemies. “I see how the source of our strength is being eroded,” Gallant said.While several other Likud members had indicated they might follow Gallant, the party quickly closed ranks Sunday, clearing the way for his dismissal.Galit Distal Atbaryan, Netanyahu’s public diplomacy minister, said Netanyahu summoned Gallant to his office and told him “that he doesn’t have any faith in him anymore and therefore he is fired.”Gallant tweeted shortly after the announcement that “the security of the state of Israel always was and will always remain my life mission.”Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Gallant’s dismissal ""harms national security and ignores warnings of all defense officials.”Israel’s consul general in New York City, Assaf Zamir, resigned in protest.Avi Dichter, a former chief of the Shin Bet security agency, is expected to replace Gallant. Dichter had reportedly flirted with joining Gallant but instead announced Sunday he was backing the prime minister.Netanyahu’s government is pushing ahead for a parliamentary vote this week on a centerpiece of the overhaul — a law that would give the governing coalition the final say over all judicial appointments. It also seeks to pass laws that would would grant parliament the authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit judicial review of laws.Netanyahu and his allies say the plan will restore a balance between the judicial and executive branches and rein in what they see as an interventionist court with liberal sympathies.But critics say the laws will remove Israel's system of checks and balances and concentrate power in the hands of the governing coalition. They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, has a conflict of interest.Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past three months to demonstrate against the plan in the largest demonstrations in the country's 75-year history. The State Department dismissed as “completely false” claims repeated by Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister’s son, that the U.S. government was financing these protests.Leaders of Israel’s vibrant high-tech industry have said the changes will scare away investors, former top security officials have spoken out against the plan and key allies, including the United States and Germany, have voiced concerns.In recent weeks, discontent has surged from within Israel’s army — the most popular and respected institution among Israel’s Jewish majority. A growing number of Israeli reservists, including fighter pilots, have threatened to withdraw from voluntary duty if the laws are passed.Israel's military is facing an increase in fighting in the occupied West Bank, threats from Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group and concerns that archenemy Iran is close to developing a nuclear-weapons capability.Manuel Trajtenberg, head of an influential Israeli think tank, the Institute for National Security Studies, said that “Netanyahu can dismiss his defense minister, he cannot dismiss the warnings he heard from Gallant.”Meanwhile, an Israeli good governance group asked the country’s Supreme Court on Sunday to punish Netanyahu for allegedly violating a conflict of interest agreement meant to prevent him from dealing with the country’s judiciary while he is on trial for corruption.The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a fierce opponent of the overhaul, asked the court to force Netanyahu to obey the law and sanction him either with a fine or prison time for not doing so. It said he was not above the law.The prime minister said the appeal should be dismissed and said that the Supreme Court didn’t have grounds to intervene.Netanyahu is barred by the country’s attorney general from directly dealing with his government’s plan to overhaul the judiciary, based on a conflict of interest agreement that the Supreme Court acknowledged in a ruling over Netanyahu’s fitness to serve while on trial for corruption. Instead, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close confidant of Netanyahu, is spearheading the overhaul.But on Thursday, after Parliament passed a law making it harder to remove a sitting prime minister, Netanyahu said he was unshackled from the attorney general’s decision and vowed to wade into the crisis and “mend the rift” in the nation. That declaration prompted the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, to warn that Netanyahu was breaking his conflict of interest agreement.The fast-paced legal and political developments have catapulted Israel into uncharted territory, said Guy Lurie, a research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.“We are at the start of a constitutional crisis in the sense that there is a disagreement over the source of authority and legitimacy of different governing bodies,” he said.___Associated Press journalist Tia Goldenberg contributed from Tel Aviv.",2023/03/27,,World

Some flights were delayed or would have to be canceled because of the problems.Check-in was still possible using cellphone browsers on smartphones or tablets, and the Lufthansa app.The technical problems were caused by external IT service providers, dpa reported. Lufthansa asked travelers to check the status of their flights and said it was working with “high-pressure"" to resolve the issues.Last month, cable damage during construction work in Frankfurt caused Lufthansa computer systems to fail, resulting in flight cancellations and delays worldwide.Sunday's problems came a day before a national strike in Germany is set to bring the country's traffic to a standstill with airport, train and public transportation employees all protesting for higher salaries in a one-day walkout on Monday.Air traffic was already canceled on Sunday at Germany's second-biggest airport in Munich because of the upcoming strike.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847277,Berlin climate proposal fails to get enough yes votes to win,"BERLIN (AP) — A Sunday referendum in Berlin that would have forced the city to ramp up its climate goals failed because there weren't enough votes in favor of the proposal, the German news agency dpa reported.After about 98% of the votes had been counted, the supporters of the proposal were just ahead of the opponents of such a change in the law, according to an announcement by the city-state's election administration. However, that result only met one requirement for a successful proposal. The second requirement, a quorum of at least 25% of all eligible voters, was not met, dpa reported.Shortly before the end of the count, there were around 423,000 votes in favor and around 405,000 votes against. The quorum for a successful referendum would have been around 608,000 votes in favor of the proposal.The referendum had called for Berlin to become climate neutral by 2030. The target meant that in less than eight years, the city would no longer be allowed to contribute further to global warming.An existing law sets the deadline for achieving that goal at 2045, which is also Germany’s national target.A grassroots group that had initiated the proposal had argued that Berlin’s current target isn’t in line with the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial average.The center-right Christian Democratic Union, which won a recent local election in the capital and is likely to lead its new government, had opposed the earlier target.",2023/03/27,,World

The city's police had granted the protesters permission to assemble on condition that they do not violate the national security law.The protest authorization restricted the protesters to 100 participants. Around 50 were on the streets on Sunday. Many welcomed the return to activism, but criticized the strict measures imposed on the march.""We need to have a more free-spirited protest culture,"" James Ockenden, a protester marching with his three children, told the Reuters news agency. ""But this is all pre-arranged and numbered and it just destroys the culture and will put people off from coming for sure.""Other restrictions involved making participants wear numbered badges around their necks.The police said in its letter to the organizers that it was important to identify the protesters, to prevent any ""lawbreakers"" from infiltrating the march.Masks were also banned, unless protesters could come up with a ""reasonable excuse.""During Hong Kong's 2019 anti-government movement, the government also banned masks from public gatherings.Sunday's protest is the first to be authorized since strict COVID-19 restrictions were lifted earlier this year.Protests were rare throughout the three years of the pandemic. In parallel, activism was silenced, with several activists jailed since the 2019 protest movement and subsequent 2020 national security law.Many fear Hong Kong's once vibrant civil movement scene has now been eroded.All eyes are on June 4 and July 1, when major demonstrations would historically take place in Hong Kong to mark the anniversaries of the Tiananmen protests and the British handover of the city to Beijing, respectively.Authorities denied an application for a candlelight vigil to commemorate the victims of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, Reuters said, on grounds of COVID social distancing.rmt/wd (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/26,,

A total of around 1,500 connections were affected, and takeoffs and landings were only possible for emergency humanitarian flights, German news agency dpa reported.German unions have called on thousands of workers across the country’s transportation system to stage a one-day strike as employees in many sectors are seeking hefty raises to reflect persistently high inflation.Ver.di chair Frank Werneke said last week that the service workers' union is calling for 120,000 workers to walk out. Those will include security and ground workers at all German airports except in Berlin, local transit employees in seven of Germany’s 16 states, harbor employees and workers on highways — the latter a measure that Werneke said is likely to affect some tunnels.The EVG union, which represents many railway workers, is calling for 230,000 workers at Germany’s main railway operator, government-owned Deutsche Bahn, and others to walk out.Ver.di is engaged in a series of pay negotiations, notably for employees of Germany’s federal and municipal governments. In that case, it is seeking a 10.5% pay raise. Employers have offered a total of 5% in two stages plus one-time payments of 2,500 euros ($2,700).It already has staged a series of one-day walkouts at individual airports and in public services, including local transit.EVG is seeking a raise of 12%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847307,Tax the rich? Chicago mayoral hopefuls debate city budget,"CHICAGO (AP) — Ken Kunz used to know everyone in the North Side Chicago neighborhood where he's lived for more than 40 years. But crossing paths with old friends is rare these days because longtime residents have been pushed out by new development and soaring property taxes.When they do meet, the 64-year-old says, they exchange the same greeting: “I'm so glad you're still here.”Chicago has grown unaffordable for many working- and middle-class people like Kunz who have been “run over by development,"" as he put it. That's why he voted both in the February mayoral election and the upcoming runoff for Brandon Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer who has called for $800 million in new taxes on ""the ultrarich.""“It seems like he is at least willing to represent someone who makes as much money as I do,” said Kunz, who operates his own delivery business and manages the property where he lives, which helps make rent manageable. “I just want as much representation as the developer who's building million-dollar condos around the corner from my house.”How to balance Chicago's steep financial challenges with residents' concerns about the cost of living is among the many issues separating Johnson and Paul Vallas, the former schools CEO and onetime city budget director, before the April 4 runoff. The two Democrats advanced in last month's vote, outdistancing Mayor Lori Lightfoot.Just as in many major cities, the debate over who should pay what in taxes has taken on increasing prominence post-pandemic. Some see this moment as a chance to rebuild the economy and ensure more equitable futures for residents, many of whom were struggling to get by even before COVID-19 hit. In Chicago, the task is complicated by concerns over violent crime, including homicide rates that spiked in recent years and have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels.Johnson is a progressive who has been endorsed and heavily funded by the Chicago Teachers Union. He has the backing of Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., along with other lawmakers and groups that have long pushed a tax-the-rich agenda.Vallas is supported by many business leaders, including groups such as the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce and the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association. He says he would rely on his budgeting expertise to find ways to cut spending and says Johnson's plan would hurt not just the wealthy but also businesses that provide jobs and industries the city needs to thrive.""He’s imposing taxes that are going to pummel the economy at a time when we could possibly be drifting into recession,” Vallas said during a recent debate.Chicago's fragile recovery is visible throughout the city.Along the iconic shopping and tourist strip known as the Magnificent Mile, storefronts sit vacant, casualties of the pandemic, crime and retail trends that were moving away from in-person shopping even before COVID-19. In some areas, particularly in the city's predominantly Black neighborhoods, people have left, leaving blocks with boarded-up homes and empty lots.There are some bright spots on the economic front. Google recently bought a state-owned building in the heart of the Loop to serve as a second headquarters. A long-sought casino was approved and will bring both jobs and revenue.But Chicago is at a crossroads, dealing with historic inflation, skyrocketing property taxes and the lingering effects of the pandemic, said Jack Lavin, president and CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce.Lavin and other business leaders credited Vallas for his plan to address crime, a major concern among businesses. The union that represents Chicago police has endorsed Vallas, who wants to hire hundreds of officers, while Johnson has been criticized over past comments in support of “defunding” police — something Johnson insists he will not do. Johnson has called for investing more in areas such as youth jobs and mental health care rather than adding more officers.“We need to do things that are going to encourage people to come back to the office, encourage people to get out and go to shows and conventions to come here, and tourism because that’s a big piece of our economy,” Lavin said.Johnson says Chicago needs new revenue to offset a freeze on property taxes while investing in other areas, including housing and schools.His plan includes reinstating a $4-a-month-per-employee “head tax” on large companies, charging big airlines “for polluting the air” in Chicago and taxing financial transactions made in the city. He also wants to impose a so-called mansion tax, or real estate transfer tax on high-end home sales, and increase the hotel tax.Johnson described the additional hotel tax as an extra $1 per room that most people wouldn't notice. But Michael Jacobson, president of the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association, said it could add up to serious damage for Chicago's bottom line because, without “palm trees or mountains,” most of the city's visitors come for conventions.Jacobson that when convention planners are shopping around for host cities, an extra charge on large blocks of hotel rooms — on top of already higher-than-average lodging taxes — could mean those planners go elsewhere.Johnson, who turns 47 on Monday, has criticized Vallas for not laying out how he would handle Chicago's budget deficit without increasing taxes on people who cannot afford it. Johnson has called the 69-year-old Vallas, who was budget director and Chicago schools CEO under then-Mayor Richard M. Daley, part of “the politics of old.”“If he actually had a plan, he’d put forward a plan,"" Johnson said. “He’s not putting forward a budget plan because he’s going to raise your property taxes.”Vallas says he would look at the city’s entire budget to find efficiencies and “work to avoid” taxes. The one thing he definitely wouldn't do, he said, is propose $800 million in taxes “right out of the box.”Vallas, who also ran schools in New Orleans, Philadelphia and Bridgeport, Connecticut, says his experience makes him the better choice to handle the city's massive budget amid tumultuous times. He criticized Johnson, who serves on the Cook County Board of Commissioners, as lacking the experience needed for the job.“Bottom line is, Brandon has run nothing,"" Vallas said.But Kunz, the longtime North Side resident, said it's time for Chicago to try a new way forward. While the business community may support Vallas, Kunz doesn't think business has the best interest of the people of Chicago at heart. So, he figures, why not tax the rich?“Who else are you going to tax, the average person making $40,000 or $50,000 a year? They're taxed out. They simply can't afford it,"" Kunz said. “Let's see what happens.”___Associated Press writer Claire Savage contributed to this report.",2023/03/27,,World

The tunnel reopened to people on foot or on bikes in July 2022 and has received many accolades, according to the release.Starting Tuesday (March 28), advance registration will no longer be required to visit the 3.19-kilometer Sandiaoling Eco-Friendly Tunnel on weekdays.Those who wish to visit on weekends or national holidays, or who want a guided tour, can register on the official site. The tunnel can be accessed via Houtong or Mudan train stations, but not via Sandiaoling train station.When the tunnel first reopened in 1922, it was used for coal mining, then later transformed into a railway tunnel for Taiwan Railway’s Yilan Line. During the 37 years of closure from 1985 to 2022, with no human interference, the ecology in the abandoned tunnel thrived. Bats reside inside, tadpoles and shrimps swim in the water, and white tree roots spread from the roof like stalactites, forming a vibrant ecology.In addition, large areas of black smoke can be seen at the top of the tunnel, which is the trace of soot left by the steam train that once passed through the tunnel.(New Taipei Tourism and Travel Bureau photos)",2023/03/26,4376,Travel & Cuisine
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847309,Key Bayern players signal concerns as Tuchel takes charge,"DÜSSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Strange, a shock, a sign of how heartless soccer can be.Comments from two key Bayern Munich players hinted at unease in the squad even before new coach Thomas Tuchel takes his first training session.Midfielders Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka voiced concerns Saturday following the sudden firing of Julian Nagelsmann and his replacement with Tuchel, a Champions League winner with Chelsea.“Of course it's strange,” said Kimmich of the coaching change after captaining Germany to a 2-0 friendly win over Peru, in comments reported by German agency dpa. “At the end of the day that's how the business is, not much love, not much heart. We have to learn to cope with and live with the decision.”Kimmich later denied he was criticizing Bayern management and said he was describing soccer in general terms, dpa reported. Kimmich had praised Nagelsmann as an “outstanding” coach Friday, hours before his departure was confirmed. His verdict on Tuchel: “I don't really know him yet.”Goretzka said he trusted the management to do the best for Bayern but that he had been “extremely close” to Nagelsmann and “when someone like that is suddenly no longer there, out of nowhere, I believe it comes as a shock for everyone,"" dpa reported.Kimmich has played 35 times for Bayern already this season, including 10 games as captain, and Goretzka is close behind with 29 appearances. They will still be with the national team preparing for a friendly against Belgium when Tuchel takes charge of a reduced Bayern squad Monday for his first training session.He will have just five days to work with his squad before playing Borussia Dortmund on Saturday in a game that could be crucial to the Bundesliga title race. Dortmund leads Bayern by one point in the standings after Bayern lost Nagelsmann's last game 2-1 to Bayer Leverkusen. On April 11, there's another key game against Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinals.Tuchel said Saturday he was focused on preparing for Dortmund and accepted not everyone would be “super happy” at the coaching change. The priority this week is building motivation for the Dortmund game, he said.Not everyone at Bayern was as close to Nagelsmann as Kimmich and Goretzka were, though. Nagelsmann’s last few months at Bayern were notable for club intrigue. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer went public with his unhappiness over the removal of a favored goalkeeping coach and Nagelsmann hunted for a “mole” he said leaked tactical secrets to a German newspaper.That kind of drama is unlikely to suit Tuchel, who has often made clear his frustration with soccer politics in his previous jobs. By the time he left his last job in Germany at Dortmund in 2017, his relationship with chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke had fractured. Tuchel’s tenure at Paris Saint-Germain saw him win two French titles and reach the Champions League final — losing to Bayern — but his time in France was marked by disagreement with sporting director Leonardo over transfers.Tuchel's departure from Chelsea in September came as a surprise. The new American ownership signed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, an old Tuchel favorite from his Dortmund days, then fired the coach a week later.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847310,"GOP states press voter photo ID rules, with unclear effects","COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — As Ohio’s primary approaches, a strict new photo ID requirement is stirring concerns for military veterans and out-of-state college students, in Amish communities and among older voters.Other Republican-led states are moving in the same direction as they respond to conservative voters unsettled by unfounded claims of widespread fraud and persistent conspiracy theories over the accuracy of U.S. elections. Critics characterize such requirements as an overreaction that could end up disenfranchising eligible voters.Ruth Kohake is among those caught up in the confusion over Ohio's law, which is going into effect this year. The retired nurse from Cincinnati gave up her driver’s license and her car in 2019. Now 82, she thought she might never have to step foot in another state license agency.But Ohio now requires an unexpired photo ID in order for someone to vote, and she'll have to get that at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The law adds passports as valid ID, but eliminates nonphoto documentation such as a bank statement, government check or utility bill for registration and in-person voting. Military IDs also are no longer acceptable when registering to vote.“I’m very, very, very concerned that people are not going to know. They’re going to come to vote and they’re not going to be able to, or they’re going to have to vote provisional,” she said. “It’s just a very upsetting time. Us old people, we have other things to worry about.”Of 35 states that request or require a photo ID to vote, Ohio is now the ninth Republican-controlled state to move to a strict law allowing few to no alternatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Fifteen states allow other ways voters can verify their identify, such as an electric bill, bank statement or signature match.The number of states where voters face strict photo ID requirements is poised to rise in the coming months.Nebraska lawmakers are in the process of establishing a new photo ID program after voters approved a requirement in November. In North Carolina, a photo ID requirement declared unconstitutional just three months ago could be revived by the state Supreme Court that has a new Republican majority. Meanwhile, a new Idaho law, which prohibits students from using college IDs at the polls, drew a recent legal challenge.Wendy Weiser, vice president for democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the new Ohio law undercuts the Republican narrative about the state having a record of clean and well-run elections.“Ohio election officials have long been adamant that this wasn’t needed, that Ohio had a good system for vetting and rooting out any fraud and the proof was in the pudding,” she said.Republican state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, a supporter of the law, said the change will make it harder to cheat.It already has led to frustration and confusion, in part because of the fast-approaching state primary on May 2.Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose ordered counties to begin implementing the fast-tracked law so it would be in effect for the primary, though its start date falls within the early voting period. Waiting until fall, LaRose said, “would result in a clear violation of Ohio law.”That decision is not without complications. The free state photo IDs the law provides won't be available until April 7, the law's effective date, despite military and overseas voting already having begun and early, in-person voting set to start April 4.At the same time, a legal challenge to the law by a Democratic law firm remains unresolved. The lawsuit alleges the law creates “needless discriminatory burdens,” including by requiring photo IDs, making it harder to correct minor mistakes on ballots and restricting mail balloting.Veterans' organizations and county recorders, particularly in the populous, Democratic-leaning counties that include Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, have been vocal about the law excluding county-issued veteran photo IDs, though it does allow military IDs, to vote. They cost less and are valid longer — 10 years — than a driver's license.“People find reasons to fix something that doesn’t need to be fixed,” said Larry Anderson, 85, a veteran from Columbus who has found the veteran ID card a convenience. “Veterans could come back from the wars and not have a driver's license and not drive a car, and it just creates more problems for them.”AMVETS Executive Director Don McCauley said the issue has been brought to lawmakers' attention and he hopes to see it resolved before the next election.Access issues also have arisen among the roughly 37,000 Amish in Ohio's Holmes County, where the largely conservative voters reject being photographed and often lack other forms of government ID.Lawmakers allowed for religious exceptions through an affidavit that the law's supporters say will be easy to use, but Holmes County Elections Director Lisa Welch is worried that confusion and extra paperwork could add to the workloads of already stressed boards of elections.“My biggest concern is the first time through, we get a whole bunch of provisionals (that must be processed separately later),"" she said. ""I’m the only full-time person in the office right now, and we can’t do everything.”Holmes County Commissioner Joe Miller fears the new process could deter some voters.“I want honest voting, I understand that, but a lot of the Amish don’t have the photo ID and won’t do a photo ID,"" he said. ""So what the Amish do usually — they’re pacifists, they don’t fight anybody — they just walk away.”Ohio State University has advised its roughly 16,000 out-of-state students against voting in person on Election Day — for fear that obtaining the necessary state ID card could invalidate their driver's license in their home state and disrupt their financial aid and residency status. The schools suggests such students casting Ohio ballots do so by mail.Backers of the photo ID requirements have widely moved away from the argument that such laws prevent voter fraud, which happens only rarely. The conservative Heritage Foundation's database lists only 26 convictions for voter impersonation fraud — the type deterred by photo ID requirements — anywhere in the U.S. between 2004 and 2022. In presidential elections alone, Americans cast more than 645 million votes during that period.Jason Snead, executive director of the conservative group Honest Elections Project Action, told reporters in a recent policy briefing that robust voter turnout and Democrats' unexpectedly strong performance in the 2022 midterm elections disprove the idea that election security enhancements suppress voters.“I would submit that, actually when you look at the sort of election integrity laws that are advancing through state legislatures and actually getting passed, what is happening in conservative states is far more mainstream than what we’re seeing happen in liberal states,” Snead said.Liz Avore, senior adviser to the Voting Rights Lab, which tracks voting legislation in the states, said voters have made the opposite choice when they've had a say on excessively strict photo ID laws. Arizona voters rejected an effort to enact a stricter photo ID law last fall, for instance, and Michigan voters protected the vote there from photo ID restrictions.So far this year, photo ID proposals also have failed in Virginia and Wyoming.“A really critical distinction to draw is, yes, it's true that the majority of Americans are in favor of voter ID laws, and it’s also true that the majority of voter ID laws are set up to allow people who don't have an ID available to still cast a ballot,” she said.___Associated Press coverage of democracy receives support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847335,Factory or farm? Oregon may alter land use for chipmakers,"NORTH PLAINS, Ore. (AP) — Aaron Nichols walked past rows of kale growing on his farm, his knee-high brown rubber boots speckled with some of the richest soil on earth, and gazed with concern toward fields in the distance. Just over the horizon loomed a gigantic building of the semiconductor chipmaker Intel.For exactly 50 years, the farms and forests that ring Oregon's metropolitan centers have been protected from urban sprawl by the nation’s first statewide law that placed growth boundaries on cities. Cities cannot expand beyond those borders unless they make a request and justify it. Approval by cities and counties can take months or even a few years (larger expansions also need approval by the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development).But now, a bill being considered in Oregon's Legislature could authorize the governor to unilaterally expand those boundaries as part of Oregon’s quest to lure chip companies and provide land for them to build their factories. The measure would also provide $200 million in grants to chipmakers.Farmers and conservationists are deeply worried about the proposal and what it will mean for a state that cherishes its open spaces.“One of the reasons we bought our farm right here is that we knew that for 50 years we’d be farms, and everyone around us would be farms,” Nichols said. “And now we’re not so sure. Now it’s up to one decision by the governor. And that’s a scarier place to be.”State officials and lawmakers, on the other hand, are eager to bring more semiconductor factories to Oregon while billions of dollars of federal funding to promote the industry is available.They were stung by Intel's decision last year to build a massive $20 billion chipmaking complex in Ohio, and not in Oregon where suitable zoned land is scarce.Oregon has its “Silicon Forest” — a counterpoint to California's Silicon Valley — and has been at the center of semiconductor research and production for decades. But Oregon is competing with other states to host multibillion-dollar microchip factories, called fabs. The competition heated up after Congress passed the CHIPS Act in 2022, providing $39 billion for companies constructing or expanding facilities that will manufacture semiconductors and those that will assemble, test and package the chips.Dramatically expanding semiconductor design and manufacturing in Oregon would create tens of thousands of high-paying construction jobs and thousands of manufacturing and supply chain jobs, the Oregon Semiconductor Competitiveness Task Force, said in a report in August.But the task force warned that Oregon needs more buildable industrial land near infrastructure, talented workers and specialized suppliers to attract and retain semiconductor businesses, and called for “urgent legislative attention.”“This is about generational change,"" Democratic state Sen. Janeen Sollman, a chief sponsor of the bill, said during a recent tour of an HP Inc. campus in Corvallis, Oregon. ""This is the opportunity that students will have for their future in going into these types of jobs.”Today, thanks to a former Republican governor, you can drive from many cities in Oregon and within minutes be in farm or ranch country, unlike many states where cities are surrounded by expanses of shopping centers and housing developments.Tom McCall, who served as Oregon's governor from 1967 to 1975, had successfully championed protections for Oregon’s beaches to ensure they remained public. In 1973, he urged lawmakers to push for a tough new land-use law.“Sagebrush subdivisions, coastal ‘condomania’ and the ravenous rampage of suburbia here in the Willamette Valley all threaten to mock Oregon’s status as an environmental model of this nation"" McCall said in a speech before the Legislature in 1973.The Legislature complied, passing a bill that established the nation's first statewide urban growth boundary policy.Washington state and Tennessee followed Oregon’s lead. In 1982, a ballot measure called for a repeal in Oregon. McCall, who was dying of cancer, campaigned against it. Voters upheld Oregon's land-use system by rejecting the measure two months before McCall died.Under Oregon's system, an urban growth boundary designates where a city expects to grow over the next 20 years. Once land is included in a UGB, it is eligible for annexation to a city. Those UGB lines are regularly expanded. From 2016 through 2021, 35 were approved, according to the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development.But the process takes time. McMinnville, in Oregon's fabled wine country, battled for 20 years to expand its boundary, said Robert Parker, director of strategy at the University of Oregon’s Institute for Policy Research and Engagement.Obtaining approval can take months or years, depending on its level of controversy, said Gordon Howard, of Oregon's land conservation department. Appeals to the courts or a state board cause further delays.That's too long a wait for chipmaking companies, especially those that want to take advantage of CHIPS Act funding.“Other states offer a more streamlined approach that is more in sync with the speed of the market,” according to Oregon's semiconductor task force, whose members included then-Gov. Kate Brown.Under the bill, the governor may designate up to a maximum of eight sites for UGB expansion: two that exceed 500 acres (202 hectares) and six smaller sites. Any appeals go straight to the state Supreme Court.The Oregon Farm Bureau, which represents 7,000 family farmers, said the effort should instead focus on lands already within the urban growth boundary.“The conversion of agricultural lands into paved industrial lands is a permanent destruction of our natural and working lands,” said bureau Vice President Lauren Poor. “Once it’s paved, the soil and its ability to sequester carbon, support our food system and generate income for Oregonians is gone forever.”Washington County, where Nichol’s farm is located, produces more clover seed crop than anywhere else in the world, thanks to its unique soil and rainy climate, said Nicole Anderson, an associate professor at Oregon State University's Department of Crop and Soil Science.""I hope that science and consideration of our land resources are considered when this bill is voted on,” Anderson told the Legislature's joint committee on semiconductors on March 13.On Friday, the ways and means committee sent the bill for a vote on the Senate floor. The Senate will consider the priority legislation this week.“I am thrilled to see this legislation pass out of committee and look forward to seeing it through to the finish line,” said Rep. Kim Wallan, a Republican and a chief sponsor of the bill.Parker, the land-use expert, doesn't believe its passage would mark the start of the end of Oregon's treasured policy.“Will there be more challenges and bumps in the road ahead? Yeah, I think so,"" Parker said. “But I feel like it is so well established in the state at this point that it has the inertia to carry it through those challenges.”",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847336,California looks to spend some Medicaid money on housing,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — At the start of 2022, Thomas Marshall weighed 311 pounds. He had been hospitalized 10 times in five years, including six surgeries. He had an open wound on his left leg that refused to heal — made worse by living in a dirty, moldy house with five other people, two ball pythons, four Chihuahuas and a cage full of rats.More than a year later, Marshall has lost nearly 100 pounds. His wound has healed. His blood pressure has returned to normal levels. His foot, which had nerve damage, has improved to the point he goes on regular walks to the park.Lots of factors are at play in Marshall's dramatic turnaround, but the one he credits the most is finally having stable housing, after the nonprofit Sacramento Covered helped him get a one-bedroom, 500 square-foot (46.4-square-meter) apartment in a downtown high rise. He has hardwood floors, white pine cabinets and a glass jar on the counter filled with Bit-O-Honeys.“To me it's the most important 500 square feet I've ever had,” he said. “Living here has just improved my well-being in every possible way.”Marshall's story is part of a radical rethinking of the relationship between housing and health care in the U.S. For decades, Medicaid, the joint state and federal health insurance program for people with disabilities or low incomes, would only pay for medical expenses. But last year the Biden administration gave Arizona and Oregon permission to use Medicaid money for housing — a nod to reams of research showing people in stable housing are healthier.Now California wants to join those states, building on the success of programs like the one that got Marshall housing. Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed spending more than $100 million per year in the state's Medicaid program to pay for up to six months of housing for people who are or risk becoming homeless; are coming out of prison or foster care; or are at risk for hospitalization or emergency room visits.It would be the biggest test yet of using Medicaid money for housing. California has the nation's largest Medicaid program, with more than 13 million patients — or about a third of the state's population. California also has nearly a third of the nation's homeless population, according to federal data.“It’s a huge step toward breaking down the silos that have gotten in the way of taking care of the whole person rather than limb by limb and illness by illness,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group.It would also be an expensive step. California is expected to have a $22.5 billion budget deficit this year, and it could get bigger in years to come. Meanwhile the state's Medicaid spending is projected to increase by $2.5 billion over the next three years, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.“What we're really doing is expanding the welfare state, which is going to become just a huge financial problem,” said Wayne Winegarden, senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, a group that advocates for free-market policies.California experimented with using Medicaid money for some housing-related expenses in 2016 when it launched a pilot project in 26 counties. While Medicaid did not pay for rent, it paid for things like security deposits and furniture.In Marshall's case, he pays his own rent, using some of the $1,153 per month he gets from Social Security and Supplemental Security Income. But Medicaid paid for his security deposit, bed, sofa, table, chairs and nearly 3 1/2 gallons of Pine Sol. Marshall said keeping his apartment clean is one thing that helped his leg wound to finally heal.Over five years the program has reduced expensive hospital stays and emergency room visits for people on Medicaid, saving taxpayers an average of $383 per patient per year, according to an analysis by researchers at UCLA.Now California wants to go further by using Medicaid money to directly pay some people's rent. Democratic Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula, who chairs the budget subcommittee that will vet Newsom's proposal, said lawmakers are supportive. Arambula spent a decade as an emergency room doctor.“I became very good at being able to get cockroaches out of people's ears,” Arambula said. “The living conditions of many of our communities, especially in our rural communities, really can affect a person's ability to get adequate sleep, to be prepared for the next day and to stay healthy.”Advocates for homeless people say they welcome such programs but spending more money on rent isn't enough, noting the state still has a massive shortage of affordable housing.Kelly Bennett, founder and CEO of Sacramento Covered, said that during California's first experiment with using Medicaid money for housing services, it would often take up to eight months for workers to place a patient in an apartment. In some cases, people have waited for years to find a place.“Even when you have the deposit money and you have some rental subsidy, it's still very, very challenging to find units — and to find units where the landlords will lease to our clients,” Bennett said.Marshall said he grew up in Sacramento and got a degree in dietic technology and culinary arts. But a 30-year addiction to meth landed him on the streets from the late 1990s through about 2006. He camped at an old landfill, often eating leftovers from people’s picnics at a nearby park.He applied for apartments at multiple subsidized housing buildings, but never made it off the wait list. It took him about a year to get his current apartment, where he pays $186 per month with the help of a subsidy.“I feel like I'm electric. ... I have power and ability to do things that I could not do for a very long time,"" Marshall, 64, said. “Whatever years I've got left now, I'm going to spend them up here in the glass tower.”",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847337,Ukraine demands emergency UN meeting over Putin nuclear plan,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's government on Sunday called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to “counter the Kremlin's nuclear blackmail” after Russian President Vladimir Putin revealed plans to station tactical atomic weapons in Belarus.One Ukrainian official said Russia ""took Belarus as a nuclear hostage.”Further heightening tensions, an explosion deep inside Russia wounded three people Sunday. Russian authorities blamed a Ukrainian drone for the blast, which damaged residential buildings in a town just 175 kilometers (110 miles) south of Moscow.Russia has said the plan to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus comes in response to the West's increasing military support for Ukraine. Putin announced the plan in a TV interview that aired Saturday, saying it was triggered by a U.K. decision this past week to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium.Putin argued that by deploying its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia was following the lead of the United States. He noted that Washington has nuclear weapons based in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.“We are doing what they have been doing for decades, stationing them in certain allied countries, preparing the launch platforms and training their crews,” he said.Ukraine's Foreign Ministry condemned the move in a statement Sunday and demanded an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.“Ukraine expects effective action to counter the Kremlin's nuclear blackmail by the U.K., China, the U.S. and France,” the statement read, saying these countries “have a special responsibility” regarding nuclear aggression.“The world must be united against someone who endangers the future of human civilization,” the statement said.Ukraine has not commented on Sunday's explosion inside Russia. It left a crater about 15 meters (50 feet) in diameter and five meters deep (16 feet), according to media reports.Russian state-run news agency Tass reported authorities identified the drone as a Ukrainian Tu-141. The Soviet-era drone was reintroduced in Ukraine in 2014, and has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).The explosion took place in the town of Kireyevsk in the Tula region, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) from the border with Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said the drone crashed after an electronic jamming system disabled its navigation.Similar drone attacks have been common during the war, although Ukraine hardly ever acknowledges responsibility. On Monday, Russia said Ukrainian drones attacked civilian facilities in the town of Dzhankoi in Russia-annexed Crimea. Ukraine’s military said several Russian cruise missiles were destroyed, but did not specifically claim responsibility.In December, the Russian military reported several Ukrainian drone attacks on long-range bomber bases deep inside Russia. The Russian Defense Ministry said the drones were shot down, but acknowledged that their debris damaged some aircraft and killed several servicemen.Also, Russian authorities have reported attacks by small drones in the Bryansk and Belgorod regions on the border with Ukraine.On Saturday, Putin argued that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has long asked to have nuclear weapons in his country again to counter NATO. Belarus shares borders with three NATO members — Latvia, Lithuania and Poland — and Russia used Belarusian territory as a staging ground to send troops into neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.Both Lukashenko's support of the war and Putin's plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus has been denounced by the Belarusian opposition.Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, tweeted Sunday that Putin’s announcement was “a step towards internal destabilization” of Belarus that maximized “the level of negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. The Kremlin, Danilov added, “took Belarus as a nuclear hostage.”Tactical nuclear weapons are intended for use on the battlefield and have a short range and a low yield compared with much more powerful nuclear warheads fitted to long-range missiles. Russia plans to maintain control over the ones it sends to Belarus, and construction of storage facilities for them will be completed by July 1, Putin said.Russia has stored its tactical nuclear weapons at dedicated depots on its territory, and moving part of the arsenal to a storage facility in Belarus would up the ante in the Ukrainian conflict by placing them closer to Russian aircraft and missiles already stationed there.The U.S. said it would “monitor the implications” of Putin’s announcement. So far, Washington hasn't seen ""any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.In Germany, the foreign ministry called it a “further attempt at nuclear intimidation,” German news agency dpa reported late Saturday. The ministry went on to say that “the comparison drawn by President Putin to NATO’s nuclear participation is misleading and cannot be used to justify the step announced by Russia.”___Kirsten Grieshaber contributed to this report from Berlin.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847338,Pakistani ex-PM Khan sets out economic rescue plan at rally,"LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan led a rally in the eastern city of Lahore in the early hours of Sunday, setting out his ideas to revive the country’s spiraling economy and accusing the government of lacking a rescue plan.The International Monetary Fund has delayed a $6 billion bailout over Pakistan’s failure to meet the terms of a 2019 deal. The government blames that failure on Khan, now the opposition leader.Khan spoke to thousands of party supporters on a damp night in Lahore from a bulletproof box perched atop a shipping container. In his address, at the Minar-e-Pakistan landmark, the former cricketer railed against the government and challenged it to come forward with a rescue plan to bring the country out of its many economic difficulties.“We need surgery to correct the governance system of this country, for which ensuring rule of law is a must,” he said. “To reduce the current account deficit, we have to encourage our overseas Pakistanis to invest in the country.”Khan’s plan focuses on boosting revenue through foreign exchange and investment, widening the tax network, and anti-money laundering initiatives.He also outlined steps to promote agriculture, tourism, a housing finance scheme, a health card program, and small- and medium-sized industries.Khan said direct foreign investments from Pakistanis overseas would help the country to avoid going cap in hand to the IMF for help. He told the crowds, who waited hours to hear him speak, that the net worth of 18,000 Pakistani-Americans in the US is $200 billion and the net worth of the top 10 Pakistani-American businessmen is $25 billion. “And (still) we are bowing before the IMF to get a $6 billion deal.”He said the main problems plaguing Pakistan’s economy are foreign debt, a current account deficit, reduced exports, pressure on the rupee and tax evasion.Local authorities warned Khan not to hold a public rally in view of a possible terrorist attack. The security alert said militants from a banned outfit had reached Lahore and could target the public gathering or the security personnel deployed there.The 70-year-old politician, who was ousted as prime minister in a no-confidence motion last April and is campaigning for early elections, blames the government for being part of a “regime change operation” against him. The government denies the allegation.Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif is struggling to maintain economic and political stability amid dwindling foreign exchange reserves and the aftermath of last summer’s record-breaking floods, which killed 1,739 people and destroyed millions of homes. The floods caused more than $30 billion in damages. He is also dealing with militant violence, which has increased since November when the Pakistani Taliban ended a cease-fire with government forces.Sharif criticized Khan in a tweet Sunday, saying he has “always been about grandstanding and rhetoric” and that Pakistan's current political, governance, and economic challenges have their roots in his failed policies.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847339,Planets on parade: 5 will be lined up in night sky this week,"NEW YORK (AP) — Keep an eye to the sky this week for a chance to see a planetary hangout.Five planets — Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus and Mars — will line up near the moon.WHERE AND WHEN CAN YOU SEE THEM?The best day to catch the whole group is Tuesday. You’ll want to look to the western horizon right after sunset, said NASA astronomer Bill Cooke.The planets will stretch from the horizon line to around halfway up the night sky. But don't be late: Mercury and Jupiter will quickly dip below the horizon around half an hour after sunset.The five-planet spread can be seen from anywhere on Earth, as long as you have clear skies and a view of the west.“That’s the beauty of these planetary alignments. It doesn’t take much,” Cooke said.DO I NEED BINOCULARS?Maybe. Jupiter, Venus and Mars will all be pretty easy to see since they shine brightly, Cooke said. Venus will be one of the brightest things in the sky, and Mars will be hanging out near the moon with a reddish glow. Mercury and Uranus could be trickier to spot, since they will be dimmer. You’ll probably need to grab a pair of binoculars.If you’re a “planet collector,” it’s a rare chance to spot Uranus, which usually isn't visible, Cooke said. Look out for its green glow just above Venus.DOES THIS HAPPEN OFTEN?Different numbers and groups of planets line up in the sky from time to time. There was a five-planet lineup last summer and there's another one in June, with a slightly different makeup.This kind of alignment happens when the planets’ orbits line them up on one side of the sun from Earth’s perspective, Cooke said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847340,"Gap grows between TikTok users, lawmakers on potential ban","NEW YORK (AP) — On the one side are dozens of lawmakers on Capitol Hill issuing dire warnings about security breaches and possible Chinese surveillance.On the other are some 150 million TikTok users in the U.S. who just want to be able to keep making and watching short, fun videos offering makeup tutorials and cooking lessons, among other things.The disconnect illustrates the uphill battle that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle face in trying to convince the public that China could use TikTok as a weapon against the American people. But many users on the platform are more concerned about the possibility of the government taking away their favorite app.TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said during a nearly six-hour congressional hearing Thursday that the platform has never turned over user data to the Chinese government, and wouldn’t do so if asked.Nevertheless, lawmakers, the FBI and officials at other agencies continue to raise alarms that Chinese law compels Chinese companies like TikTok's parent company ByteDance to fork over data to the government for whatever purposes it deems to involve national security. There’s also concern Beijing might try to push pro-China narratives or misinformation through the platform.“I want to say this to all the teenagers out there, and TikTok influencers who think we’re just old and out of touch and don’t know what we’re talking about, trying to take your favorite app,” said Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw during the hearing. “You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but you will be one day.”Many TikTok users reacted to the hearing by posting videos critical of lawmakers who grilled Chew and frequently cut him off from speaking. Some called a potential TikTok ban, as some lawmakers and the Biden administration has reportedly threatened, the “biggest scam” of the year. And others blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on another tech rival, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.But few expressed fear of possible Chinese surveillance or security breaches that lawmakers continue to amplify as they look to rein in TikTok.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., whose district is in the heart of Silicon Valley, said he is mindful of the value that platforms like TikTok provide to young people as an outlet for creative expression and building community. “But there’s absolutely no reason that an American technology company can’t do that,” said Khanna, the top Democrat on the cyber subcommittee on House Armed Service. “America has the most innovative technology companies in the world.”He added that Congress should move forward with a proposal that would force platform’s sale to an American company for continued access for its millions of users while “ensuring that the platform isn’t subject to Chinese propaganda or compromises people’s privacy.”According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, two-thirds of Americans aged 13 to 17 use TikTok, and 16% of all teens say they use it almost constantly. It's because of TikTok's large user base that Lindsay Gorman, a former tech adviser for the Biden administration who now works as a senior fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund, says the Biden administration will likely pursue every option short of a ban first. That would include the option for the app's Chinese owners to divest, which the Biden administration is reportedly demanding from TikTok if it wants to avoid a nationwide ban.TikTok itself has been trying to leverage its popularity. On Wednesday, it sent dozens of influencers to Congress to lobby against a ban. It has also ramped up a broader public relations campaign, plastering ads all over Washington that tout its promises of securing users’ data and privacy and creating a safe platform for its young users.Some popular TikTokers who speak out against a ban are concerned — and angered — about how it might impact their personal lives. Many earn income from their videos and have inked brand partnerships to market products to their audiences — another stream of revenue that could be wiped away if the platform disappears. They would also lose the social capital that comes from having a large following on the trend-setting app.Demetrius Fields, a standup comedian who amassed 2.8 million followers on TikTok from posting comedy sketches, said he spent a long time building his career and followership on the platform. He has one active deal with the fast fashion retailer Fashion Nova, which allows him to earn an income along with the videos he posts on TikTok.If the app is taken away, he said building an audience on another platform would be challenging for him due to the competition to grab user attention.“The financial implications for me would be pretty terrible,” Fields said. “I would probably have to go back to working a desk job.”Sarah Pikhit, an 18-year-old student at Penn State University, said she used to use TikTok a lot, but started cutting back when she realized how much time she spent scrolling through videos on the app. She still uses it, but mostly to post her own content, which she says she can do on other platforms. She said she wouldn’t care if TikTok gets banned — but her friends would.“They like the excessive scrolling,” Pikhit said.—-Associated Press writer Farnoush Amiri in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847356,States' divisions on abortion widen after Roe overturned,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A group of Tennessee Republicans began this year’s legislative session hoping to add narrow exceptions to one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, armed with the belief that most people — even in conservative Tennessee — reject extremes on the issue.Tennessee law requires doctors to prove in court that they were saving a woman’s life when they performed an abortion. Surely, the lawmakers thought, they could win concessions that would allow doctors to use their good faith judgment about when abortion is necessary to save a woman’s life. But after a key anti-abortion group stepped in, the lawmakers had to settle for a stricter legal standard that moves the needle very little.Like lawmakers in several GOP-led states who started the year thinking about moderating the nation’s toughest abortion laws, Tennessee's lawmakers found no appetite among their colleagues for loosening the rules.During the first legislative sessions in most states since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, lawmakers on both sides are dug in. Republicans are moving to make abortion restrictions tougher. Democrat-dominated states are moving to protect access for their residents and, now, for the residents of other states arriving for care.“Abortion is one of the most stark examples of the political divide between red states and blue states, even when we know that people generally favor the middle on abortion,” said Gretchen Ely, a professor in the College of Social Work at the University of Tennessee.Last year's overturning of the 1973 Roe decision meant that state laws banning or restricting abortion if such a ruling arrived took effect. Many were met with legal challenges. Currently, bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy are in place in 13 states and on hold in another four because of court injunctions.Lawmakers in most states have introduced abortion-related legislation this year. Republican-backed measures include funding for counseling centers that discourage abortion, bans on medication abortions and other restrictions. Democrats' bills include expanding insurance coverage for abortion and knocking back restrictions implemented in the past.The legislative action comes after voters in six states — conservative, moderate and liberal -- voted in referendums last year and abortion access proponents prevailed in all of them. Polling has shown the public was unhappy with the overturning of Roe even as they also support some abortion restrictions.But Mary Ziegler, a legal historian at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said anti-abortion groups are anticipating that abortion rights support will gradually diminish.“There’s a belief that people will be more open to more and more stringent bans the further we get away from Roe v. Wade being the law,” she said.Kelsey Pritchard, a member of the state affairs staff at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said those ballot measure losses motivated anti-abortion groups to get their message out more strongly. “It was a wakeup call for how much work we have to do,"" she said.The ban currently implemented in Tennessee is among the most stringent. Instead of an exception for abortions to save the life of the woman, it includes an “affirmative defense” for doctors, placing the burden on them to prove an abortion was medically necessary.Now, a scaled-back proposal is moving through the Legislature. It removes the affirmative defense language but still doesn't grant access to abortions in the cases of “medically futile pregnancies” and lethal fetal anomalies. Doctors warned the new exemption will do little to relieve worries about being prosecuted.Tennessee Right to Life had already revoked its endorsement of one GOP lawmaker — seen as a key tool for winning over conservative voters — after Republican Sen. Richard Briggs called for changes while admitting that he voted in favor of the state’s so-called trigger ban because he didn’t believe Roe would actually be overturned. Now the lobbying group warned that it could do the same with others who tried to weaken the ban.""This new amended bill only allows a woman to access an abortion if she’s damn near on her deathbed,” said Democratic Sen. London Lamar, who experienced her own near-fatal pregnancy loss several years ago.In Kentucky, a Republican bill to allow abortion in the case of pregnancies caused by rape or incest also made no headway.Other red states are looking to tighten the bans and restrictions already in place.Florida, which currently bans abortions after 15 weeks, is considering banning them them at six weeks’ gestation — a move backed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce his candidacy for president in the coming months.Wyoming recently adopted a ban on abortions throughout pregnancy — though its enforcement was halted last week by a judge — as well as a separate law specifically to bar medication abortions, which are the most common method of ending pregnancies in the U.S.And South Carolina raised eyebrows when more than 20 GOP lawmakers sponsored a bill classifying abortion as homicide — opening the door for women to face the death penalty, a step no state has yet taken. The bill has since stalled in the House amid backlash, with nine sponsors removing their names as supporters. Instead, lawmakers are advancing an abortion ban with some exceptions.In blue states, the push to protect abortion access continues.In liberal Oregon, there are no legal restrictions on when abortions can be provided. But the Legislature is considering a sweeping measure that would allow someone to bring a civil lawsuit against a government agency for interfering with reproductive health rights and also for minors to access certain gender-affirming care services without parental involvement. Dozens of people gave emotional testimony last week on the bill.With both chambers of the Minnesota legislature now under Democratic control, the state adopted a law to codify abortion rights that were protected under a 1995 state Supreme Court decision. Lawmakers have also pushed ahead with a measure to prohibit enforcement of laws, subpoenas, judgements or extradition requests from other states against people who get, perform or assist with abortions in Minnesota.Several other blue states enacted similar measures last year through laws or executive orders, including Hawaii, whose governor signed one last Wednesday.That brand of protections came largely in response to a 2021 Texas law that relies on private lawsuits to enforce abortion bans.Ballot measures to approve or ban abortions could also go to voters this year or next in several states, including Maryland and Missouri.But in at least one case, anti-abortion groups are playing a long game with those efforts.In Ohio, they're trying to keep a ballot question to guarantee the right to abortion off the ballot in November — all while trying to get another question on the ballot. That question would amend the state constitution to require ballot measures have at least 60% approval to be adopted, rather than the current standard of more than half, making it harder for abortion rights amendments in the future to pass.___Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847357,"In Ghana, Kamala Harris 'excited about the future of Africa'","ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris was greeted by schoolchildren, dancers and drummers as she arrived Sunday in Ghana for the start of a weeklong visit to Africa intended to deepen U.S. relationships amid global competition over the continent’s future.""We are looking forward to this trip as a further statement of the long and enduring very important relationship and friendship between the people of the United States and those who live on this continent,” Harris said.The children cheered and waved Ghanaian and American flags as she stepped off her plane after an overnight flight. She smiled broadly and placed a hand on her heart as she passed by the dancers.“What an honor it is to be here in Ghana and on the continent of Africa,"" Harris said. “I'm very excited about the future of Africa.” She said she wanted to promote economic growth and food security and welcomed the chance to ”witness firsthand the extraordinary innovation and creativity that is occurring on this continent.”Ghana is one of the continent's most stable democracies, but Harris is arriving at a time of severe challenges for the West African nation. Its economy, among the fastest growing in the world before the COVID-19 pandemic, faces a debt crisis and soaring inflation that is driving up the cost of food and other necessities.A country of 34 million people that’s slightly smaller than Oregon, Ghana is also wary of threats from instability in the region. Burkina Faso and Mali have each endured two coups in recent years, and local offshoots of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group operate in the area known as the Sahel, which is north of Ghana. Thousands of people have been killed and millions more have been displaced.The fighting has created an opening for the Russian mercenary outfit known as Wagner, which maintains a presence in Africa despite participating in the invasion of Ukraine as well. Mali welcomed Wagner after it pushed out French troops that were based there, and there are fears that Burkina Faso will do the same.The economic and security challenges will likely be discussed on Monday when Harris meets with Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo. They also are expected to hold a joint news conference.The two leaders have met twice before, both times in Washington.During their first meeting, in September 2021, Akufo-Addo said “our big challenge — and it is a challenge of all those who want to develop democratic institutions on our continent — is to ensure and reassure our people that democratic institutions can be a vehicle for the resolution of their big problem — that is economic development as the means to eradicate poverty on the continent.”Harris is the highest-profile member of President Joe Biden’s administration to visit Africa this year. After Ghana, she plans to visit Tanzania and Zambia. She returns to Washington on April 2.The expanded outreach is intended to counter China’s influence, which has become entrenched in recent years through infrastructure initiatives, lending money and expanding telecommunications networks. Ghana, for example, reached a $2 billion deal with a Chinese company to develop roads and other projects in return for access to a key mineral for producing aluminum.Most of Harris’ events in Ghana will focus on young people. Africa’s population has a median age of 19.On Monday, she plans to visit a skate park and co-working space that has a recording studio for local artists. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is accompanying her on the trip, will hold a town hall meeting with actors from a local television show and attend a girls basketball clinic.In the evening, they will attend a state banquet with the Ghanaian president and first lady.On Tuesday, Harris will give a speech and visit Cape Coast Castle, where enslaved Africans were once loaded on ships bound for the Americas.Before leaving for Tanzania on Wednesday, Harris will meet with women entrepreneurs and Emhoff will tour a chocolate company that was founded by two sisters. The name of the company, ’57 Chocolate, is a reference to when Ghana became independent.Cameron Hudson, an Africa expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Ghana has been “a bright spot in the region” but “it’s facing some very stiff headwinds.”He noted that the country’s south, where the capital of Accra is located, is primarily Christian, while the northern area is mostly Muslim, and there are fears that militants could expand their operations there.“These terrorist groups are able to prey on existing fault lines within these societies,” he said.Hudson said Ghanaian authorities have intercepted weapons shipments and human smugglers. Sometimes there are bursts of violence, and the number of incidents spiked last year.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847358,Veto puts Kentucky in thick of fight over transgender rights,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's veto of a bill aimed at transgender health care puts the state in the middle of a national fight, but with more immediate consequences as the state's looming election offers an early test on the state-by-state assault on gender-affirming care for minors.The veto issued Friday set off competing messages likely to be repeated until the November election — when Bluegrass State voters will decide whether to reward the Democratic governor with a second term or hand over the governor's office to a Republican. No one seems to know yet how much weight voters will put on the transgender issue with the general election more than seven months away.The legislation in Kentucky is part of a widespread movement, with Republican state lawmakers in other states approving extensive measures that restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ people this year, from bills targeting trans athletes and drag performers to measures limiting gender-affirming care.Beshear framed the Republican-backed bill in Kentucky as an example of government overreach into parental rights. The sweeping bill would ban gender-affirming care for minors — one of many provisions that would affect the lives of young transgender people.“At the end of the day, this is about my belief — and, I think, the belief of the majority of Kentuckians — that parents should get to make important medical decisions about their children, not big government,"" Beshear told reporters soon after his veto.Kentucky's GOP-dominated legislature passed the bill by lopsided margins. Lawmakers will reconvene Wednesday for the final two days of this year’s session, when they could vote to override the veto.Republicans took immediate aim at the governor's veto, saying he veered too far for most Kentuckians. Republican Party of Kentucky spokesperson Sean Southard asked: “Is Andy Beshear the governor of Kentucky or California?” He predicted the governor will pay a political price for his action.""Once this campaign is over, today may very well be remembered as the day Andy Beshear lost his bid for reelection,” Southard said Friday.Republicans could try to capitalize on the political divide over transgender rights to motivate socially conservative voters to flock to the polls in November, when state constitutional offices are on the ballot. Several leading GOP contenders for governor were aligned in condemning Beshear's veto.“If the Republicans choose to make this a centerpiece of the campaign against Beshear, it’s going to hurt him,” said Scott Jennings, a Kentucky-based Republican political commentator.Beshear cited his own religious faith as a factor in rejecting the bill, saying: “I believe every single child is a child of God.”Twelve candidates in all are competing for the Republican nomination for governor in the state's May primary. Beshear’s bid for a second term is drawing national attention to see if the popular incumbent can win again in the Republican-trending state. Beshear has won praise for his responses to devastating tornadoes and flooding, as well as a series of economic development successes.The bill's opponents say they've got the public on their side and predict Beshear will benefit. They pointed to statewide polling released last month showing a majority of Kentuckians believe decisions over a transgender teen’s health care should be left with the parent, not determined by the state.“Folks who have never been involved with politics or legislation have been activated by the Kentucky General Assembly’s all-out war on LGBTQ kids,” said Chris Hartman, executive director of the Kentucky-based Fairness Campaign.Social conservatives in Kentucky were dealt a setback in last year's general election when statewide voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion.The transgender health care bill sparked emotional responses from opponents as it was fast-tracked to legislative passage by GOP supermajorities in mid-March. It would ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors. It would outlaw gender reassignment surgery for anyone under 18, as well as the use of puberty blockers and hormones, and inpatient and outpatient gender-affirming hospital services.Doctors would have to set a timeline to “detransition” children already taking puberty blockers or undergoing hormone therapy. They could continue offering care as they taper a child’s treatments if removing them from the treatment immediately could harm the child.The bill’s supporters say they're trying to protect children from undertaking gender-affirming treatments they might regret as adults. Research shows such regret is rare. Gender-affirming medical treatments have long been available in the U.S. and are endorsed by major medical associations.The bill would require school districts to devise bathroom policies that, “at a minimum,” would not allow transgender children to use the bathroom aligned with their gender identities. And it would allow teachers to refuse to refer to transgender students by the pronouns they use and would require schools to notify parents when lessons related to human sexuality are going to be taught.Debates over transgender rights garnered considerable attention throughout Kentucky's legislative session, but in Pike County in eastern Kentucky, the issue has been a non-factor, said Pike County Judge-Executive Ray Jones II, a Democrat who supports Beshear.“It’s not even been an issue up here,"" said Jones, a former state senator. ""People are worried about inflation, they’re worried about the economy, they’re worried about jobs. Nobody’s called my office to discuss transgender issues.”Summing up the potential political fallout from the veto, Jones said: “People who would vote because of the governor’s veto would likely not vote for him anyway.”",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847359,Horse racing's national anti-doping program starts Monday,"Horse racing’s efforts to clean up the sport and level the playing field take another step forward Monday with the launch of a new anti-doping program.It’s an attempt to centralize the drug testing of racehorses and manage the results, as well as dole out uniform penalties to horses and trainers instead of the current patchwork rules that vary from state to state.The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act (HISA) was created by the federal government nearly three years ago. It has two programs: racetrack safety, which went into effect in July, and anti-doping and medication control.“It’s one standard. You can be in Kentucky, you can be in Ohio, you can be in California and you’re going to be judged by the same standard,” HISA CEO Lisa Lazarus said.HISA’s Horseracing Integrity and Welfare Unit — its independent enforcement agency — has reached agreements with all of the state racing commissions and/or racetracks that will have live racing as of Monday.Seven of the biggest racing states — Arkansas, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania, as well as Will Rogers Downs in Oklahoma — will continue to use their current staff to collect samples.In Arizona, Illinois and Ohio, there is no signed voluntary agreement with HISA, so it contracted directly with either current staff or hired its own personnel to collect samples. Post-race testing only in New York will be handled this way.States that have live racing after mid-April are in discussion with the enforcement agency, HISA said.The agency will work with accredited labs in Ohio, Illinois, Colorado, California, Pennsylvania and Kentucky to analyze samples.“For the first time, racing’s labs will be harmonized and held to the same performance standards nationwide,” said Ben Mosier, executive director of the enforcement agency. “Thoroughbred racehorses will be tested for the same substances at the same levels, regardless of where they are located or compete.”Unlike the central offices that govern the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, the 38 U.S. racing states have long operated under rules that vary from track to track. Horses, owners, trainers and jockeys move frequently between states to compete. Locales would honor punishments meted out elsewhere, but inconsistencies created confusion and made it possible to game the system.Lazarus said that in talking with horsemen they want three things from HISA: Catch the cheaters, be realistic about medication, and be aware of environmental contaminants that trainers cannot control but can trigger positive tests.“That’s exactly what our program does,” she said recently.HISA has been met with resistance in its short existence.Last year, a federal appeals court ruled it unconstitutional, saying Congress gave too much authority to the group it established to oversee the racing industry. Congress tweaked the wording of the original legislation to fix that. It also gave the Federal Trade Commission the authority to oversee HISA.Legal challenges in Texas and Louisiana to HISA resulted in the federal appeals court preventing it from operating, so state regulations will continue to govern the sport. Racetracks in Texas and Nebraska have chosen not to broadcast their simulcast signals out of state, so HISA currently has no authority to regulate them, Lazarus said.As a result of the ongoing legal issues surrounding HISA, the anti-doping program won’t begin in every state on Monday as Lazarus had hoped.“It’s not perfect,” she said. “We have to change some things, we have to see how some things go.”There's also been vocal opposition among some in the industry over the prospect of sweeping change — as well as its cost to racetracks, horse owners and trainers, and the impact it will have on business.“They’ve been taking away certain medications, therapy machines, things that are truly beneficial,” said trainer Bret Calhoun, whose stable operates in Louisiana, Kentucky and Texas. “They’re having the opposite effect of what they’re saying … safety of the horse and rider. They’re doing absolutely the opposite.”Calhoun spoke earlier this month at the National Horsemen’s Benevolent & Protective Association national convention in Louisiana.Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry was even more blunt.“At the core of HISA is this: a handful of wealthy players wish to control the sport through a one-size-fits-all, pay-to-play scheme that will decimate the inclusive culture of horse racing,” he said at the convention.Lazarus counters the criticism, saying, “We’re there to make racing better.”She has said she’s aiming for transparent investigations and speedier resolutions of disputes. And Lazarus has spent much of her first year on the job trying to “overcommunicate and overeducate.”“I’m really hopeful that the message is getting through,” she said.There will be no trial period for infractions under the new rules. Veterinarians who administer medications to horses have had to get up to speed on the regulations as well as trainers who are ultimately responsible for what goes into their horses.“Change I think is always hard,” Lazarus said, “and this is like seismic change.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847389,Ukraine updates: Kyiv slams Russia's Belarus nuclear plan,"Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on Sunday said it was seeking an emergency meeting of the United Nation's Security Council to counter Russia's ""nuclear blackmail"" over a planned move to deploy tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a decision to station the weapons there a day earlier — sending a warning to NATO, and escalating a standoff with the alliance over its military support for Ukraine.""Ukraine expects effective actions to counteract the Kremlin's nuclear blackmail from the United Kingdom, China, the United States and France,"" Kyiv's foreign ministry said.""We demand that an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council be immediately convened for this purpose,"" it added.Earlier, one of the chief advisers to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday said Russian plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus would cause destabilization there.Although the move was not a major surprise, it is one of the most significant nuclear developments since Russia launched its invasion in February last year.The head of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, called the announcement ""a step towards internal destabilization of the country.""He said it would maximize the level of ""negative perception and public rejection"" of Russia and Putin among Belarusians.""The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,"" he tweeted.Another of Zelenskyy's advisers on Sunday mocked the announcement as ""too predictable.""""Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing and all he can do is scare with tactics,"" Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted.The Russian president likened his plans to the US deploying its weapons in Europe, and said Moscow would not be transferring control of the weapons to Minsk. However, it is the first time since the mid-1990s that Russia has stationed such weapons outside its borders.NATO called Putin's analogy ""misleading,"" saying its members allies — unlike Russia — acted with full respect to their
international commitments.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Sunday, March 26:Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow and Beijing are not building a military alliance and that cooperation between their armed services is ""transparent.""Putin made the comments in a broadcast on Sunday, days after he hosted Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the Kremlin.At their meeting, the pair professed friendship and they pledged closer ties, including in the military sphere, as Russia struggles to make battlefield gains in Ukraine.""We are not creating any military alliance with China,"" Putin said on state television. ""Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret.""Putin, meanwhile, accused the United States and NATO of seeking to build a new global ""axis""Beijing has refrained from criticizing Putin's decision and has touted a peace plan for Ukraine — something the West dismisses as a ruse to buy Putin more time to rebuild his forces in Ukraine.The US has recently voiced concern that Beijing could start arming Russia although China has denied this.The UK Ministry of Defence says Russia has likely launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles against targets across Ukraine.These attacks followed a two-week pause in such drone attacks in late February 2023. Russia has likely started receiving regular resupplies of small numbers of Shahed drones, the ministry's daily report said.British analysts think Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia's Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the northeast.""This allows Russia flexibility to target a broad sector of Ukraine and decreases flying time to targets in the north of Ukraine,"" said the report, adding that this was likely to be a further attempt to stretch Ukrainian air defenses.The governor of Ukraine's central bank has said the country will no longer resort to ""dangerous"" monetary financing to fund the war against Russia.National Bank of Ukraine chief Andriy Pyshnyi was speaking to the Financial Times newspaper in an interview published on Sunday.Kyiv's central bank was last year forced to print billions of hryvnia, Ukraine's currency, to plug a budget shortfall.Pyshnyi said the course of action had ""created huge risks for macro-financial stability"" and added that an ""open conflict"" with the government over the issue had been resolved.""It was a quick remedy, but very dangerous,"" Pyshnyi told the newspaper.Russian President Vladimir Putin says he struck a deal with his Belarusian counterpart to station tactical nuclear weapons on that country's territory. It would be the first time Moscow has based the arms outside the country since the mid-1990s.Howitzers without GPS, rocket launchers restricted to short-range: The US is sending Ukraine weapons with critical limitations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847390,"Too little, too late? The complicated art of comparing pension systems","French President Emmanuel Macron wants to raise the retirement age in France from 62 to 64. His plans have sparked protests and strikes across France.But in a number of other European countries, people are shaking their heads at the vehemence of the French demonstrations. They already work to an older age before being eligible for pensions. In Germany, for example, the pensionable age is to climb gradually to 67, starting from 2024.""It is always hard to compare pension systems because they are all very complex and very different. But this comparison is skewed,"" says Ulrich Becker from the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy, which compares pension schemes from around the world with its ""Pension Map.""That is because the rise that has brought so many out to protest in France is actually an increase in the earliest age at which paid workers can retire without deductions from their pensions. Previously they had to work for 41-and-a-half years. After the reforms, it is supposed to rise to 43 years.In Germany, one can retire at the age of 63, but only if you have already contributed to the pension funds for 45 years. These conditions are further complicated by other factors, such as the year one was born.In France, a full pension that does not depend on time spent working, is paid out only after someone has reached 67, and this will remain the case even after the reform.Compared with the rest of the world — not just with Germany — French retirees have had it rather good up until now, at least with regard to the following three aspects: the pension rate, the pensionable age and the duration of pension payments (or the life expectancy, something counted from when people first start receiving a pension until their deaths).Whether you can maintain your standard of living during retirement depends on what is known as the net pension replacement rate. That is the percentage of money that remains of the after-tax income you earned, on average over your working life. In France, in 2020, this was 74.4%. That means If you received €2,500 ($2,689) a month on average, for example, then you would receive about €1,860 ($2,002) as your pension.In France, the net pension replacement rate is 14 percentage points above the OECD average. In Germany, pensioners receive just 52.9% of their after-tax earnings, calculated during their working lives. Taking the example above, that is about €540 less than in France.The net pension replacement rate could now fall for many people in France in the future. This is because it is not only the minimum retirement age being raised, but also the number of paid working years one needs to receive a full pension before the age of 67. This would mainly affect low-income earners, because they mostly start working earlier. Someone who doesn't start paying pension contributions until the age of 25 because she or he has studied, is going to turn 67 after just 42 years of work.To compensate for this, the French pension reform will raise the minimum pension to about €1,200 for single people. At present, the minimum pension is €961.08, putting it mid-table compared with other OECD countries.Incidentally, Germany is one of the few countries not to have a minimum pension. People with very low pensions can, however, apply to have them topped up.A lot of wage earners are happy to accept pension cuts in return for being able to stop work earlier. In France, on average, men retire at 60.4 and women at 60.9. That means French males retire almost 3.5 years earlier than their OECD peer group, and French females 1.5 years earlier.At the same time, life expectancy in France is particularly high. Only in Luxembourg, do men enjoy their retirement for longer (24 years) than in France (23.5 years). And only Greek women (28.4 years) and Spanish women (27.7 years) have it better in this regard than French women (27.1 years).But this is one of the reasons why the French government finds it necessary to reform the pension system, says Becker from the Max Planck Institute. ""France — like all OECD countries, and others as well — must ask itself how it is going to adapt its pension system to the demographic changes,"" he says.For pension funds, it is a problem that people are living longer because it obviously means pensions have to be paid out for a longer period of time, despite the fact that nothing more is being paid into those funds. What is more, birth rates are falling, which means there are fewer wage earners to pay contributions in, and for increasing numbers of pensioners.No pension system within the OECD can manage with just the contributions from those within it.In Germany, for example, you can claim pension payments for the time spent at school or university, or raising children, and these are taken from the federal budget and not from pension contributions. But many pension funds still post losses that must be compensated for with tax revenues. The more generous pensions are, and the less favorable the demographic situation is, the bigger those subsidies tend to be.In France, public pension subsidies are among the highest in the OECD, when measured against the gross domestic product. Only Italy has higher ones. This was what French prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, was talking about when she declared: ""With this project, we make a pledge to balance out pension funds financially by 2030.""""An obvious and widely discussed remedy is to raise the retirement age,"" Becker explained. ""This way, people pay in for longer and receive benefits for a shorter time. The idea is to redress the relationship between contributions and benefits.""This is exactly what a number of OECD countries have already done. In the Netherlands, the retirement age will rise to 67 years and three months by 2028.""Based on legislated measures, the normal retirement age will increase by about two years in the OECD on average by the mid‑2060s,"" the organization itself reported in 2021. ""The future normal retirement age is 69 years or more in Denmark, Estonia, Italy and the Netherlands.""In Germany, no one has dared to seriously tackle a further increase since the 2006 decision to raise the retirement age to 67, by the year 2031.And in France?  ""People have lost sight of the fact that the reforms were also supposed to abolish privileges of certain groups, albeit in a rather arbitrary way,"" Becker argued. ""Obviously the reason for this, is that the defence of social rights is considered more important than their generation-appropriate distribution.""This article was translated from German.",2023/03/26,,

He has held rallies in rural pockets of Punjab where he shared his hardline interpretation of Sikhism.Indian authorities launched a manhunt for Singh over a week ago. Some 100 others have also been arrested.The northern state of Punjab has meanwhile experienced mobile internet cuts and a ban on gatherings of more than four people in some parts.Police have accused Singh and his supporters of attempted murder, obstruction of law enforcement, and causing disharmony.Indian authorities have long rejected calls for an independent Sikh state, in fear of reviving the violence which killed tens of thousands of people in the 1980s and early 1990s.Last week, Indian police opened an investigation into a protest at its High Commission in London, where protesters gathered to denounce the police action in Punjab.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced the tournament to be postponed for two years.Israel qualified last June for its first ever Under-20 World Cup when it reached the semifinals of the Under-19 European Championship. The team went on to lose the final to England.FIFA declined to comment Sunday on the draw being postponed just eight weeks before the opening game.If Indonesia fails to resolve its hosting issues over Israel, the national soccer federation risks being suspended by FIFA.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847395,‘John Wick: Chapter 4’ comes out blazing with $73.5M,"NEW YORK (AP) — “John Wick: Chapter 4,” the fourth installment in the Keanu Reeves assassin series, debuted with a franchise-best $73.5 million at the box office, according to studio estimates Sunday.The Lionsgate film, starring Reeves as the reluctant-but-not-that-reluctant killer John Wick, exceeded both expectations and previous opening weekends in the R-rated franchise. Since first launching in 2014 with “John Wick” ($14 million on its opening weekend), the Chad Stahelski-directed series has steadily grown as a ticket-seller with each sequel. The 2017 follow-up opened with $30.4 million, and the 2019 third chapter, “Parabellum,” debuted with $56.8 million.But “Chapter 4,” running two hours and 49 minutes and costing at least $100 million to produce, is the biggest film yet in the once-lean action series. Critics also said it was a franchise high point, scoring 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The film, which drew a 69% male audience, added $64 million overseas. It's Lionsgate's biggest success of the pandemic era.""When you make a fourth in an action franchise, you have to expect it to go down. That is the nature of these franchises,"" said Joe Drake, chairman of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “But we kept seeing signals and it was wonderful to see the movie they delivered. We saw the audience wanting more.""Though “John Wick” has been bigger at the box office with each new release — an enviable and rare trajectory among Hollywood franchises — “Chapter 4” brings some finality to Reeves' character. The actor hasn't entirely dismissed continuing the series, telling interviewers “never say never.”Regardless, the franchise is set to keep humming. A spin-off titled “Ballerina” starring Ana de Armas and co-starring Reeves has already been shot. The miniseries “The Continental,” with Mel Gibson, is upcoming on Peacock.“Chad and Keanu have created this world and that world continues to expand. I don't know what all the edges of that world are, still,” said Drake. “As best they can, they'll continue to try to seduce Keanu to come back and do things. He gets beat up in these shows. He really does. And at the end he's like, ‘I’m not doing it anymore.' Then you watch him sit in the theater and feel that audience.”“So we're going to continue to look for ways to meet that demand.”The release of “John Wick: Chapter 4,” which included a surprise premiere at SXSW, was also bittersweet. Lance Reddick, who plays the Continental Hotel concierge, Charon, in the films, unexpectedly died at the age of 60 a week before the film’s release.But the success of “John Wick: Chapter 4” adds to a strong start in 2023 for Hollywood. After ticket sales rebounded to about 67% of pre-pandemic levels last year, the release lineup is steadier and more packed this year. Sequels have led the way, including “Creed III” and “Scream VI.” Ticket sales are up 28% from last year, according to data firm Comscore.But there have been some exceptions. After its disappointing $30.5 million debut last weekend, the superhero sequel “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” slumped to second place with $9.7 million in its second weekend. The Warner Bros. release dropped steeply, tumbling 68% from its launch.“Scream VI” took third place with $8.4 million in its third weekend, bringing its total thus far to $90.4 million domestic and $139.3 million worldwide. “Creed III” followed in fourth with $8.4 million. Michael B. Jordan's sequel is up to $140.9 million domestic.The weekend’s other new releases were more modest.Zach Braff’s “A Good Person,” starring Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman, opened on 530 theaters. The MGM release grossed $834,000. IFC Films' “The Lost King,” with Sally Hawkins and Steve Coogan, debuted with $575,000 in 753 locations.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.1. ""John Wick: Chapter 4,"" $73.5 million.2. “Shazam!

(AP) — All seven bodies have been recovered from the site of a powerful explosion at a chocolate factory in a small town in eastern Pennsylvania, officials said.West Reading Mayor Samantha Kaag said in a statement Sunday night that none of the victims will be named until officials are certain that all families have been contacted.“Please understand that this is a devastating loss, but we are truly grateful to bring closure to the families involved in the upcoming days,” Kaag said.West Reading Borough Chief of Police Wayne Holben said at a press briefing just after 9 p.m. that rescue workers had found the bodies earlier in the evening and that they are believed to be the remaining two individuals who were listed as missing earlier in the day. Their identities will be confirmed by the Berks County Coroner’s Office, he said.One of the victims was found around 6:50 p.m. and the other around 8:20 p.m., Holben said. The deaths brought the total number killed to seven in the blast that occurred just before 5 p.m. Friday.Earlier, Kaag confirmed to The Associated Press that the fifth body was found Sunday morning by first responders.Holben said the body of a fourth victim was found under debris early Sunday at the R.M. Palmer Co. plant in the borough of West Reading, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia.Rescue crews had been using heat imaging equipment and dogs to search for possible survivors after the blast destroyed one building and damaged a neighboring building. Crews were using heavy equipment to methodically and carefully pull debris from the site, Holben said.Three buildings around the site will be condemned as a precaution, Kaag said.“This does not mean they are slated for demolition or uninhabitable,” she said. “Simply that there will still be work happening around them as we proceed and they will need to be looked at further by structural engineers.”Officials said they had no update on the condition of a woman pulled alive from the rubble early Saturday. Kaag said she had apparently been on the second floor and was found in a “hopeful circumstance,” calling out to rescuers despite her injuries after a dog located her.Officials also reported no updates on the conditions of those taken to hospitals. Reading Hospital said it received 10 patients and transferred two to other facilities, while two others were admitted in good and fair condition respectively and the others had been discharged.R.M. Palmer said in a statement Saturday that everyone at the company was “devastated"" and it was reaching out to employees and their families through first responders and disaster recovery organizations because its communication systems were down.Kaag, a volunteer firefighter herself, said rescue crews had been working 12- to 16-hour shifts and were so dedicated to continuing the search that “you have to pull them away at this point"" to swap out and get some rest.Gov. Josh Shapiro visited the site Saturday and vowed support from the state.Kaag said some residents have reported damage to windows from the blast, and she asked people to “take a walk around your house” and report any damage.State and local fire investigators are continuing to examine the scene to try to determine the cause of the blast.",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847411,Transport woes hit Germany ahead of Monday strikes,"Some travelers in Germany found their travel plans ruined on Sunday, a day ahead of planned 24-hour strikes called by two major unions, EVG and Verdi.There was early disruption at Munich Airport because of the impending industrial action, while technical problems affecting German airline Lufthansa led to delays and cancellations at the country's largest air hub Frankfurt.Officials at Munich Airport, Germany's second-busiest airport, said that the Verdi union was hitting it with two consecutive days of strikes, rather than just one. The airport said there would be no passenger or cargo flights on either Sunday or Monday.Some 1,500 connections were believed to be affected, with takeoffs and landings only possible for emergency humanitarian flights.Separately to the strike, IT problems that slowed Lufthansa's operations at Frankfurt Airport — forcing cancellations — were resolved by early afternoon, the airline said.However, problems continued to hamper passengers' ability to check in for Lufthansa flights, either online or at the machines at the airport. The technical disruptions had dogged external IT service providers, the airline said.Last month, Lufthansa also struggled with IT issues because of damage during construction work, causing worldwide flight cancellations and delays.There was extra traffic on the roads ahead of the strike as 10 of Germany's 16 states eased a Sunday ban on heavy goods vehicles carrying freight that might otherwise move by rail or ship.However, Marcus Hover, vice general manager of North Rhine-Westphalia Association of Transport Economics and Logistics on Saturday said it was not expected to lead to the disruption of highway traffic.Both the EVG railway union and the huge Verdi services union are combining forces to push for increased pay for their memberships amid persistent inflation.Verdi last week said the union was calling for 120,000 workers — including security and ground workers at all German airports except in Berlin — to walk out.Almost all major airports are on strike, including Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, and Stuttgart.The German airport association ADV warned that as many as 380,000 airline travelers would not be able to take their flights because of the planned strikes.The EVG union is calling for 230,000 workers at Germany's main railway operator Deutsche Bahn to walk out.Deutsche Bahn has warned that it may not even be able to run an emergency timetable for long-distance trains on the strike day.The state-owned rail service said regional trains would also be drastically scaled back.Meanwhile, a strike of local transit employees in seven of Germany's 16 states will hit commuters taking shorter journeys.Local buses and rail systems, including trams, are largely not expected to function because of the action in the states of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Saxony.Harbor employees and highway workers are also downing tools.Staff at numerous locks on important waterways plan to strike as well as workers at Germany's largest port, Hamburg. Some highway tunnels could also be closed.Verdi wants a 10.5-percent salary rise, or at least 500 euros ($530) a month more, for public sector workers and higher bonus payments for airport staff who work on evenings and public holidays.""The strike is necessary to make clear to employees that we will vehemently stand up for our demands,"" Verdi chair Frank Werneke was quoted as saying.""It is a matter of survival for many thousands of employees to get a considerable pay rise,"" he said.EVG is seeking a raise of 12% for its employees. Deutsche Bahn has offered a two-stage raise totaling 5%, as well as one-off payments.Deutsche Bahn on Sunday said the strike was ""completely excessive, groundless and unnecessary.""""Our employees and passengers now need a quick solution, not a big strike,"" Deutsche Bahn Human Resources director Martin Seiler said.German rail union boss Martin Burkert on Friday admitted that strike action was a ""sharp sword"" but insisted that the unions were using it responsibly.Berkert said the unions were expecting an offer suitable for negotiation ahead of talks with employers on April 24 and 25.While German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit noted on Friday that the right to strike is a fundamental one, he urged unions and transport employers to ""find a viable solution that the effects of this strike are not too bad for the citizens of this country.""In a survey by the pollsters YouGov, there was overall support for the industrial action. Some 55% of respondents agreed it was justified for two major trade unions to jointly call for a day-long strike.rc/kb (dpa, AFP, Reuters, AP)",2023/03/26,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847424,Eyes on abstention as Cubans vote for National Assembly,"HAVANA (AP) — Cubans voted Sunday in National Assembly elections with attention focused on voter turnout amid a deep economic and migratory crisis.With 470 candidates running for the legislature’s 470 seats, and no opposition challengers, the election's outcome is a foregone conclusion. Voters essentially will do no more than endorse a slate of candidates vetted by Communist Party officials, critics say.What observers will be watching Sunday is whether a trend in declining voter participation continues as Cuba’s government struggles to turn around deteriorating economic conditions.Participation in elections in Cuba is high but has been on the decline for a decade.The National Electoral Commission said that for last November’s municipal elections about 31% of eligible voters abstained from voting, That translates to 69% participation, which is still high by international standards, but a substantial decline for Cuba where voting is not compulsory but traditionally was considered a national duty. The rate of abstention for national elections was 14% in 2018, and only 6% in 2013.Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank, said the trend toward non-participation in Cuban elections reflects growing discontent with the deteriorating economy and the migration crisis.“There may be different reasons that explain the increase in abstention, but an important factor is undoubtedly the growing distaste for the government's poor performance,"" he said.Cuba's government says the system is inclusive and builds unity, while steering clear of the divisiveness of party politics or any ill effects of big-money donors.President Miguel Díaz-Canel voted Sunday in the province of Villa Clara where he was born. He acknowledged the economic difficulties, power outages and fuel shortages amid which the elections were being held.“Some may put the economic situation ahead but most people know that despite the difficult economic situation we are working together,” he said. ""If we were once again a colony of the United States, the problems would only increase.”Julio Antonio Martínez Estrada, a lawyer, professor and a fellow at Harvard University, said he believes participation will continue to decline, in part due to the economy.“It is a response to the political and socio-economic problems of recent years,” Estrada said.The voting takes places as hundreds of thousands of people migrate, including 300,000 alone to the United States in recent months. The migrants are still on voters lists but can't vote because they are outside the country.National Assembly elections are held every five years and are technically nonpartisan. But they fall under the indirect control of the ruling Communist Party.Half of the 470 candidates come from municipal assemblies chosen in local elections last November. The other half are nominated by groups representing broad swaths of society — such as a women’s group and workers unions. All are vetted by election committees with ties to the party.The National Assembly is nominally the country’s highest governing power. It approves laws and votes for the president and executive officials from among its members.In practice, the chamber typically endorses initiatives and the leadership favored by the Communist Party, which is the only political party allowed on the island nation.The new National Assembly is expected to convene April 19, when it will vote on the executive leadership, with current President Miguel Díaz-Canel expected to be re-elected.Candidates include major Cuban leaders such as Díaz-Canel, semi-retired former Communist Party leader Raúl Castro and Economy Minister Alejandro Gil. Candidates also include musician Eduardo Sosa, LGBT community representative Mariela Castro and Elián González, who as a child in 2000 famously became the center of a diplomatic custody battle between Cuba and the United States.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847425,"Is the David porn? Come see, Italians tell Florida parents","ROME (AP) — The Florence museum housing Michelangelo’s Renaissance masterpiece the David on Sunday invited parents and students from a Florida charter school to visit after complaints about a lesson featuring the statue forced the principal to resign.Florence Mayor Dario Nardella also tweeted an invitation for the principal to visit so he can personally honor her. Confusing art with pornography was “ridiculous,” Nardella said.The board of the Tallahassee Classical School pressured Principal Hope Carrasquilla to resign last week after an image of the David was shown to a sixth-grade art class. The school has a policy requiring parents to be notified in advance about “controversial” topics being taught.The incredulous Italian response highlighted how the U.S. culture wars are often perceived in Europe, where despite a rise in right-wing sentiment and governance, the Renaissance and its masterpieces, even its naked ones, are generally free of controversy. Sunday's front page of the Italian daily publication Corriere della Sera featured a cartoon by its leading satirist depicting David with his genitals covered by an image of Uncle Sam and the word “Shame.”Carrasquilla believes the board targeted her after three parents complained about a lesson including a photo of the David, a 5-meter tall (17 foot) nude marble sculpture dating from 1504. The work, reflecting the height of the Italian Renaissance, depicts the Biblical David going to fight Goliath armed only with his faith in God.Carrasquilla has said two parents complained because they weren’t notified in advance that a nude would be shown, while a third called the iconic statue pornographic.Carrasquilla said in a phone interview Sunday that she is “very honored” by the invitations to Italy and she may accept.“I am totally, like, wow,” Carasquilla said. “I've been to Florence before and have seen the David up close and in person, but I would love to go and be a guest of the mayor.”Cecilie Hollberg, director of the Galleria dell'Accademia, where the David resides, expressed astonishment at the controversy.""To think that David could be pornographic means truly not understanding the contents of the Bible, not understanding Western culture and not understanding Renaissance art,” Hollberg said in a telephone interview.She invited the principal, school board, parents and student body to view the “purity” of the statue.Tallahassee Classical is a charter school. While it is taxpayer-funded and tuition-free, it operates almost entirely independently of the local school district and is sought out by parents seeking an alternative to the public school curriculum.About 400 students from kindergarten through 12th grade attend the three-year-old institution, which is now on its third principal. It follows a curriculum designed by Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school in Michigan frequently consulted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on educational issues.Barney Bishop, chairman of Tallahassee Classical's school board, has told reporters that while the photo of the statue played a part in Carrasquilla’s ouster, it wasn’t the only factor. He has declined to elaborate, while defending the decision.""Parents are entitled to know anytime their child is being taught a controversial topic and picture,” Bishop said in an interview with Slate online magazine.Several parents and teachers plan to protest Carrasquilla's exit at Monday night's school board meeting, but Carrasquilla said she isn't sure she would take the job back even if it were offered.“There's been such controversy and such upheaval,” she said. “I would really have to consider, ‘Is this truly what is best?’”Marla Stone, head of humanities studies at the American Academy in Rome, said the Florida incident was another episode in escalating U.S. culture wars and questioned how the statue could be considered so controversial as to warrant a prior warning.“What we have here is a moral crusade against the body, sexuality, and gender expression and an ignorance of history,” Stone said in an email. “The incident is about fear, fear of beauty, of difference, and of the possibilities embedded in art.”Michelangelo Buonarroti sculpted the David between 1501-1504 after being commissioned by the Cathedral of Florence. The statue is the showpiece of the Accademia, and helps draw 1.7 million visitors each year to the museum.""It is incredibly sought-after by Americans who want to do selfies and enjoy the beauty of this statue,” Director Hollberg said.The museum, like many in Europe, is free for student groups.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847427,Union Pacific 2nd railroad to drop push for one-person crews,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific has become the second major freight railroad in the past week to back away from the industry's longstanding push to cut train crews down to one person as lawmakers and regulators increasingly focus on rail safety following last month's fiery derailment in Ohio.The Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad said in a statement Saturday that it had reached an agreement with the union that represents conductors to drop its proposal to take those workers out of the cabs of locomotives just months after it was pressing to test out the idea of stationing conductors in trucks in parts of its 23-state network. Norfolk Southern made a similar announcement several days earlier.The Feb. 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train that forced the evacuation of roughly half the town of East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border after officials released and burned toxic chemicals is what sparked the renewed interest in railroad safety. A bipartisan bill that's gaining support in Congress would require railroads to maintain two-person crews and make several other changes designed to reduce the chances of future derailments. And regulators, who are also pushing railroads to make reforms, were already considering a rule that would require two-person crews.The major freight railroads have long argued that technological advances — particularly the automatic braking system they were required to install in recent years — had made it unnecessary to have a second person in every locomotive. And railroad executives had said they believed that moving conductors off of trains would improve their quality of life by giving them more predictable schedules and keeping them from going on the road.But the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union and the other rail unions have long refused to agree to reducing the size of train crews because they believe train conductors play a crucial safety role and they want to preserve jobs.The unions say conductors help monitor track conditions and radio communications while ensuring that engineers remain alert and respond to any emergencies or mechanical problems on the train. In the case of a derailment or collision, conductors are the first ones to respond before any additional help can arrive and they provide emergency responders key details about what a train is hauling.Union Pacific Executive Vice President Beth Whited said the railroad will now focus on other ways to address the concerns about demanding schedules that workers expressed during last fall's difficult contract negotiations. The rail industry reached the brink of a strike that could have crippled the economy before Congress intervened in December and imposed a contract to prevent a walkout.“We are pleased that Union Pacific is focusing on quality of life for our conductor workforce,” said Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD.Railroads have also been under pressure over the past year to improve their service because they were struggling to handle all the shipments companies want them to deliver. And the industry has been defending its safety record after eliminating nearly one-third of all railroad jobs over the past six years as railroads overhauled their operations. Unions say all those cuts have left workers spread too thin and made it more difficult to keep up with all the inspections and maintenance that are needed.The railroads maintain that they remain the safest way to transport hazardous chemicals and all kinds of other cargo across land because nearly every shipment arrives intact, but the East Palestine derailment reinforced just how devastating even one derailment involving dangerous chemicals can be.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847428,UConn's return to prominence has been a family affair,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Dan Hurley got choked up when asked about his dad on the eve of UConn's Sweet 16 game.Tears flowed again before the Huskies' Elite Eight game, this time from thinking about what he considers his other family.“I love coaching this team. I’ve gotten emotional,” Hurley said after UConn steamrolled Gonzaga Saturday night. “I just can’t think about coaching this group for the last time. It makes me sad.”Hurley will get to coach them at least one more game, next week in Houston.UConn has blitzed its way through the bracket so far, winning each of its four NCAA Tournament games by at least 15 points.The Huskies turned what was supposed to a dream Elite Eight game into a nightmare for Gonzaga.UConn dominated at both ends, beating the Zags 82-54 in the fourth-most lopsided Elite Eight game since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.That puts the Huskies in the Final Four for the first time since winning the 2014 national title and back on track to once again being an elite program.UConn will play Texas or Miami next Saturday in Houston.“I saw them in November and I just thought they were such a complete team there,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. “They’ve got great size. They have depth. Their bigs are different. So they bring different qualities.”The run has been a gratifying one for Hurley.His father, Bob, is one of the few high school coaches to be inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, a demanding coach who led St. Anthony High School to 26 New Jersey state titles.Bobby Hurley, Dan's brother, won two national titles as a player at Duke and led Arizona State to its third NCAA Tournament since 2018 this season.Dan played at Seton Hall before working his way up the coaching ladder. He spent two years at Wagner before leading Rhode Island to consecutive NCAA Tournaments.Tasked with returning UConn to national prominence, Hurley gradually rebuilt the program, leading the Huskies to their first NCAA Tournament berth in five years in 2021.The knock on Hurley: he couldn't win in March. UConn got bounced out of the NCAA Tournament's first round each of the previous two seasons, including to No. 12 seed New Mexico State last year.The Huskies looked like national title contenders early this season, went through a funk, then started playing their best basketball at the perfect time.After the win over Gonzaga, Dan now has some bragging rights of his own and celebrated with hugs from his family after clinching a Final Four spot Saturday night along The Strip in Las Vegas.“We’re just blessed that we grew up in Jersey City and found basketball and had a dad that pushed us,” Hurley said. “And I’m just proud that he’s been able to travel with us and now I get to take my dad to a Final Four.”And he's taking that other family with him.Collegiate athletics create a unique experience, the countless hours spent together chasing a common goal. College basketball players spend up to 11 months a year with each other between the season and offseason workouts, so bonds come naturally.Some teams are closer than others. These Huskies are a tight-knit pack.“You truly are — you’re family,” Hurley said. “And to do this together is special, not just the great moments, but having to pick each other up after great failures. Just doing it all together, the roller coaster ride. It’s like it’s a bond that you have with other people that most people don’t get to experience.”Next up for Hurley and the Huskies is a truly unique experience: playing in the Final Four.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847429,Kane extends England goals record in 2-0 win against Ukraine,"LONDON (AP) — Presented with a golden boot before kickoff, Harry Kane's golden touch continued for England on Sunday as he struck a record-extending 55th goal for his country.The Tottenham striker had already surpassed Wayne Rooney as the Three Lions' outright leading scorer with his penalty in Thursday's 2-1 win against Italy in Naples.Back at Wembley, he got the chance to celebrate in front of his home fans with another goal in England’s 2-0 win against Ukraine in European Championship qualifying.“It has been crazy over the last few days,"" Kane said. “My dad and brother were in Naples so I shared that moment with them. I had my wife and kids here today and those are memories that will always stay with me.”The England captain struck in the 37th minute, converting Bukayo Saka’s cross at the far post.Saka deservedly got on the scoresheet himself three minutes later when turning on the edge of the area and curling a shot into the top corner.With that double strike England effectively secured the victory and ensured a 100% start to qualifying for Euro 2024 in what has been an impressive response to the disappointment of being eliminated from last year’s World Cup at the quarterfinal stage.“It shows the type of team we are. We were all disappointed after the World Cup but the sign of a good team is to come back,” Kane said. “We are at the bottom of the hill again, but we’ve put in two great performances and it shows the mentality of the team.”Kane, whose penalty miss in the 2-1 loss to France proved so costly in Qatar, has also proven he is not suffering a hangover from one of the most painful moments of his career.While he is still waiting to win his first trophy for club or country, the personal honors continue to come.In February he overtook the late Jimmy Greaves as Tottenham’s all-time leading scorer. In international soccer, he equaled Rooney’s England total at the World Cup before setting a new record against Italy.The English Football Association marked that achievement before kickoff against Ukraine when its chair, Debbie Hewitt, presented Kane with a commemorative golden boot. For the match, Kane also wore Nike boots with a gold swoosh on the side.“He is somebody that I think it would be easy for us to get drawn into not challenging,” England coach Gareth Southgate said. ""But we've got to challenge him as well. The individual accolades are well deserved and are amazing. But he wants to be part of a team that is successful.“That's the drive with England, for us to achieve that. He will be just as happy that we've got the six points and got ourselves in a good position in the group as getting the two goals this week as well.”Kane's hunger to further extend his record was immediately evident as he went in search of more goals.There was an early penalty claim when he hit the ground in the box and then an unusual air shot when just a couple of meters out from goal.He didn’t have to wait long, however, for his latest strike in England colors. Drifting to the far post, he was perfectly placed to turn in Saka’s cross for one of the easiest goals he is ever likely to score.The same cannot be said of Saka’s effort. First the Arsenal forward showcased his control when spinning with the ball at his feet to leave Mykola Matviyenko trailing. Then he looked up before picking out the top corner of Anatoliy Trubin’s goal.“It is a top-level finish,"" Southgate said. ""That is the ruthless part he has added to his game in the last 18 months or so. There were times you weren’t sure he was going to finish but now he has that confidence in front of goal.”Ukraine was playing for the first time in six months and never looked like finding a way back into the game after conceding twice in quick succession. Yet it was cheered on throughout by an away contingent of around 4,200 fans.The FA had invited more than 1,000 Ukrainian refugees to the match, as well as the families hosting them under the U.K. government’s Homes for Ukraine Scheme.It is estimated that more than 150,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the U.K. since the war with Russia began last year.Ahead of kickoff Ukraine’s fans sang along to a stirring rendition of the country’s national anthem, with one corner of Wembley awash with the blue and yellow colors of its flag.Despite being heavily outnumbered inside a crowd of around 85,000, the away supporters made sure they were heard as they chanted and sang for their team.“It was an atmosphere like no other international game I have ever experienced,"" Ukraine coach Ruslan Rotan said.It was Kane who got England’s fans out of their seats, as he continues to set new standards in front of goal.JACK LESLIE HONOREDThe family of Jack Leslie, the first Black player to receive an England call-up in 1925, was presented with a posthumous honorary cap ahead of the game.The Plymouth inside left was deselected after facing adversity because of his skin color and never played for his country.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847430,Army pulls recruiting ads after Jonathan Majors' arrest,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The arrest of actor Jonathan Majors has upended the Army’s newly launched advertising campaign that was aimed at reviving the service’s struggling recruiting numbers.Majors, who authorities said was arrested Saturday in New York on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment, was the narrator of two ads at the heart of a broader media campaign that kicked off at the start of the NCAA's March Madness college basketball tournament.Army leaders were hopeful that the popularity of the star of the recently released “Creed III” and “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania,” would help them reach the youth audience.In a statement Sunday, the Army’s Enterprise Marketing Office said that the Army was aware of Majors’ arrest and was ""deeply concerned by the allegations.” It added that while Majors “is innocent until proven guilty, prudence dictates that we pull our ads until the investigation into these allegations is complete.”New York City police said the actor was involved in a domestic dispute with a 30-year-old woman. “The victim informed police she was assaulted,” a police spokesperson said in a statement.A lawyer for Majors, Priya Chaudhry, said in a statement Sunday there was evidence clearing Majors and that the actor “is provably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows.”The Army ads, titled “Overcoming Obstacles” and “Pushing Tomorrow,” are part of the plan to revive the Army’s “Be All You Can be” motto. They highlighted the history of the Army and some of the many professions that recruits can pursue.The ""Be All You Can Be” slogan dominated its recruiting ads for two decades starting in 1981. A nearly two-minute preview video, made available before the campaign rollout in early March, featured soldiers jumping out of airplanes, working on helicopters, climbing obstacle courses and diving underwater. A voiceover said: “We bring out the best in the people who serve, because America calls for nothing less.”In the Army's worst recruiting year in recent history, the service fell 25% short of its goal to enlist 60,000 recruits in 2022. The new ads were a key element in the Army's drive to find creative new ways to attract recruits and ensure that the service has the troops it needs to help defend the nation.Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said the Army has set a difficult goal for this year: aiming to bring in 65,000 recruits, which would be 20,000 more than in 2022.",2023/03/27,,World

It doesn’t matter if they can score 30; they can all shoot, they can all dribble, they can all pass, and that puts your defense in a bind.”The Owls (35-3) from Boca Raton, Florida, are heading to the Final Four for the first time in school history with Division I's winningest team, a collection of interchangeable pieces that has been greater than the sum of the parts.“Extremely rewarding to see a group give as much as these guys have all season — shots, playing time, minutes, everything you could imagine, grit, everything 100% every day in practice — and then be rewarded because there’s never a guaranteed,” May said Saturday night. “In this era where everyone wants the whole pie, these guys continued sharing the pie every single day, and this was the result.”FAU, the lowest-seeded team left in the field, will face either Creighton or San Diego State in Houston on Saturday.To win four tournament games so far, each by single digits, has taken contributions from up and down the roster.The Owls have had three different leading scorers (Giancarlo Rosado vs. Memphis, Johnell Davis vs. FDU and Tennessee and Alijah Martin vs. Kansas State), three different leading rebounders (Vladislav Goldin, Davis and Nick Boyd) and three different leaders in assists (Boyd, Davis and Brandon Weatherspoon).Seven different players have registered at least one double-digit scoring performance, but only one of more than 17 points.Davis is the closest thing the Owls have to a star, and he was coming off the bench for much of this season. The Conference USA Sixth Player of the Year has been a starter throughout the NCAA Tournament.FAU's Elite Eight victory at Madison Square Garden against Kansas State epitomized the Owls' ethos.The Wildcats had the player of the game in Markquis Nowell. The dynamic 5-foot-8 point guard from Harlem has been arguably the best player of the entire tournament through two weekends.In two East Regional games at The Garden against Michigan State and FAU, Nowell had 50 points and 31 assists. According to ESPN Stats and Info, he became just the second player in NCAA Tournament history to have consecutive 20-10 games.FAU was able to rotate several defenders on Nowell, who played all 40 minutes in the 79-76 loss to the Owls.“We game planned for him, and he still put up numbers,” FAU's Bryan Greenlee said. “But we just know it’s a team effort, and it’s going to take the whole unit to really win this game, and it’s not just one guy who can shut somebody down. It’s just a group effort.”On the final possession of the game, Kansas State had no timeouts and 6.9 seconds left.Boyd appeared to be the primary defender on Nowell, who started his dribble near the left sideline and worked his way to the middle of the floor as he crossed midcourt.When Boyd was screened, Davis immediately switched to Nowell, with Martin lurking to the point guard's right side.Sensing a double-team with 2.2 seconds left and still more than 30 feet from the basket, Nowell made a short pass to his right to Ismael Massoud, near the sideline. Davis and Martin quickly converged and Davis swiped the ball away from Massoud.Martin said he wasn't surprised Nowell gave up the ball.“He's a smart player,” Martin said. “Win, lose or draw you got to make the right play, you got to live with that. And that's what he did.”FAU made only one previous appearance in the NCAA Tournament before this season, going one-and-done in 2002. The Owls had only one previous 20-win season before this one. The FAU Arena where they play home games seats 2,900.Asked if he thought something like this would be possible when he signed to play with FAU two years ago, Martin chuckled and said: “No, not really, honestly.”Then how does FAU get to the Final Four?“Leadership. Support. Sacrifice. And no ego, no pride,"" Martin said.

All of them support President Serdar Berdymukhamedov.Berdymukhamedov, 41, was elected last March to succeed his father, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who had run the isolated ex-Soviet country for more than a decade.Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov came to power after the death of the eccentric Saparmurat Niyazov in 2006 and established a pervasive personality cult similar to that of his predecessor. Under his rule, Turkmenistan has remained difficult for outsiders to enter. It has also struggled to diversify its economy, which is overwhelmingly dependent on its vast natural gas reserves.The elder Berdymukhamedov has cultivated an image of robust health with media stunts that included firing a pistol at a man-sized target while riding a bicycle and hoisting a gold weightlifting bar, to the applause of his Cabinet. He has the title “Arkadag,” or Protector, and last year stepped down, giving way for his son to assume office.Earlier this year, Serdar Berdymukhamedov appointed his father to be the chairman of Halk Maslahaty, or People’s Council, the country's supreme representative body. The People’s Council has the power to change the country’s constitution and determine the main guidelines of domestic and foreign policies, giving Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov powerful levers to shape the country’s course.Loud patriotic music played at polling stations in the capital and dance troupes performed.

Medium-pacer Issy Wong finished with 3-42 as she and English compatriot Sciver-Brunt again impressed, just like the eliminator when they helped Mumbai beat UP Warriors on Friday with Wong earning the first hat trick in the WPL.Opting to bat first, Delhi got off to a poor start when India’s Shafali Verma was ruled out caught in a controversial decision. Wong delivered a full toss that seemed to be sailing above the stumps, yet Verma was out of her crease when she sliced a catch to point, with the umpires ruling her out.Delhi was down to 12-2 as Wong dismissed Alice Capsey for a two-ball duck.Jemimah Rodrigues (9) became Wong’s third wicket on the night to make it 35-3 in 4.2 overs.Australia’s Meg Lanning, the leading run-scorer of the tournament, scored 35 off 29 balls to rebuild the innings. She hit five fours and added 38 runs with Marizanne Kapp (18).Kapp was caught behind in the 11th over, and the game further turned on its head in the 12th when Lanning was run out after a mix-up with fellow Australian Jess Jonassen (2).Matthews then got into the act with her off-spin and struck three times in the space of 11 deliveries to leave Delhi tottering at 79-9 in 16 overs.The last-wicket partnership of Radha Yadav and Shikha Pandey put on an amazing 52 runs off the last 24 balls to take the Capitals to a fighting total.Yadav hit 27 not out off 12, while Pandey also scored 27 not out off 17 balls, as the duo hit five fours and three sixes to change the momentum.Yadav then also struck early into the Mumbai innings, dismissing opener Yastika Bhatia (4). At the other end, Jonassen had Matthews (13) caught in the deep as Mumbai was down to 23-2.Sciver-Brunt held one end together and denied any further inroads to the Delhi bowlers. In doing so, she put on 72 runs off 75 balls with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur for the third wicket in a vital partnership.Kaur made 37 off 39, including five fours, before she was run-out.Sciver-Brunt followed up her half-century in the eliminator with another 50 off 52 balls as Mumbai crossed the 100-mark.She also got the winning runs with her seventh boundary of the innings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847436,LeBron James returns for season-ending push with Lakers,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James says two doctors recommended season-ending surgery on a torn tendon in his right foot, but he has decided to finish out the season on the court with the Los Angeles Lakers.James returned to the Lakers on Sunday after a monthlong absence with what he revealed was a significant tendon injury. He wasn't in the starting lineup for only the second time in his 20-year NBA career, but he still led the Lakers with 19 points in their 118-108 loss to the Chicago Bulls.The NBA's career scoring leader hadn't played since Feb. 26, when he complained of right foot soreness after a win at Dallas. James considered surgery after getting the sobering diagnosis, but his teammates' outstanding play down the stretch and his own inner determination contributed to his decision to keep playing.James also said his doctors told him that he was “healing faster than anybody they’ve seen before with the injury.”One more factor contributed to his decision: James got a third opinion from an unnamed foot specialist.“I went to the LeBron James of feet, and he told me I should (delay possible surgery),” James said, declining to name the doctor.James returned with eight games left in the Lakers’ regular season as they attempt to avoid missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year and the third time in James’ five seasons in Los Angeles.James said he was inspired by his teammates while he put in 12-hour workdays between rehab and training to get back in action. Los Angeles went 8-5 while James was out despite adding five new rotation players around the trade deadline, finally developing some chemistry during their push.“They go 8-5 and obviously had a chance to — the hell with the play-in, we actually can be a top-eight seed,” James said. “It definitely changed my mindset on me coming back and trying to be a part of this. Well, I don’t even want to say (it) changed my mindset. It just enhanced what I was trying to do as far as my workouts, as far as my treatment and everything. They played such great basketball. I was just ecstatic, from me being in a boot to me getting out of the boot, you guys saw me on the sideline, just so happy about what the guys are doing.”The Lakers had one of their roughest performances in a month against the Bulls, falling behind by a huge early margin and never closing the gap.James had played in a game as a reserve just once previously in his 20-year NBA career, doing it with Cleveland on Dec. 11, 2007.The 38-year-old James is averaging 29.5 points, 8.4 rebounds and 6.9 assists in his fifth season with the Lakers. He surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA's top scorer on Feb. 7 but had played in just three games since that historic night.James said he doesn’t know whether he’ll need surgery after the season, but he expects to have an MRI exam after he’s done playing for the summer. He said he would be at full strength for training camp in the fall even if he has the surgery.The Lakers provided few updates on James' condition during his absence, and James kept the details of his recovery firmly under wraps on social media. He also missed five games earlier this season with a strained left adductor, and he has had lengthy injury absences in every full season during his time with the Lakers.But James is looking healthy at a key point for the Lakers, who could finally have their full roster available for the final games of the stretch run.While James returned, D'Angelo Russell missed his second straight game because of a right hip injury. Russell and James have played in only two games together since the Lakers acquired Russell in a trade last month because of injuries for both players.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847437,Double win for Cambridge over Oxford in annual Boat Race,"LONDON (AP) — It's four wins out of five for Cambridge in one of England’s oldest sporting events after it powered to victory over Oxford in the men's Boat Race on Sunday.And it was a bold move by Cambridge cox Jasper Parish on the River Thames that proved the difference in the annual contest between the two universities which started in 1829. Cambridge now leads the rivalry 86-81.Cambridge had rudder issues before the race and Oxford, with the weight advantage, pulled ahead. Fighting choppy conditions and gusting winds, Parish's decision to steer his crew closer to the bank near Fulham’s Craven Cottage — taking an unorthodox line in the direction of flatter water — ultimately paid off as Cambridge took a half-length’s lead.While Oxford would not let their opponents get away, it turned out to be an inspired move by Parish as Cambridge carried its advantage over the finish line.The Light Blues went on to win by 1 1/3 lengths.Last year Oxford had halted its rival’s run of three straight wins, but it proved to be a temporary pause of Cambridge's recent dominance.In the women's Boat Race, Cambridge made it six straight wins after beating Oxford with another dominant performance in the 77th edition.Oxford got out to a strong start but Cambridge recovered. By the halfway point, the defending champions were well ahead and steered to victory.“I’m just so proud of the girls,” Cambridge women’s president Caoimhe Dempsey said. “That was a tough race, there was so much going on and they handled it so well.”___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World

(AP) — The Dallas Mavericks' postseason hopes could be slipping away.The Charlotte Hornets overcame a 40-point outing from Luka Doncic on Sunday to defeat Dallas 110-104, their second win over the Mavericks in three days — dealing another blow to Dallas' playoff hopes.Gordon Hayward scored 22 points and P.J. Washington had 21 points and 12 rebounds for the injury-plagued Hornets, who have been eliminated from playoff contention.The Mavericks (36-39) entered the day tied with Oklahoma City for the 10th-best record in the Western Conference but were still outside of the play-in tournament bubble because the Thunder hold the head-to-head tiebreaker.“It’s unfortunate that we let these two games go and we have to figure out a way to stop the bleeding,” said Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, adding that he wasn't pleased with the team's defensive effort.Kyrie Irving had 18 points for Dallas, which fell to 7-13 since the point guard was acquired in a trade.“Losing in basketball is very frustrating, especially when we have as talented a group as we do,” Irving said.A 3-of-18 shooting start from the field and a 19-point first-half deficit ultimately proved too much for Dallas to overcome. The Mavs were able to capture the lead in the fourth quarter when Doncic knocked down his sixth 3-pointer of the game with 5:44 left, but they appeared to wear down during the stretch run.“The desire to win has to be at an all-time high right now,” Tim Hardaway Jr. said. "" ... The second half it was, but the same as last game it was too late.”The desire will need to be even higher on Monday night.Doncic picked up his 16th technical foul of the season in the third quarter, meaning he will face a one-game suspension and will miss a game against the Indiana Pacers unless the technical is rescinded by the league office.Crew Chief Kevin Scott said in a pool report after the game that Doncic used ""a profanity directed at the officials in protest to a no-call that was correctly judged in postgame video review.”Kidd said he didn't think the technical was warranted and that it should be rescinded.Doncic was not made available for interviews after the game.A dejected Doncic had said after Friday night's loss to the Hornets he was frustrated over how the season has gone. He added that his feelings were not just basketball-related but did not elaborate.Dennis Smith Jr. came up with a key bucket for Charlotte against his former team, sneaking behind the Dallas defense and dunking off a lob from Washington to put Charlotte up by five with 1:05 remaining. Maxi Kleber responded with a 3 off a feed from Doncic, but Charlotte answered again with a layup by Mark Williams off a pass from Hayward.Doncic then missed a 3-pointer on the other end, all but securing the Charlotte win.After Doncic missed another desperation 3 as the clock expired, he exchanged words with a fan seated courtside and wagged his finger at him.“The biggest part of the game again was the first quarter,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. “Playing from ahead is a big deal. Every year the numbers bear it out, people want to say, ‘All you have to do is watch the fourth quarter,’ but they have no idea what they’re talking about. It’s anything but that.”FAN BOOTEDIrving asked officials to remove a fan from the arena in the third quarter after he said the fan called him a name.“I just had to make sure I looked him eye to eye and see if he would say it to my face,” Irving said. “A lot of fans say things when you turn your head or say it in a crowd because they can get it away it. ... He yelled it and I handled it.”TIP-INSMavericks: Doncic has been assessed the third-most technical fouls in the league behind Memphis’ Dillon Brooks (18) and Atlanta’s Trae Young (17). ... Hardaway returned after missing the last two games.Hornets: Rookie center Mark Williams had 15 points and 16 rebounds. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847440,Pray for rain: Spanish farmers hold unique Mass amid drought,"L'ESPUNYOLA, Spain (AP) — When Josep Altarriba looks across his parched fields, the Spanish farmer can't remember a time of such widespread drought in Catalonia. If it doesn't rain in the next two weeks, he says there's little chance of saving the harvest.What can be done? For the mountain villagers of L'Espunyola, the answer is divine intervention.On Sunday, around 250 residents brought back the faded practice of a special Mass and procession to pray to Our Lady of the Torrents, a local virgin associated with rainfall.Under mostly sunny skies, worshippers lifted the colorfully painted statue of the Lady of the Torrents from its place of prominence in the stone church. She was then nestled onto a wooden litter filled with green branches and hoisted aloft, to be carried around the village followed by the bishop and parishioners.“It’s not a magic act, it is an act of trust,” Bishop Francesc Conesa told The Associated Press.Three years of very low rainfall and high temperatures put Spain officially into long-term drought, the country's weather agency said this month. Last year was Spain's sixth driest — and the hottest since records began in 1961.Catalonia, in the country's northeastern corner, is among the worst-affected regions. Agrotourism and farming are the primary sources of income for the 260 inhabitants of L'Espunyola, an hour and a half north of Barcelona.""If it doesn’t rain within two weeks, it's very hard to say what might happen,” Altarriba, the farmer, said after celebrating Mass.Local councilor and firefighter Eduard Perarnau described the special Mass as a last resort. The government has restricted water usage, asking farmers to limit watering crops and trees as much as possible.All three reservoirs in the area are below a third of their capacity. The nearby La Baells reservoir is down to 25%, and in some places only a trickle of water cuts through the layers of silt that used to be underwater.The last time the village offered prayers and hymns to Our Lady of the Torrents was in 2008, local media reported. And it worked — residents say the rains came not long after.But this year, the bishop doesn’t guarantee success.“We have asked with faith, and many people have come and prayed with faith,” Conesa said. “The Lord will give us what suits us.”___AP Writer Raquel Redondo in Madrid contributed to this report.",2023/03/27,,World

(AP) — The Atlanta Braves will open the season with two rookie left-handers in their rotation while giving right-hander Kyle Wright more time to prepare for his first start.Wright was told Sunday he would start the season on the 15-day injured list. He was the only 20-game winner in the majors last season but had a slow start this spring after getting a cortisone shot in January to address a shoulder issue.Jared Shuster and Dylan Dodd, who each have impressed the team this spring while competing for what was believed to have been one spot in the rotation, were told Sunday they will open the season with the team. The Braves optioned Ian Anderson and Bryce Elder to Triple-A Gwinnett on March 14 to clear the path for Shuster and Dodd.Shuster, 24, was Atlanta's first-round draft pick in 2020. He is expected to start in the Braves' third game at Washington on April 2.Dodd is expected to take the No. 5 spot in the rotation and start on April 4 at St. Louis.Both rookies have impressed the Braves with good control this spring.Shuster has posted a 1.45 ERA in five spring training games. He has 18 strikeouts and only four walks in 18 2/3 innings.Dodd, 24, has a 2.00 ERA in 18 innings this spring, with 20 strikeouts and four walks.

(AP) — Texas forward Dylan Disu, one of the bright stars of the opening weekend of the NCAA Tournament, was ruled out of the Longhorns' game against Miami for a spot in the Final Four on Sunday with a left foot injury.The 6-foot-9 Disu was the MVP of the Longhorns' run to the Big 12 Tournament title on the same T-Mobile Center floor two weeks ago, then helped them reach the Sweet 16 with 17 points in a win over Colgate and 28 points in a win over Penn State.Disu hurt his foot during the second-round game against the Nittany Lions. He made progress with the injury throughout the week, and there was some hope he'd be available for a Midwest Region semifinal against Xavier. But after a setback, Disu played just 94 seconds for No. 2 seed Texas before watching the rest of the game in a walking boot.“Dylan obviously worked really hard to get to this point of the season right now,” said interim Texas coach Rodney Terry, who was trying to get the Longhorns past the Hurricanes and into the Final Four for the first time in 20 years.“We went through the Big 12 Tournament without Timmy Allen, a guy that had become a real focal point of our offense down the stretch in Big 12 play. Next man up had to step in and do the job for us,” Terry said. “No different type of mentality we will have going into the contest against Miami — next man up, and that will be by committee.”Christian Bishop got the first opportunity, sliding into the starting lineup when it was released about an hour before tipoff in Kansas City. The native of nearby Lee's Summit, Missouri, scored 18 points in Friday night's win over the Musketeers.Fifth-seeded Miami advanced to the regional final with a whipping of No. 1 seed Houston.“I always say to our guys, ‘We’re all we need.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847455,"San Diego State muscles past Creighton, makes 1st Final Four","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Darrion Trammell had shot enough free throws in practice to believe at least one would fall when it mattered.San Diego State's 5-foot-10 senior guard was fouled by Creighton's Ryan Nembhard when he put up a floater near the free-throw line with 1.2 seconds left in a rugged NCAA Tournament East Region final that was tied at 56-all.Trammell's first free throw clanged off the rim, but he knocked down the second, and that was enough to push the defense-first Aztecs into their first Final Four with a 57-56 victory on Sunday.Lamont Butler scored 18 points and Trammell had 12 for fifth-seeded San Diego State (31-6), which slowed down high-scoring, sixth-seeded Creighton (24-13) and became the first Mountain West Conference team to reach the national semifinals.The experienced Aztecs, in their sixth season under coach Brian Dutcher, will play the surprising East Region champion, ninth-seeded Florida Atlantic, on Saturday in Houston for a spot in the national title game.“Here we are,” said Dutcher, a longtime assistant to his predecessor, Steve Fisher. ""We're making the next step and it's something we've always talked about. I'm sure there were people that doubted we could do it, but we never doubted for a minute.“Not to say it's easy to get there or that we would ever get there. But we're there now, and we're going to go and try to win the thing.”In the final seconds, Trammell dribbled from the perimeter and elevated for the potential winning shot. A chasing Nembhard got his hand on Trammell's hip and was whistled for the foul, sending Trammell to the line for the first time in the game.“I feel like I’ve shot probably a thousand free throws in the last week,"" said Trammell, who was named the region's most outstanding player. ""And then today, I feel like I put in the work to be able to step up and have confidence that I’m going to make ’em.”Make one, anyway.Creighton couldn't get a shot off on its final, desperation play. Baylor Scheierman threw the ensuing inbound pass the length of the floor. San Diego State’s Aguek Arop and Creighton's Arthur Kaluma both jumped for it and the ball deflected out of bounds. Officials reviewed the play and determined that time had expired, and the celebration was on for the Aztecs.“I wasn’t given an explanation other than there was no time on the clock,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. “They made no call on the floor but officiating is part of the game and we’re not gonna go there.”Scheierman had tied the game at 56-all when he stole an inbounds pass and converted a layup with 34 seconds remaining.Ryan Kalkbrenner scored 17 points and Scheierman and Kaluma had 12 apiece for the Bluejays, who went 2 of 17 from 3-point range.The Aztecs, who got this far thanks to defense and physical play, held the Bluejays to 23 second-half points on 28% shooting as they won for the 14th time in 15 games. Creighton shot 40% overall.San Diego State shot 38% but got clutch baskets from Nathan Mensah, whose jumper gave the Aztecs a 56-54 lead with 1:37 left, and Arop, who made two straight shots before that for a 54-50 advantage with 3:03 remaining.“I’ve done that a thousand times throughout the season, so it was just another shot for me,” Arop, who had six points, said of his go-ahead jumper. ""Obviously, there was a lot more weight to it, but I wasn’t thinking like that. I was just thinking, staying in rhythm, getting the shot up and putting my team up front.”Creighton, which beat San Diego State in overtime in the first round of last year's NCAA Tournament, fell just short of joining Big East rival UConn in the Final Four.The teams didn't appear to share any hard feelings from last year's meeting. They shared a round-trip flight to Hawaii last fall for the Maui Invitational, and there were no dustups during a tight, physical game in which no team led by more than eight points.REGION HONORSTrammell was part of an all-region team that included Butler, Creighton's Kalkbrenner and Scheierman and Princeton's Tasan Evbuomwan.PERIMETER DEFENSEBefore muscling past Creighton, San Diego State crafted a similar defensive masterwork against Alabama, the tournament's top overall seed. The Aztecs held Alabama and Creighton to a combined 5 of 44 (11.4%) from 3-point range, the best 3-point percentage defense ever in a regional weekend for a team that advanced to the Final Four.DIVIDED LOYALTIESKaluma played against his brother, San Diego State’s Adam Seiko. Their parents sat a few rows up at midcourt, sitting quietly before joining Seiko to celebrate.BIG PICTURECreighton’s offense started well enough as the Bluejays built a 33-28 halftime lead and extended their advantage to seven in the second half. But Creighton didn't make a single 3-pointer after halftime.San Diego State proved again that defense matters, especially since the Aztecs also scuffled for points. Their experience and depth showed as Mensah and Arop, who averaged just 6.1 and 4.5 points per game respectively, converted the last three baskets. They and Creighton each grabbed 37 rebounds, but the Aztecs' 13-9 edge offensively proved critical.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World

They say a suspicious person and car were seen at the office, leading them to Kosowski. A search of the doctor's Tarpon Springs home found evidence that led to his arrest, police said. They did not elaborate.Kosowski, 44, who goes by “Dr. K,” was being held without bail on Sunday at the Pinellas County Jail.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847457,Residents protest zipline on Rio’s iconic Sugarloaf Mountain,"Some 200 protesters gathered beneath Rio de Janeiro's world-famous Sugarloaf Mountain to protest the ongoing construction of ziplines aimed at boosting tourism, alleging it will cause unacceptable impacts.The four steel lines will run 755 meters (almost 2,500 feet) over the forest between Sugarloaf and Urca Hill, and riders will reach speeds of 100 kph (62 mph). Inauguration is scheduled for the second half of this year, and an online petition to halt work has been signed by almost 11,000 people.Sugarloaf — known in Portuguese as Pao de Açucar — juts out of the earth at the entrance to Rio's bay. The United Nations heritage center named it a World Heritage Site in 2012 along with Rio's other marquee mountains and, years earlier, Brazil's heritage institute designated it a national monument.The cable cars to its summit draw hundreds of thousands of Brazilian and international tourists each year, all eager to take in the panoramic views of the sprawling city’s beaches and forested mountains.It is also a popular spot for sport climbing and birdwatching with preserved Atlantic Forest in a conservation unit, which towers over the sleepy Urca neighborhood. As such, the prospect of riders buzzing down wires while screaming wildly has united mountaineers, environmental activists and residents in opposition. They caution UNESCO could withdraw its heritage status. One protester on Sunday held a sign reading, “S.O.S. UNESCO,” and the group often broke out into chants of “Zipline out!”“We are completely opposed to the transformation — which in truth has been happening for some time — of the summits of Urca Hill and Sugarloaf into an entertainment hub,” said André Ilha, a former director of biodiversity and protected areas of Rio state’s environment institute and founder of environmental nonprofit Ecological Action Group.“This is inducing people to go there for reasons that aren’t why the cable car was conceived: To appreciate the landscape,” he said.Many residents of Urca are likewise displeased.“We live in a small, peaceful neighborhood. There will be visual and audible impact; no one goes down a zipline in silence,"" said Aurimar dos Prazeres, president of a residents association. “And it isn’t one zipline. It’s four of them. One hundred people going down each hour. That’s craziness, and very big impact.”Parque Bondinho Pao de Açúcar, which operates the cable cars and is behind the 50-million reais ($9.5-million) project, said in a statement that sound tests indicate noise from riders will not be perceptible from below, nor will it affect climbing routes. It says it has obtained all the necessary authorizations and licenses for the project from the national heritage institute and municipal authorities, and it touts the ability to drive tourism.“In addition to the great integration with nature, the intention is to improve the experience of our visitors and make the visit to the Parque Bondinho Pao de Açucar Park even more pleasant and unforgettable,” the company says on the zipline's website.The company also says it consulted the community ahead of time. Residents, at least, say that's not true.Prazeres told The Associated Press her association wasn't approached until after work was already underway, and amid complaints. Juliana Freire, president of another residents association, told the AP the company brought up its intention to develop the zipline during a 2022 meeting about another subject, but never made any formal presentation.Freire says the national heritage institute that gave its OK to the zipline had recently barred construction of a lifeguard tower on the beach below Sugarloaf.Ilha told the AP that the project was presented to the natural monuments council, comprised of government and civil society, but that members had been awaiting presentation of an additional sound study. The company said in its statement that further studies on sound and traffic are underway.Activists on Sunday also expressed concern the zipline is a harbinger of future interventions. The company that administers the cable cars is studying a project that would modify the structure atop Sugarloaf's summit.Opponents have nicknamed it “the castle of horrors” and warn of all sorts of potential constructions — almost none of which appear in the company's proposal. The company says the future project wouldn't entail expansion of its current footprint nor the opening of new stores, and is meant to facilitate observation of the landscape, improve accessibility for disabled people and separate the flow of tourists, workers and cargo.___AP writer Eléonore Hughes contributed.",2023/03/27,,World

His falling out with Santos came amid his break with Manchester United, before he made his surprising move to the Saudi Arabian league.He has now scored braces in back-to-back starts, albeit against European minnows.Portugal leads Group J with six points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847459,Retegui scores again as Italy beats Malta 2-0 in qualifying,"TA’ QALI, Malta (AP) — Argentina-born striker Mateo Retegui is fast becoming the center forward Italy has been sorely lacking.Retegui scored again in Italy’s 2-0 win over Malta on Sunday to make it two goals in as many matches as the defending champion recorded its first win in European Championship qualifying.The 23-year-old Retegui had scored on his international debut on Thursday, in a 2-1 loss at home to England in a rematch of the Euro 2020 final, which Italy won on penalties.Retegui became the first Italy player to score in his first two competitive international matches in nearly 55 years.Italy was looking to kickstart its campaign after losing a European Championship qualifier for the first time since 2006.Coach Roberto Mancini made eight chances from that loss to England.Italy was without injured forward Ciro Immobile and its problems up front continued when Wilfried Gnonto went off with an ankle problem midway through the first half.It was already 1-0 up by then, however, as Retegui had headed in Sandro Tonali's corner in the 15th minute.The Azzurri doubled their tally in the 27th when Matteo Pessina tapped in a low cross from Emerson.Gianluca Scamacca almost scored an acrobatic third in the 69th but his overhead kick was well saved by Malta goalkeeper Henry Bonello.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847460,Final Four newcomers: Grab your name tag at the door,"Everyone's heard of UConn. All these other guys? They'll need name tags at the Final Four.When they travel to Houston next week to play for the national title, Florida Atlantic, San Diego State and Miami will be making their first appearances at college basketball's grand finale, the first time since 1970 that three first-timers all showed up in the same year.If the unfamiliar names — to say nothing of the seedings — are any indication, fans might look back on 2022-23 as the season when true parity finally sunk down deep into the bones of America's favorite basketball tournament and turned March Madness into a total free-for-all, all the way to the last weekend.There will be no No. 1 seed at the Final Four for the first time since 2011. Instead, there will be a 9 seed in Florida Atlantic, a pair of 5 seeds in SDSU and Miami, and a 4 seed in UConn. The combined seed total of the four teams is 23, the second-highest total since the seeding began in 1979. This marks the first time that not a single top-3 seed made it.The matchups for Saturday: San Diego State against FAU, in a not-so-classic 5-vs-9 matchup. (San Diego State, a 57-56 winner over Creighton on Sunday, is a 1.5-point favorite, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.) Who saw that coming?In the later game, it's the Hurricanes as 5 1/2-point underdogs against UConn, which is the prohibitive favorite, at minus-135, to bring a fifth national title home.If UConn does win, it will join Kentucky, North Carolina and Kansas as the fourth school to win the championship under three or more coaches. Dan Hurley would join Jim Calhoun and Kevin Ollie in the winner's circle for the Huskies.In the past, some of the upheaval in the brackets could have been pinned on the single-elimination format and the tournament selection committee, which sometimes overvalues its top seeds — this year, that included first-round loser Purdue and seven-loss defending-champion Kansas — while clearly underrating others.No team got undervalued more than UConn (29-8), which had 25 wins coming in, a No. 8 standing in the NET rankings — which looks at quality wins among other factors — and the still-developing potential of junior Adama Sanogo, who has averaged 20 points and just a touch under 10 rebounds in four tournament games.But all the other factors upending college sports — namely, NIL deals and the transfer portal — played a role here, too.Heading into the Elite Eight, Miami coach Jim Larrañaga — who brought George Mason to the Final Four as an 11 seed 17 years ago — said the portal was the basketball equivalent of speed dating. Worked for him. The third- and fourth-leading scorers for the Hurricanes (29-7), Nijel Pack and Norchad Omier, both came to The U from the portal.Also down in South Florida, FAU got three key players, including 7-foot-1 Russian center Vladislav Goldin, from elsewhere. All moved to the campus in Boca Raton after less-than-successful stays at big-conference schools. No one was quite sure how coach Dusty May would blend all these new faces from different places. Turns out, he did pretty well. At 35-3, nobody has more wins this season than the Owls.“We already had a good chemistry last year, and the pieces that we added just complemented everything we had going on,” said Bryan Greenlee, in his second year at FAU after coming over from Minnesota.A longtime power in the Mountain West Conference, San Diego State was 30-2 and projected for a No. 1 seed in 2020 when the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Three years later, the Aztecs (31-6) are two wins away from the title. Their top two scorers, Matt Bradley and Darrion Trammell, are — you guessed it — products of the transfer portal, though coach Brian Dutcher brought them in as much for defense as scoring. SDSU made it this far behind a defense that held top-seeded Alabama to 32% shooting in the Sweet 16 and held Creighton to 11% from 3-point range in Sunday's win.Asked what to expect from the Aztecs in Houston next week, Dutcher said, “I would think pretty good defense, to start with.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847462,March Madness: SC's Boston vs. Terps' Miller for Final Four,"GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — Aliyah Boston has played her share of All-Americans this season and each time, she and South Carolina have always ended up victorious.Facing Maryland's Diamond Miller, a second-team AP All-American, is nothing more than the next step of a journey focused on success.“I take it as another game,” Boston, a three-time first-team All-American, said Sunday, “just the opposing five players that we have to play against.”The top-seeded undefeated Gamecocks (35-0) face the Terrapins (28-6) on Monday night in the Greenville 1 Region for a trip to the Final Four in Dallas next week. It's a rematch of a game at Maryland last November where South Carolina throttled the home team, 81-56.The Terps were without Miller, the smooth, 6-foot-3 senior who leads the team with an average of 19.7 points and 6.5 rebounds this season.“I'm not sure at that point of the season whether we would have had Diamond, it would have made a difference,"" Maryland coach Brenda Frese said.Miller has missed the past two games against South Carolina in 2021 and 2022 because of injury. Her lone appearance came in November 2019 when she and Boston were both freshmen.Boston had 14 points and seven rebounds in the Gamecocks' 63-54 win while Miller finished with 10 points and five rebounds.Boston has been as steady in her approach since she first stepped on the court at South Carolina. There were moments when coach Dawn Staley had to tweak and shape Boston's practice habits early on, guidance the young player took to heart and improved.With Boston a senior who swept the major national awards last season, Staley said her centerpiece performer is solely focused on the wins.""She doesn’t care about stats. She doesn’t care about double doubles. She just wants to win,"" Staley said. “I think she wants to go out as winners with her team. Like that is it.”Boston has taken on her share of talented players this season. She had 14 points and 13 rebounds in a 76-71 overtime win at Stanford in November to overcome Cardinal star Cameron Brink's 25 points.On Super Bowl Sunday, Boston and the Gamecocks put away LSU and first-team All-American Angel Reese, 88-64. Boston had 14 points and nine rebounds while Reese's streak of 23 double doubles to start the season ended as she had 16 points and four rebounds.Miller was disappointed she couldn't play the past two against South Carolina and is simply excited to get another chance at Boston and the defending national champions.“Aliyah is a great player,” Miller said. ""They have a lot of great players, and our class of 2019 is really thriving right now. It’s going to be fun.""POINT GUARD DUOStaley brought in Georgia Tech grad transfer Kierra Fletcher for her experience and steadiness at running at team with sophomore Raven Johnson, expected to take over the point this season, coming off a serious knee injury.Instead of a competition, Fletcher and Johnson formed a bond that helped make the Gamecocks better. Fletcher has started 31 games this season, but Johnson has averaged more minutes coming off the bench.Staley says their practice work has improved the team and kept the undefeated season going. It's lot like, Staley recalled, when she and Teresa Edwards competed at point guard for the ABL's Richmond Rage. Staley couldn't supplant Edwards as starter and focused on making everyone better.“We had knock-down, drag-outs,” Staley said. “And we made our team better because of what we were able to bring to the table. And that's what Raven and Kierra are doing for our team.”LARGE, HOSTILE CROWDMaryland's Frese believes her team is accustomed to playing and tuning out large crowds — as the team will see Monday night against South Carolina.The game is at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena (nicknamed, “The Well""), about 90 minutes from South Carolina's home court. There were 12,879 people in the building for the Gamecocks' 59-43 win over UCLA in the Sweet 16 on Saturday.Even more South Carolina fans are expected at the 15,951-seat building for the next game. The Gamecocks have led women's basketball in attendance the past eight seasons, including this season as they averaged 12,942 per game.Frese said her team has competed in front of large crowds at Notre Dame, at Baylor and at the Big Ten Tournament semifinals against Iowa, where much of the fans were backing the Hawkeyes and their star Caitlin Clark.“We've been in so many of these,"" Frese said, ""that we don't even blink anymore.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847463,Antonio Conte leaves Tottenham by mutual agreement,"LONDON (AP) — Antonio Conte has left his position as Tottenham manager by mutual agreement, the Premier League club said Sunday.The Italian's assistant, Cristian Stellini, has been appointed acting head coach for the rest of the season.The announcement comes just over a week after Conte delivered a post-match rant in which he accused the team's players of being “selfish” and also took aim at the club's ownership.“We have 10 Premier League games remaining and we have a fight on our hands for a Champions League place,"" Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said in a club statement released Sunday night. ""We all need to pull together. Everyone has to step up to ensure the highest possible finish for our Club and amazing, loyal supporters.”Conte was in charge of Tottenham for 16 months but was unable to end its trophy drought stretching back to 2008.His tenure ended in an undignified way, with his outburst after the 3-3 draw at Southampton making his departure almost inevitable. His contract was due to expire at the end of the season.The 53-year-old Conte tore into his players for what he perceived to be a poor attitude, accusing them of not playing as a team and failing to deal with pressure, before saying: “20 years there is the (same) owner and they never won something.”After days of speculation about his future, Tottenham confirmed his exit.“We can announce that Head Coach Antonio Conte has left the Club by mutual agreement,” the London club said in its statement. “We achieved Champions League qualification in Antonio’s first season at the Club. We thank Antonio for his contribution and wish him well for the future.”Conte leaves with Tottenham out of the Champions League and FA Cup, ensuring it will not win any silverware this season. But the team is in fourth place in the league and in contention to qualify for the Champions League again next season.Tottenham appointed former Chelsea manager Conte as the replacement for Nuno Espirito Santo in November 2021, with the club in eighth place. He succeeded in guiding it to a top-four finish, one of only three Tottenham managers to have done so in the Premier League era.Mauricio Pochettino achieved Champions League qualification in four consecutive seasons between 2015-16 and 2018-19, while Harry Redknapp did so twice in 2009-10 and 2011-12.Tottenham spent about $140 million since Conte's arrival, including $73.5 million on Brazil forward Richarlison. The most recent signing was Pedro Porro, a wing back bought because he suits Conte’s ideal 3-4-3 formation.Conte has just returned to the touchline after recovering from gallbladder surgery and also has had to contend with personal trauma following the deaths of three close friends over the past five months — Tottenham fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone, and former players Sinisa Mihajlovic and Gianluca Vialli.His outburst after Southampton was surprising even for a manager who has developed a reputation for being fiery.“They don’t want to play under pressure. They don’t want to play under stress,” he said.Some interpreted it as evidence he wanted to go.“Conte wants to be sacked (fired) in this international break,” TV commentator Jamie Carragher wrote on Twitter at the time. “Spurs should just put him out of his misery and do it tonight.”Stellini led Tottenham’s first team while Conte was recovering from his recent surgery, which included the loss to second-tier Sheffield United in the FA Cup.Ryan Mason has been appointed as assistant head coach.___AP Sports Writer Steve Douglas contributed to this report.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847475,Bulls spoil LeBron's return with 118-108 win over Lakers,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James scored 19 points off the bench in his return from a monthlong injury absence, but Zach LaVine scored 32 points to lead the Chicago Bulls to a 118-108 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.DeMar DeRozan added 17 points for the Bulls, who easily overcame James' return for their seventh win in nine games. LaVine hit 11 of his first 14 shots to lead an offensive effort that snapped the Lakers' three-game winning streak despite the return of the NBA's career scoring leader.James sat out 13 games with right foot soreness, missing four weeks during the Lakers' run at a playoff berth. The team provided few updates on his recovery, and his return came with little advance warning.“I felt confident in the workouts that I had this week,” James said. “And the day after the workouts, when I woke up, stepped out down off the bed, I could possibly play today. And after my workout early before the game today, I knew I could play.”For only the second time in his 20-year, 1,958-game NBA career, James wasn't a starter. He came in as a reserve midway through the first quarter, doing his standard pregame chalk toss while receiving a standing ovation from Lakers fans. James got a field goal in every quarter, and he finished with eight rebounds, three assists and five turnovers in 30 minutes.“You could see him getting his rhythm, his timing, his finishes, all of that,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “He's a savvy veteran, one of the greatest ever to do it, so it's not going to take all that much.""Chicago largely controlled play despite James’ return, streaking to a 20-point lead in the second quarter. Los Angeles briefly got the lead down to single digits down the stretch, but got no closer.“There are going to be swings, and that was the encouraging part,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “I'm seeing a response back competitively.”Patrick Beverley had 10 points and five assists in his first game against the Lakers since they traded him last month. Beverley has been outspoken about his desire to hurt the Lakers’ playoff hopes during this home-and-home series between the teams, but Davis and the other Lakers just smiled at his provocative talk.When Beverley made a little hook shot with 1:12 left to boost Chicago’s lead back to double digits, Beverley slapped the floor and made the dismissive “too small” gesture sometimes used by NBA players to taunt their opponents, in this case James.“I was just playing basketball,"" Beverley said. ""Obviously it's good to see some old teammates, old coaching staff.”Troy Brown Jr. and Malik Beasley scored 18 points apiece, but Anthony Davis managed just 15 points and nine rebounds as the Lakers (37-38) failed to get above .500 for the first time since Jan. 9, 2022.The Lakers were without D’Angelo Russell, who missed his second straight game with a right hip injury. Los Angeles went 8-5 in James’ absence, but his return will force an adjustment of the chemistry built by his teammates in his absence.“We came out a little flat, turned the ball over early, just weren't aggressive enough, physical enough,” Ham said.VOOCH TOSSEDThe Bulls largely controlled Davis even after Nikola Vucevic was ejected in the second quarter with two quick technical fouls when he argued what appeared to be a good call against him. Donovan jokingly wondered how Vucevic could be ejected when he was arguing in his native Serbian.“Obviously it was a bad decision by me to react the way I did,” Vucevic said. “My mistake. I'm just glad my teammates came through for us. I obviously overreacted, for sure.”TIP-INSBulls: DeRozan sat out Friday’s win in Portland with a strained quadriceps He will attempt to play in both back-to-back games in Los Angeles, Donovan said. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847476,Churches provide solace in tornado-ravaged Mississippi Delta,"ROLLING FORK, Miss. (AP) — As a deadly tornado tore through the lower Mississippi Delta, the Rev. Mary Stewart clung to a door in the hallway of her Rolling Fork home, shielding herself from the branches and chunks of debris that came flying through her shattered windows.Friday's storm flattened entire town blocks, but the Rolling Fork Methodist Church withstood the high winds. And so the first Sunday after the twister commenced just like any other Sunday — with congregants reaffirming their faith and finding solace together.“We are a very religious community,” said Laura Allmon, a fourth-generation congregant. “It just means a lot for us to be able to get together and pray and be thankful for what we have.”At least 25 people were killed and dozens were injured late Friday in Mississippi as the storm ripped through one of the poorest regions in the country, carving out a swath of destruction. Elsewhere, a man was killed in neighboring Alabama after his trailer home flipped over several times.Their homes rendered unlivable, many Rolling Fork residents flocked Sunday to the network of churches dotting the landscape. It is a close-knit farming community bound by intergenerational ties of family and faith that form the social fabric of this rural Southern town of about 2,000.Wayne Williams, 55, teaches construction skills at a vocational center. He was working with others Sunday to clean up some relatively minor damage at the building. Across the street, a large metal building that had been a community center was ripped apart by the tornado.“It’s going to be a long road to recovery, to rebuild and get over all the devastation,” Williams said of his community. “With God in the mix, we will recover.”For Rolling Fork, a rebuilding process now awaits unlike any the town has faced before. But Friday's tornado wasn't the first time residents have had their lives upended by the elements. In 2019, the worst flooding since 1973 drove some from their homes.Religion is a central way residents of the Delta cope with an unpredictable climate and entrenched poverty.“So many people here know patience from farm work,” Stewart said. “With their dependence on the rain for their crops — their livelihood — and having to leave it in God’s hands … it’s a wonderful reaffirmation that God is in control.”Founded nearly 135 years ago, the Rolling Fork Methodist Church has long been a source of support and resilience in hard times, its members said.Since the church building was without power Sunday morning, roughly two dozen worshipers gathered on its historic steps and bowed their heads while Stewart delivered a short sermon.“We’re grateful, Lord, that you brought us through this storm,” she said, standing in sunshine beneath a clear blue sky. “We have a lot to do and a lot of rebuilding, and there are people that we’ve lost in our town. … We pray for their families.”Elsewhere, President Joe Biden issued an emergency declaration for Mississippi early Sunday, making federal funding available to the hardest hit areas.Based on early data, the tornado received a preliminary EF-4 rating, with top wind gusts between 166 mph and 200 mph (265 kph and 320 kph), according to the National Weather Service office in Jackson. Officials said the twister was on the ground for more than an hour.Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves issued a state of emergency and vowed to help rebuild as he viewed the damage in the region, which boasts wide expanses of cotton, corn and soybean fields and catfish farming ponds. He spoke with Biden, who also held a call with the state’s congressional delegation.More than a half-dozen shelters were opened in Mississippi to house displaced residents.Just a few blocks down the road from the Rolling Fork Methodist Church, pastor Britt Williamson spoke from the pulpit at First Baptist Church, addressing rows of weary congregants. During the service, people hugged, shook hands and wiped away tears.“The Delta is a hard soul for the gospel,” Williamson said. “Through the calamity of what happened, God has brought a plow bigger than any of these farmers could have.”He said faith gives people something to hold onto during life’s challenges.“We don’t want to help people just to give them a place to live. We don’t want to feed them for a day,” he said. “We want to give them an eternal home.”Marlon Nicholas, a congregant of the church, said his family’s attendance at a local high school prom Friday night meant they stayed safe even as their home was destroyed. He said other relatives also lost their homes but escaped without serious injuries.“Miracles,” he said.",2023/03/27,,World

Bowen Byram also scored for the Avalanche.Clayton Keller scored his 36th goal for Arizona, which extended its points streak at home to eight games. Matias Maccelli and Christian Fischer also scored for Arizona.“I thought our first 40 minutes was outstanding,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “We looked like we were standing around in the (defensive) zone. Obviously they came out with another level of intensity and I don’t think we responded real well.“We found a way to win in the shootout and we’ll take the two points.”The Avalanche opened the scoring nearly midway through the game. Ingram’s attempt to clear the puck hit Rantanen behind the net and the Colorado forward put it in for his 48th.Colorado made it 2-0 just 1:16 later when Byram scored off a rebound from Logan O’Connor’s shot. Andrew Cogliano also assisted on Byram’s eighth goal of the season.Arizona found its offense in the third period. Maccelli got the Coyotes on the board 10:37 into the period, then Fischer tied it a minute later after Colorado got caught in a line change. Michael Kesselring, in his eighth NHL game, assisted on Fischer’s goal for his first career point.“We tried to do too much with the puck, and (that doesn’t work) against that kind of elite team,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said of the Avalanche’s second period spurt. “I knew we could (come back), and have a little bit better mindset offensively, I believe in the drive of our guys.”Liam O’Brien went to the penalty box 12 seconds after Fischer’s goal, and Nichushkin made the Coyotes pay with a power-play goal with assists from Rantanen and Devon Toews.SCHEDULING QUIRKThe Avalanche and Coyotes were the only NHL teams who were idle on Saturday.

(AP) — New Mexico State's new coach said Sunday his focus is on rebuilding the culture of a program that was shut down in midseason after back-to-back scandals.“I think they made a statement when they hired a guy like me,” said Jason Hooten, who came from Sam Houston State and was introduced in a pep rally setting at the Aggies' arena.Flanked by athletic director Mario Moccia and chancellor Dan Arvizu, Hooten said the decision to leave Sam Houston after 13 years and 261 wins was a difficult one. It was certainly made more challenging given the situation he inherits. The Aggies are expected to lose up to half a roster from a team that was 9-15 when Arvizu shut things down after hazing allegations came on the heels of a fatal shooting of a University of New Mexico student by an Aggies player during a road trip to Albuquerque.The school is conducting an investigation into a player’s accusation in February that three teammates ganged up on him multiple times in hazing episodes.“No matter when you take over, or what the situation is, you have an opportunity to build a culture,” Hooten said. “This is a culture time. A new culture needs to be built, and a new start and a new beginning.”Hooten is slated to make $425,000 his first season and $475,000 by his fourth year. Among the incentives in the contract are $2,500 for regular-season wins over rival New Mexico and $10,000 for winning a first-round game at the NCAA Tournament.Among those in attendance to see Hooten become the school's 28th basketball coach was Mary Henson. Her late husband, Lou Henson, took the Aggies to their lone Final Four in 1970 and won 308 games over two long stints in Las Cruces.The program, which is moving from the Western Athletic Conference to Conference USA next season, has been to 10 NCAA Tournaments since 2007. The new coach said he was hoping to restore the Aggies to that level.Moccia was asked a handful of questions about the turmoil his athletic program is in. He said he hoped to be part of a task force that was recommended by an outside law firm that looked into circumstances surrounding forward Mike Peake. Peake has not been charged in the fatal shooting of UNM student Brandon Travis because Peake appeared to be acting in self-defense when he pulled a gun after being confronted by Travis at a dorm complex in Albuquerque.“Whatever the task force is made (of), and what comes out of that, we will certainly actively follow,” Moccia said. “We can always get better.”He also defended the athletic department's record of producing hundreds of players with 3.0 or better grade-point averages and who logged more than 6,000 hours of community service per year before the pandemic.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847484,North Korea test-fires 2 more missiles as US sends carrier,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Fighter jets roared off the USS Nimitz as the nuclear-powered U.S. aircraft carrier and its battle group began exercises with South Korean warships on Monday, hours after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles in an apparent protest of the allies’ expanding drills.The seventh missile test this month underscored heightening tensions in the region as both the North’s weapons tests and the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises have intensified in a cycle of tit-for-tat.The launches may have been timed for the arrival of the USS Nimitz and its strike group, including a guided missile cruiser and two destroyers, which engaged in air defense exercises and other drills with South Korean warships in waters near Jeju island.Jang Do Young, a South Korean navy spokesperson, said the drills were aimed at sharpening joint operational capabilities and demonstrating the U.S. commitment to defend its ally with the full range of options, including nuclear, in face of the North’s “escalating nuclear and missile threats.”The Nimitz strike group was expected to arrive at the South Korean mainland port of Busan on Tuesday.“The United States has deployable strategic assets at the ready on every day,” said Rear Adm. Christopher Sweeney, commander of Carrier Strike Group Eleven. “We can continue to deploy those assets and we will.”South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the two North Korean missiles were fired from a western inland area south of the North's capital of Pyongyang from around 7:47 a.m. to 8 a.m. and traveled around 370 kilometers (229 miles) before landing at sea. Japan’s military said the missiles, which landed outside Japan's exclusive economic zone, flew on an irregular trajectory and reached a maximum altitude of 50 kilometers (31 miles).Japan has previously used similar language to describe a North Korean solid-fuel missile apparently modeled after Russia’s Iskander mobile ballistic system, which is designed to be maneuverable in low-altitude flight to better evade South Korean missile defenses. North Korea also has another short-range system with similar characteristics that resembles the U.S. MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System.Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said North Korea may dial up its testing activity further with more missile launches or even conducting its first nuclear test since September 2017.The South Korean and Japanese militaries denounced the latest launches as a serious provocation threatening regional peace and said they were working with the United States to analyze the missiles further. The U.S. Indo Pacific Command said the launches did not pose an immediate threat to the United States or its allies, but still highlighted the “destabilizing impact” of North Korea's illicit nuclear weapons and missiles programs.North Korea, which has weathered tightened U.N. Security Council sanctions since 2016 over its nuclear developments, didn't immediately comment on the launches.The United States and South Korea completed their biggest springtime exercises in years last week, which had included both computer simulations and live-fire field exercises. But the allies have continued their field training in a show of force against the North's rising threats.North Korea had also fired a short-range missile when the USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group arrived for joint drills with South Korea in September, which was the last time the United States sent an aircraft carrier to waters near the Korean Peninsula.North Korea has launched more than 20 ballistic and cruise missiles on 11 occasions this year as it tries to force the United States to accept its nuclear status and negotiate a removal of sanctions from a position of strength.The weapons tested this month included an intercontinental ballistic missile and a series of short-range missiles intended to overwhelm South Korean defenses as North Korea tries to demonstrate an ability to conduct nuclear strikes on both South Korea and the U.S. mainland.The North last week carried out what it described as a three-day exercise that simulated nuclear attacks on South Korean targets.The country's leader Kim Jong Un has condemned the U.S.-South Korean joint military drills as invasion rehearsals. The allies say the exercises are defensive in nature.The tests also included a purported nuclear-capable underwater drone that the North claimed can set off a huge “radioactive tsunami” and destroy naval vessels and ports. Analysts were skeptical whether such a device was a major new threat and Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement Monday that it considers the North Korean claims likely to be “exaggerated and fabricated.”North Korea, following some of its ballistic and cruise missile tests this month, also claimed that those weapons were tipped with mock nuclear warheads that detonated 600 to 800 meters (1,960 to 2,600 feet) above their sea targets, communicating them as heights that would maximize damage.North Korea already is coming off a record year in weapons testing, launching more than 70 missiles in 2022. It had set into law an escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes pre-emptive nuclear strikes in a broad range of scenarios where it may perceive its leadership as under threat.“It appears North Korea might be practicing, or signaling that it’s practicing, the use of nuclear strikes, both preemptive and retaliatory, in a range of scenarios that are authorized in its nuclear doctrine,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security.“The problem is that continued testing helps Pyongyang perfect its technology, strengthen its nuclear weapons capability that threatens South Korea and Japan, increase the likelihood of miscalculation that could lead to inadvertent conflict, and accumulate political leverage ahead of future diplomatic talks with Washington.”Following the North’s announcement of the drone test on Friday, South Korea’s air force released details of a five-day joint drill with the United States last week that included live-fire demonstrations of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons.The air force said the exercise was aimed at verifying precision strike capabilities and reaffirming the credibility of Seoul’s “three-axis” strategy against North Korean nuclear threats — preemptively striking sources of attacks, intercepting incoming missiles and neutralizing the North’s leadership and key military facilities.___Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847485,"Miller, Wong rally Miami past Texas 88-81 for 1st Final Four","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — On the eve of Miami playing for a place in its first Final Four, the quiet conversation floating through the team hotel did not revolve around all that the Hurricanes had accomplished this season. Instead, they talked about what had happened to bring last season to a close.The sting of an Elite Eight defeat was fresh to those who were there. And they made everyone else feel it, too.“That loss sat with me for a really long time,” the Hurricanes' Jordan Miller said. “It doesn't go away, and the fact that we had the opportunity to come back and make amends, make it right, that’s what was pushing me.”Miller responded with a perfect performance against second-seeded Texas in the Midwest Region final Sunday. Along with Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year Isaiah Wong and March dynamo Nijel Pack, Miller rallied the Hurricanes from a 13-point second-half deficit for an 88-81 victory that clinched that long-awaited trip to the national semifinals.“How hard we fought to come back in this game, especially on a stage like this, it’s an amazing feeling,” said Pack, one of Miami’s newcomers. “I know how much these guys wanted to win this game, especially being here last year and losing the Elite Eight, and now being able to take it to the Final Four is something special.”Miller finished with 27 points, going 7 of 7 from the field and 13 of 13 from the foul line, while Wong scored 12 of his 14 points in the second half against the Longhorns, who had been the top remaining seed in a topsy-turvy NCAA Tournament.Now, the No. 5 seed Hurricanes (29-7) have a date with No. 4 seed UConn on Saturday night in Houston. Two more Final Four newbies, fifth-seeded San Diego State and No. 9 seed Florida Atlantic, will play in the other national semifinal.It's the first time since seeding began in 1979 that no team seeded better than No. 4 made the Final Four, so perhaps it is fitting that Miami coach Jim Larrañaga is involved. He took George Mason there as an 11 seed 17 years ago to the day.Miami was a 10 seed last year when it lost 76-50 to eventual national champion Kansas in a regional final.“No one wanted to go home,” said Miller, coincidentally a George Mason transfer, who joined Duke’s Christian Laettner as the only players since 1960 to go 20 for 20 combined from the field and foul line in an NCAA tourney game. “We came together. We stuck together. We showed really good perseverance and the will — the will to just want to get there.”After Miami climbed back from a 64-51 deficit with 13:22 to play, the game was tied at 79-all when Norchad Omier was fouled by the Longhorns' Brock Cunningham while going for a loose ball. He made both of the foul shots to give the Hurricanes the lead, then stole the ball from Texas star Marcus Carr at the other end, and Wong made to more free throws with 34 seconds remaining to keep them ahead for good.Miller kept drilling foul shots down the stretch to ice the Midwest Region title for the Hurricanes.Wooga Poplar scored 16 points, and Pack followed up his virtuoso performance against top-seeded Houston with 15, as the same school that once dropped hoops entirely in the 1970s advanced to the game’s biggest stage.“You just love when your players accomplish a goal they set out before the season,” Larrañaga said.Carr led the Longhorns (29-9) with 17 points, though he was bothered by a hamstring injury late in the game. Timmy Allen added 16 and Sir’Jabari Rice had 15 in the finale of a season that began with the firing of Chris Beard over domestic violence charges that were later dropped and ended with interim coach Rodney Terry consoling a heartbroken team.“These guys more than any group I’ve worked with in 32 years of coaching have really embodied, in terms of staying the course, being a team,” Terry said, choking up so hard on the postgame dais that he could barely speak. “They were so unselfish as a team, and they gave us everything they had. They really did.”The Longhorns revealed about 90 minutes before tipoff that Dylan Disu, the Big 12 tourney MVP and early star of the NCAA Tournament, would miss the game with a foot injury. He hurt it in the second round against Penn State and only played about 90 seconds in the Sweet 16 against Xavier before watching the rest of that game in a walking boot.Without their 6-foot-9 star, the Longhorns’ deep group of dangerous guards resorted to potshots from the perimeter against Miami’s porous defense. Rice hit two 3s early, Carr two of his own, and the Longhorns stormed to a 45-37 halftime lead.On the other end, Texas tried to keep Pack and Wong from producing a sequel to their 3-point barrage against Houston.Pack, who dropped seven 3s in the regional semifinal, didn’t even attempt one until there were 7 1/2 minutes left in the first half, and his best shot — a looping rainbow as he fell out of bounds — didn’t even count because it went over the backboard.Wong took as many shots and scored as many points (two) as he had turnovers in the game’s first 20 minutes.The Longhorns’ advantage stretched to 13 in the second half, and tension built on the Miami bench. At one point, Harlond Beverly and Larrañaga got into a verbal spat and the 73-year-old coach yanked the backup guard from the game.Fortunately for the ’Canes, Pack and Wong were poised, Poplar and Miller seemingly possessed.Still trailing 72-64 with about eight minutes to play, Pack and Wong joined Miller and Omier in turbocharging a 13-3 run to give the Hurricanes a 77-75 lead, their first since the opening minutes. When Rice answered at the other end for Texas, Miller calmly made two go-ahead free throws to begin his late-game parade to the line.Carr made a nifty turnaround jumper to tie the game again for Texas, but the Miami momentum never slowed. Omier made two free throws with a minute left, swiped the ball from Carr at the other end, and Miller and Co. finished it off.“We just all bought into staying together, keeping that hope alive,” Miller said, “and the way we just willed this one through, I think everybody played really well, and I think it really shows the poise of this squad.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847486,"Virginia Tech, Ohio State seek Final Four berth","SEATTLE (AP) — Once the brackets were released, a showcase featuring two of the biggest powerhouse names in women’s college basketball seemed inevitable.And then Virginia Tech and Ohio State went and kicked aside the nostalgic hopes of a possible UConn and Tennessee showdown with a Final Four berth on the line.Instead, it will be the top-seeded Hokies (30-4) and the No. 3 seed Buckeyes (28-7) meeting Monday night in the Seattle 3 Regional final and the last spot in Dallas on the line.And it’ll provide another fresh face to the Final Four landscape. Ohio State hasn’t reached a Final Four since 1993, its only appearance in school history. Virginia Tech had never even reached the Elite Eight before Saturday night’s win over Tennessee.“I think that’s the beauty because these kids have dreamed — they didn’t dream of playing for Tennessee or UConn. They dreamed of getting to the Elite Eight, the Final Four, and now they’re accomplishing those goals,” Virginia Tech coach Kenny Brooks said. “And I want them to relish in it. I want them to understand what they have accomplished for Virginia Tech.”While it was easy to dream at the potential of another UConn-Tennessee matchup after the tournament field was unveiled, Virginia Tech was the No. 1 seed in the region for good reason. The Hokies’ 73-64 win over the Lady Vols in the Sweet 16 was their 14th straight win.The previous time Virginia Tech suffered a setback was Jan. 26 at Duke. Two months later, there hasn’t been another blemish and only one of those 14 wins has been by fewer than eight points.“I think the end of our season that we had kind of prepared us for this,” Virginia Tech guard Georgia Amoore said. “We played a bunch of talented teams back-to-back-to-back. I think it tested us a lot. We came out with wins, but we definitely learned a lot from that final season stretch.”For Ohio State, getting to a regional final is an accomplishment, but also the Buckeyes are finally meeting their lofty expectations. Prior to this season, Ohio State had been a top-3 seed in the tournament six times and failed to reach the Elite Eight.That included 2016 when Ohio State was a No. 3 seed and lost to seventh-seeded Tennessee in the Sweet 16. Two years later, the Buckeyes were again a No. 3 seed and were upset by No. 11 seed Central Michigan in the second round.But their success — including the dominant win over UConn in the regional semifinal — has given Ohio State the chance to add another new fresh face to the Final Four.“There is a lot more parity than there used to be. But to really validate that statement we need new teams in the Final Four,” Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said. “So I think this is obviously a great opportunity for both programs.”KNOWN COMMODITYOhio State freshman Cotie McMahon was sensational in the win over UConn with 23 points, including 18 in the first half when the Buckeyes built a 10-point halftime lead. McMahon was the freshman of the year in the Big Ten and has scored in double figures in 15 of the past 17 games for Ohio State.She was a known standout to McGuff by playing her high school career about an hour from Columbus. Brooks — and a special assistant — was also aware of McMahon’s talent.“I have a 17-year-old daughter and once a year I’ll take her in the summertime and let her tag along with me on a recruiting trip. And one of these ones we happened to sit down and watch Cotie. And she doesn’t really know people’s names, but she knows Cotie McMahon’s name,” Brooks said. “And we’ve been watching them during the year, and she’s like, ‘There’s that Cotie girl.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, that’s that Cotie girl. She’s really good.’ And now all of a sudden we’re facing her.”HANDLING PRESSUREVirginia Tech struggled in the fourth quarter handling the full-court pressure from Tennessee. The press allowed the Lady Vols to trim an 18-point deficit down to 53-52 before the Hokies settled and pulled away in the closing minutes.The pressure from the Lady Vols was a precursor to what Virginia Tech will face from Ohio State and its full-court press.“I think the whole ACC teams, Duke, Louisville, Miami, they’re all aggressive styles and they all pressed at some points in the game,” Virginia Tech’s Cayla King said. “So playing those teams throughout the year and the ACC tournament I think has prepared us some for this.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847487,"Top prospect Volpe, 21, wins Yankees' starting shortstop job","TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Anthony Volpe grew up watching Derek Jeter star at shortstop for the New York Yankees.Now, the 21-year-old is getting the chance to be the Yankees' opening day shortstop Thursday against the San Francisco Giants.The team announced Sunday after a 6-2 win over Toronto in spring training that Volpe had won the spot. New York manager Aaron Boone called the kid into his office to deliver the news.“My heart was beating pretty hard,” said Volpe, rated one of baseball's best prospects. “Incredible. I'm just so excited. It's hard for me to even put into words.""Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, hitting coach Dillon Lawson and bench coach Carlos Mendoza were also present.Volpe was able to share the news with his parents and other family members near the Yankees' dugout and said it is something he will never forget.“It was pretty emotional,"" Volpe said. “It was just an unbelievable moment to share with them.”Volpe, who grew up a Yankees fan, lived in Manhattan as a child before moving to New Jersey. Jeter was his favorite player.“It's very surreal,” Volpe said. “I've only ever been to games at Yankee Stadium and for the most part only watched him play there.”Volpe is hitting .314 with three homers, five RBIs and a .417 on-base percentage in 17 Grapefruit League games. He has just 22 games of experience at Triple-A.Spring training started with Volpe, Oswald Peraza and holdover Isiah Kiner-Falefa competing for the everyday shortstop job. Kiner-Falefa was shifted into a utility role midway through camp, and Peraza was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Sunday evening.“While certainly the performance was there, he killed it between the lines,” Boone said of Volpe. “All the other things that we've been hearing about showed up. There's an energy he plays the game with, and an instinct that he has that is evident. He really checked every box that we could have had for him. Absolutely kicked the door in and earned his opportunity.""Volpe arrived in Florida in December to work out at the Yankees' minor league complex.“He's earned the right to take that spot, and we're excited for him and excited for us,” Cashman said. “He just dominated all sides of the ball during February and March, and that bodes well obviously for him as we move forward.”Volpe was selected out of high school with the 30th overall pick in the 2019 draft from Delbarton School in New Jersey. He passed up a college commitment to Vanderbilt to sign with the Yankees.“It was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get into the organization,” Volpe said. “This day, this feeling, this moment was kind of what I've worked my whole life for when I made that big decision.”“Right now it's crazy,” he added. “I don't even know what lies ahead but Thursday I just want to go out and play, and have fun.”___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847488,Reddick wins COTA crashfest in triple OT for 23XI Racing,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Tyler Reddick had the lead and the fastest car on the track when calamity nearly struck.Caution. Restart. Caution. Restart. Caution. Restart.Enough slowdowns to make a driver lose his mind.Or at least his cool.Reddick handled it nearly to perfection Sunday, earning his first victory with new team 23XI Racing by holding on over multiple late restarts to win in triple overtime Sunday at Circuit of the Americas, the first road course race on this year’s NASCAR schedule.“Didn’t quite get the restarts perfectly, but we got the one that mattered,"" Reddick said. ""The last one.”Reddick’s victory was the first of the year for Toyota and his first since joining the team co-owned by Denny Hamlin and Michael Jordan. It was Reddick’s fourth career Cup Series win, third on a road course. Reddick won a year ago at Road America and on the road course at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in his final season with Richard Childress Racing.This one might have been the most nerve wracking.Reddick had to hold the front through the elevated, switchback left hand turn that saw the field bunch up and smash each other time after time on the restarts. The race had eight cautions for 17 laps and went to three overtimes and seven laps past the scheduled distance.Hamlin said Reddick showed poise to match talent that could lead to a whole lot of victories. He got Reddick to agree to sign with 23XI with a full year remaining on his RCR contract, and then was able to secure Reddick early for 2023 when Kurt Busch was forced to retire because of a concussion.“I knew he was going to be the most coveted free agent in a very, very, very long time. That’s why I got the jump on it and it cost me a lot of money to do it,” Hamlin said. “You have to have that driver you feel can carry you to championships ... I feel like we have that guy.”Kyle Busch, who pushed Reddick through the final three restarts, finished second in the Chevrolet for RCR that became available to the two-time Cup champion when Reddick jumped to 23XI.“When we tested here, they were lights out,” Busch said of 23XI. “Tyler obviously is a really good road racer. He proved it driving this car here last year. I’ve been trying to emulate the things he did in order to make this car fast last year, but not quite all the way there.”Alex Bowman, who had a chance to win on the final lap at COTA last season, was third in a Chevrolet from Hendrick Motorsports.Ross Chastain, the defending race winner, finished fourth and was confronted post-race inside his car by Trackhouse Racing teammate Daniel Suarez over the aggressive nature of the race. Suarez also exchanged words with Bowman. NASCAR may take action against Suarez for using his car to bump both Bowman and Chastain on pit road.“He just thought I drove in and tried to drive through him,” Bowman said. “Daniel and I, we’ve been teammates in the past, raced together a long time. I respect the hell out of him. I’m sure he’s still not super happy. Just tried to explain that I wouldn’t race him like that, that I was shoved in there.”William Byron finished fifth for Hendrick and Austin Cindric was the highest-finishing Ford driver in sixth for Team Penske.There were no stage breaks for the first time this season under a rule change introduced for the six road course races in 2023. That left teams to manage different pit stop strategies.Reddick appeared to have managed the perfect strategy before the rash of late collisions, caution flags and restarts left him with a harder path to win.The race included former Formula One champions Kimi Raikkonen and Jenson Button. Raikkonen drove Trackhouse Racing’s Project91 entry that is designed to give a seat in NASCAR to drivers from others disciplines. He finished 27th. Button drove the No. 15 Mobil 1 Ford Mustang for Rick Ware Racing as part of a three-race deal for road courses this season. He was 18th.Raikkonen was running as high as fourth on a late late restart but was quickly shuffled into the pack.Another “road course ringer” on the track Sunday was sports car driver four-time IMSA champion Jordan Taylor driving for injured Chase Elliott, who is still recovering from a fractured leg in a snowboarding accident and participated in the Fox Sports broadcast booth remotely from Colorado.Taylor finished 24th.CROSSOVER APPEALTrackhouse team owner Justin Marks expects Project91 to run several times this season. Project91 ran only Watkins Glen with Raikkonen last season.“We’re going to definitely race this car multiple times this year,"" Marks said.COTA’S NASCAR FUTUREAfter three years racing at the track built for Formula One, signs point to a possible return for NASCAR in 2024.Speedway Motorsports, which runs the event and rents the track for a week, has an option to return next season. Ticket holders have been given an option to reserve spots for 2024.UP NEXTThe series moves to short track racing next Sunday at Richmond Raceway in Richmond, Virginia. Denny Hamlin is the defending race winner.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World

Thanks to the outstanding performance of Yancoal Australia, the Group has received cumulative cash dividends of AUD2.2 billion and loan repayments of USD4.3 billion from Yancoal Australia as of 31 December 2022.   The coal chemicals business recorded sales revenue of RMB24.27 billion, up 13.4% year on year, with a gross margin of 13.1%. At Lunan Chemicals, the high-quality acetic anhydride and nylon-6 projects were completed and put into production, and the world's first set of acrylic acid production unit adopting the method of formaldehyde and acetic acid reacting was proved to be successful in the first trial. At Yulin Neng Hua, the 100,000 tonnes/year DMMn project entered the trial production stage, and the world's first opposite multi-nozzle gasifier with semi-waste heat boiler passed the site assessment. The Group has successfully expanded its high-end chemicals and new materials businesses along the industry value chain to create greater value.   Furthermore, the Group formulated and implemented a development plan for its new energy business, while stepping up its efforts to obtain the production quotas and advance project construction simultaneously. The first batch of more than 10 self-owned distributed photovoltaic and power storage projects has been implemented.   Looking into 2023, the external environment remains complex and challenging, and the macro economy faces intricate risks and challenges. However, China's economy demonstrates strong resilience and robust recovery momentum, providing solid support for the high-quality development of the energy industry. Although the transformation of the coal industry picks up pace, coal will continue to play an important role as the major energy source. In light of the tight global energy supply, the gradual release of advanced production capacity, and the growth of downstream demand, the coal industry is expected to witness an increase in both supply and demand in 2023, with coal prices fluctuating at medium-to-high levels. The Group will focus on the ""green, low-carbon and high-quality development"" approach, step up the transition from old to new growth drivers, accelerate business transformation and upgrading, improve the quality of operational management and control, and achieve new leapfrog growth to create greater returns for shareholders.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847506,Twitter hunts Github user who posted source code online,"NEW YORK (AP) — Some parts of Twitter's source code — the fundamental computer code on which the social network runs — were leaked online, the social media company said in a legal filing that was first reported by The New York Times.According to the legal document, first filed with the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California on Friday, Twitter had asked GitHub, an internet hosting service for software development, to take down the code where it was posted. The platform complied and said the content had been disabled, according to the filing.Twitter, based in San Francisco, noted in the filing that the postings infringe on copyrights held by Twitter.The company also asked the court to identify the alleged individual or group that posted the information without Twitter’s authorization. It's seeking names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social media profile data and IP addresses associated with the user account “FreeSpeechEnthusiast” which is suspected of being behind the leak. The name is an apparent reference to Twitter's billionaire owner, Elon Musk, who described himself as a free speech absolutist.It is difficult to know if the leak poses an immediate cybersecurity risk for users, said Lukasz OIejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant, but he did say that breach underscores internal turbulence at the company.“While this is the internal source code, including internal tools, the biggest immediate risk seems to be reputational,"" Olejnik said “It highlights the broader problem of Big Tech, which is insider risk,"" and could undermine trust between Twitter's employees or internal teams, he said.Musk had promised earlier this month that Twitter would open source all the code used to recommend tweets on March 31, saying that people “will discover many silly things, but we’ll patch issues as soon as they’re found!” He added that being transparent about Twitter's code will be “incredibly embarrassing at first” but will result in ""rapid improvement in recommendation quality.""The leak creates another challenge for Musk, who bought Twitter in October for $44 billion and took the company private. Twitter has since been engulfed in chaos, with massive layoffs and an exodus of advertisers fearful of exposure on the platform to looser rules on potentially inflammatory posts.Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is probing Musk’s mass layoffs at Twitter and trying to obtain his internal communications as part of ongoing oversight into the social media company’s privacy and cybersecurity practices, according to documents described in a congressional report.____Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report from London.",2023/03/27,,World

(AP) — David Pastrnak eclipsed the 50-goal mark by scoring twice and the Boston Bruins won their seventh game in a row by defeating the Carolina Hurricanes 4-3 in a shootout Sunday.Charlie Coyle and Jake DeBrusk Scored in the shootout in a matchup of Eastern Conference division leaders.Jakub Lauko also scored for the Bruins, who earned their 57th victory and are five wins shy of matching the all-time NHL record with nine regular-season games to play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847508,Creighton takes blame after late foul leads to tourney exit,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Creighton guard Ryan Nembhard sat quietly, tossing his head back and taking a deep breath as he reflected on the decisive foul called with 1.2 seconds left in the NCAA Tournament's South Region final against San Diego State.Ryan Kalkbrenner and Baylor Scheierman, seated next to Nembhard, had towels over their mouths.After Sunday's stunning conclusion to the best season in school history, Creighton's players were confounded, dejected and almost speechless.“It's a tough feeling. You work so hard all year, and it comes down to a play like that,” Nembhard said. “I think we could have done a little bit more to make it a game that didn't have to go down to that, but it's a tough way to lose.”The Bluejays didn't blame anyone but themselves for the 57-56 loss that sent them back to Omaha, Nebraska, one win and two points short of their first Final Four trip, while setting off a wild celebration for San Diego State, which is bound for Houston next weekend. The Aztecs will face East Region champion Florida Atlantic, another first-time Final Four team.Creighton coach Greg McDermott credited his longtime friend and colleague, Brian Dutcher, for devising a defensive scheme that allowed the Aztecs to impose their will on one of the country's top offensive teams.Creighton (24-13) entered the game averaging 77.0 points and 8.8 3-pointers, a finely tuned scoring machine that took it through the first three rounds of March Madness. San Diego State limited the Bluejays to their second-lowest point total of the season and two 3s on 17 attempts.The Bluejays never led by more than eight, relinquished their advantage with 6:45 to go and never led again.They were plagued by errant shots, unfortunate bounces, and questionable decisions such as McDermott's instruction to give a sixth team foul with 6.7 seconds left. That turned off the shot clock and allowed the Aztecs to take the final shot.Then came the sequence that had everyone talking, with Nembhard's left hand wrapped around Darrion Trammell's hip.“They came off a little screen, he got downhill and tried to make a floater,” said Nembhard, who hurt his right wrist earlier in the second half. “I tried to contest it. They called a foul.”Even Trammell, who was named the region's most outstanding player, acknowledged the contact from Nebhard didn't affect his shot, which bounced off the back of the rim.""I wouldn't say so,"" Trammell said. ""I feel I still had a good look, the refs made their call. They called it and I got an opportunity ... to win the game for my team.”After missing the first free throw, Trammell made the second to seal the Bluejays' fate.McDermott did not criticize the call, the desperation floor-length pass from Scheierman to Arthur Kaluma that was deflected out of bounds, or the officials' ensuing conclusion that time had expired.""Officiating is part of the game and we're not going to go there,” McDermott said. “We lost a game because we didn't do enough, and San Diego State did.”That was little consolation to the Bluejays, who reached their first Elite Eight since being part of the eight-team NCAA Tournament in 1941.Afterward, Scheierman walked to the locker room with a jersey over his face. Kalkbrenner rested his head against a concrete wall after leaving the court. And Nembhard had to live with the consequences of a call that Bluejays fans won't soon forget.“We don't blame officials, when we lose or we win we don't make excuses,” Nembhard said. “It may have been a bad call, it may have been the right call. It is what it is.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847512,Cavaliers clinch playoff spot with 108-91 win over Rockets,"CLEVELAND (AP) — For the first time since LeBron James left them a second time, the Cavaliers are a playoff team again.Jarrett Allen scored 24 points and had 14 rebounds, Donovan Mitchell added 22 points and the Cavs clinched a postseason spot for the first time since 2018, beating the Houston Rockets 108-91 on Sunday night.After James left five years ago, the Cavs went through a massive rebuild while enduring coaching changes, a pair of 19-win seasons and just missing the postseason last year before finally getting back.“It was a winding road to get here,” said Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff.Along with ending the five-year drought, Cleveland has also returned to the playoffs without James on its roster for the first time since 1998.“That’s crazy that that’s the stat or whatever,” said center Evan Mobley, who was born in 2001. “I’m just here trying to win the most I can, and I guess that’s a big deal for a lot of people.”The Cavs, who made it to four straight Finals with James from 2015-18, are closing in on locking up the No. 4 spot — and home-court advantage in the first round — in the Eastern Conference. They've won 9 of 11.Mobley added 19 points and Darius Garland 17 for Cleveland, which after making the play-in tournament last season, signaled it was ready to compete for a championship when it traded for Mitchell in September.Following the game, the All-Star guard Mitchell told his teammates to celebrate but not to be satisfied.“I told the guys in there, this is what you should just come to expect,” said Mitchell, who has qualified for the playoffs in each of his six NBA seasons. ""You made your first one. Appreciate and enjoy it. Celebrate it for the city, for the organization, for you individual guys who have made it.“We should come to a point now where that’s expected of us making the playoffs and continuously being here and continuously pushing forward.”Jalen Green scored 30 to pace the Rockets, who have lost five straight.Houston trailed by 20 in the third quarter but rallied and closed within five early in the fourth when Allen single-handedly put the Cavs back in control.First, Cleveland's center hustled back on defense and blocked an attempted dunk by Tari Eason. Allen then made four free throws before his dunk pushed the Cavs' lead to 11. Caris LeVert knocked down a 3-pointer and made a steal and dunk to give Cleveland a 102-86 lead.The 21-year-old Mobley, who seems to improve every game, had a dominant sequence in the first half.Mobley snatched a pair of offensive rebounds to prolong Cleveland's possession before grabbing a third in the air and dunking over two Rockets defenders to put the Cavs ahead by 11.Mitchell made back-to-back 3-pointers and scored eight points in the final 1:48 to help the Cavs open a 60-43 halftime lead.PORTER'S RETURNRockets forward Kevin Porter Jr. returned to Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse for the first time since being traded by Cleveland in 2021.Porter spent a tumultuous 1 1/2 years with the Cavs, a stay that included an arrest for weapons possession and an argument with GM Koby Altman.“I’m happy for Kevin after everything he’s been through — and it’s a lot — since the day he left here,” Houston coach Stephen Silas said. “He has matured and grown. I’m proud of him for that.”TIP-INSRockets: With one of the league's youngest rosters, Houston is a work in progress. Silas sees the Cavs as a model for his squad. “That’s where we want to be, playing for the chance to make the playoffs or seeding late in the season,” he said.

Duchene immediately skated off the ice, removing his glove from the hand while doing so.The Predators did not provide an update on Duchene during the game.Nashville has been besieged with injuries recently. The Predators are already without the services of Filip Forsberg, Ryan Johansen, Roman Josi and Alexandre Carrier.500 FOR MARNERMarner played his 500th career NHL game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847515,Elias Pettersson's 2 goals lifts Canucks over Blackhawks 4-2,"CHICAGO (AP) — Elias Pettersson scored twice, Phillip Di Giuseppe scored, Brock Boeser got an empty-netter, and the Vancouver Canucks beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-2 on Sunday night.The Canucks won their third straight and sent the Blackhawks to their fifth straight defeat.The Blackhawks celebrated Pride night, honoring the city’s gay community, without rainbow-colored Pride warmup jerseys or colored stick tape used in previous seasons. The organization made the decision to go without the warmup jerseys because of an anti-gay Kremlin law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in December that could imperil Russian athletes when they return home.Defenseman Nikita Zaitsev was the only Russian-born Blackhawk in the lineup on Sunday. Injured center Philipp Kurashev holds dual Swiss-Russian citizenship.Pettersson scored his 34th and 35th goals of the season in the third period. His first, a deep-angle shot from the right side, broke the tie at 12:06. His second, on a power-play, came from the slot in the middle of a pileup 63 seconds later. Andrei Kuzmenko assisted on both goals.“Listen, I’m happy we won,” Vancouver coach Rick Tocchet said. “I just didn’t like our start. We came on at the end.”Chicago defenseman Connor Murphy opened the scoring, beating Canucks goalie Collin Delia with a 55-foot wrist shot with 3:59 left in the first period. It was the sixth goal of the season for Murphy who last scored on Jan. 23.“I think we just stuck with it regardless of the situation,” said Delia. “We kept on going. I think that’s just a testament to our group. That’s the type of habits we’re trying to build. Just the commitment we have to each other day in and day out, the little habits, the practice habits.“We’re kind of reaping the rewards of that right now.”Di Giuseppe tied it at 1 with 17 seconds left in the second period, his centering pass from the right slot caroming into the Chicago net off the left instep of Blackhawks defenseman Seth Jones. Goaltender Petr Mrazek could not react to the deflection.Rookie Lukas Reichel scored his fifth goal of the season to pull Chicago within 3-2 with 1:42 remaining, but an empty-net goal by Vancouver’s Boeser finished the scoring.Delia stopped 29 shots in picking up his ninth win. Mrazek made 27 saves in recording his 20th loss.Blackhawks defenseman Jarred Tinordi went to the locker room with an injury midway through the second period and did not return.“When you go five deep you’ve got to try to decide when to jump in the play and be aggressive,” Jones said of playing with an odd number of defensemen. “I thought we did a good job.”RICHARDSON, MURPHY BOOST PRIDE NIGHTBefore the game, Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said of Pride night, “I’m appreciative of being involved with it. I know the whole organization’s committed 365 days a year, not just today. That’s the biggest message we want to show the community – support.”Richardson and defenseman Murphy addressed gay fans on a scoreboard video during the first commercial break, Murphy concluding it by saying, “You are welcome here.”After the game, Murphy said players didn’t use rainbow-colored tape on their sticks because it wasn’t available, adding, “Sometimes they have it for us here and we use it. When it’s not, we don’t use it. That’s all I know.”UP NEXTCanucks: at St. Louis on Tuesday night.Blackhawks: host Dallas on Tuesday night. ___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847516,Anthony Volpe wins Yankees' opening day shortstop job,"Anthony Volpe is getting an opportunity to live a lifelong dream.The 21-year-old who grew up idolizing Hall of Famer Derek Jeter will be the New York Yankees' opening day shortstop after winning the job in spring training.Manager Aaron Boone, general manager Brian Cashman, hitting coach Dillon Lawson and bench coach Carlos Mendoza delivered the news after Sunday’s 6-2 Grapefruit League win over the Toronto Blue Jays.The Yankees open the regular season at home Thursday against the San Francisco Giants.Volpe, who lived in Manhattan as a child before moving to nearby New Jersey, shared the news with his parents and other family members at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida.“It was pretty emotional,” Volpe said. “It was just an unbelievable moment to share with them.”Rated one of baseball's best prospects, Volpe is hitting .314 with three homers, five RBIs and a .417 on-base percentage in 17 spring training games. He won the starting shortstop job over Oswald Peraza and holdover Isiah Kiner-Falefa despite having only 22 games of experience at Triple-A.Peraza was optioned to the minors Sunday. Kiner-Falefa was shifted into a utility role midway through camp.“While certainly the performance was there, he killed it between the lines,” Boone said of Volpe. “All the other things that we’ve been hearing about showed up. There’s an energy he plays the game with, and an instinct that he has that is evident. He really checked every box that we could have had for him.""BRAVES ROTATIONAtlanta right-hander Kyle Wright, the only 20-game winner in the majors in 2022, will start this season on the injured list. That creates the likelihood that rookie left-handers Jared Shuster and Dylan Dodd will both be part of Atlanta’s rotation early.Wright, who was 21-5 with a 3.19 ERA last season, has been limited to two starts this spring and the right-hander needs additional time to strengthen his sore pitching shoulder. He’s expected to return in mid-April.Shuster is Atlanta’s top prospect. He and Dodd have been competing for what the Braves had anticipated would be one opening in the rotation.The 24-year-old Shuster was the club’s first-round draft pick in 2020. He is expected to start the Braves’ third game at Washington on April 2.Dodd will be added to the roster and is expected to take the No. 5 spot in the rotation and start on April 4 at St. Louis.GOODBYE MIGGYDetroit’s Miguel Cabrera was presented a key to the city of Lakeland, Florida, before his final spring training game, which the Tigers won 11-10 over the Tampa Bay Rays. The two-time AL MVP and four-time batting champion has said he intends to retire after the 2023 season, his 16th with the Tigers and 21st overall. The 39-year-old slugger received a standing ovation before and after his final at-bat at Joker Marchant Stadium, flying out to left field to finish 0 for 3 with a strikeout.TOUGH CALLLeft-hander Josh Fleming won a competition to open the season in Tampa Bay’s rotation, beating out right-handers Yonny Chirinos and Luis Patino to fill in for injured right-hander Tyler Glasnow (oblique). Chirinos was optioned to Triple-A Durham on Sunday. Patino was sent to the minors earlier in the weekend.“It was a really tough decision,” manager Kevin Cash said. “Fleming, I think, is very deserving of it.”Meanwhile, Glasnow threw from 75 feet on flat ground, and right-handed reliever Kyle Click was released.Rays shortstop Wander Franco, scratched from the lineup Saturday due to right quadriceps soreness, was awaiting the results of an MRI.FAMILIA SIGNSThe Oakland A’s agreed to terms with right-hander Jeurys Familia on a $1.5 million, one-year contract. To clear a spot on the 40-man roster, the A’s placed left-hander Kirby Snead on the 60-day injured list with a strained left shoulder.Familia was a non-roster invite to Arizona Diamondbacks camp this spring and went 1-0 with a 1.35 ERA and .167 opponents' batting average in eight relief appearances before being released by the Diamondbacks on Friday. He pitched for Philadelphia and Boston last year, going a combined 2-3 with a 6.09 ERA in 48 outings.The 33-year-old righty is 34-28 with 125 saves and a 3.51 ERA in 574 games over 11 seasons with the Mets, A’s, Red Sox and Phillies.BRITO IMPRESSESYankees prospect Jhony Brito pitched 5 1/3 perfect innings against the Blue Jays, striking out three in a performance Boone said could land the 25-year-old the starting assignment in the third game of the regular season against the Giants.“That was great, right?” Boone said. “Jhony was another level of sharp today. In control.”Brito, who pitched in Double-A and Triple-A last season, entered camp not thinking he had a chance to make the opening day roster.“No, not at all. I mean, when you think about when we started camp, the rotation the Yankees had was a pretty good one, right? ... Unfortunately, injuries do happen. You feel really bad about that,” Brito said through a translator. “On the other hand, you understand that you have a job to do and you want to be able to pitch when the team is calling you.”Boone also said Sunday that relievers Jimmy Cordero and Albert Abreu have made the opening day roster.Meanwhile, the Yankees will take a cautious approach with Luis Severino as the right-hander tries to comeback from a right lat strain. A similar injury sidelined the two-time All-Star last season.“You know how the Yankees are, they always (take) precaution. Even if I want to rush it, they’re not going to let me do it,” Severino said. “Hopefully, this is it. If I miss even three or four starts, after that if I can be good for the rest of the season I’ll be blessed.”ROCKY RETURNKyle Freeland made his first start for the Colorado Rockies since returning from the World Baseball Classic, where he pitched three innings for Team USA in the championship-game loss to Japan.The left-hander allowed one run in the finale last Tuesday and struck out tournament MVP Shohei Ohtani. Freeland's 41 pitches were the most of any hurler who appeared in the title game.Freeland went 3 1/3 innings Sunday against the Cincinnati Reds. He gave up four runs and eight hits but was hurt by his defense.“Working through some traffic trying to get the ball on the ground was nice. No one is ever going to have clean innings every time. It built my pitch count up, which I needed to do because I’m a little behind,” Freeland said. “My aim was 70-75. I was right around that.”Freeland was 9-11 with a 4.53 ERA in 31 starts for Colorado last season. He was curious how the first outing back with the new pitch clock would go.“It was an easy transition,” Freeland said.He is scheduled to start the second game of the season in San Diego.___AP Sports Writer Charles Odum in Atlanta and AP freelancers Mark Didtler in Tampa, Florida, and Gary Schatz in Scottsdale, Arizona, contributed to this report.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World

But the six-game winning streak, the NBA's longest active streak, includes two victories away from home.Morant received a big cheer from the Atlanta sellout crowd during pregame introductions. He came off the bench in his first two games after serving an eight-game NBA suspension for posting a video in which he was shown waving a gun at a Denver-area strip club.Saddiq Bey's 3-point play for Atlanta cut the Grizzlies' lead to 98-87 before Bane responded by sinking a jumper. AJ Griffin's jumper again pulled the Hawks within one before Bane answered with another basket.Minutes later, Bane's 3-pointer gave Memphis a 110-103 advantage. The Hawks made one final push, cutting the Grizzlies' lead to 122-119 on De'Andre Hunter's 3-pointer. After a free throw by Tyus Jones extended the lead to four points, Atlanta called a timeout with 11.6 seconds remaining.Trae Young, who led Atlanta with 28 points, missed a short jumper before Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3 from the corner also was no good. Young added 10 assists one day after he was ejected for throwing the ball at an official during the Hawks' 143-130 win over Indiana on Saturday.Jaren Jackson Jr. continued to thrive as a shot blocker against Atlanta. Jackson set a career high with eight blocks in the Grizzlies' 128-103 home win over the Hawks on Dec. 12. He added five blocks on Sunday, all in the first half.Jackson was called for a foul on a block that knocked John Collins to the floor with six seconds remaining in the first half. Jackson and coach Taylor Jenkins were called for technical fouls for arguing the call against Jackson, and a review confirmed it was a clean block.TIP-INSGrizzlies: With Morant starting, Jones had 13 points in a backup role. Jackson scored 15.Hawks: Hunter started after missing one game with a bruised left knee. Bogdanovic, also slowed by a bruised left knee, returned to a backup role. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847522,"Netanyahu sacks defence minister, sparking mass protests","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday sacked Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, triggering mass protests, a day after Gallant broke ranks with the government and urged a halt to a highly contested plan to overhaul the judicial system.As news of the dismissal spread, tens of thousands of protesters, many waving blue and white Israeli flags, took to the streets late at night across the country. Crowds gathered outside Netanyahu's home in Jerusalem, at one point breaching a security cordon.Some three months since taking office, Netanyahu's nationalist-religious coalition has been plunged into crisis over the bitter divisions exposed by its flagship judicial overhaul plans.""State security cannot be a card in the political game. Netanyahu crossed a red line tonight,"" opposition leaders Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz said in a joint statement.They called on members of Netanyahu's Likud party not to have a hand in ""the crushing of national security.""In announcing Gallant's dismissal, Netanyahu's office did not name a replacement nor give any other details. ""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided this evening to dismiss Defence Minister Yoav Gallant,"" it said.Shortly afterward, Gallant, 64, wrote on Twitter: ""The state of Israel’s security has always been and will always be my life's mission.""POLICE USE WATER CANNONSNetanyahu made the decision to sack Gallant after the former navy admiral warned on Saturday that the overhaul plans risked ""a clear, immediate and tangible threat to the security of the state"" and called for them to be halted.""At this time, for the sake of our country, I am willing to take any risk and pay any price,"" Gallant said in his televised address.Netanyahu acted in response on Sunday night as he was poised to ratify a central part of the overhaul package, a bill that would tighten political control over judicial appointments, handing the executive wider freedom to name judges to the Supreme Court.Earlier this month, President Isaac Herzog, the head of state who is supposed to remain above politics, warned that the country faced ""disaster"" unless a broader consensus could be reached on how to overhaul the judiciary.But Netanyahu, on trial on corruption charges that he denies, has vowed to continue with a project he says is needed to rein in activist judges and restore the proper balance between an elected government and the judiciary.The United States said it was deeply concerned by Sunday's events and saw an urgent need for compromise, while repeating calls to safeguard democratic values.As protesters poured into the streets, police used water cannons to push them back from Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, while in Tel Aviv, where hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets since the beginning of the year, protesters lighted several bonfires on a main highway.The protests dwindled as the night went on, and eventually police forcefully removed a smaller crowd that refused to leave.It was not immediately clear whether the protests would affect the government's tactics. At least three Likud ministers said publicly that it was time to reevaluate their strategy and they would support halting the legislation if Netanyahu decided to do so. The head of the parliamentary committee deciding on the legislation said discussions would continue on Monday.The crisis came as Israel's security establishment has been bracing for potential violence in the coming weeks as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan overlaps with the Jewish Passover and the Christian Easter celebration.Over the past year, Israeli forces have been conducting nearly daily raids in the occupied West Bank, killing more than 250 Palestinian fighters and civilians, while more than 40 Israelis and foreigners have been killed by Palestinian attackers.DIPLOMAT RESIGNSGallant on Saturday became the most senior member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party to say he would not support the judicial overhaul, saying protests that have included growing numbers of military reservists were also affecting regular forces and undermining national security.In recent weeks senior Finance Ministry officials have warned of an economic backlash and business leaders have sounded the alarm for their companies' future.Adding to the pressure, the head of the Histadrut labour federation, the umbrella organisation for hundreds of thousands of public sector workers, said he was ""astonished"" by Gallant's removal and promised a ""dramatic"" announcement on Monday.Israel's consul-general in New York said he was resigning over the dismissal. Israel's research universities announced they would stop holding classes due to the legislative push, calling for its immediate freeze.Some of Netanyahu's hard-right coalition partners had called for Gallant to be sacked, but a number of other Likud lawmakers have backed his call for a halt to the reforms.The turmoil comes at a key moment in the passage of the legislation with a bill giving the executive more control over the appointment of judges expected to be brought for ratification this week in the Knesset, where Netanyahu and his allies control 64 out of 120 seats.But how - or even whether - that as yet-unscheduled vote will proceed has been thrown into question by the wave of protest sparked by Gallant's removal and the deepening splits within the coalition.(Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch, Ronen Zvulun and Dan Williams in Jerusalem, Rami Amichay in Tel Aviv; Writing by James Mackenzie, Editing by Andrew Heavens, Cynthia Osterman and Gerry Doyle)",2023/03/27,353,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847553,Taiwan will not enter 'meaningless contest of dollar diplomacy with China': Tsai,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) on Sunday (March 26) refused to ""engage in a meaningless contest of dollar diplomacy with China.""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press conference announcing that Taiwan was officially terminating diplomatic ties with Honduras after 82 years of relations between the two countries. The ministry declared that ""Taiwan remains unbowed & continues to work as a force for good in the world.""In the afternoon, Tsai issued an official statement via the Presidential Office website and her social media accounts announcing the severing of relations with Honduras. She expressed her conviction that Taiwan can foster the long-term development of its diplomatic allies through a ""forward-looking and pragmatic approach.""However, she said that Taiwan ""will not engage in a meaningless contest of dollar diplomacy with China."" Tsai pointed out that Beijing has employed a variety of methods to ""suppress Taiwan's international participation, intensify its military intimidation against Taiwan, and disrupt regional peace and stability.""Nevertheless, the president said that such tactics will not change the fact that Taiwan and China are not subordinate to each other. She said that Beijing cannot ""erode the Taiwanese people's staunch commitment to freedom and democracy or our determination to engage wholeheartedly with the world.""Tsai argued that Taiwan's citizens have demonstrated to the world that ""we do not give in to threats."" She vowed that Taiwan's ties and coordination with diplomatic allies and like-minded countries and efforts to forward international security will ""only expand and grow stronger.""She closed by saying Taiwan will continue to stand with its remaining diplomatic allies and like-minded global partners as we ""work toward a better future for all.""Also on Sunday, Taiwan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) revealed that Honduras had issued requests for financial aid for a hospital, a hydropower dam, and sovereign debt assistance that amounted to more than US$2.4 billion (NT$74.3 billion). Wu described the requests as unreasonable and possibly tied to talks with Beijing over a similar aid package.Honduran Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina on March 15 said that his country severed ties with Taiwan because it refused to double aid and restructure debt. He said Honduras had asked Taiwan to double its annual aid package of US$50 million (NT$1.53 billion) and to consider ""realigning"" its US$600 million (NT$18.38 billion) in debt to Taipei, but failed to receive a satisfactory reaction.In addition, Reina also said Honduras has needs that must be addressed in terms of energy, social policies, and refinancing of debt, which is ""drowning the country."" Regarding the debt, Reina pointed out that Honduras paid US$2.2 billion in 2022 and must expend an additional US$2.3 billion this year to service internal and external debt, which totals US$20 billion.The people of #Taiwan have proven to the world that we do not give in to threats. We will continue to stand with our diplomatic allies and like-minded global partners as we work toward a better future for all. pic.twitter.com/cryJMRlRp3",2023/03/27,1560,Politics

Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847566,"Arrow Electronics Supports LightSpeed to Build Compact, scalable, and Power-Efficient Opto-Electronic System-in-Packages (SiPs) for Delivering Superior Data Bandwidth Capability and Processing Performance.","SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 27 March 2023 - Global technology-solutions provider Arrow Electronics, Inc. today announces its support for LightSpeed Photonics Private Limited (LightSpeed), a Singapore-based start-up, to accelerate the development of optics embedded processors for speeding up data input/output processing, optimizing power consumption, and enabling multi-terabit data connectivity for a wide range of applications from data center, AI, video content streaming to augmented reality/virtual reality.        Arrow is teaming with LightSpeed to help accelerate the development of optics embedded processors for delivering superior data bandwidth capability and processing performance.      Due to digitalization, applications need to process growing volumes of data. Modern computing systems demand better data processing and transmission capabilities with higher speeds, higher energy-efficiency, and greater scalability at a lower cost of manufacturing and ownership. A diverse integration of electronics and photonics has emerged as a viable alternative. By using light to facilitate massive data movement between processors and components rather than traditional electrical cables, optical interconnects help address increasing challenges of power density, circuit miniaturization, and cost efficiency.   Co-founded in 2021 by Rohin Kumar Y, Ph.D., CEO, and Ramana V. Pamidighantam, CTO, LightSpeed specializes in building compact, modular package of opto-electronic processors and interconnects for data bandwidth intensive applications that require real-time processing. Their patent-pending technology provides free space multichannel optical bus connecting up to four processors simultaneously. Their photonic packaging uses standard semiconductor process. Offering a modular and scalable design, the ""optics-to-the chip"" modules can be field-configurable to support multiple applications.   ""Our mission is to bring a holistic solution to the problem by leveraging our combined decades of experience in R&D in photonics, semiconductors, IC packaging and Opto-Electronic component design. By integrating photonics with processors, we strive to make data processing work up to at least ten times faster than existing technology,"" said Rohin Kumar Y, CEO of LightSpeed. ""Arrow has been a valuable and trusted technology partner, guiding us through our journey, from design optimization to proof of concept, testing, and production-ready supply chain services. We appreciate Arrow's global technology ecosystem which enables us to tap into their market expertise and industry trends of the electronics world.""   Intel, one of Arrow's long-standing technology suppliers, is among LightSpeed's roster of mentors. Taking part in Intel's startup program, LightSpeed has received mentoring and technical support to their FPGA computing architecture.   ""We believe LightSpeed is working on a solution that will be essential for computing in the near future. We share the comprehensive details and application information of FPGA, field programmable gate arrays. It helps form the foundation for solution framework,"" said Arvindh Rajasekharan, Intel's startup program mentor. ""We also provide our technical mentoring and feedback, which is crucial in the early stages of the system architecture"".   To support local start-ups community in their idea-to-prototype-to-manufacturing journey, Arrow has established the NTU-Arrow Invent Lab in collaboration with the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore since April 2022. NTU-Arrow Invent Lab acts as an innovation and experimental platform where technology start-ups develop ideas, unleash creativity, and bring their inventions to life as they tap into Arrow's global resources. LightSpeed has used the NTU-Arrow Invent Lab's equipment to test and consult and collaborate with Arrow. Arrow engineers and technical experts have provided recommendations and advice to help LightSpeed make the solution happen, including:      Electronic-Photonic Integration: Proposing suitable components to meet customer requirements to enable high data rate optics instead of copper in the 3D package to enhance performance for the high critical operational needs of data centers together with I/O system design, and interposer fabrication.       Matching the Right Expert: Introducing suitable design partners to support customers with their design requirements and support throughout the whole journey – fabrication, assembly, validation and packaging.         Accelerating Time-to-market: Providing the NTU-Arrow Invent Lab environment and equipment required for testing with instruments - power supplies, oscilloscope, signal, and spectrum analyzer to streamline the turnaround time and processes during the prototype stage      ""At Arrow, we are constantly seeking ways to help innovators bring their forward-thinking technologies and solutions to the market faster and in a much more cost-effective manner,"" said Natarajan MM, Arrow Electronics' vice president of South Asia. ""We are excited to extend our global technology supplier ecosystem, best-in-class design tools and resources, and engineering expertise to LightSpeed as they commercialize their next generation opto-electronic embedded products offerings, aiming at delivering high bandwidth and high-performance benefits at a lower carbon footprint for data-intensive applications.""

(AP) — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the depleted Portland Trail Blazers 118-112 on Sunday.Jalen Williams had 23 points and Isaiah Joe added 20 off the bench for Oklahoma City. It was a crucial win for the Thunder in the Western Conference play-in race. They improved to 37-38 and moved into a tie for ninth place with the Los Angeles Lakers.Shaedon Sharpe led the Trail Blazers with a career-high 29 points, and Nassir Little scored a season-best 28 off the bench. The loss was Portland’s eighth in 10 games, dropping the team to 32-42 this season. The Blazers are four games back of 10th place in the West and the final spot in the play-in tournament.“It wasn’t a pretty game,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “It wasn’t our best game by any stretch. But given the circumstances, it required a level of resilience and toughness out of our team to win the game and I thought we had that.”Portland was playing without four of its five regular starters as guards Damian Lillard (right calf) and Anfernee Simons (right foot), forward Jerami Grant (left calf) and center Jusuf Nurkic (right knee) all sat out.“I thought we played very well,” Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. “Defensively and offensively, we were in tune. We got the ball moving around.”The Blazers started off hot and built a 37-25 lead at the end of the first quarter, but squandered it with a 7-for-21 shooting performance in the second, allowing Oklahoma City to take a 68-62 lead into halftime.The second half began in much the same way: Portland retook the lead with an 11-0 run powered by Sharpe and Little. That led to a back-and-forth third quarter before Oklahoma City pulled away midway through the fourth.“I thought we gutted it out,” Daigneault said. “We did what we needed to do, especially down the stretch. Strung some plays together late. I thought our physicality the last four or five minutes of the game was really, really good.”TIP-INSThunder: Lindy Waters III was a late scratch due to a plantar fasciitis injury that flared up during pregame warmups.Trail Blazers: Despite recent reports that Portland is shutting down its regular starters for the season, Billups said Lillard, Grant, Simons and Nurkic are day-to-day. “We’re just being cautious,” the coach said. … F Trendon Watford sustained a right ankle injury in the first quarter and returned, but was later ruled out for the rest of the game.UP NEXTThunder: Return home to host the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday.Trail Blazers: Continue a five-game homestand Monday against the New Orleans Pelicans.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847575,Boutier beats Hall in playoff to claim 3rd LPGA victory,"GOLD CANYON, Ariz. (AP) — Celine Boutier of France beat Georgia Hall of England with a birdie on the first playoff hole Sunday to win the LPGA Drive on Championship.Boutier forced a playoff by making a testy birdie putt at the par-5 18th to close out a 4-under 68, matching Hall (65) at 20-under 268 in the LPGA's first full-field event of the season.Playing the 18th hole again, neither golfer found the green with their second shot of the playoff. Boutier, chipping from nearly the same spot as she did in regulation short and right of the green, pitched to about 4 feet. Meanwhile, Hall hit her second shot into a greenside bunker, blasted beyond the hole and failed to convert her birdie effort. That set the stage for Boutier's winning birdie putt.Boutier had mixed feelings about squaring off in a playoff against — and beating — Hall, a former Solheim Cup teammate.“I was honestly not looking forward to it,” Boutier said. “It’s a bittersweet feeling because you obviously want to win, but at the same time I really think she’s an amazing player. ... She is a really good friend of mine. So I feel like it’s not always easy, but also I’m a little bit competitive, so I feel like I definitely want to win as well. But it’s not the greatest feeling.”With the victory, the 29-year-old Boutier claimed her third LPGA victory and became the winningest French player on tour, moving past Patricia Meunier-Lebouc and Anne-Marie Palli. She had previously won the 2019 ISPS Handa Vic Open and 2021 ShopRite Classic.Boutier posted two early birdies at Nos. 2-3 and gave a stroke back with bogey at the sixth. On the back nine, she made a move with birdies at 11 and 13, and none more important than the clutch birdie putt at the 18th, her 72nd hole.“I was a little bit nervous, but not as much as I expected or I thought I was going to be,” she said. “I feel like I was just really focused. I had a really tough chip from the right with a break from right to left, so I was just trying to get as close as I could. Then the 5- or 6-footer was definitely a little bit of pressure.”After three birdie-filled rounds at Superstition Mountain Golf Club, the final round started with 17 players within three shots of the lead and stayed to form.Hall made the most of her fourth round, posting one of three 7-under par scores, including going 6 under on the back nine to take a clubhouse lead, finishing about an hour ahead of Boutier.Hall, who was looking for her first win since the 2020 Cambia Portland Classic, which followed a victory at the Women’s British Open in 2018, tried to find some consolation in her near-miss.“Obviously fantastic to get to the position I was in,” the 26-year-old major winner said. “I knew I had to shoot low today, and obviously gutted about the playoff.”Japan’s Ayaka Furue closed with a 65 and finished third at 19 under. Na Rin An of South Korea was alone in fourth at 18 under with a closing 67, while American Ally Ewing (67) and South Korea's Jin Young Ko (68) were another stroke back in fifth.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/27,,World

He came off the bench in his first two games after serving an eight-game NBA suspension for posting a video in which he was shown waving a gun at a Denver-area strip club.Trae Young led the Hawks with 28 points and 10 assists, one day after he was ejected for throwing the ball at an official during a 143-130 win over Indiana.CELTICS 137, SPURS 93BOSTON (AP) — Jaylen Brown scored 41 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to lead Boston over San Antonio.The Celtics were without star forward and leading scorer Jayson Tatum, who was sidelined with a bruised left hip.

Poole had a game-high 27 points.The Warriors had a chance with 9.9 seconds left but Stephen Curry couldn’t corral Poole’s errant pass, then Curry missed a contested 3 from the baseline just before the final buzzer.Towns had 14 points and five rebounds in his second outing following a 52-game absence with a strained right calf.The Warriors had their nine-game home winning streak snapped and missed a chance to boost their playoff positioning. A victory also would have clinched Sacramento’s first postseason berth since 2006.

Users of the product can input their desired message in Mandarin and the program will output a response that matches their native English speaking recipients' tone and style.In addition to taking away the competition’s US$15,000 (NT$455,257) top prize, organizer LabLab said the team will participate in the invitation only startup accelerator program for early-stage AI projects.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847583,Taiwan environmentalists suspicious over wetland fire,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taitung’s Zhiben Wetlands caught fire late Sunday afternoon (March 26), burning into the night, fueled by strong winds, spreading over an area of five hectares per UDN.The fire drew the suspicion of environmentalists who completed a survey of endangered bird species in the wetland earlier in the day. They called upon the Taitung Fire Department to fully investigate whether the fire was an act of arson.The Society of Wilderness (SOW) and the Wild Bird Society of Taitung County conducted a wild bird field study on Sunday morning, counting the number of endangered bird species such as ring-necked pheasants, orioles, and Taiwan thrush. Many of these birds nest in the shrubs on the north bank of the Zhiben River mouth.SOW Taitung branch member Su Yating (蘇雅婷) said ring-necked pheasants are classified as a ""critically endangered"" bird species by the Council of Agriculture. The survey found 196 such pheasants in the Zhiben Wetland, a record high.Conservationists track endangered ring-necked pheasants in local wetland. (CNA photo)After announcing the results of the survey, environmentalists were surprised that a fire broke out in the wetland at 5 p.m. Su said the ring-necked pheasant is only abundant in the Hualien-Taitung area, and it is a species under threat that needs conservation.The fire coincided with the breeding season for birds, exacerbating the ecological damage. The dry climate also led the fire to spread quickly.Su said the timing of the fire right after the announcement of the ecological survey is too much of a coincidence. Wild Bird Society Taitung County Director-General Han Lijun (韓立郡) also said the fire was too coincidental, and will cause ecological impacts that are difficult to assess.The Taitung County Fire Department said the fire in the Zhiben Wetland was completely extinguished at 1:00 a.m. on Monday (March 27). The initial estimate of the area burned was about five hectares with the cause of the fire still needing to be investigated.",2023/03/27,819,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847585,Animal welfare and food transition forum to kick off in Taipei Wednesday,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The 2023 Animal Welfare and Food Transition Forum is scheduled to be held in Taipei on Wednesday (29 March).The annual forum is a valuable opportunity to understand the link between ESG and animal welfare, especially topical given the reports of egg shortages in Taiwan and the need for international imports.The lead organizers of this year’s forum are Carrefour Culture and Education Foundation, Environmental & Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST), and the Jane Goodall Institute Taiwan. Supporting partners include the European Chamber of Commerce Taiwan Low Carbon Initiative, the Taiwan National University of the Arts, Howsfood, The Advocate, The Match Kitchen Lab, Matcha Prince, Talent Field, and the Taiwan Experience Map.The forum particularly welcomes personnel from food retail, hospitality, and food manufacturing companies, the agricultural sector, policymakers, academics, the media, and other interested parties.The forum runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on March 29 and will be held at the Multifunctional Hall, Taipei New Horizon Building (6th floor, No. 88 Yanchang Road, Xinyi District, Taipei). Attendance is free of charge and attendees can register at https://reurl.cc/qkO7jR.The forum will be held in Mandarin. Interested parties can also contact the International Liaison, Jonathon Tree, at jonathon@east.org.tw.In 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly passed a resolution acknowledging the role of animal welfare in addressing environmental challenges, promoting the “One Health” approach, and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.In the EU, animals are recognized as sentient beings in the EU's foundational treaties. The EU has announced plans to phase out all cage farming by 2027 as part of its Farm to Fork strategy to create a sustainable food system, with Commissioner for Agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski, declaring “A sustainable food system cannot exist without high animal welfare standards.”In 2021, the EU added animal welfare to its Code of Conduct for responsible food businesses and its sustainability reporting requirements which apply to more than 49,000 European businesses. The EU has also begun requiring exporters to match EU standards to qualify for favored tax treatment as part of EU trade negotiations. To date, agreements have been reached with the Mercosur countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, in addition to Mexico and New Zealand.The International Standards Organisation (ISO) published technical specifications for the management of animal welfare (ISO/TS 34700:2016), providing a roadmap for food industry actors to implement animal welfare standards throughout their supply chain.Globally, more than 2000 food companies have pledged to eradicate cage eggs from their supply chains, with tracking by the Open Wing Alliance showing 88% of companies are currently fulfilling their cage-free commitments.The 2021 Business Benchmark for Farm Animal Welfare, arguably the most authoritative guide to corporate performance, found that 89% of 150 multinational companies in the rankings now acknowledge farm animal welfare as a business issue. The benchmark shows 81% of companies have published policies on close confinement, 65% on prophylactic use of antibiotics, and 59% on pre-slaughter stunning.In Taiwan, large companies are required to conduct annual sustainability reporting under rules set by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC). Since 2019, companies have been obliged to submit reports in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. The GRI standards for the agriculture, aquaculture, and fishing sectors seek disclosure of animal welfare policies relating to housing, transport, and slaughter. The GRI is currently devising similar sector standards for food businesses.In Taiwan, positive examples of corporate leaders come from Carrefour, the first major retailer in Asia, which has committed to phasing out sales of eggs from hens confined in cages by 2025, and Taiwan's largest pork producer, TaiSugar, which has committed to ending its use of sow stalls.",2023/03/27,344,Environment
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847586,Newly opened Czech Hub to strengthen Taiwan-Czech economic relations,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The European Values Center for Security Policy and the Czech-Taiwanese Business Chamber on Monday (March 27) unveiled the Czech Hub, which is expected to facilitate stronger economic ties between Taiwan and the Czech Republic.
“The mission of this project is to build a platform inviting new Czech and Taiwanese partners in various sectors and become the bridge between the Czech Republic and Taiwan,” Speaker of the Czech Chamber of Deputies Marketa Pekarova Adamova said at the opening ceremony Monday morning. Adamova said she hopes the opening of this office will encourage other nations “to create similar hubs in Taipei to develop their relationship with Taiwan.”
In addition to business affairs, the hub will also serve as a space to “assist in building the Czech community in Taiwan,” the speaker said. Government support from Taiwan and the Czech Republic was instrumental in establishing this office, she added.
Adamova told Taiwan News that her trip is intended to strengthen bilateral ties. Though they are already solid, “good friends should work on their relationship,” she said.










“There is great space” for bilateral cooperation between Taiwan and Czech companies, especially in the AI and semiconductor industries, she said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Roy Chun Lee (李淳) said the hub demonstrates the Czech Republic is not in Taiwan “just for fun.”
“They’re here to stay. We’re talking about long-term partnership. Not only in the business community but also between think tanks, great minds, and the exchange of ideas,” Lee said.
The deputy director said companies have now realized there are “hidden agendas” when doing business in China. He acknowledged that by moving to Taiwan, the economic value may be smaller but “you have a much higher level of peace of mind. You have a much higher level of confidence in doing business.”
Lee pointed out that interest in expanding business goes both ways. “Almost all major Taiwan ICT companies have already established some sort of operation in the Czech Republic in the last five years,” he said. The Czech Republic is one of the most competitive and attractive destinations in Europe, he said.
The Czech Hub is located in the Gengxi Building (耕曦大廈) at No. 18, Lane 26, Pucheng Street, Da’an District, Taipei City.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 15, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles.

Some ballistic missiles can also be equipped with a nuclear warhead.North Korea has launched more than 20 ballistic and cruise missiles across 11 launch events this year, as it tries to force the US to accept its nuclear status and seeks to negotiate sanctions relief.North Korea has also increased its military testing intensity in the past couple weeks amid military drills by the US and South Korea from March 13-23.North Korea claims the drills are a rehearsal for invasion, which Seoul and Washington reject.Pyongyang also said that dictator Kim Jong Un had attended some of the week's tests.Besides the string of missile tests, North Korean propaganda was keen to tout what it said was a successful test run of an underwater, nuclear-capable exploding drone. It said it could be used to create localized tsunamis in attacks on ships or ports.Observers met the specific technical claims published by state news agency KCNA on Friday with skepticism, however.msh/jsi (AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/27,,

However, as Lin was preparing to receive her bronze medal, officials at the last minute stripped her of the medal and awarded it to Bulgaria's Staneva Svetlana Kamenova, who had lost to Lin in the quarter-finals.Officials did not provide an explanation to Lin or her coach John Tseng (曾自強) at the time why she had been disqualified. Later that day, the Chinese Taipei Boxing Association announced that Lin's pre-match gender test taken on March 16 had come back with an abnormality and that the report would be sent to the association, which can appeal the decision through official channels, reported UDN.Lin is a highly decorated athlete, having won gold medals at the 2018 AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi in the bantamweight category and at the 2022 IBA Women's World Boxing Championships in Istanbul in the featherweight class. She also took gold at the 2017 Asian Women's Amateur Boxing Championships in Ho Chi Minh City and the 2019 Asian Amateur Boxing Championships in Bangkok and has never failed a gender test in the past.Secretary-General of the Chinese Taipei Boxing Association, Peng Chun-ming (彭俊銘) was cited by CNA as saying that the organization was sorry to hear the news and will appeal the decision. Peng said coaches and athletes are frustrated by the announcement and are still dealing with the disappointment.Peng said the association will wait for the team to return to Taiwan next week and the official report from IBA to confirm the detailed reasons for the disqualification before issuing a response and taking action.Regarding the incident, Mirror Media said because female competitors such as Lin have to carry out weight control and adjust their menstrual cycles to match the competition schedule, they may take certain medications that impact their hormonal levels, possibly leading to the abnormality with Lin's gender test results in this case.",2023/03/27,7253,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847637,"Reese, LSU women push past Miami 54-42 to reach Final Four","GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — So much for Kim Mulkey's timelines and cautioning against expecting too much, too soon at LSU.Two years in, and Mulkey's return to lead her home-state program already includes another Final Four trip — and dreams of more.Angel Reese had 18 rebounds and LSU returned to the women's Final Four for the first time in 15 years by beating Miami 54-42 on Sunday night, carrying a rapid rise under Mulkey straight to the sport's biggest stage.Alexis Morris scored 21 points and Reese added 13 for the third-seeded Tigers (32-2), who asserted control of a grinding, defense-first game. LSU's length caused Miami problems even with Reese — an Associated Press first-team All-American — having a brutal shooting day, and the Tigers offset their offensive hiccups by dominating the glass.Not bad for a group that began with nine new players, with Morris as the lone returning starter.“Coach Mulkey, she's had a plan for us, since Day One,” Morris said, pausing from munching on chicken wings in the locker room. ""This year, she had 12 players who just bought in, bought into the system. What you're witnessing right now is the result of a team commitment.“We all made a commitment and we all just want one thing, and that's just to win.”The reward came at the horn, with Mulkey turning to her bench and leaning forward to put her hands on her knees as though in disbelief. Players ran to midcourt to celebrate, except for Morris running straight to the scorer’s table and jumping on top of it in a moment she said she had long dreamed of.As players posed for cellphone photos with the regional-title trophy, the 60-year-old Mulkey looked eager to take it all in after players dumped a cooler of confetti on her. She danced briefly with Reese. She watched her grandchildren roll around in the confetti laying at midcourt. She took a moment to acknowledge LSU fans in the stands by gazing their way while patting her heart.Mulkey arrived at LSU with a resume headlined by three NCAA titles from her time at Baylor along with some flamboyant sideline looks such as her silver-shimmering jacket with white pants for this one. She had cautioned that the Tigers were overachieving when they’re still strengthening a program for the long haul.Maybe so, but they’re ahead of schedule after pushing their way through the NCAA Tournament’s Greenville 2 Region. The Tigers head to Dallas to face Ohio State or Virginia Tech in Friday’s national semifinals.“What really makes me smile is not cutting that net down,"" Mulkey said. ""It’s looking around out there at all those LSU people, looking at that team I get to coach experience it for the first time.""Reese, a Maryland transfer who has led Mulkey’s team all year with her physical play, was named the region’s most outstanding player despite missing her first nine shots and going 3 for 15 for the game.LSU shot 30.2% and went 1 for 12 from 3-point range, including misses on its first nine attempts. But Miami was even worse from 3, missing all 15 tries.The third-seeded Tigers finished with a 49-35 rebounding edge behind Reese, which led to a 15-3 edge in second-chance points — all desperately needed on a day with offensive rebounds readily available. They also made 15 of 26 free throws while Miami got to the line just nine times.Jasmyne Roberts scored 22 points for ninth-seeded Miami (22-13), which had taken a wild ride here. The Hurricanes rallied from a huge deficit to beat Oklahoma State in the first round, stunned No. 1 seed Indiana on the road, then beat Villanova in Friday's Sweet 16 despite blowing a 21-point lead.The last win set off an emotional on-court celebration for Katie Meier's bunch, which had played with toughness and athleticism to get to its first Elite Eight. The Hurricanes were trying to match the record for lowest-seeded team ever to reach a Final Four, set by Arkansas in 1998.But the Hurricanes struggled the entire way offensively, even as their defense kept them hanging around and leaving open opportunities.Outside of Roberts — coming off a career-best 26 points against Villanova — seemingly no Hurricanes player could make a shot.“I know we were exhausted because we were pouring our heart and soul into the defensive end and the rebounding effort,” Meier said, adding: “And that’s all the credit to LSU for being so hard to guard inside and for taking our legs out so much.”The Hurricanes shot 31.6% and plenty of their missed 3-pointers came off clean looks. Destiny Harden, who hit the shot to beat Indiana, scored three points on 0-for-9 shooting with seven missed 3s.It was a disappointing conclusion to an incredible run for Miami, and the school fell short of making history twice in one day.The men's and women's teams were each playing Sunday to reach the programs' first Final Four. The men pulled it off, beating Texas in Kansas City, Missouri. That game went final during the first quarter of the women's game — drawing cheers when the final play was shown on the arena scoreboards.Miami battled but couldn't complete the double.“I mean, it hurts because we competed, we gave it our all,” Harden said. “We took the program somewhere it’s never been.""___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World

(AP) — The NFL's veteran wide receiver market is a little thinner after Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton declared neither Jerry Jeudy nor Courtland Sutton are on the trade block.Payton made the comments while speaking to the NFL Network on Sunday, the first day of the league's spring owners meetings in Arizona.“We're not trading those two players,” Payton said, acknowledging the Broncos have received inquiries about the availability of the wide receivers who combined for 1,801 yards receiving and eight TD receptions in 2022.“We've received calls, you bet. Those are two good football players,” Payton said. “But we're in the business of gathering talent right now. Why do people call? Because they know we're void of draft picks and that we might, because there was some discussions a year ago, I think, regarding Courtland. But we like the current group that we're working with.”The Broncos have just five picks in the NFL draft next month and they own no selections until the third round after parting with premium picks to acquire quarterback Russell Wilson from Seattle last year and Payton from the Saints this winter.Wilson cost them first- and second-round picks last year and this year and they had to send a first-rounder they acquired from Miami in the Bradley Chubb trade to New Orleans in order to hire Payton.Jeudy has never lived up to his status as a 2020 first-round pick, mostly because of injuries, although he came on strong at the end of last season, posting big numbers after he was moved to the flanker position.Sutton, a second-round selection in 2019, hasn't been the same since tearing an ACL in 2020. He has caught just two touchdown passes in each of the last two seasons.Also, the Broncos' depth at the position took a hit last week when speedster K.J. Hamler, another receiver whose career has been marked by injuries, tore a chest muscle while working out. He's expected to be out up to six months.Tim Patrick, the Broncos' most productive receiver, is returning from a torn ACL that cost him all of the 2022 season.Following Hamler's latest injury, the Broncos signed free agent wide receiver Marquez Callaway, a fourth-year pro who played for Payton in New Orleans.It was also revealed last week that Wilson underwent arthroscopic knee surgery after the season, but is on track to participate in the team's offseason program next month.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847639,"Towns makes 2 late 3-pointers, lifts TWolves over Warriors","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Minnesota Timberwolves coach Chris Finch has plenty of confidence in his new-look team’s ability to defend at every position, all over the court, even with the ball in Stephen Curry’s hands and the game on the line.Karl-Anthony Towns hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 11 seconds to play after Kyle Anderson stole a pass by Draymond Green, and the Timberwolves held off the Golden State Warriors 99-96 on Sunday night.“Defensively I thought we were really, really good,” Finch said. “When you play these guys it puts a lot of onus on your smalls to keep chasing, keep fighting and keep contesting.”Jordan Poole gave Golden State the lead on a 3-pointer with 1:28 left, moments after Towns had connected from deep. Poole, who had a game-high 27 points, then secured a rebound on the other end.The Warriors had a chance with 9.9 seconds left but Curry couldn't corral Poole's errant pass, then Curry missed a contested 3 from the baseline just before the final buzzer.Towns had 14 points, five rebounds and a pair of steals in his second outing following a 52-game absence with a strained right calf. He returned Wednesday against Atlanta.Green fouled Rudy Gobert with 27.7 seconds left to save a likely dunk, and Gobert missed the first of his two free throws. Green went down hard taking a charge from the 7-foot-1 Gobert earlier in the quarter.Warriors coach Steve Kerr credited Green for continuing to put his body on the line and keep Golden State in the game.“He took some hits. He got hit in the face three different times,” Kerr said.The Warriors had their nine-game home winning streak snapped and missed a chance to boost their playoff positioning. A victory also would have clinched Sacramento's first postseason berth since 2006. The Kings, coached by former Golden State top assistant Mike Brown, will try to end the longest playoff drought in NBA history Monday night at home against Minnesota.Naz Reid hit a baseline 3-pointer with 6:12 remaining, followed by a layup. He scored 23 points off the bench to lead Minnesota, which snapped a 12-game skid on the Warriors' home floor. Anderson contributed 12 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.“I thought a couple possessions in those last two minutes just hurt us and they hit the big shot,” Kerr said.Curry tied it at 61 with 5:35 left in the third, only for Minnesota to make a great play moments later: Nickeil Alexander-Walker lunged for a diving save across the half-court line to save a backcourt violation and flicked the ball to Anderson for a 40-foot 3 to beat the shot clock at the 5:07 mark.Poole's 3 just before the third-quarter buzzer got Golden State within 77-73 going into the fourth.Gobert grabbed 18 rebounds to go with 10 points for the Timberwolves in their third straight victory following a three-game losing streak.“Turnovers here and there and they piled up,” Golden State guard Gary Payton II said after making his Warriors season debut. “Down the stretch we had it right there.”PAYTON'S BACKPayton made a big 3 midway through the fourth and then took a charge on the other end. He played 15 1/2 minutes in his first game since the Warriors reacquired him at the trade deadline from Portland after he helped Golden State to a championship last season as a top defender. Payton had been nursing a right adductor injury in his leg stemming from offseason core muscle surgery.He received a rousing standing ovation when checking in for the first time with 26.1 seconds left in the first. Did it top his expectations?“I didn’t have any. I already knew it was love,” he said. “It was a nice welcome home.”The Warriors spoke to the NBA about determining whether the Trail Blazers withheld medical information about Payton, whose physical for Golden State brought up concerns.TIP-INSTimberwolves: Minnesota outrebounded the Warriors 26-18 in the first half, 12 by Gobert, and 49-37 overall. ... A replay review overturned Taurean Prince's common foul to a Flagrant 1 with 30.4 seconds left in the first, and then he picked up his third personal just four seconds later. ... Mike Conley hit four of his first five 3s to score all 12 of his points in the first quarter. ... Minnesota hadn’t won on the Warriors’ home floor since a 124-117 overtime victory in April 2016, and this was just its second win in the Bay Area in the last 17 meetings.Warriors: Klay Thompson's five 3-pointers gave him 273, moving him closer to his career high in 3s for a season of 276 set in 2015-16. ... The Warriors tied the season series 2-all. ... Golden State missed matching its season-best home unbeaten run of 10 in a row at Chase Center from Oct. 23 to Dec. 3.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847640,Caitlin Clark leads Iowa to first Final Four since 1993,"SEATTLE (AP) — Caitlin Clark put on quite a show, having one of the greatest performances in NCAA Tournament history to help Iowa end a 30-year Final Four drought.She had 41 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds to lead the No. 2 seed Hawkeyes to a 97-83 win over fifth-seeded Louisville on Sunday night and send the team to its first women's Final Four in since 1993.“I dreamed of this moment as a little girl, to take a team to the Final Four and be in these moments and have confetti fall down on me,” said Clark, who is a Iowa native.The unanimous first-team All-American was as dominant as she's been all season in getting the Hawkeyes to Dallas for the women's NCAA Tournament national semifinals on Friday night. The Seattle 4 Region champion will face the winner of the Greenville 1 region that has South Carolina playing Maryland on Monday night.“I thought our team played really well. That’s what it’s all about. I was going to give it every single thing I had,” said Clark, who was the region's most outstanding player. “When I came here I said I wanted to take this program to the Final Four, and all you’ve got to do is dream. And all you’ve got to do is believe and work your butt off to get there. That’s what I did, and that’s what our girls did and that’s what our coaches did and we’re going to Dallas, baby.”Iowa (30-6) hadn't been to the Final Four since Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer led the team to its lone appearance in 1993. Before Sunday, the team had only been to one other Elite Eight — in 2019 — since the Final Four team.Clark had the 11th triple-double of her career and the 19th in NCAA Tournament history. She had the first 30- and 40-point triple-double in March Madness history.“It's like a storybook, been like that all year long,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “We keep talking about destiny and how it's supposed to happen. ... She's spectacular. I don't know how else to describe what she does on the basketball court. A 40-point triple-double against Louisville to go to the Final Four. Are you kidding me? That's mind-boggling.”Trailing by five at the half, Louisville cut its deficit to 48-47 before Clark and the Hawkeyes scored the next 11 points as part of a 17-6 run to blow the game open. That brought most of the pro-Iowa crowd of nearly 12,000 fans to their feet.Louisville was down 22 with just under 6 minutes left before going on a 13-1 run to get within 86-76 with 2:10 left. The Cardinals could get no closer.Clark left the game with 22.7 seconds left to a loud ovation from the crowd as she hugged her coach. After the game, Clark paraded around the court holding the regional trophy high above her head, delighting the thousands of fans who stuck around to celebrate their Hawkeyes.Hailey Van Lith scored 27 points and Olivia Cochran had 20 points and 14 rebounds to lead Louisville (26-12).Clark hit eight of the Hawkeyes’ season-high 16 3-pointers, including a few from just past the March Madness logo. It was a school record for the Hawkeyes in the NCAA Tournament, blowing past the previous mark of 13 against Gonzaga in 2011.Louisville scored the first eight points of the game, forcing Iowa to call timeout. Then Clark got going. The 6-foot junior scored the first seven points for the Hawkeyes and finished the opening quarter with 15 points. When she wasn’t scoring, she found open teammates with precision passes.She also had four assists in the first 10 minutes, accounting for every one of Iowa’s points as the Hawkeyes led 25-21.Clark continued her mastery in the second quarter, hitting shots from all over the court, including a few of her famous long-distance 3s from near the logo.Louisville was able to stay in the game, thanks to Van Lith. After scoring the first six points of the game, she went quiet before getting going late in the second quarter. She had 11 points in the second quarter as the Cardinals found themselves down 48-43 at the break.Clark had 22 points and eight assists in the opening 20 minutes enroute to the fourth-highest scoring total all-time in a NCAA regional.“She played great, she made some big shots,” Louisville coach Jeff Walz said of Clark. “She passed the ball well. we turned her over at times.”1,000-POINT CLUBClark has 984 points this season and is looking to join former Hawkeye Megan Gustafson with 1,000 points in a single year. Four other players have done it, including Villanova’s Maddy Siegrist, who accomplished the feat this season. Kelsey Plum, Jackie Stiles and Odyssey Sims were the others to do it.HOMETOWN HEROVan Lith once again played well in her home state. The small-town standout from 130 miles away from Seattle grew into being one of the best prep players in the country, the all-time state high school leader in scoring and now a star for the Cardinals.Hundreds of fans from her hometown of Cashmere, which has a population of 3,200, took in the game, cheering the Louisville star on.EMOTIONAL DAYIt was a bittersweet day for Iowa assistant coach Jan Jensen. Her dad Dale died in the morning after battling pancreatic cancer for a year. He was 86.“He didn’t sound so good the last couple days and I was kind of fretting, ‘When am I going to go if we go to Dallas?’"" she said. “I just feel like he knew. He was never a high maintenance guy, he was never a guy who made it complicated with me in anything. So I think, he told my people at home, I’m not ready to go until Jan’s team is done.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847642,"Black, Hispanic investors struggle with faith in crypto","NEW YORK (AP) — A software developer twice invested his savings in cryptocurrencies, only to lose it all. But he still promotes it to the Black community and would like to get back in himself.A recent college graduate and a single mom are dabbling hopefully in bitcoin after attending a crypto workshop sponsored by rapper Jay-Z at the public housing complex where the hip-hop star grew up.But a former executive at a cryptocurrency exchange feels disillusioned by the false promise of crypto helping her family in Ethiopia’s war-torn Tigray region.All were drawn by the idea of crypto as a pathway to wealth-building outside of traditional financial systems with a long history of racial discrimination and indifference to the needs of low-income communities. But crypto's meltdown over the past year has dealt a blow to that narrative, fueling a debate between those who continue to believe in its future and skeptics who say misleading advertising and celebrity-fueled hype have drawn vulnerable people to a risky and unproven asset class.The collapse of two crypto-friendly banks this month, Silvergate Capital Corp. and Signature Bank, complicates the picture. Their failure was a setback for crypto companies that relied on the banks to convert digital currencies to U.S. dollars. Yet the crisis bolstered Bitcoin, the oldest and most popular digital currency, by reinforcing a distrust in the banking system that helped give rise to cryptocurrencies in the first place.Mariela Regalado, 33, and Jimmy Bario, 22, neighbors at the Marcy Houses complex in Brooklyn, started putting $20 or $30 into bitcoin every two weeks or so after attending “Bitcoin Academy,” a workshop sponsored last summer by Jay-Z and Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Block Inc., the parent company of mobile payment system Cash App.“I don’t see it as something that’s going to, you know, take me out of Brooklyn and buy me a $2 million mansion in Texas,” said Regalado, an educational consultant and mother of a toddler. “But if it happens, I’m all for it.”Only a small minority of the U.S. population owns cryptocurrency, but adoption increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as low interest rates made borrowing money and investing in risky assets more attractive. Prices peaked in 2021, and a constellation of apps, exchanges and even ATM-like crypto machines made buying digital coins easy.But the drawbacks of crypto played out dramatically after prices cratered in 2022, wiping out millions in investments and leading to a cascade of bankruptcies and layoffs at crypto exchanges, lenders and other companies. Along with its volatility, crypto lacks protections such as deposit insurance since it’s not controlled by any single institution. Largely unregulated, the industry is susceptible to scams, hacks and fraud.Cryptocurrencies are built on decentralized ledgers — usually blockchain — allowing peer-to-peer transactions without a middleman like a bank or government. That continues to appeal to many people who face barriers to traditional wealth-building avenues such as homeownership, college education, or the stock market, said Terri Bradford, a payment specialist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve, who has researched crypto’s popularity among many Black investors.“It doesn’t appear that a whole lot of people are dissuaded from crypto even though we have observed what has happened,” Bradford said.According to Pew Research Center polls in 2021 and 2022, some 20% of Black, Hispanic and Asian U.S. adults have bought, traded or used cryptocurrency, compared with 13% of white adults. Bradford's research, which examined data from Pew Research Center and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, found that Black investors are more likely to own crypto than stocks or mutual funds, while the opposite is true for white investors.Black and Latino crypto enthusiasts have formed social media groups, written books and organized summits to promote minority developers in the space and champion blockchain technology's potential to create more equitable systems in finance and beyond.But crypto companies also sought to capture a broader market of retail investors through lucrative sponsorship deals with celebrities and sports teams, many aimed directly at Black and Hispanic consumers by touting crypto as an economic equalizer.Coin Cloud, a company that makes ATMs for cryptocurrencies and which has filed for bankruptcy, launched an ad featuring movie director Spike Lee deriding “old money"" as “exploitative,” “oppressive” and ”white,"" and crypto as “positive"" and ""inclusive.”Tonantzin Carmona, a Brookings Institute fellow who researches crypto's impact on minority communities, said that for inexperienced investors, this sort of high-profile hype easily obscures crypto's drawbacks.Carmona considers crypto's marketing to racial minorities part of a legacy of “predatory inclusion” in the tradition of payday loans and subprime mortgages — risky services that promise access to financing that would otherwise be out of reach.“You’ll have a marginalized group, a community that has been historically excluded from accessing products, services, opportunities, and all of a sudden they’re told that they will get access to maybe some type of alternative,” Carmona said. “But this access often comes with conditions that undermine the benefits or that will reproduce insecurity for these very same communities.”Rahwa Berhe first started investing in crypto while studying alternative financial products during a master's degree program at the University of Washington in Seattle. Berhe, who was born in Chicago and grew up in Seattle, tried to forge a career in crypto, leading a listing team for digital assets at an exchange for four years, only to feel isolated as a Black woman.“It’s like you took all the tech bros and the finance bros and put them together. I didn’t know where I fit in,” Berhe said.Her disillusion deepened when crypto couldn’t help her family in Tigray during the conflict there from 2020 to 2022 because the lack of infrastructure and access to electricity made transfers impossible. When she tried to point out these realities to some in the crypto community, she was dismissed as “negative” by social media posters breezily celebrating that the hashtag #eth, for Ethiopia, was introducing people to the digital coin Ether.Berhe now works with a research lab founded by Stanford University and the USC Shoah Foundation, exploring how decentralized web tools can be applied to archiving Africana artifacts. As for cryptocurrency, she is done for now.“It was great until it wasn’t,” Berhe said.Crypto advocates argue minority communities deserve access to a potentially lucrative asset class that isn't going away. Many believe another boom is inevitable and liken last year's collapse to the dotcom bust of the 2000s, which, far from dooming the tech industry, only weeded out bad actors and bolstered winners like Amazon.Andre Mego, Bitcoin Academy’s program manager, said crypto is an accessible way to teach financial literacy to a community where many find concepts like wealth-building investment abstract and out of reach. At the end of the summer workshop, participants were each gifted $1,000 in bitcoin, most of them through Cash App, which launched bitcoin trading in 2018.“When we talk about accessibility, that provides motivation. Because for anybody thinking about investment, they could think, ’That’s a big thing in the future. That’s something that I have to save up so much money for. I don’t know if I’m allowed to do this. Am I even part of this conversation?” Mego said.Bario said Bitcoin Academy's workshop at the Marcy Houses complex was his first meaningful introduction to personal finance, though he graduated last spring with a degree in economics from Lafayette University. Growing up, he said, investing was not a realistic possibility in his family, which relied on income from his father, who worked as taxi driver back in Honduras.“I always thought, as soon as you get your money, it's time to spend it — as soon as you get that Friday paycheck,” said Bario, who now works as a soccer coach.Omid Malekan, who teaches a course on blockchain and cryptocurrency at Columbia Business School, said he hopes the latest crash will disabuse people of the idea that crypto is a reliable avenue for getting rich quick. But Malekan said the crypto industry needs more diversity, not less, and that young Black and Hispanic people should be encouraged to pursue careers in developing a technology he believes will be the future of finance.“The people who are attracted to crypto because of the way the technology works and because of the promise of a more global, more accessible financial system — those people, it takes more than just prices going down to scare them away,"" Malekan said.Tyrone Norris, the software developer, said he learned to be cautious about how to buy crypto the hard way.Growing up in Washington, D.C., Norris studied computer programing in high school and took college courses, but never graduated because he couldn’t afford to go full time. He has worked as a contractor, moving around the country and never owning a home or accessing a workplace retirement plan.When Norris first decided to invest in crypto, he poked around on exchanges and chose MANA, a token powering the 3D virtual world Decentraland, because it shared his ex-girlfriend’s name and he saw it as a sign.He went all in, emptying his bank account of $4,000. When his MANA investment doubled, he started betting on whichever coins he thought would be most lucrative. But one exchange turned out to be scam, and another based in New Zealand lost millions in a hack. Norris's investment went to zero, but two years later, he got back in the game with another $5,000. Again, he watched it soar, then crash as the 2022 “crypto winter” set in.“I was a rookie — I didn’t understand what I was doing. I was putting my crypto into dangerous places,” Norris said.For now, he is taking a break from software development to focus on building a crypto-backed hip-hop gaming project. Norris said he has no regrets because investing introduced him to the possibilities of the blockchain.“I come from nothing,” he said. “I don’t come in expecting anything to be fair.”___The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847677,"Inflation and supply chain fears easing, but global economy continues to face uncertainty","SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 27 March 2023 -         Sharp falls in inflation to leave behind some of the recent challenges for the global economy.             Central banks approaching the end of the tightening cycle partly as a response to recent tensions in the banking system.             Easing supply chain pressures and resilient labour markets to support recovery but uncertainty about the outlook remains high.             KPMG forecasts world GDP growth of 2.1 percent and inflation at 5.3 percent for 2023        KPMG Global Economic Outlook H1 2023   The outlook for the global economy took a positive turn in the first half of 2023 as inflationary pressures began to ease, but ongoing geopolitical tensions and domestic challenges in key markets are slowing any return to sustained growth, according to the latest forecast from KPMG.   According to  KPMG's latest Global Economic Outlook report, global energy prices returning to levels last seen prior to the invasion of Ukraine, combined with easing commodity and food prices, have helped put further downward pressure on inflation for the rest of 2023.   Despite the positive news, major economies throughout the world – most recently the UK and USA – are facing their own domestic pressures, delaying any hopes of improving market conditions and a drop in inflation. The nuanced, complex picture in each country, region and territory is placing unprecedented pressure on central banks, with worries that core inflation could remain sticky and price rises could become entrenched due to the relatively tight economic environment facing a number of territories. Growing fears for the wider international banking system could further complicate matters for central banks as they weigh in financial stability risks against a plan to bring inflation back to target.   The global organisation is forecasting GDP growth of 2.1 percent in 2023 and 2.6 percent in 2024 with inflation forecast at 5.3 percent in 2023 and 3.2 percent in 2024, and global unemployment levels of 5.2 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2024.   Yael Selfin, Chief Economist at KPMG in the UK, said:    ""Despite the resilience of the labour market and the improving inflation conditions, we expect global economic growth to be relatively modest over the next two years, and to stay below its long-term average. Global growth is expected to be driven by the recovery of the Chinese economy and a relatively strong growth in some of the emerging markets, while Eurozone and the US economy are expected to contribute less to global growth over the next two years. Risks to the outlook are broadly skewed to the downside given the volatility in financial markets.   ""The global economy has been through a series of significant shocks over the past three years – the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict – and saw a major expansion to government debt and a significant hike in policy interest rates by central banks. The ramifications of some of these headwinds may not have surfaced yet and we are still to see their full impact and how they interact.""   With monetary policy focused on moderating inflation while stabilising financial markets, fiscal policy is left as the potential tool to boost economic growth. Unfortunately, the public finances have deteriorated significantly over the past three years. Governments have spent significant amounts on first shielding their economies from Covid-19 and subsequently on protecting households and businesses from higher energy prices. That left public debt at historically elevated levels, with less room for expansionary fiscal policy. Even in the U.S., federal spending is expected to slow despite the ramp up in infrastructure spending, although in China fiscal support is to be stepped up following the reopening of the economy. The rise in interest rates has made these larger debt levels more costly to service, putting further pressure on government finances. Nevertheless, some positive growth momentum is expected this year from the relatively smooth reopening of the Chinese economy following the lifting of Covid-related restrictions in December last year.   The pressure on global supply chains has eased significantly in recent months, while shipping costs have dropped too. This should help alleviate some inflationary pressures and improve supply capacity. Global trade remains relatively weak, although we would expect it to recover this year as trade flows normalise with the reopening of the Chinese economy and a recovery in global growth, while we expect geopolitical tensions to continue to exert some pressure on trade flows over the medium term. Consumer demand is also expected to pick up this year, with excess savings – money saved during the pandemic when spending on certain services was not possible – still relatively high in China and Europe, which could potentially be deployed once confidence returns. Indeed, consumer confidence has started to improve in Europe, although it remains at relatively low levels.   Paul Kent, Partner, Advisory, at KPMG in Singapore, said:    ""Singapore stands out as a beacon of hope amid global economic uncertainties. Even as the world faces challenges such as geopolitical tensions and banking crises, Singapore continues to experience steady growth in its economy that is expected to remain notably higher compared with other regions – thanks to strong optimism in the ASEAN region and sustained international investment in the nation. Furthermore, unemployment levels remain low and are expected not to rise significantly this year, highlighting Singapore's relative resilience in the labour market.   ""To ensure that Singapore remains vibrant and competitive economically, businesses across sectors need to focus their efforts on increasing productivity and upskilling their workforce to weather any potential turbulence ahead. Moreover, Singapore must also continue to keep a close pulse on the implications of global developments on inflation and interest rates to ensure that households and businesses remain sufficiently cushioned from the rising costs.   ""The good news is that Singapore has in place robust and sound controls to safeguard its financial systems, with overall limited risk and exposure to banks here so far. However, the country will have to tread cautiously amid heightened volatility in the global financial markets and be ready to respond decisively to any 'black swan' events that could destabilise the economy.""   Regina Mayor, Global Head of Clients & Markets at KPMG, commented:    ""How we get back to sustainable, long-term growth is the big question facing boardrooms and political chambers around the world right now. Some of the biggest inflationary fears – widely predicted late last year – have been mitigated by more direct, pro-active political action geared especially towards getting rising energy prices down. There are also signs that other commodities and food prices are finally starting to ease – helping consumers and business owners who've been facing a significant financial squeeze.   ""The actions taken over the coming months are likely to play a significant role in the pace and nature of the world's economic recovery. KPMG's forecasts show that employment levels should remain robust, even given recent tech layoff announcements – a sign that the tightness of the labour market faced post-pandemic shows little sign of easing. It's an indication of the complexities the world faces today. Strong employment figures are often held up as an example of buoyant market conditions, but they can also reflect the challenges central banks are facing as they attempt to juggle wage expectations, tightened credit conditions and the ever-present danger that any shift in the conflict in Ukraine could bring inflation back into the mix. The upside of a strong labour market, combined with relatively strong personal savings among consumers – especially in Europe and the Americas – means we could start to see robust consumer spending, driving a return to slow-but-steady domestic growth in key markets.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847681,"Harris pledges aid to Ghana amid security, economic concerns","ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — With fears of terrorism and Russian mercenaries rippling through West Africa, Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday opened her weeklong trip to the continent by vowing support for Ghana, a democratic pillar in the region that’s being squeezed by an economic crisis and security concerns.The visit was a high-profile show of support for Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo, who faces rising discontent over inflation after previously overseeing one of the world’s fast-growing economies.“Under your leadership, Ghana has been a beacon of democracy and a contributor to global peace and security,” Harris said during a joint press conference at the Jubilee House, the presidential palace in Accra.Harris announced $100 million in assistance for the region and pledged that the United States would be “strengthening our partnerships across the continent of Africa.” The administration also is requesting another $139 million from Congress to help Ghana reduce child labor, improve weather forecasting, support local musicians and defend against disease outbreaks.The vice president is the most notable member of President Joe Biden’s administration to visit Africa this year, and she’ll be continuing on to Tanzania and Zambia later this week. The trip is part of a concerted effort to broaden U.S. outreach at a time when China and Russia have entrenched interests of their own in Africa.Ghana and some other African countries are suffering ripple effects from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, such as higher costs for food and fuel.The war has also become a dividing line at the United Nations, where some African leaders have condemned the invasion and others have refused. The situation has sparked alarm about the potential for a new Cold War dynamic, where global competition leaves Africa caught in the middle.Harris was careful to emphasize that the U.S. outreach was independent of geopolitical rivalries.“Yes, we are concerned with security. We are concerned with what is happening on the globe as a whole. We are clear-eyed about that,” she said. “But this trip is motivated by the importance of the direct relationship between the United States and Ghana, and as I travel the continent, with those countries as well.”Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who has worked extensively on African issues and joined Harris for the trip to Ghana, said that it “would be a tragic error to disrespect the legitimate hopes and interests of African people.”The United States has sent troops to train militaries from Ghana and other countries in the hopes of bolstering their defenses against local offshoots of al-Qaida and the Islamic State. However, other countries have turned to the Russian mercenary force known as Wagner, which has been on the front lines of Russia’s war in Ukraine but also has a presence in Africa.Wagner began operating in Mali, which ousted French troops based there, and there are concerns that it will also deploy to Burkina Faso, where France also ended its military presence. Ghana recently accused Burkina Faso’s leaders, which took power in a coup last year, of already seeking help from Wagner.Akufo-Addo called terrorism a “poison” and said “we’re spending a lot of sleepless nights trying to make sure we’re protected here.” Sporadic fighting has already increased in Ghana’s north, which borders Burkina Faso.Akufo-Addo also expressed concern that Wagner could expand its footprint in the region.“It raises the very real possibility that once again our continent is going to become the playground for a great power conflict,” he said.Akufo-Addo’s desire for autonomy on the global stage was evident when he rebuffed a question about Chinese influence in Africa. His country reached a $2 billion deal a few years ago with a Chinese company to develop roads and other projects in return for access to a key mineral for producing aluminum.“There may be an obsession in America about Chinese influence on the continent. But there’s no such obsession here,” Akufo-Addo said.Although China has been a leading concern in U.S. foreign policy, Russia’s own attempts to make inroads in Africa have alarmed Washington as well. Some countries have longstanding ties dating back to the Soviet era.The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has made multiple trips to the continent in an effort to show that the West has failed to isolate Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.“The Russians are continuing to make the first move in Africa, and the U.S. is continuing to play catch-up,” said Samuel Ramani, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based defense and security think tank.“It’s really unclear how Russia will really be able to expand its influence in the long term,” he added. “But in the short term, they’re creating good will for themselves.”Mucahid Durmaz, a senior analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk intelligence company, said that Moscow’s overall investments in Africa “are very modest” compared with Washington’s but he added that it has been able to leverage anti-Western sentiment in some areas of the continent.“The Ukraine war has boosted Africa’s importance in international politics and increased geopolitical jostling among global powers for the support of its governments and nations,” he said.U.S. officials have steered clear of framing their approach in terms of global rivalries, something that could swiftly sour Africans who are wary of being caught in the middle.“They remain cautious about becoming collateral damage to geopolitical competition by repeating the same mistakes of the Cold War era,” Durmaz said.___ Mednick reported from Dakar, Senegal.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847682,DeSantis team welcomes contrast with Trump 'chaos' candidacy,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Jim McKee is standing at the end of a line that snakes through five aisles of fiction inside the Books-A-Million store in Florida’s capital city.He is smiling because in a matter of minutes, the book he’s holding will be signed by its author, Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor who McKee believes should be the nation’s next president. But as a former Donald Trump loyalist, the 44-year-old Tallahassee attorney almost whispers when he first says it out loud.“Personally, I’d rather see DeSantis win the Republican primary than Trump,” McKee says softly, having to repeat himself to be heard. His voice soon grows louder.“Trump has upset so many people,” McKee says. “DeSantis is more palatable. He has a good story to tell.”Indeed, conversations throughout Tallahassee’s book stores, conference rooms, state house offices and sports bars reveal that DeSantis’ allies are gaining confidence as Trump’s legal woes mount. The former president faces a possible indictment in New York over his role in a hush money scheme during the 2016 campaign to prevent porn actor Stormy Daniels from going public about an extramarital sexual encounter, which he denies.The optimism around DeSantis comes even as an unlikely collection of establishment-minded Republican officials and Make America Great Again influencers raise concerns about the Florida governor’s readiness for the national stage. DeSantis has stumbled at times under the weight of intensifying national scrutiny as he builds out his political organization and introduces himself to voters in key primary states.DeSantis' allies privately scoffed at recent reports of anonymous concerns over the direction of his campaign, noting there is no campaign. The 44-year-old governor isn't expected to launch his White House bid for at least two more months. And the first presidential primary contest is roughly 10 months away.For now, DeSantis’ team, headquartered here on the front edge of Florida’s Panhandle, believes he holds a position of strength among Republican voters. And as Trump fights to undermine DeSantis, his strongest Republican rival, the Florida governor’s growing coalition is eager to highlight the contrast between the two men.On one side stands Trump, a twice-impeached former president carrying a new level of turmoil into the 2024 presidential contest. On the other is DeSantis, a big-state governor coming off a commanding reelection, who is a far more disciplined messenger and hyperfocused on enacting conservative policies.“Of all the things that Donald Trump has done and accomplished in his life, it’s just constant chaos. And I think the American people are just tired of it,” said Florida state Rep. Spencer Roach, a former Trump supporter who thinks DeSantis would be “a very formidable presidential candidate.”Most voters have only just begun to analyze the differences between the dueling Republican stars as the 2024 presidential election season opens under a cloud of unprecedented scandal.A former president has never been arrested, but prosecutors in New York, Georgia and Washington are leading criminal probes of Trump’s behavior on multiple fronts that could potentially produce indictments in the coming days, weeks or months.The politics are murky at best.Should Trump be charged, DeSantis supporters concede that Trump would likely benefit politically — in the short term, at least — as the GOP base rushes to defend their former leader from what they see as a weaponized justice system. But in the long term, DeSantis’ team believes primary voters will view Trump’s legal challenges as an acute reminder of his extraordinary baggage that could lead to another Republican disappointment in 2024.Meanwhile, Trump is using his mounting legal challenges as a cudgel to force Republican rivals to line up the GOP behind him. It's the same playbook he employed successfully last summer after the FBI raided his Florida estate to seize classified documents and during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.DeSantis condemned the New York prosecutor's potential indictment over the last week under intense pressure from MAGA influencers and after other White House prospects had offered their own criticism.“I hope it doesn’t come to where you end up seeing this going forward,” DeSantis said in an interview with Piers Morgan, without mentioning Trump by name. “People see that as weaponizing the justice system. So I think it’s fundamentally wrong to do that.""And while DeSantis sprinkled a few jabs at Trump and his leadership style throughout the same interview, such remarks are mild in comparison to Trump’s scorched-earth broadsides against him.Last week alone, the former president seized on DeSantis’ votes as a congressman to cut Social Security and Medicare and attacked his record as Florida governor on violent crime, public health and education. Trump also shared a photo suggesting impropriety when DeSantis was a teacher two decades ago, despite no evidence of that.At a rally over the weekend in Waco, Texas, Trump said DeSantis was “dropping like a rock.”In an effort to combat the perception that his numbers might be slipping, DeSantis’ allies quietly distributed polling conducted last week in Iowa and New Hampshire by the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies that suggests vulnerability for Trump.Meanwhile, DeSantis is only just beginning to navigate the intense national scrutiny that comes with being a top-tier presidential prospect.DeSantis’ recent reference to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “a territorial dispute"" — a statement he has since walked back — sowed doubt among some would-be supporters about whether he’s ready for prime time. There are also consistent concerns that he doesn’t have the charisma necessary to connect with voters on a personal level.“I have heard that there is concern out there that he doesn’t have the ability to go the distance because of his interpersonal skills,” said New York-based Republican donor Eric Levine, a fierce Trump critic. “If it’s a race between him and Trump, I’m a Ron DeSantis guy. But I don’t know if I’m with either of them right now.”At Thursday’s book signing in Tallahassee, the Florida governor made little effort to speak to people who had waited in the long line — aside from an obligatory “Hey, how are you?” — as he signed their books. Most of the one-on-one interactions were silent and spanned less than 10 seconds as he scribbled his name on the inside cover.DeSantis' staff wouldn't allow pictures.At the same event, DeSantis did not answer when asked by an Associated Press reporter whether Trump was being treated fairly by prosecutors.His decision to ignore the mainstream press, just as he often ignores Trump's attacks, is not new. In fact, his allies praise the approach as an example of the discipline that makes him a better presidential contender than Trump.Yet it carries risks.By not engaging more directly with the former president in particular, DeSantis is adopting a similar playbook as Trump’s 2016 Republican rivals — including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — who ignored Trump for much of that campaign. Each ultimately went on the attack more directly, but by that time, Trump had built an insurmountable lead.“DeSantis will not shrink from the fight. That’s not how he’s operated in Florida politics to this point,” said Matt Caldwell, a former state representative who shared the statewide ballot with DeSantis in 2018 as a candidate for state agriculture commissioner. “One could argue that he’s got the upper hand, so he’s only engaging when he has to.”Instead of 2016, Caldwell likened Trump’s challenges in 2024 to the 1996 presidential election when President Bill Clinton faced serious allegations of sexual impropriety that nearly sank his reelection.“At end of the day, this is just a hubbub about money and sex, which isn’t a whole lot different from 1996,” Caldwell said. “I don’t like this, and I didn’t like ’96. But Bill Clinton won reelection.”___Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in Waco, Texas, contributed to this report.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847683,"Twenty years on, reflection and regret on 2002 Iraq war vote","WASHINGTON (AP) — Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow was sitting in Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s conference room at the Pentagon, listening to him make the case that Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction.At some point in the presentation — one of many lawmaker briefings by President George W. Bush’s administration ahead of the October 2002 votes to authorize force in Iraq — military leaders showed an image of trucks in the country that they believed could be carrying weapons materials. But the case sounded thin, and Stabenow, then just a freshman senator, noticed the date on the photo was months old.“There was not enough information to persuade me that they in fact had any connection with what happened on Sept. 11, or that there was justification to attack,” Stabenow said in a recent interview, referring to the 2001 attacks that were one part of the Bush administration’s underlying argument for the Iraq invasion.“I really thought about the young men and women that we would be sending into battle,"" she said. ""I have a son and a daughter — would I vote to send them to war based on this evidence? In the end the answer for me was no.”As with many of her colleagues, Stabenow’s “nay” vote in the early morning hours of Oct. 11, 2002, didn’t come without political risk. The Bush administration and many of the Democrat’s swing-state constituents strongly believed that the United States should go to war in Iraq, and lawmakers knew that the House and Senate votes on whether to authorize force would be hugely consequential.Indeed, the bipartisan votes in the House and Senate that month were a grave moment in American history that would reverberate for decades — the Bush administration’s central allegations of weapons programs eventually proved baseless, the Middle East was permanently altered and nearly 5,000 U.S. troops were killed in the war. Iraqi deaths are estimated in the hundreds of thousands.Only now, 20 years after the Iraq invasion in March 2003, is Congress seriously considering walking it back, with a Senate vote expected this week to repeal the 2002 and 1991 authorizations of force against Iraq. Bipartisan supporters say the repeal is years overdue, with Saddam's regime long gone and Iraq now a strategic partner of the United States.For senators who cast votes two decades ago, it is a full-circle moment that prompts a mixture of sadness, regret and reflection. Many consider it the hardest vote they ever took.The vote was “premised on the biggest lie ever told in American history,” said Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, then a House member who voted in favor of the war authorization. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said that “all of us that voted for it probably are slow to admit” that the weapons of mass destruction did not exist. But he defends the vote based on what they knew then. “There was reason to be fearful” of Saddam and what he could have done if he did have the weapons, Grassley said.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, then a House member who was running for the Senate, says the war will have been worth it if Iraq succeeds in becoming a democracy.“What can you say 20 years later?” Graham said this past week, reflecting on his own vote in favor. “Intelligence was faulty.”Another “yes” vote on the Senate floor that night was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, now Senate majority leader. With the vote coming a year after Sept. 11 devastated his hometown, he says he believed then that the president deserved the benefit of the doubt when a nation is under attack.“Of course, with the luxury of hindsight, it’s clear that the president bungled the war from start to finish and should not have ever been given that benefit,” Schumer said in a statement. “Now, with the war firmly behind us, we’re one step closer to putting the war powers back where they belong — in the hands of Congress.”Twenty years later, support has flipped. Then, only 28 senators voted against the authorization. All but one were Democrats. Today, roughly the same number of senators are voting against nullifying the 2002 and 1991 measures, arguing that repeal could project weakness to U.S. enemies and hamper future operations. But all of the opponents are Republicans.Among those Republicans voting in favor of repeal is Grassley. He said withdrawing the war authorization would prevent those powers from being misinterpreted and abused in the future.In 2002, the Bush administration worked aggressively to drum up support for invading Iraq by promoting what turned out to be false intelligence claims about Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction. Lawmakers attended briefing after briefing with military leaders and White House officials, in groups and in one-on-one conversations, as the administration applied political pressure on Democrats, in particular.In the end, the vote was strongly bipartisan, with Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and others backing Bush’s request.Joe Biden also voted in favor as a senator from Delaware, and now supports repealing it as president.Other senior Democrats urged opposition. In one of many speeches on the Senate floor that invoked the country's history, the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., urged his colleagues to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall, where “nearly every day you will find someone at that wall weeping for a loved one, a father, a son, a brother, a friend, whose name is on that wall.”Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., issued a similar warning during the floor debate, saying he believed that anxiety and fear may be driving sentiment for an Iraq invasion. “I caution and beg my colleagues to think twice about that,"" Durbin said, adding that “America has faced periods of fear in its past.”Now the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Durbin recalled on the Senate floor earlier this month his vote against the resolution amid a “fearsome national debate” over whether the U.S. should invade Iraq. The threat of weapons of mass destruction “was beaten into our heads day after day,” Durbin said. “But many of us were skeptical.”“I look back on it, as I am sure others do, as one of the most important votes that I ever cast,” Durbin said.Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., agrees that at the time, “I remember thinking this is the most serious thing I can ever do.”She says the environment was charged with an “emotional pressure” in the public and in the media that the U.S. needed to show Iraq and the world that it was tough. She voted against the resolution after deciding there was not enough evidence to support the Bush administration’s argument, and after talking to many of her constituents at home who opposed the idea of an Iraq invasion.For many lawmakers, the political pressure was intense. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, then a House member and now the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says he was “excoriated” at home for his “no” vote, after the Sept. 11 attacks had killed so many from his state. He made the right decision, he says, but “it was fraught with political challenges.”Similarly, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., recalls that the idea of invading Iraq was popular at home, and the state’s other senator, Republican Gordon Smith, was supporting it, as were Daschle and other influential Democrats. But he was a new member of the intelligence committee, with regular access to closed-door briefings by administration officials. He wasn’t convinced by their arguments, and voted no.“It was really a dramatic moment in American history,” Wyden says. “You wish you could just unravel it and have another chance.”Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., then a freshman senator who also voted against the resolution, says the war “made no sense strategically” and took the country’s focus off the troops waging war in Afghanistan. “Just absolutely bad strategy,” he says, that also contributed to the buildup of other powerful countries like China and Russia.For those who voted for the invasion, the reflection can be more difficult.Hillary Clinton, a Democratic senator from New York at the time, was forced to defend her vote as she ran for president twice, and eventually called it a mistake and her “greatest regret.” Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin solemnly told an Iowa PBS station several years ago that his vote in the Senate to authorize force in Iraq was “the worst vote I ever cast in my life.”Markey says “I regret relying upon” Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney, along with other administration officials. “It was a mistake to rely upon the Bush administration for telling the truth,” Markey said in a brief interview last week.Graham says he spoke to Bush last week on an unrelated matter, but that they also discussed the war’s anniversary.“I told him, ‘Mr. President, Iraq has not retreated from democracy,’” Graham said. “'It has been imperfect. But if at the end of the day, Saddam Hussein is eliminated and a democracy takes his place that can work with the United States, that is worth it. It turned out to be in America’s interest.'”Bush’s reply was uncertain.“He said he believes that history will judge whether or not Iraq can maintain its path to democracy,” Graham said.",2023/03/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4847684,"Twenty years on, reflection and regret on 2002 Iraq war vote","WASHINGTON (AP) — Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow was sitting in Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s conference room at the Pentagon, listening to him make the case that Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction.At some point in the presentation — one of many lawmaker briefings by President George W. Bush’s administration ahead of the October 2002 votes to authorize force in Iraq — military leaders showed an image of trucks in the country that they believed could be carrying weapons materials. But the case sounded thin, and Stabenow, then just a freshman senator, noticed the date on the photo was months old.“There was not enough information to persuade me that they in fact had any connection with what happened on Sept. 11, or that there was justification to attack,” Stabenow said in a recent interview, referring to the 2001 attacks that were one part of the Bush administration’s underlying argument for the Iraq invasion. “I have a son and a daughter — would I vote to send them to war based on this evidence? In the end the answer for me was no.”As with many of her colleagues, Stabenow’s “nay” vote in the early morning hours of Oct. 11, 2002, didn’t come without political risk. The Bush administration and many of the Democrat’s swing-state constituents strongly believed that the United States should go to war in Iraq, and lawmakers knew that the House and Senate votes on whether to authorize force would be hugely consequential.Indeed, the bipartisan votes in the House and Senate that month were a grave moment in American history that would reverberate for decades — the Bush administration’s central allegations of weapons programs eventually proved baseless, the Middle East was permanently altered and nearly 5,000 U.S. troops were killed in the war. Iraqi deaths are estimated in the hundreds of thousands.Only now, 20 years after the Iraq invasion in March 2003, is Congress seriously considering walking it back, with a Senate vote expected this week to repeal the 2002 and 1991 authorizations of force against Iraq. Bipartisan supporters say the repeal is years overdue, with Saddam's regime long gone and Iraq now a strategic partner of the United States.For senators who cast votes two decades ago, it is a full-circle moment that prompts a mixture of sadness, regret and reflection. Many consider it the hardest vote they ever took.The vote was “premised on the biggest lie ever told in American history,” said Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, then a House member who voted in favor of the war authorization. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said that “all of us that voted for it probably are slow to admit” that the weapons of mass destruction did not exist. But he defends the vote based on what they knew then. “There was reason to be fearful” of Saddam's and what he could have done if he did have the weapons, Grassley said.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, then a House member who was running for the Senate, says the war will have been worth it if Iraq succeeds in becoming a democracy.“What can you say 20 years later?” Graham said this past week, reflecting on his own vote in favor. “Intelligence was faulty.”Another “yes” vote on the Senate floor that night was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, now Senate majority leader. With the vote coming a year after Sept. 11 devastated his hometown, he says he believed then that the president deserved the benefit of the doubt.“Of course, with the luxury of hindsight, it’s clear that the president bungled the war from start to finish and should not have ever been given that benefit,” Schumer said in a statement. “Now, with the war firmly behind us, we’re one step closer to putting the war powers back where they belong — in the hands of Congress.”In 2002, the Bush administration worked aggressively, in briefing after briefing, to drum up support for invading Iraq by promoting what turned out to be false intelligence claims about Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction.In the end, the vote was strongly bipartisan, with Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and others backing Bush’s request.Joe Biden also voted in favor as a senator from Delaware, and is now supports repealing it as president.Other senior Democrats urged opposition. The late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., urged his colleagues to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall, where “nearly every day you will find someone at that wall weeping for a loved one, a father, a son, a brother, a friend, whose name is on that wall.”Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, now the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, recalled on the Senate floor earlier this month his vote against the resolution after the threat of weapons of mass destruction “was beaten into our heads day after day.""“I look back on it, as I am sure others do, as one of the most important votes that I ever cast,” Durbin said.Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who also voted against the resolution, said that at the time, “I remember thinking this is the most serious thing I can ever do.”For many lawmakers, the political pressure was intense. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, then a House member and now the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says he was “excoriated” at home for his “no” vote, after the Sept. 11 attacks had killed so many from his state. He made the right decision, he says, but “it was fraught with political challenges.”For those who voted for the invasion, the reflection can be more difficult.Hillary Clinton, a Democratic senator from New York at the time, was forced to defend her vote as she ran for president twice, and eventually called it a mistake and her “greatest regret.”Markey says that “I regret relying upon” Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney, along with other administration officials.“It was a mistake to rely upon the Bush administration for telling the truth,” Markey said in a brief interview last week.",2023/03/27,,World
