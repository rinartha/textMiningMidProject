https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804705,Australian Defense Department to remove Chinese-made cameras,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia’s Defense Department will remove surveillance cameras made by Chinese Communist Party-linked companies from its buildings, the government said Thursday after the U.S. and Britain made similar moves.

            The Australian newspaper reported Thursday that at least 913 cameras, intercoms, electronic entry systems and video recorders developed and manufactured by Chinese companies Hikvision and Dahua are in Australian government and agency offices, including the Defense Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 

            Hikvision and Dahua are partly owned by China's Communist Party-ruled government.











            Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said his department is assessing all its surveillance technology.

            “Where those particular cameras are found, they’re going to be removed,” Marles told Australian Broadcasting Corp. “There is an issue here and we’re going to deal with it.”

            Asked about Australia's decision, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning criticized what she called “wrongful practices that overstretch the concept of national security and abuse state power to suppress and discriminate against Chinese enterprises.” 

            Without mentioning Australia by name, Mao said the Chinese government has “always encouraged Chinese enterprises to carry out foreign investment and cooperation in accordance with market principles and international rules, and on the basis of compliance with local laws."" 

            “We hope Australia will provide a fair and non-discriminatory environment for the normal operation of Chinese enterprises and do more things that are conducive to mutual trust and cooperation between the two sides,” she told reporters at a daily briefing. 

            The U.S. government said in November it was banning telecommunications and video surveillance equipment from several prominent Chinese brands including Hikvision and Dahua in an effort to protect the nation’s communications network. 

            Security cameras made by Hikvision were also banned from British government buildings in November.

            An audit in Australia found that Hikvision and Dahua cameras and security equipment were found in almost every department except the Agriculture Department and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

            The Australian War Memorial and National Disability Insurance Agency have said they will remove the Chinese cameras found at their sites, the ABC reported.

            Opposition cybersecurity spokesman James Paterson said he had prompted the audit by asking questions over six months of each federal agency, after the Home Affairs Department was unable to say how many of the cameras, access control systems and intercoms were installed in government buildings.

            “We urgently need a plan from the ... government to rip every one of these devices out of Australian government departments and agencies,” Paterson said.

            Both companies are subject to China's National Intelligence Law which requires them to cooperate with Chinese intelligence agencies, he said.

            “We would have no way of knowing if the sensitive information, images and audio collected by these devices are secretly being sent back to China against the interests of Australian citizens,” Paterson said.CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia’s Defense Department will remove surveillance cameras made by Chinese Communist Party-linked companies from its buildings, the government said Thursday after the U.S. and Britain made similar moves.The Australian newspaper reported Thursday that at least 913 cameras, intercoms, electronic entry systems and video recorders developed and manufactured by Chinese companies Hikvision and Dahua are in Australian government and agency offices, including the Defense Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Hikvision and Dahua are partly owned by China's Communist Party-ruled government.Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said his department is assessing all its surveillance technology.“Where those particular cameras are found, they’re going to be removed,” Marles told Australian Broadcasting Corp. “There is an issue here and we’re going to deal with it.”Asked about Australia's decision, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning criticized what she called “wrongful practices that overstretch the concept of national security and abuse state power to suppress and discriminate against Chinese enterprises.”Without mentioning Australia by name, Mao said the Chinese government has “always encouraged Chinese enterprises to carry out foreign investment and cooperation in accordance with market principles and international rules, and on the basis of compliance with local laws.""“We hope Australia will provide a fair and non-discriminatory environment for the normal operation of Chinese enterprises and do more things that are conducive to mutual trust and cooperation between the two sides,” she told reporters at a daily briefing.The U.S. government said in November it was banning telecommunications and video surveillance equipment from several prominent Chinese brands including Hikvision and Dahua in an effort to protect the nation’s communications network.Security cameras made by Hikvision were also banned from British government buildings in November.An audit in Australia found that Hikvision and Dahua cameras and security equipment were found in almost every department except the Agriculture Department and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.The Australian War Memorial and National Disability Insurance Agency have said they will remove the Chinese cameras found at their sites, the ABC reported.Opposition cybersecurity spokesman James Paterson said he had prompted the audit by asking questions over six months of each federal agency, after the Home Affairs Department was unable to say how many of the cameras, access control systems and intercoms were installed in government buildings.“We urgently need a plan from the ... government to rip every one of these devices out of Australian government departments and agencies,” Paterson said.Both companies are subject to China's National Intelligence Law which requires them to cooperate with Chinese intelligence agencies, he said.“We would have no way of knowing if the sensitive information, images and audio collected by these devices are secretly being sent back to China against the interests of Australian citizens,” Paterson said.",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804706,Staley Statue: Gamecocks coach to be honored with statue,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's capital city is planning a statue honoring two-time national championship coach Dawn Staley. 

            The city of Columbia and the group, Statues for Equality, are working together on Staley's statue. The organization is dedicated to increasing the number of female honorees for their contributions to society. 

            A rendering of the statue is in the works and should take about a year to build and install once a design is approved by Staley. 











            The statue will cost about $140,000 and be split between the Statues for Equality organization and private donations. Plans call for it to be installed across from the South Carolina Statehouse. 

            Staley would be third person connected with South Carolina athletics to have a statue. The Gamecocks lone Heisman Trophy honoree, 1980 winner George Rogers, has a statue outside the football stadium. One of Staley's best players, WNBA champion A'ja Wilson, has a statue near the entrance of the basketball arena. 

            Staley is in her 15th season as South Carolina women's basketball coach. She's won NCAA Tournament titles in 2017 and 2022. The Gamecocks are ranked No. 1 in the country and are 23-0. They play Auburn on Thursday night.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804709,"Kim Jong Un shows off daughter, missiles at N. Korean parade","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his young daughter took center stage at a huge military parade, fueling speculation that she is being primed as a future leader of the isolated country as her father showed off his latest, largest nuclear missiles.

            Wednesday night's parade in the capital, Pyongyang, featured the newest hardware in Kim’s growing nuclear arsenal, including what experts said was possibly a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile he could test in the coming months.

            That missile was part of around a dozen ICBMs Kim’s troops rolled out at the event — an unprecedented number that underscored how he continues to expand his military capabilities despite limited resources in the face of deepening tensions with his neighbors and the United States.











            The parade was the fifth known public appearance by Kim’s daughter, Kim Ju Ae, his second-born child who is believed to be around 10 years old. On Tuesday, Kim Jong Un brought his daughter to visit troops as he lauded the “irresistible might” of his nuclear-armed military.

            State media have signaled a lofty role for Kim Ju Ae. She has been called “respected” and “beloved,” and a photo released Wednesday showed her sitting in the seat of honor at a banquet, flanked by generals and her parents.

            The parade marked the 75th anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s army and came after weeks of preparations involving huge numbers of troops and civilians mobilized to glorify Kim’s rule and his relentless push to cement his country's status as a nuclear power.

            North Korean state TV video released Thursday showed Kim, wearing a black coat and fedora, arriving at the parade with his wife and daughter in a limousine. They received thunderous cheers from thousands of troops and spectators packed in brightly illuminated Kim Il Sung Square, named after his grandfather, the nation’s founder.

            After saluting his honor guards, Kim held hands with his daughter as they walked down a red carpet. The family entered a building where they sat on a leather couch, chatting and sharing snacks and drinks with top officials as they waited for the main march to start.

            Troops and spectators roared again as Kim appeared from behind the building as the clock struck 9 p.m. He smiled and waved to the crowds below before taking his spot on a balcony, with his wife and daughter sitting behind him.

            Thousands of goose-stepping soldiers marched through the square, chanting “Defend with your life, Paektu Bloodline,"" referring to the Kim family’s lineage named after a volcano that North Koreans consider sacred. 

            A ceremonial cavalry unit trotted through the square riding white horses, another symbol associated with the Kim family’s dynastic rule. The broadcast described one of the animals as “most beloved” by Kim's daughter.

            Tanks and multiple rocket launchers were rolled out before the appearance of Kim’s nuclear missiles, which are typically saved for last. 

            Launcher trucks carried around 10 Hwasong-17 ICBMs, a system which demonstrated a potential to reach deep into the U.S. mainland during a flight test in November.

            Those missiles were followed by what appeared to be another type of long-range missile encased in canisters and carried on nine-axle vehicles. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the missiles were actual rockets. But analysts say the use of canisters strongly implied a solid-fuel missile, most likely an ICBM which North Korea has been trying to develop for years.

            North Korea’s existing ICBMs, including Hwasong-17s, use liquid propellants, which require pre-launch injections and cannot remain fueled for prolonged periods. A solid-fuel alternative would take less time to prepare, “providing less opportunity for an impending launch to be identified and countered,” said Joseph Dempsey, an analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. 

            “Where North Korea is in terms of completing the actual missile and integrating it onto the launcher is unclear, but if North Korea is parading it, an attempted launch this year could well be on the cards,” he said.

            The unprecedented number of Hwasong-17s in Wednesday’s event suggests progress in efforts to produce those weapons in larger numbers, said Kim Dong-yub, a professor at Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies. 

            The parade came after Kim met with his top military brass on Monday and ordered an expansion of combat exercises, as he continues to escalate an already provocative run in weapons tests in the face of deepening tensions with his neighbors and Washington.

            The official Korean Central News Agency said the parade featured a variety of nuclear-capable weapons, including tactical nuclear weapons targeting South Korea. The agency described the ICBMs as crucial weapons supporting North Korea’s ongoing stance of “nuke for nuke and an all-out confrontation for an all-out confrontation” with its enemies. 

            Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a briefing that the South Korean and U.S. militaries were closely analyzing the North Korean photos and reports to evaluate the weaponry. 

            North Korea is coming off a record-breaking year in weapons testing. The dozens of missiles it fired in 2022 included potentially nuclear-capable systems designed to strike targets in South Korea and the U.S. mainland.

            The intensified tests were punctuated by fiery statements and a new law threatening preemptive nuclear attacks against its neighbors and the United States in a broad range of scenarios.

            Kim doubled down on his nuclear push entering 2023.

            During a major political conference in December, he called for an “exponential increase” in the country’s nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nuclear weapons targeting “enemy” South Korea and the development of more advanced ICBMs.

            In December, Kim supervised a test of a “high-thrust solid-fuel motor” for a new strategic weapon he said would be developed in the “shortest span of time,” which experts said likely referred to a solid-fuel ICBM. 

            Solid-fuel ICBMs featured prominently in an extensive wish list Kim announced under a five-year arms development plan in 2021. It also included tactical nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, nuclear-powered submarines and spy satellites.

            Analysts say Kim’s decision to bring his daughter to major public events involving his military sends a statement to the world that he has no intention to voluntarily surrender his nuclear weapons, which he apparently sees as the strongest guarantee of his survival and the extension of his family’s dynastic rule.

            An official from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to department rules during a background briefing, said Kim Ju Ae’s repeated appearances at significant events and her prominent exposure in state media are also aimed at strengthening loyalty to the Kim family. The official said it’s too early to determine whether she is being primed as her father's successor but added that “all possibilities are open.” 

            “We can only speculate at this point,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, D.C. “(Kim Jong Un is) obviously showing her off intentionally and, at a minimum, he seems to be trying to reiterate the importance, status, and legitimacy of a direct Kim bloodline offspring. It’s too soon to assume that she will be his heir because the son has always succeeded the throne in North Korea.”

            South Korean media have speculated that Kim has three children — born in 2010, 2013 and 2017 — and that the first child is a son and the third is a daughter.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his young daughter took center stage at a huge military parade, fueling speculation that she is being primed as a future leader of the isolated country as her father showed off his latest, largest nuclear missiles.Wednesday night's parade in the capital, Pyongyang, featured the newest hardware in Kim’s growing nuclear arsenal, including what experts said was possibly a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile he could test in the coming months.That missile was part of around a dozen ICBMs Kim’s troops rolled out at the event — an unprecedented number that underscored how he continues to expand his military capabilities despite limited resources in the face of deepening tensions with his neighbors and the United States.The parade was the fifth known public appearance by Kim’s daughter, Kim Ju Ae, his second-born child who is believed to be around 10 years old.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804723,Advancing to the Next Phase: PandaiSuite Commences Phase II Development,"SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 9 February 2023 - PandaiSuite, an online course management platform based in Singapore, is bridging the gap between digital transformation and individual learning. Cognotiv, the parent company of PandaiSuite, is further developing an advanced and cutting-edge system that takes a systematic approach to improve efficiency in learning and training. Titled PandaiSuite Phase II, the game-changing system uses advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to provide personalised courses and optimise the overall training cycle. This new iteration comprises four key features: PandaiMind, PandaiKM, PandaiHR and PandaiNetwork. Their approach to learning has enabled them to capitalise on the growing ASEAN smart education and learning market, which is estimated to be worth US 354,597.8 million by 2027, according to the Coherent Marketing Institute.   PandaiMind, a patent-protected solution, intends to improve training and learning neural networks while leveraging learner profile-driven training and course design improvement. PandaiKM, another ground-breaking feature, aims to offer comprehensive knowledge management and course recommendations, as well as an AI-enabled career path training planner to help users identify relevant courses for their career goals. The next phase also sees the rollout of PandaiHR, which is designed to bridge the gap between SME/Enterprise and Training Providers (TPs) while enabling learners to acquire relevant skills through AI-enabled training. The final advanced addition to PandaiSuite Phase II includes PandaiNetwork, which seeks to facilitate networking between learners and trainers, creating a community based on learning and development. Together, these improvements will provide a more effective  learning management system while enhancing the inclusive learning experience for users.   The new additions of PandaiSuite Phase II are projected to bolster the existing components of PandaiSuite Phase I, which include PandaiCore, PandaiCart, PandaiCampus, and PandaiCorner. This first phase laid the framework for PandaiSuite to be an  online course platform that offers learners the flexibility to personalise their learning journey. Designed to cater to  corporate training providers and individual learners looking to enhance their skill set and knowledge base, the current platform allows users to select from various short courses, monitor their progress, and take relevant tests. It also enables users to learn at their own speed, offering access to professional trainers attached to the platform and allowing learners to achieve their goals regardless of their prior knowledge or skills.   With its proposed action plans, PandaiSuite has been selected to participate in the innovSpur Programme, which supports the advancement and early adoption of viable learning innovations for EdTech solutionists. As a result, the platform has been awarded a grant that is projected to support the implementation of PandaiSuite Phase II and its next steps of development.   Through its participation in the innovSpur Programme, PandaiSuite is equipped to benefit from the resources available and thereby has the potential to push its learning initiatives forward. The grant of up to $500,000 or 75% of the project value offered by the programme will allow PandaiSuite to cover a significant portion of the costs associated with scaling up and early adoption. The live-testing support offered in the real market and customer conditions also aim to aid PandaiSuite in understanding their customers better and fine-tuning their product to cater to market needs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804739,"Allen, Mobley power Cavaliers to 113-85 win over Pistons","CLEVELAND (AP) — Jarrett Allen scored 20 points, Evan Mobley added 19 and the Cleveland Cavaliers won their fourth straight game, 113-85 over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night despite resting their starting backcourt.

            All-Star starter Donovan Mitchell (groin) and Darius Garland (thumb) got the night off to heal some nagging injuries and the Cavs barely missed their top guards, who average a combined 48.8 points.

            With Allen and Mobley doing inside damage and combining for 21 points, Cleveland built an 18-point lead after one quarter.











            The Pistons hung around and got within two in the third before the Cavs opened the fourth by outscoring Detroit 26-4 over the first seven minutes to put it away.

            “Jarrett did a great job of setting the tone,” Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “There was a bunch of extra-effort plays that he made where he was just outworking the guy in front of him. He was able to get offensive rebounds, his teammates were finding him in the paint.

            ""And the same thing with Evan. They had opportunities to attack and were extremely aggressive.""

            Allen added 14 rebounds as the Cavs outrebounded the Pistons 48-32 and held them to their lowest point total this season.

            “These type of games are butt-kicking contests because they play physical offense,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""It was a great game for us to feel, to taste, to go up against a hard-nosed, physical playoff team.”

            Bojan Bogdanovic scored 15 and rookie Jalen Duren 14 for Detroit. The Pistons have dropped nine of 11 and have the worst record (14-42) in the Eastern Conference.

            Cavaliers swingman Caris LeVert, who has been mentioned in rumors leading into Thursday's NBA trade deadline, struggled for much of the game. He finished with 15 points — 10 in the fourth — on 5-of-16 shooting.

            “He knows we need him,” Bickerstaff said, “and he knows how to get to his spots and what he's capable of, so it's not one of those things where he's having a bad night and you just sit him down.""

            The Cavs are unlikely to make a significant move, but LeVert's expiring $18 million contract does make him attractive for a team looking to clear salary space in the offseason.

            Cleveland hasn't lost since a tough three-point defeat at home against Miami.

            “I feel like everyone is just clicking right now,” Mobley said. “Everyone is in attack mode.”

            THE GREAT DEBATE

            Now that he's the NBA's career scoring leader, LeBron James has checked a box on his resume that can't be equaled.

            And while there will continue to be discussion over whether James or Michael Jordan is the greatest player in league history, Bickerstaff believes one argument has been settled.

            ""I no longer think there is a debate over who had the greatest NBA career,” Bickerstaff said, referring to James, who spent 11 seasons with Cleveland.

            For Bickerstaff, James' best attribute is his well-roundedness — as a player and person.

            “The way he has gone about his business,” he said. ""He’s a pros pro. He’s about his teammates. He made everybody he plays with better. You can be a great player and be selfless. ”He's a hell of a role model for younger players.”

                McMahon was 8 of 13 from the field and 9 of 9 from the foul line, converting three three-point plays for 25 points. Mikesell was 6 of 6 from the 3-point line and 9 of 15 overall for 24 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804745,"Scheierman, Nembhard lead No. 23 Creighton over Seton Hall","NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — After entering the season with a Top 10 ranking and Big East title expectations, No. 23 Creighton started 6-0 before losing six straight, including the conference opener.

            With a month to go in the regular season, the Bluejays are flying high and into the thick of the Big East title race.

            Baylor Scheierman had 19 points and nine rebounds, Ryan Nembhard added 15 on 6-of-7 shooting and dished out four assists, and Creighton fended off a feisty Seton Hall 75-62 on Wednesday night.











            “We have different guys that step up on different nights,” Scheierman said. “Tonight it was just my turn.”

            Ryan Kalkbrenner scored 13 points and Arthur Kaluma had 11 points and seven rebounds for the Bluejays (16-8, 10-3 Big East).

            “Since we’ve gotten healthy, we’ve played pretty good basketball,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. “Things happen during the season. I think every team in the country – you see there’s been some ebbs and flows with a lot of good teams across the country, but for us to dig ourselves out of a six-game losing streak and get back into the rankings – that doesn’t happen very often.”

            Seton Hall (15-10, 8-6) opened up the second half with an Al-Amir Dawes 3-pointer to take the lead before Kalkbrenner quickly tied things up at 42. Tyrese Samuel drilled a 3-pointer in the corner to give Seton Hall a 49-43 lead – its largest of the game – with 16:49 left.

            Creighton would quickly fight back and the teams traded the lead down the stretch until the Bluejays went on an 8-0 run to take a 61-55 lead with 6:55 to play.

            “Defensively we ran a bunch of stops together,” McDermott said. ""Then Baylor hit a couple of bombs, which gave us some separation.”

            Scheierman had three second-half 3-pointers and was 5-of-10 from beyond the arc in the game.

            “I thought we played well for 34 minutes, The last 6 minutes we lost our minds,” Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway said. “Stopped doing the little things and stopped being disciplined on offense and defense and it cost us.”

            Dawes had 19 points, Samuel had 11 points and Kadary Richmond added 10 points for Seton Hall.

            Richmond hit a pair of free throws to give Seton Hall its first lead of the game at 16-15 with 13:05 left in the first half. Creighton went on a 7-0 run, taking a 36-29 lead with 3:35 left in the first half. Richmond tied it at 36 just over a minute later. Creighton took a 40-39 lead into the break.

            The game featured 10 lead changes overall.

            BIG PICTURE

            Creighton: Picked to win the Big East and earned its best preseason AP poll ranking in program history at No. 9. After some early season struggles, they have turned things around, are back in the rankings, and have seven straight conference wins. The Bluejays are looking to keep pace with No. 13 Xavier, No. 10 Marquette, No. 20 Providence in the regular season conference title race.

            Seton Hall: After starting 0-3 in the Big East, the Pirates won four straight — including a win over No. 15 UConn — and found themselves in the middle of the pack for the Big East standings. If the Pirates could finish in fifth place, where they are currently tied with UConn, they’d not only get a bye to the Big East Tournament quarterfinals but also be in a good position to make an NCAA Tournament in coach Holloway’s first year. Another signature win would solidify that.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            After getting back into the polls this week, Creighton has a chance to ascend with a big showdown against No. 21 UConn next. A win could vault the Bluejays back into the Top 20 heading into the final month of the regular season.

            The Commodores had struggled for so long with crowds dwindling that the old Memorial Gym magic seemed gone. 

            Not Wednesday night. 











            Tyrin Lawrence knocked down a 3-pointer from the right corner at the buzzer as the Commodores snapped an 11-game skid against their in-state rival by upsetting sixth-ranked Tennessee 66-65 Wednesday night. 

            Stackhouse called Lawrence's shot the biggest of his tenure and maybe his favorite spanning both his own playing career in the NBA and now coaching career. 

            “We finally experienced it, the Memorial Magic we were looking for,"" Stackhouse said. ""Unbelievable game, unbelievable effort. Guys never quit. Didn't look great there for a minute, but we just kept battling.”

            Students rushed the court and joined the Commodores in celebrating easily the program's biggest win in nearly 11 years. Then the Commodores (12-12, 5-6) celebrated by running along the courtside slapping high-fives. 

            Tennessee (19-5, 8-2) had every chance to finish off the win after Olivier Nkamhoua's 15-foot jumper with 50 seconds left put the Vols up 65-63 lead. Liam Robbins missed a turnaround jumper with 27 seconds for Vanderbilt, and Zakai Zeigler grabbed the rebound. 

            Vols freshman Julian Phillips had a chance to dunk in the final seconds but kept dribbling to force another Vanderbilt foul. 

            “I am not sure what was going through his head there,” Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said. “I don't think he will ever make that mistake again.”

            Vanderbilt had to foul five times to finally send Santiago Vescovi to the line with 8 seconds left. 

            He missed the first shot, and Lawrence grabbed the rebound. Stackhouse took a timeout with 4 seconds to go to set up the final play, and Ezra Manjon drove to the basket before passing out to Lawrence in the corner for the winning bucket.

            “It felt great,” said Lawrence, who Stackhouse benched for an ugly loss to No. 4 Alabama last week. “It's the stuff we dream about as kids just in the back yard counting down ‘3, 2, 1.’ Glad I was able to hit the game winner.”

             Lawrence finished with a team-high 19 points. Robbins added 14 and nine rebounds, and Jordan Wright had 12. 

            Vescovi and Tyreke Key each had 14 to lead Tennessee. Olivier Nkamhoua and Julian Phillips added 10 apiece.

            Tennessee led 34-32 at halftime setting up a thrilling finish in a game that featured 15 lead changes and nine ties. 

            BIG PICTURE

            Tennessee was shooting well over 55% before hitting the kind of scoring drought that usually plagues the Vols in their losses. The Vols went 4:27 without a bucket as Vandy scored six straight to stay close. The nation's best 3-point defense, which had been holding opponents to 21.9% shooting outside the arc, also gave up a season-high 10 3s with Lawrence's game-winner the last.

            Vanderbilt improved to 100-259 all-time against Top 25 opponents, and the Commodores improved to 2-3 this season. They now are 4-16 against ranked opponents under Stackhouse. ... Lawrence's game-winning shot was Vandy's first made bucket since the 3:44 mark. 

            
                POLL IMPLICATIONS
              

            The road is turning into a challenging issue for the Volunteers with a second straight loss away from home, and this won't help them stay in the Top 10. 

            DID IT COUNT?

            Stackhouse tapped a play used by Dwane Casey when the Vandy coach worked with him in the NBA in Toronto. Stackhouse added some wrinkles with Manjon driving toward the basket where the Vols collapsed on him before whipping the pass down the baseline to Lawrence. 

            While everyone celebrated the shot, Stackhouse asked the scorekeeper if it counted. They didn't know.

            “Then (official) Tony Greene came over and he said it was good. ‘We’re gonna look at it, but it was good.' I can't contain myself. I hugged Tony Greene,"" Stackhouse said with a big smile.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804748,Tiny California mouse wins Guinness award for longevity,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — A tiny California mouse now has a big title after winning a Guinness World record for longevity.

            A Pacific pocket mouse named Pat — after “Star Trek"" actor Patrick Stewart — received the Guinness approval Wednesday as the oldest living mouse in human care at the ripe age of 9 years and 209 days, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance announced after a certification ceremony.

            Pat was born at the at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park on July 14, 2013, under a conservation breeding program, the alliance said.











            The Pacific pocket mouse, which weighs as much as three pennies, is the smallest mouse species in North America and gets its name from cheek pouches the animals use to carry food and nesting materials, the wildlife alliance said.

            The mouse once had a range stretching from Los Angeles south to the Tijuana River Valley but the population plunged after 1932 because of human encroachment and habitat destruction, the alliance said.

            The mouse was thought to be extinct for 20 years until tiny, isolated populations were rediscovered in 1994 in Dana Point in Orange County but the species remains endangered, the alliance said.

            In 2012, the alliance began a breeding program to help save the mouse from extinction. Last year, the alliance recorded 117 pups born in a record 31 litters. Many of the mice will be reintroduced to the wild this spring, the alliance said.

            A new population of Pacific pocket mice was established in Orange County’s Laguna Coast Wilderness Park and the mice began breeding without human assistance in 2017, the alliance said.

            Though it doesn't receive the publicity of larger and more charismatic species, the Pacific pocket mouse is critical to its ecosystem because the mice disperse the seeds of native plants and their digging encourages plant growth, the alliance said.

            “This recognition is so special for our team, and is significant for the species,” said Debra Shier, who established and oversees the conservation program. “It’s indicative of the dedication and incredible care we as an organization provide for each species, from the largest to the very smallest.”SAN DIEGO (AP) — A tiny California mouse now has a big title after winning a Guinness World record for longevity.A Pacific pocket mouse named Pat — after “Star Trek"" actor Patrick Stewart — received the Guinness approval Wednesday as the oldest living mouse in human care at the ripe age of 9 years and 209 days, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance announced after a certification ceremony.Pat was born at the at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park on July 14, 2013, under a conservation breeding program, the alliance said.The Pacific pocket mouse, which weighs as much as three pennies, is the smallest mouse species in North America and gets its name from cheek pouches the animals use to carry food and nesting materials, the wildlife alliance said.The mouse once had a range stretching from Los Angeles south to the Tijuana River Valley but the population plunged after 1932 because of human encroachment and habitat destruction, the alliance said.The mouse was thought to be extinct for 20 years until tiny, isolated populations were rediscovered in 1994 in Dana Point in Orange County but the species remains endangered, the alliance said.In 2012, the alliance began a breeding program to help save the mouse from extinction.

He made the remark when asked about the progress concerning the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program involving Taiwan, about which he said no further information was available.Kirby reiterated bipartisan support in congress for arming Taiwan, in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and the One-China policy. The U.S. will continue to work with the country to learn about its defense needs and what best suits it, wrote CNA.The official also made a case for reopening military communication channels with China. The issue would have been discussed if Secretary of State Antony Blinken had not canceled his China trip over the recent Chinese spy balloon incident in the U.S.Kirby asserted Washington’s effort to seek competition, rather than conflict, with Beijing. The U.S. does not believe a conflict is unavoidable, stressing there is no reason for one, he added.Congress in December approved a spending bill that includes US$2 billion (NT$60.1 billion) in arms sales loans for Taiwan. However, some Taiwanese officials expressed regret that the aid came in the form of loans rather than grants, according to Defense News.Officials from Taiwan and the U.S. have warned of a possible Taiwan Strait conflict, with some predicting a Chinese invasion in 2025 or 2027.",2023/2/9,1648,Politics

The White Helmets responders group based in Syria's rebel controlled region in the northwest said at least 1,600 people had died.Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his country is working to open two additional border gates to Syria to enable humanitarian aid into the war-torn country.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a donor conference for international aid for Syria and Turkey in the wake of Monday's devastating earthquake has been planned for March.For the first time in 24 years, the Istanbul stock exchange announced that it is closing for five days in response to the earthquake.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the disaster area, acknowledged ""shortcomings"" in his country's response to the huge earthquake.The sanctions-hit Syrian government has put in an official request to the EU for emergency assistance through the civil protection mechanism, the bloc's commissioner for crisis management has said.dh/wd (AFP, dpa)",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804769,"US' Blinken, NATO's Stoltenberg rebuke China over balloon","The US and NATO on Wednesday both criticized China over the network of suspected spy balloons like the one shot down off the eastern coast of the US last week.The White House described the balloon as part of a ""fleet"" that has spanned five continents and said it had been in contact with allies.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg both raised the issue in a joint press conference in Washington D.C. on Wednesday.""We already shared information with dozens of countries around the world, both from Washington and through our embassies,"" Blinken said. ""We're doing so because the United States was not the only target of this broader program, which has violated the sovereignty of countries across five continents.""This comes as teams scramble to recover the debris from the large balloon and its payload off the coast of South Carolina.Blinken said Washington was gaining more information ""almost by the hour"" and that the US would share relevant findings with Congress and allies around the world.NATO's Jens Stoltenberg said following his talks with Blinken that NATO had to be ""vigilant,"" and warned that China was drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, saying ""what happens in Europe today could happen in Asia tomorrow,"" seemingly in reference to Taiwan or other potential Chinese aggression in the region.""The Chinese balloon over the United States confirms a pattern of Chinese behavior where we see that China over the last years has invested heavily in new military capabilities,"" Stoltenberg said.""We've also seen increased Chinese intelligence activities in Europe. They use satellites, they use cyber, and, as we've seen over the United States, also balloons. So we just have to be vigilant,"" he said.China insists that the balloon was merely conducting weather research, but the Pentagon described it as a high-tech spying operation. The balloon floated at an altitude far higher than most airplanes and crossed directly over at least one sensitive US military site.Brigadier General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that the balloon was part of a surveillance operation China had been conducting for ""several years.""Ryder said that when similar balloons passed over US territory on four occasions during the Biden and Trump administrations, the US did not immediately identify them as Chinese surveillance balloons.But he said that ""subsequent intelligence analysis"" allowed the US to confirm it was an espionage operation and learn ""a lot more"" about the program.When pressed about the previous balloons and their flight paths, he would only say that, like the current balloon, ""they were over sites that would be of interest to the Chinese.""Last week, the US had first said it was an unjustified risk to shoot down the balloon when it was over land, citing the danger of falling debris. But the debate continued as it crossed the continent, and the balloon was shot down soon after it floated clear of the eastern coast on Saturday.China at first apologized for the balloon entering US airspace, saying this was unintentional. But it has also said the balloon's intentions were benign. And since it was shot down, Beijing also said it would ""defend its interests"" when sidestepping a question on whether it would demand that the US return any recovered debris.Despite the concerted criticism from US government agencies on Wednesday, Biden has also voiced confidence that the incident should not have a pronounced negative impact on US-Chinese relations. Though he simultaneously struck a more combative tone in his State of the Union address to Congress.""Make no mistake about it: as we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did,"" Biden told Congress.msh/wd (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/2/8,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804773,Georgia Tech beats Notre Dame on Terry's tip-in at buzzer,"ATLANTA (AP) — Lance Terry scored 19 points, the last two on a game-winning tip-in at the buzzer that gave Georgia Tech a 70-68 victory over Notre Dame on Wednesday night.

            With the score tied at 68 with five seconds remaining, the Yellow Jackets' Kyle Sturdivant drove the left side of the lane and missed a step-back jumper along the baseline. Terry, who had inbounded the ball after a timeout, followed down the left side and delivered a two-handed tip-in for the victory that snapped a nine-game losing streak.

            Georgia Tech held Notre Dame to 1-of-11 field goal shooting over the final seven minutes and the Yellow Jackets won despite making only 2 of 8 shots down the stretch.











            There were six ties and three lead changes in the first 12 minutes of the second half, the last tie coming on a layup by Cormac Ryan that made it 54-all with 9:15 remaining. Nate Laszewski and Dane Goodwin followed with 3-pointers to give the Fighting Irish a six-point lead. Georgia Tech kept it close and a layup by Javon Franklin had the Yellow Jackets within 64-62 with 5:27 to go.

            Neither team scored until Georgia Tech's Deebo Coleman hit three free throws for a 65-64 lead with 3:32 remaining.

            Laszewski ended a five-minute field goal drought, making a layup to get Notre Dame within two and later Ryan made two free throws to tie the score at 68 with 1:55 to go. Neither team scored again until Terry's winning play.

            Franklin had 16 points with nine rebounds and his block at the rim kept Notre Dame from taking the lead with 1:15 remaining. Sturdivant added 12 points and Coleman 11 for the Yellow Jackets (9-15, 2-12 ACC).

            All five starters reached double figures in scoring for Notre Dame (10-14, 2-11), which got only two points off the bench. Laszewski had 16 points, Goodwin 14, Ryan 13, Ven-Allen Lubin 13 and Marcus Hammond 10. Goodwin added seven rebounds, four assists and three steals.

            After Ryan hit a 3-pointer to give Notre Dame a 27-24 lead with 5:19 remaining in the first half, Sturdivant and Lance Terry hit 3-pointers to open a 12-2 run that gave Georgia Tech a 36-29 lead. Marcus Hammon and Laszewski then hit 3-pointers to get Notre Dame back within one point, but Georgia Tech held on to lead 38-37 at halftime.

            Georgia Tech beat Notre Dame for just the second time in the past nine meetings.

            Georgia Tech plays at Wake Forest on Saturday and Notre Dame hosts Virginia Tech, also on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804776,"Porzingis makes eight 3s as Wizards beat Hornets, end skid","WASHINGTON (AP) — Kristaps Porzingis scored 36 points and matched a career high with eight 3-pointers, and the Washington Wizards beat the Charlotte Hornets 118-104 on Wednesday night to stop a three-game skid.

            Deni Avdija had 20 points and 13 rebounds and Bradley Beal had 17 points and 10 assists for the Wizards, who broke open a close game in the third quarter and handed the Hornets their fifth straight loss.

            Porzingis scored 18 in the third, including a personal 8-2 run in which he made a 3, blocked a shot attempt by JT Thor and drained another 3. The 7-foot-3 Latvian concluded the burst with a 15-foot jumper to put the Wizards ahead 86-74, their largest lead to that point.











            “A lot of it is in the mind, you know,” Porzingis said. “I just knew that I was going to shoot the ball well. Even after the first half I was like, second half, it's going down.”

            P.J. Washington scored 20 points, Terry Rozier had 19 and LaMelo Ball added 16 for Charlotte, which entered the night only one game clear of the Eastern Conference cellar. The Hornets came in ranked 30th in the NBA in 3-point shooting percentage and went 9 of 31 (29%).

            “We just didn’t come out in the third quarter with the same offensive purpose and energy, and Porzingis obviously got going,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. “We made two mistakes at the end of the first half, which led to two wide-open 3s for him and kind of got him going, which is what happens with a lot of primary scorers.”

            The Wizards took three of four in the season series between the struggling franchises. All three previous games were decided by eight points or fewer, and this one appeared headed in that direction during a first half in which neither team led by double digits. Washington was ahead 32-31 after the first quarter and Avdija's 3 sent the game into halftime tied at 61.

            “I felt like we were playing around a little bit in the beginning and we weren't as aggressive,” Avdija said. “We came second half and we came aggressive, we played together and we weren't playing around. ... We sealed it pretty quickly.”

            Beal, who missed the previous two games with left foot soreness, picked his spots to attack and struggled with his outside shot, but he looked healthy when he drove from the wing midway through the third quarter and elevated over the outstretched arm of Mark Williams for a dunk that put Washington up 72-67.

            “I thought he looked OK,” Wizards coach Wes Unseld Jr. said. “He was good. Defensively, I thought he was excellent. He made huge plays that kind of stemmed the tide in our favor.”

            The Wizards expanded their advantage in the fourth quarter with Porzingis on the bench. He re-entered midway through the period and put the game away when he made his seventh 3 from the top of the key for a 105-82 lead.

            TIP-INS

            Hornets: This is their fourth skid of five games or more this season. ... Clifford identified Porzingis' range as a problem for his team before the game, noting the matchup problems he presents when the Wizards play him at forward with Daniel Gafford at center. “We can beat any team on any given night but we don't have room for error,” Clifford said afterward.

            Wizards: Two starters were out: F Kyle Kuzma missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle and PG Monte Morris sat with back tightness. ... Delon Wright started in Morris' spot and had 10 assists. ... Gafford limped off the court with 10:05 left in the second quarter. He returned to the Wizards’ bench late in the period and re-entered the game early in the third. He finished with 13 points. ... Porzingis had nine rebounds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804777,"Johnson, Matthews lead West Virginia over No. 11 Iowa State","MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia's recent streak of success is starting to make up for a terrible start to the Big 12 schedule. 

            Kedrian Johnson tied a career high with 22 points, and West Virginia held off No. 11 Iowa State 76-71 on Wednesday night.

            The Mountaineers (15-9, 4-7 Big 12) have won five of seven to get their season going in the right direction after they dropped five in a row in January. Three of those recent wins have come over ranked opponents.











            “We dug ourselves a hole, and so we're trying to climb out of it,” coach Bob Huggins said. “I think that's a big part of our competitiveness now. I think that's a big part of why we're playing so much harder than what we played before. We're trying to get out of that hole. And we've made strides. 

            ""Once you get close to getting out of the hole, you sure as heck don't want to fall back in it.”

            Iowa State (16-7, 7-4) missed a chance to climb into a first-place tie with No. 5 Texas, which lost at Kansas on Monday night. 

            The difference Wednesday came at the free throw line, where Iowa State was outscored 26-19.

            “We knew it was going to be a hard, tough game that we don't have very much margin for error,” Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said.

            Iowa State trailed for most of the game. Jaren Holmes made the Cyclones' only field goal in the final five minutes, a bank shot that put Iowa State ahead 71-70 with 1:28 remaining. But Iowa State didn't score again.

            West Virginia’s Joe Toussaint made four free throws over the final 1:07. He also sprinted down court to contest a layup that Iowa State’s Caleb Grill missed on the fast break with 12 seconds left. Toussaint also stepped in front of Holmes and took an offensive charge with 4.5 seconds to go.

            “That was a big play, taking a charge in the end,” Johnson said of Toussaint, an Iowa transfer. “I just think his presence is big for us on the court on the defensive end and on the offensive end.”

            Emmitt Matthews, who had a season-high 20 points for the Mountaineers, made two free throws for the final margin.

            Holmes led the Cyclones with 18 points. Freshman Tamin Lipsey had a season-high 16 points and Grill added 13.

            Coming off a big home win over No. 9 Kansas, Iowa State committed eight early turnovers and trailed by as many as 15 points against the Mountaineers in the first half. 

            STEVENSON HURT

            West Virginia’s Erik Stevenson had to be helped off the court after getting hit in the head late in the first half. When he returned early in the second half, he leaped to save the ball from going out of bounds, was fouled at the other end of the court and made two free throws. Stevenson finished with nine points on 1-of-6 shooting after scoring career highs of 31 and 34 points in his two previous home games. 

            “Seeing Erik go down, he's a big part of our scoring,” Johnson said. ""I feel like some of us needed to step up and help him with that since he was hurt. I think me and Emmitt did that effectively tonight.""

            BIG PICTURE

            Iowa State: The Cyclones have lost five straight games on the road.

            “Every night out, we know how good our league is,” Otzelberger said. ""I felt like we could have been better pressuring the basketball. There was times I would have liked us to have better composure. But at the same time, when you’re going on the road, you have to play your best game.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804809,UConn women lose 2nd straight game for 1st time since 1993,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — UConn coach Geno Auriemma could sense from the start of the night that something was off about his team.

            By the time the evening ended, the Huskies were staring at their first losing streak in three decades, ending one of the most remarkable achievements in college basketball history.

            Chloe Marotta had 19 points and Jordan King added 18 as Marquette defeated UConn 59-52 on Wednesday. The Huskies, who were playing three nights after an 81-77 home loss to No. 1 South Carolina, dropped consecutive games for the first time since March 1993.











            “When people read that stat and they look back, that is a fairy-tale stat,” Auriemma said. “And all fairy tales - they don't always come true - but everything has an end. So this ended here at Marquette.”

            Marquette (16-8, 9-6 Big East) beat UConn (21-4, 13-1) for the first time in 17 meetings. 

            The Golden Eagles had led UConn early in the fourth quarter at home last season before fading down the stretch and losing 72-58.

            This time, the Golden Eagles closed the deal, holding the Huskies to their lowest point total of the season.

            “We came into a huddle and we were at the media timeout in the fourth quarter, and I was like, ‘We were here last year. I'm not watching film on how we lost in the last five minutes,' ” King said. “You have to put 40 minutes of basketball together. For us, I felt we did that.”

            Marquette coach Megan Duffy, who played at Notre Dame from 2002-06, became just the third person ever to beat an Auriemma-coached UConn team as both a player and a coach. The others are South Carolina's Dawn Staley and Villanova's Denise Dillon.

            “In some ways, I'm speechless,” Duffy said. “The next emotion is I'm just incredibly proud of these women and what they did tonight - a historic win for Marquette women's basketball. We knew we were up against a buzzsaw with Connecticut losing on Sunday.”

            Dorka Juhasz led UConn with 15 points. Aubrey Griffin and Lou Lopez Senechal added 12 points each.

            After missing eight of its first nine shots, Marquette went on a 21-2 spurt over an eight-minute stretch to turn an 8-2 deficit into a 23-10 advantage. The Golden Eagles never trailed again, though UConn briefly tied the game in the third quarter.

            King started the momentum shift by scoring 10 straight points on her own, including a pair of 3-pointers. 

            “I think that just completely and totally deflated us,” Auriemma said. “After the week that we've had - after the 10 days, two weeks, whatever - we just, I think mentally, all of us ... I think we just checked out. It was a major struggle because they were so locked in, their team, in what they wanted to do.” 

            UConn tied the game at 31 on an Aaliyah Edwards basket with 6:10 left in the period. Marquette regained the lead 21 seconds later on Marotta’s 3-pointer and carried a 39-38 edge into the final quarter.

            Marquette gradually built the lead in the final period and got ahead 51-44 on a Marotta jumper with 1:35 left. UConn made its last charge by cutting the margin to 51-47 on a Juhasz 3-pointer with 1:20 remaining.

            After Marquette initially struggled to get the ball inbounds and had to call a timeout, the Golden Eagles beat the press and got the ball to Emily La Chapell for a layup with 1:15 remaining.

            That started a 6-0 run that put the game out of reach.

            “I said this to them in the locker room,” Auriemma said. “I don't know if it was residue from Sunday, whether something in practice yesterday, something on the trip over, but there was a collective something different about today.”

            BIG PICTURE

            UConn: Even after the Huskies dug themselves such a deep hole in the first half, UConn had reason to believe it could put this game away by dominating the fourth quarter, just as it had in last season’s game at Marquette. It didn’t happen. Azzi Fudd, who scored 24 points and sparked that fourth-quarter surge in last season’s game at Marquette, hasn’t played since injuring her right knee Jan. 15 against Georgetown. 

            Marquette: The Golden Eagles are on the NCAA Tournament bubble, so this game was huge for their postseason hopes. Marquette now must make sure it doesn’t have any letdowns the rest of the season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804810,"Adebayo scores 38, Heat hold off sliding Pacers 116-111","MIAMI (AP) — Bam Adebayo entered this season wanting more shots. The Miami Heat gave him those opportunities, and are thrilled at how it's working out.

            Miami's All-Star center tied his season high with 38 points, Jimmy Butler added 25 and the Heat held off the Indiana Pacers 116-111 on Wednesday night to snap a two-game slide.

            Adebayo was 12 of 16 from the field, 14 of 14 from the foul line.











            “Bam, obviously, was really good on both ends of the court,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.

            Gabe Vincent had 17, Tyler Herro scored 15 and Caleb Martin finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Heat, who snapped a two-game slide.

            Buddy Hield scored 29 points for Indiana, which has lost 13 of its last 15 games. Myles Turner had 23 points and 11 rebounds, while T.J. McConnell scored 18.

            Tyrese Haliburton had 10 assists for the Pacers, but a Heat defense led by Butler held him to 11 points — 32 fewer than he scored in a win at Miami on Dec. 23. His 3-pointer with 10.5 seconds left got Indiana within three, but Adebayo sealed it with a pair of free throws.

            “Miami has a deserved, an earned reputation as a hard-playing team, a team that always responds to previous losses,"" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.

            The Heat and Pacers split the four-game regular-season series. And just like the first three, this one went right down to the end. The combined score of the season series entering Wednesday was Pacers 294, Heat 294; now, it's Heat 410, Pacers 405, none of the games this season decided by more than five points.

            It was Adebayo's 10th 30-point game of the season, matching the total of all other Heat players combined — Butler has five, Herro four and Max Strus has one.

            “He's found a great balance,"" Butler said. “If you've got the hot hand, you've got to keep feeding that individual. And a lot of nights, it's Bam. You've got to ride that wave sometimes.""

            He's the sixth player in Heat history to have at least 10 games of 30 or more in the same season, and nobody had done it since LeBron James — now the NBA's career scoring leader — had 31 such games for Miami in 2013-14.

            “The work speaks for itself,"" Adebayo said.

            TIP-INS

            Pacers: Including playoffs, it was the 1,996th NBA game for Carlisle — 1,796 as a coach, and 200 more he got into as a player. No. 2,000 would be next Wednesday against Chicago, Indiana’s final game before the All-Star break. ... Andrew Nembhard scored 10 for Indiana.

            Heat: Miami had a season-low nine bench points. ... PG Kyle Lowry missed his second consecutive game with left knee soreness, and the Heat expect him to miss at least two more. ... Jazz Chisholm of the Miami Marlins was among those in the crowd, getting a Heat jersey as a gift during a third-quarter timeout – followed by a hug and handshake from Hield, a fellow Bahamian.

            BIG HALF

            McConnell had 16 points in the first half, the second-most points he’s ever had by halftime in his career. He had 25 by halftime against Milwaukee on Jan. 16, finishing that game with a career-high 29 — one of only four 20-point games for him in the NBA. Including playoffs, McConnell averaged 5.5 points in 33 games against Miami entering Wednesday.

            MUST-SEE TV

            As would be expected, Spoelstra was tuned in Tuesday night to watch James pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and become the leading scorer in NBA history. “I rarely stay up for those late games — but that was must-see TV,” Spoelstra said. “It’s so historic for him to be able to do that. And for Kareem to be in the building, that’s one of those amazing NBA moments.”

            Keldon Johnson scored 22 points, Josh Richardson had 14 and Doug McDermott 13 for San Antonio, which has not won since Jan. 17 against Brooklyn. Former Raptor Jakob Poeltl scored 12 points and Keita Bates-Diop had 10.

            It’s the second time this season the Spurs have lost at least 10 straight. They had a season-worst 11-game slump between Nov. 14 and Dec. 4.

            San Antonio made 16 turnovers, leading to 22 points for Toronto. The Spurs made 18 turnovers in Monday’s loss at Chicago.

            “When you turn it over against Toronto, it’s like a bucket at the other end with their speed and their athleticism,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “They got too many points off our turnovers, but that’s how they play. That’s one of their strengths.”

            Poeltl, who was close friends with Siakam when they both played in Toronto, said his old pal did a good job of picking his spots against the Spurs.

            “He made tough shots tonight,” Poeltl said. “I felt like at times we played really good defense on him, he just made better shots. Hats off to him.”

            Siakam shot 7 for 7 and scored 18 points in the first quarter, his season high for any quarter, as Toronto led 34-24 after one.

            San Antonio rallied in the second, but the Raptors held a 57-54 lead at the half.

            Siakam scored nine points in the third, and VanVleet and Trent each had six, as Toronto took an 88-75 edge to the fourth.

            Spurs: F Jeremy Sochan (sore lower back) and G Tre Jones (sore left foot) each sat for the third consecutive game. ... San Antonio is 5-20 on the road.

Toronto played at home for the first time since a Jan. 22 win over the Knicks. The Raptors went 4-3 on a season-high seven-game road trip in between.

            TRADING PLACES?

            With the NBA trade deadline set for 3 p.m. ET Thursday, VanVleet said he expects the Raptors (26-30) to be fielding calls from contending teams.

            “We’ve got a lot of good players on a team that’s not winning,” Vanleet said. “That’s pretty much it. We haven’t played up to our standard this year, so we put ourselves in this position. Now we’ve got to deal with it. We understand there’s going to be probably every team in the league calling. We’ve got a lot of guys that a lot of teams would want, and we’re not in a great situation.”

            UNHAPPY NEW YEAR

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804817,"Sasser scores 25, No. 2 Houston beats Tulsa 80-42","HOUSTON (AP) — Marcus Sasser scored 25 points and had five 3-pointers, Emanuel Sharp added 13 points and No. 2 Houston routed Tulsa 80-42 on Wednesday night for their fifth straight win.

            Sasser scored 19 points on 8 of 13 shooting in the first half as the Cougars (23-2, 11-1 American Athletic Conference) built a 46-18 halftime lead. The senior guard had the first 12 points in a 24-2 run that gave Houston a 31-12 lead with six minutes remaining in the first half.

            “Marcus plays the right way,” Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. “We give our kids freedom to make plays, but the caveat is to make the right play.”











            Houston shot 46%, including 13 of 35 on 3-pointers. The Cougars outrebounded Tulsa 53-27 and owned a 31-4 advantage in bench points. 

            “Reggie (Chaney), Ja’Vier (Francis), Terrance (Arceneaux) and Emanuel, that’s our bench,” Sampson said. “All four are good players. All four contribute and impact winning for us. Not every night. Last time I checked, they bleed and they breathe, so they are going to make mistakes, but I like the fact they are getting better.”

            Houston also beat Tulsa 89-50 on Dec. 28. After playing three games in six days, Houston now gets eight days off – their longest stretch of the season without a game.

            “We’ve only lost two games, we probably should have lost some more,” Sampson said. “We’re lucky to only have two losses. Teams don’t usually go 23-2, but again, losses never really bother me that much. Just like I don’t get overly carried away with wins. I do know the pulse of this team, and the thing this team really needs right now is rest.”

            Tim Dalger scored 13 points, and Sam Griffin added 11 points for Tulsa (5-18, 1-11).

            “We played an elite basketball team tonight,” Tulsa coach Eric Konkol said. “They’re absolutely a national title contender. 

            “I thought we did some nice things early. I thought our guys were prepared, and they were ready and came out with some good energy and execution, but it’s hard to withstand against a team like Houston. They've just got so many different weapons. They do it on both ends of the floor.”

            The Golden Hurricane has lost five straight and fell to 0-9 on the road this season. Tulsa struggled from the field shooting 28% and making 4 of 29 on 3-pointers.

            BIG PICTURE

            Tulsa: The Golden Hurricane’s last win over a team ranked in the top three was an 84-77 victory over No. 3 Louisville on Feb. 8, 1975. … Tulsa started the game 5 of 10 from the field and ended the first half 2 of 18 as Houston went on the game-deciding run.

            Houston: The Cougars have won four straight games over Tulsa. … Houston improved to 10-0 in Quad 4 games. … Houston dished out 21 assists on 31 field goals, led by Jamal Shead, who had 12 assists.

            HE SAID IT

            “We got a great lesson in what elite basketball looks like on both ends of the floor. I don’t think their sharing of the basketball gets enough notoriety. They share it extremely well. Shead with 12 assists. There’s some things we look at and say ‘Hey, let’s try to do some of these things better, and this is how it’s done.'” – Konkol on lessons learned from playing Houston.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804820,"Celtics lose Jaylen Brown, hold on to beat Sixers 106-99","BOSTON (AP) — The NBA-leading Boston Celtics scrounged enough out of their bench to keep the Philadelphia 76ers at bay in the Eastern Conference playoff race. 

            With three of the Celtics' regular starters out — and Jaylen Brown soon to join them — Malcolm Brogdon and Derrick White scored 19 points apiece to lead Boston to a 106-99 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night.

            Brown, who missed the previous game with a non-COVID illness, left the game after colliding with Jayson Tatum under the basket when they were both going for an offensive rebound. 











            Brown appeared to take Tatum’s elbow in the left side of his head. He went to the floor and was slow to get up; when he did, he went straight to the locker room, rubbing his left eye and temple. 

            The team announced at the start of the third quarter that he had a facial contusion and would not return. After the game, coach Joe Mazzulla said he had no more information, but Brogdon said Brown appeared to be in pain when he left. 

            “I called him but he didn't answer,” Mazzulla said. “But I'll get that ASAP. I hope he's OK.”

            Tatum had 12 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games to add to the NBA’s best record (39-16). The 76ers (34-19) are second in the Atlantic Division and third in the Eastern Conference, having lost both matchups with the Celtics this season.

            “Boston has beaten us twice, and Boston won the East last year. Boston is the best team in the East. I said that before,” Sixers coach Doc Rivers said. “It’s our job to prove that wrong. But we have a lot of time to do that.”

            Joel Embiid scored 28 points and James Harden added 26 points and 11 assists for the Sixers, who lost their second game in a row. They had won nine of their previous 11.

            Marcus Smart, Robert Williams III and Al Horford all missed the game with injuries. Blake Griffin got the start and hit five 3-pointers for a season-high 15 points, and Grant Williams scored 15 points and added eight rebounds.

            In all, the Boston bench outscored Philadelphia's 31-21, with three other usual second-stringers contributing 49 points from the starting lineup. The Celtics made 19 of 35 from 3-point range. 

            “I could have made some of those 3s,” Rivers told reporters. “Well, maybe not me. I was a poor shooter. But someone in this room could have made those 3s.”

            CATCHING UP

            The Celtics led 98-87 midway through the fourth quarter before Matisse Thybulle and Harden hit back-to-back 3-pointers to key an 8-0 run. But Boston scored on an inbounds pass from White to Luke Kornet with 0.5 seconds to make it 100-95 with about three minutes left.

            “I really didn’t think we played with the right spirit the entire game,” Rivers said. “They scored with .5 on the clock. I just thought our defensive discipline was poor. And when you play that way you don’t deserve to win.” 

            White then hit a 3-pointer the next time down. It was a six-point game with under two minutes when Embiid put up a fadeaway from the foul line that missed everything and went out of bounds. It was first ruled Celtics ball, the referees overruled themselves and awarded it to the Sixers, then the Celtics challenged; the replay showed Grant Williams got a piece of Embiid's hand, not the ball. 

            Boston didn’t capitalize on that possession but, after Embiid missed a 3, Tatum drove for a floater that made it 105-97 with 37 seconds left.

            TIP-INS

            The Celtics were without Al Horford (swollen right knee), Robert Williams III (sprained left ankle) and Marcus Smart (sprained right ankle). The No. 9 Duke women’s basketball team attended the game, a night before they are scheduled to play Boston College. Duke coach Kara Lawson spent 2020 as a Celtics assistant. … Griffin’s season-highs had been three 3-pointers made and 13 points. ... Embiid picked up a technical foul in the second quarter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804858,AP source: Lakers trading Westbrook to Utah in 3-team swap,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles Lakers are trading Russell Westbrook to Utah and reacquiring guard D'Angelo Russell from Minnesota in a three-team, eight-player deal, a person with knowledge of the trade told The Associated Press on Wednesday night.

            The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn't announced the major deal made ahead of the NBA's trade deadline Thursday.

            Los Angeles is also getting guard Malik Beasley and forward Jarred Vanderbilt from the Jazz, bolstering its core around LeBron James in a bid to jump-start its sputtering season. The Lakers fell to 25-30 on Tuesday while James set the NBA's career scoring record, and they sit in 13th place in the 15-team Western Conference.











            The Lakers are sending Juan Toscano-Anderson, Damian Jones and their first-round pick in 2027 to Utah with Westbrook.

            ESPN and The Athletic first reported the trade. Those outlets also said Minnesota is getting Mike Conley and Nickeil Alexander-Walker from Utah, along with three second-round picks.

            Minnesota won 143-118 at Utah on Wednesday night, and all five players involved in the trade weren't in uniform. Most players and coaches couldn't speak directly about a trade that hadn't been announced, but Minnesota coach Chris Finch acknowledged the challenge of playing short-handed amid roster upheaval.

            “We just talked briefly about things before taking the floor,"" Finch said. “It’s unfortunate timing. You don’t ever get to pick your timing. But maybe in some ways it was good that we could just play a game and not have to overthink things.”

            Westbrook's tenure with his hometown team lasted just 130 tumultuous games. The 2017 NBA MVP never thrived with James and injury-plagued Anthony Davis for any significant stretch of time, struggling to mold his possession-heavy game into a more complementary role.

            A move to the bench last fall led to minor improvements over a dismal 2021-22 season, but Westbrook still appeared profoundly uncomfortable with the Lakers, who are in danger of missing the playoffs for the second straight year. Westbrook averaged 17.4 points, 7.2 assists, 6.9 rebounds and 3.7 turnovers per game during his time in Los Angeles, where fans grumbled regularly about his poor shooting and turnovers.

            The 34-year-old Westbrook is making about $47 million in the final year of his contract. Several months after the Lakers infuriated a large portion of their worldwide fan base by not trading Westbrook in the summer, they swapped him for Russell, who played his first two NBA seasons with the Lakers after they chose him with the second overall pick in the 2015 draft.

            Russell was a rookie during Kobe Bryant’s final season, and the point guard was the most consistently entertaining part of two poor Lakers teams before Magic Johnson traded him to Brooklyn in 2017. Russell is now being traded for the fourth time in his eight NBA seasons.

            Russell is averaging 17.9 points, 6.2 assists and 3.1 rebounds while hitting a career-best 46.5% of his shots with Minnesota in the final year of a contract paying him more than $31 million this season. His style on both ends of the court also could complement James and Davis better than Westbrook, although the Lakers will have little time to figure it out.

            The Timberwolves courted Russell hard when he was on the market in July 2019, when Brooklyn ultimately landed on a sign-and-trade deal that sent Kevin Durant to the Nets and shipped Russell to Golden State. The Wolves eventually acquired Russell at the deadline in Feb. 2020 and teamed him with his draft-class pal, Karl-Anthony Towns.

            The Russell-Towns pairing never really took off, in part because of injuries for each player that often kept them from being on the court at the same time. The Wolves drafted Anthony Edwards with the first overall pick in 2020, integrating another high-impact offensive player into the lineup whose value is minimized without frequent touches.

            The Wolves made the playoffs in 2022, but only recently have Russell and Edwards truly clicked after coach Chris Finch made Edwards the primary ball-handler and moved Russell into an off-ball position to better maximize his shooting ability.

            Russell is shooting a career-best 39.1% from 3-point range, having made five or more shots from deep in six of his last 17 games.

            Conley is more of a pure distribute-first point guard than Russell, who has never been a tenacious perimeter defender, either. The 35-year-old Conley is averaging 10.7 points and 7.7 assists in his fourth season with Utah.

            Utah's Jordan Clarkson said it was “super-hard to say goodbye” to Conley after four years together. 

            “That guy was like Yoda, honestly,” Clarkson said. “He had so many stories, and he had such an enlightenment about him. You just listened to him. ... He can communicate with anyone.”

            Conley will reunite with big man Rudy Gobert, whose transition to Minnesota has been slow. Conley and Gobert meshed well with the Jazz, and their collective experience in the playoffs ought to also help a Wolves team that has been remarkably inconsistent this season while trying to keep up in the crowded race.

            There’ll be an even bigger Minnesota reunion on the Lakers, with Vanderbilt and Beasley going to LA where Patrick Beverley already plays — although Beverley is showing up in numerous trade rumors himself in the final hours before the deadline. All four of those players helped the Timberwolves get the No. 7 seed for the playoffs last season before Vanderbilt, Beasley and Beverley were traded to the Jazz in the Gobert deal.

            Beasley is a strong outside shooter, averaging 13.4 points while hitting 35.9% of his 3-pointers for the Jazz. The 6-foot-9 Vanderbilt has averaged 8.3 points and 7.9 rebounds per game, excelling on defense and on the boards while starting 41 of his 52 games.

            The Lakers began their roster overhaul last month by trading Kendrick Nunn to Washington for Rui Hachimura, who is fitting in well so far as a wing option. Los Angeles also took a swing at acquiring Kyrie Irving, but Brooklyn sent the controversial guard to Dallas.

            Toscano-Anderson and Jones played almost no role after joining the Lakers in the offseason.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles Lakers are trading Russell Westbrook to Utah and reacquiring guard D'Angelo Russell from Minnesota in a three-team, eight-player deal, a person with knowledge of the trade told The Associated Press on Wednesday night.The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn't announced the major deal made ahead of the NBA's trade deadline Thursday.Los Angeles is also getting guard Malik Beasley and forward Jarred Vanderbilt from the Jazz, bolstering its core around LeBron James in a bid to jump-start its sputtering season. The Lakers fell to 25-30 on Tuesday while James set the NBA's career scoring record, and they sit in 13th place in the 15-team Western Conference.The Lakers are sending Juan Toscano-Anderson, Damian Jones and their first-round pick in 2027 to Utah with Westbrook.ESPN and The Athletic first reported the trade. Those outlets also said Minnesota is getting Mike Conley and Nickeil Alexander-Walker from Utah, along with three second-round picks.Minnesota won 143-118 at Utah on Wednesday night, and all five players involved in the trade weren't in uniform. Most players and coaches couldn't speak directly about a trade that hadn't been announced, but Minnesota coach Chris Finch acknowledged the challenge of playing short-handed amid roster upheaval.“We just talked briefly about things before taking the floor,"" Finch said. “It’s unfortunate timing. You don’t ever get to pick your timing. But maybe in some ways it was good that we could just play a game and not have to overthink things.”Westbrook's tenure with his hometown team lasted just 130 tumultuous games. The 2017 NBA MVP never thrived with James and injury-plagued Anthony Davis for any significant stretch of time, struggling to mold his possession-heavy game into a more complementary role.A move to the bench last fall led to minor improvements over a dismal 2021-22 season, but Westbrook still appeared profoundly uncomfortable with the Lakers, who are in danger of missing the playoffs for the second straight year. Westbrook averaged 17.4 points, 7.2 assists, 6.9 rebounds and 3.7 turnovers per game during his time in Los Angeles, where fans grumbled regularly about his poor shooting and turnovers.The 34-year-old Westbrook is making about $47 million in the final year of his contract. Several months after the Lakers infuriated a large portion of their worldwide fan base by not trading Westbrook in the summer, they swapped him for Russell, who played his first two NBA seasons with the Lakers after they chose him with the second overall pick in the 2015 draft.Russell was a rookie during Kobe Bryant’s final season, and the point guard was the most consistently entertaining part of two poor Lakers teams before Magic Johnson traded him to Brooklyn in 2017. Russell is now being traded for the fourth time in his eight NBA seasons.Russell is averaging 17.9 points, 6.2 assists and 3.1 rebounds while hitting a career-best 46.5% of his shots with Minnesota in the final year of a contract paying him more than $31 million this season. His style on both ends of the court also could complement James and Davis better than Westbrook, although the Lakers will have little time to figure it out.The Timberwolves courted Russell hard when he was on the market in July 2019, when Brooklyn ultimately landed on a sign-and-trade deal that sent Kevin Durant to the Nets and shipped Russell to Golden State. The Wolves eventually acquired Russell at the deadline in Feb. 2020 and teamed him with his draft-class pal, Karl-Anthony Towns.The Russell-Towns pairing never really took off, in part because of injuries for each player that often kept them from being on the court at the same time. The Wolves drafted Anthony Edwards with the first overall pick in 2020, integrating another high-impact offensive player into the lineup whose value is minimized without frequent touches.The Wolves made the playoffs in 2022, but only recently have Russell and Edwards truly clicked after coach Chris Finch made Edwards the primary ball-handler and moved Russell into an off-ball position to better maximize his shooting ability.Russell is shooting a career-best 39.1% from 3-point range, having made five or more shots from deep in six of his last 17 games.Conley is more of a pure distribute-first point guard than Russell, who has never been a tenacious perimeter defender, either. The 35-year-old Conley is averaging 10.7 points and 7.7 assists in his fourth season with Utah.Utah's Jordan Clarkson said it was “super-hard to say goodbye” to Conley after four years together.“That guy was like Yoda, honestly,” Clarkson said. “He had so many stories, and he had such an enlightenment about him.

            Devin Carter and Ed Croswell had 12 points apiece as the Friars (18-6, 10-3 Big East) won for the fourth time in five games. Noah Locke added 11 points, shooting 3 of 5 from 3-point range.

            Bradley Ezewiro paced last-place Georgetown (6-19, 1-13) with 19 points and Primo Spears added 18. Brandon Murray scored 16 as the Hoyas dropped their fourth straight. 











            “That’s a very hard team to play against,” Providence coach Ed Cooley said. “Winning is very hard, but I think our players continue to get better. I was very proud of our effort.” 

            Providence threatened to pull away several times. Locke hit a 3 to make it 54-37, but the Hoyas were within 58-51 with eight minutes left. Another surge by the Friars featuring 3s from Locke and Hopkins helped them maintain a double-digit lead down the stretch. 

            “In our timeouts we talked about staying confident … wanting to get three stops in a row,” Carter said. “We all bought into playing defense towards the end of the game and it definitely helped us stop Georgetown from going on a run.”

            “They’re probably one of the most physical teams we have in our conference,” Hoyas coach Patrick Ewing said. “Ed has done an outstanding job of getting them to buy in to the way that he wants to play. They have some older guys who have been around and they play together.”

            “We wanted to play faster all year,” Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. “Typically that allows you in the second periods with the long change if you can play fast to catch teams, and I think we did that tonight.”

            Joel Eriksson Ek scored on a power play to get Minnesota within 3-1 late in the second, and the Wild had Ryan Hartman's goal just 30 seconds later called off for goalie interference against Jordan Greenway. Minnesota has lost five consecutive road games in regulation.

            “We get a positive situation, score a goal at the end of the second period, (Greenway is) going to the net, trying to do all the right things, takes a route and the goalie just happens to be there,” Wild coach Dean Evason said. “It's the right call, but we need a break like that to go our way.”

            Hintz added an empty-netter for his 22nd of the season with 2:11 remaining, and Jake Oettinger made 38 saves for Dallas. Jason Robertson had two assists.

            “Timely saves, and at the same time, I thought we defended well in front of him,” DeBoer said. “He was Jake. You just get used to that. You've got to make a real good, too perfect shot to beat him because he's always in position.”

            The Stars' second consecutive victory stopped a four-game run of games going to extra time, which Dallas finished with a 1-0-3 record in a quartet of games decided by 3-2 scores. Three overtime losses started the strange stretch, followed by a shootout victory in Benn's 1,000th game. 

            They were all part of Dallas' season-high eight-game homestand. The Stars, who last played on the road Jan. 19, have two games left on the homestand.

            “It's a nice feeling when you don't have to go to OT or a shootout for sure,” Hakanpaa said. “I think the boys in here had enough of that.”

            Faska had a chance for a second goal when Greenway was called for hooking on a breakaway with six minutes remaining, but Filip Gustavsson easily stopped the penalty shot. Gustavsson had 33 saves.

            After a scoreless first period in which Minnesota had several strong scoring chances early, Johnston waited with the puck at the blue line as Benn skated in. Johnston hit Benn in stride, and the 33-year-old faked Gustavsson on the goalie's left side and beat him on the right.

            “I think adjusting to the pace of the game is a big thing,” Johnston said after a 10th assist to go with 13 goals that were tied for second among rookies to start the night. “Just kind of learning with that what kind of space and time you’ll have in situations. And kind of finding where space is open on the ice.”

            Faksa had the simple task of redirecting the puck into an open net on the pass from Seguin, as did Minnesota's Eriksson Ek on a feed from All-Star Kirill Kaprizov after Miro Heiskanen was called for cross-checking Kaprizov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804878,UN eyes revival of millets as global grain uncertainty grows,"RUSHINGA, Zimbabwe (AP) — While others in her Zimbabwean village agonize over a maize crop seemingly headed for failure, Jestina Nyamukunguvengu picks up a hoe and slices through the soil of her fields that are lush green with a pearl millet crop in the African country's arid Rushinga district.

            “These crops don’t get affected by drought, they are quick to flower, and that’s the only way we can beat the drought,” the 59-year old said, smiling broadly. Millets, including sorghum, now take up over two hectares of her land — a patch where maize was once the crop of choice. 

            Farmers like Nyamukunguvengu in the developing world are on the front lines of a project proposed by India that has led the U.N.’s Food and Agricultural Organization to christen 2023 as “The Year of Millets,” an effort to revive a hardy and healthy crop that has been cultivated for millennia — but was largely elbowed aside by European colonists who favored corn, wheat and other grains.











            The designation is timely: Last year, drought swept across much of eastern Africa; war between Russia and Ukraine upended supplies and raised the prices of foodstuffs and fertilizer from Europe's breadbasket; worries surged about environmental fallout of cross-globe shipments of farm products; many chefs and consumers are looking to diversify diets at a time of excessively standardized fare. 

            All that has given a new impetus to locally-grown and alternative grains and other staples like millets.

            Millets come in multiple varieties, such as finger millet, fonio, sorghum, and teff, which is used in the spongy injera bread familiar to fans of Ethiopian cuisine. Proponents tout millets for their healthiness — they can be rich in proteins, potassium, and vitamin B — and most varieties are gluten-free. And they're versatile: useful in everything from bread, cereal and couscous to pudding and even beer.

            Over centuries, millets have been cultivated around the world — in places like Japan, Europe, the Americas and Australia — but their epicenters have traditionally been India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa, said Fen Beed, team leader at FAO for rural and urban crop and mechanization systems.

            Many countries realized they ""should go back and look at what’s indigenous to their agricultural heritage and what could be revisited as a potential substitute for what would otherwise be imported — which is at risk when we had the likes of pandemic, or when we have the likes of conflict,” said Beed.

            Millets are more tolerant of poor soils, drought and harsh growing conditions, and can easily adapt to different environments without high levels of fertilizer and pesticide. They don't need nearly as much water as other grains, making them ideal for places like Africa's arid Sahel region, and their deep roots of varieties like fonio can help mitigate desertification, the process that transforms fertile soil into desert, often because of drought or deforestation.

            “Fonio is nicknamed the Lazy Farmers crop. That’s how easy it is to grow,"" says Pierre Thiam, executive chef and co-founder of New York-based fine-casual food chain Teranga, which features West African cuisine. “When the first rain comes, the farmers only have to go out and just like throw the seeds of fonio ... They barely till the soil.""

            “And it’s a fast growing crop, too: It can mature in two months,” he said, acknowledging it's not all easy: ""Processing fonio is very difficult. You have to remove the skin before it becomes edible.”

            Millets account for less than 3% of the global grain trade, according to FAO. But cultivation is growing in some arid zones. In Rushinga district, land under millets almost tripled over the past decade. The U.N.'s World Food Programme deployed dozens of threshing machines and gave seed packs and training to 63,000 small-scale farmers in drought-prone areas in the previous season. 

            Low rainfall and high temperatures in recent years in part due to climate change, coupled with poor soils, have doused interest in water-guzzling maize. 

            “You'll find the ones who grew maize are the ones who are seeking food assistance, those who have grown sorghum or pearl millet are still eating their small grains,” said Melody Tsoriyo, the district’s agronomist, alluding to small grains like millets, whose seeds can be as fine as sand. “We anticipate that in five years to come, small grains will overtake maize.” 

            Government teams in Zimbabwe have fanned out to remote rural regions, inspecting crops and providing expert assistance such as through WhatsApp groups to spread technical knowledge to farmers.

            WFP spokesman Tatenda Macheka said millets “are helping us reduce food insecurity” in Zimbabwe, where about a quarter of people in the country of 15 million — long a breadbasket of southern Africa — are now food insecure, meaning that they're not sure where their next meal will come from.

            In urban areas of Zimbabwe and well beyond, restaurants and hotels are riding the newfound impression that a millet meal offers a tinge of class, and have made it pricier fare on their menus.

            Thiam, the U.S.-based chef, recalled eating fonio as a kid in Senegal's southern Casamance region, but fretted that it wasn't often available in his hometown — the capital — let alone New York. He admitted once “naively"" having dreams making what's known in rural Senegal as “the grain of royalty” — served to honor visiting guests — into a “world class crop.”

            He's pared back those ambitions a bit, but still sees a future for the small grains.

            “It’s really amazing that you can have a grain like this that’s been ignored for so long,"" Thiam said in an interview from his home in El Cerrito, Calif., where he moved to be close to his wife and her family. ""It’s about time that we integrate it into our diet.”

            The eight-time All-Star was traded to the Mavs on Sunday from the Brooklyn Nets. He was part of a 13-0 spurt early in the game, scoring eight points on a jumper and back-to-back 3-pointers.

            Irving had four rebounds and five assists in 37 minutes of what amounted to a dress rehearsal before injured Luka Doncic returns to give the Mavs a powerhouse backcourt. 











            Reggie Bullock scored 15 of his 18 points in the first quarter against his former team. All five Dallas starters reached double figures.

            Norman Powell had 24 points for the Clippers.

            BOSTON (AP) — With three of Boston’s regular starters out — and Jaylen Brown soon to join them — Malcolm Brogdon and Derrick White scored 19 points apiece to lead the Celtics over Philadelphia.

            Jayson Tatum had 12 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games to improve the NBA’s best record (39-16). The 76ers (34-19) are second in the Atlantic Division and third in the Eastern Conference, having lost both matchups with the Celtics this season. 

            Joel Embiid scored 28 points and James Harden added 26 points and 11 assists for the Sixers, who lost their second in a row. They had won nine of their previous 11. 

            Marcus Smart, Robert Williams III and Al Horford all missed the game with injuries. Blake Griffin got the start and hit five 3-pointers for a season-high 15 points, and Grant Williams had 15 points and eight rebounds. 

            Brown, who missed the previous game with an illness, exited after colliding with Tatum under the basket when they were both going for an offensive rebound. 

            Brown appeared to take Tatum’s elbow in the left side of his head. The team announced at the start of the third quarter that he had a facial contusion and would not return.

            Buddy Hield scored 29 points for the Pacers, who have lost 13 of 15. Myles Turner had 23 points and 11 rebounds.

            Tyrese Haliburton had 10 assists for the Pacers, but was held to 11 points — 32 fewer than he scored at Miami on Dec. 23. His 3-pointer with 10.5 seconds left got Indiana within three, but Adebayo sealed it with two free throws.

            CAVALIERS 113, PISTONS 85

            CLEVELAND (AP) — Jarrett Allen scored 20 points, Evan Mobley added 19 and Cleveland topped Detroit for its fourth straight victory despite resting its starting backcourt.

            All-Star starter Donovan Mitchell (groin) and Darius Garland (thumb) got the night off to heal some nagging injuries, but the Cavaliers barely missed their top guards.

            With Allen and Mobley doing inside damage and combining for 21 points, Cleveland built an 18-point lead after one quarter. The Pistons hung around and got within two in the third before the Cavs opened the fourth by outscoring Detroit 26-4 over the first seven minutes to put it away.

            Allen added 14 rebounds as the Cavs outrebounded the Pistons 48-32 and held them to their lowest point total this season.

            Bojan Bogdanovic scored 15 points for Detroit. The Pistons have dropped nine of 11 and have the worst record (14-42) in the Eastern Conference.

            HOUSTON (AP) — De’Aaron Fox scored 31 points, including three free throws with less than a second left, to lift Sacramento over Houston.

            Fox was fouled by Eric Gordon on a 3-point attempt with 0.3 seconds to play, setting up the game-winning free throws. Fox, who also had 11 assists, made consecutive baskets to get the Kings within one with 42.2 seconds to go. 

            Jalen Green scored 41 points and Alperen Sengun finished with 18 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds as the Rockets dropped their fourth straight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804880,"Miller scores 24, No. 3 Alabama races past Florida 97-69","TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — With freshman star Brandon Miller leading the way, Alabama is now off to its best Southeastern Conference start in nearly seven decades.

            Miller scored 24 points and made 4 of 8 3-pointers to lead No. 3 Alabama to a 97-69 victory over Florida on Wednesday night for the program's best SEC start since the 1955-56 team went 14-0 in league games.

            The Crimson Tide (21-3, 11-0) raced to a 29-point halftime lead against the Gators (13-11, 6-5), who had knocked off then-No. 2 Tennessee a week earlier. 











            Alabama also matched the 1975-76 team for the program's best record through 24 games.

            “It’s great. They’ve had a lot of really good teams here,” Tide coach Nate Oats said. “I don't even know who was in the SEC back in 55-56, but it's a good league now.

            ""We’re just trying to play good basketball. I think we played pretty well tonight. It’s nice to make some history around here.”

            Miller added nine rebounds and three assists for the Tide. Mark Sears made 4 of 6 3s and scored 19 for Alabama, which buried 15 shots from long range. Jahvon Quinerly had 11 points and five assists.

            Colin Castleton led Florida with 29 points and 10 rebounds. He accounted for 13 of his team's 23 in the first half and made 11 of 14 free throws. Riley Kugel added 15 points and Will Richard scored 11.

            It was a rough way to end a four-game stretch that included three Top 5 opponents and a visit to Kentucky's Rupp Arena.

            “A really challenging time for us,” Florida coach Todd Golden said. ""A lot of fatigue both physically and mentally. We thought after beating Tennessee last week and then having a close emotional loss on Saturday (against Kentucky) that this was going to be a challenging game for us.

            “And we just didn't play well enough. I thought Alabama looked fresh. Obviously they respect us in the way they approached the game and they played a really good game.”

            Alabama built a 52-23 halftime lead on a combination of scorching 3-point shooting, and the Gators' own shooting woes. The Tide made 9 of 17 3s by halftime while Florida missed its five attempts.

            Alabama started the rout with a 23-4 run that included Quinerly's eight points and the team's four 3s.

            Miller hit 3 of 4 3s in the first half, including a pair in the final three minutes. 

            It was a hot start for a team coming off a more lackluster 79-69 win over LSU.

            “We weren’t happy with our game at LSU,” Oats said. “I think guys understood we’ve got to play better. It wasn’t who we were. Two out of our last three games, we haven’t played hard enough, long enough.”

            The Gators got as close as 17 in the second half but Miller answered with eight points in less than two minutes: a 3-pointer, a one-handed dunk and a basket and subsequent foul shot.

            “Coach called a time out and we just regrouped as a team and got our energy back right together,” Sears said.

            CLOWNEY FACE

            Alabama's Noah Clowney left the court in the middle of the second half and didn't return. Oats said it was a facial injury, not a concussion and Clowney shouldn't miss a game.

            BIG PICTURE

            Florida: Has faced four different top 5 teams for the first time in program history, going 2-2. Castleton tied Al Horford (2004-07) for third place in career blocks at Florida with his 188th and 189th.

            Alabama: Made 15 of 34 3-pointers (44%) against a defense that came in allowing opponents to hit only 29%. Has won its first 11 SEC games for only the second time.

            Alexis Lafreniere and Mika Zibanejad also scored for the Rangers, who have won four straight and 11 of the last 14 at home. K'Andre Miller had three assists and Jacob Trouba added two, and Igor Shesterkin had 22 saves. 

            “We’re at our best when we keep things simple,″ said Miller, who recorded the first three-point game of his career with assists on the first three goals. “The puck found me tonight and the guys made some great plays.”











            Conor Garland, Vasily Podkolzin and Elias Pettersson had goals for the Canucks. Quinn Hughes had two assists and Spencer Martin finished with 17 saves.

            New York is 18-4-3 since Dec. 5 while spiraling Vancouver is 4-12-1 since Dec. 27. 

            Kreider opened the scoring with his 21st goal at 6:53 of the opening period, converting a pass from Vincent Trocheck past Martin. It was Kreider's 21st of the season and 250th of his career — tying him with Mark Messier for seventh place on the franchise's all-time list. 

            Chytil made it 2-0 at 8:31 with his career-best 19th and his seventh during a five-game scoring streak. He has 11 goals and four assists in his last 13 games. 

            “I love scoring goals, it's a great feeling,'' Chytil said. ”And it's a great feeling that I'm helping the team get points. We're playing good hockey right now. We have to keep doing the things we are doing.""

            “We're finding ways to win,'' Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said. ”Tonight was a see-saw battle. There was nothing easy tonight.""

            Podkolzin made it 3-2 with his first of the season with 3:54 left in the middle period.

            India pressed home its advantage to reach 77-1 at stumps, with Rohit Sharma 56 not out.

            Australia openers Usman Khawaja and David Warner were gone within the first 13 deliveries. Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith fashioned an 82-run respite but the last five wickets went for 15 runs in 10.5 overs.











            India made a rollicking start, with the pacemen making the ball swing, even if there wasn’t enough bounce in the Nagpur deck.

            Mohammed Siraj trapped Khawaja low on the pad in front of leg stump with his first delivery in the second over, and the original not out decision was overturned on review.

            Mohammed Shami started the third over with a delivery between Warner's bat and pad that sent the off stump cartwheeling, and Australia was 2-2.

            Spin was introduced in the seventh over courtesy of Jadeja then Axar Patel. Veteran Ravichandran Ashwin entered the attack late in the first session but gave away runs at a faster clip.

            Labuschagne and Smith negated then spin with clever footwork and were rarely troubled in getting Australia to lunch on 76-2.

            After lunch, India got on top quickly. Jadeja made the breakthrough when Labuschagne was stumped by Srikar Bharat for 49 runs off 123 balls.

            Jadeja trapped Matt Renshaw for a duck off the next ball, and when he Jadeja bowled Smith for 37 off 107 balls with an arm-ball that held its line, Australia crashed from 84-2 to 109-5 in the space of 6.2 overs.

            Peter Handscomb and Alex Carey combined for 53 runs for the sixth wicket, then Ashwin sparked up before tea. Ashwin bowled the adventurous Carey for 36 runs, and earned his 450th wicket in his 89th test.

            Captain Pat Cummins was caught cheaply off Ashwin, too.

            Australia was 174-8 at tea with Jadeja striking either side of the break. Todd Murphy fell for a five-ball duck on debut, and Handscomb was out in similar fashion on 31.

            On his test return after seven months out, Jadeja’s 11th five-wicket haul was his fourth against Australia.

            “I played test cricket after a long time and it is tough,” Jadeja said. ""I worked hard on my fitness. I bowled nearly 10-12 hours daily at the NCA (National Cricket Academy) to regain my rhythm for this series. I also played first-class cricket. I knew I had to bowl long spells.” 

            Ashwin bowled Scott Boland for 1 to complete the rout.

            India openers Sharma and Lokesh Rahul defied the Australia's bowling to complete the hosts’ dominance on day one of the four-test series.

            Sharma hit nine fours and a six to reach his half-century off 66 balls.

            Rahul scratched around for 20 runs off 71 balls before a simple return catch gave offspinner Murphy his maiden test wicket. With 13 balls remaining, Ashwin came out to be the nightwatchman.

            Both teams made changes to their lineups for the start of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

            Australia dropped in-form batter Travis Head, bringing back Handscomb into the middle order after all the attention on the pitch preparation and the perception it will disadvantage left-handed batters.

            India handed test debuts to Bharat and Suryakumar Yadav. Bharat replaced wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant, who was recovering from injuries in a car crash. Yadav replaced the injured Shreyas Iyer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804885,Reporter arrested during news event on Ohio train derailment,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — A reporter was pushed to the ground, handcuffed and arrested for trespassing while covering a news conference about the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals in Ohio.

            NewsNation posted video of correspondent Evan Lambert being arrested Wednesday in the gymnasium of an elementary school in East Palestine where Gov. Mike DeWine was giving an update about the accident.

            Lambert was held for about five hours before being released from jail, NewsNation reported.











            “I’m doing fine right now. It’s been an extremely long day,” Lambert said after his release. “No journalist expects to be arrested when you’re doing your job, and I think that’s really important that that doesn’t happen in our country.”

            At the end of his news conference, DeWine said he didn't authorize the arrest and reporters have “every right"" to report during briefings.

            “If someone was stopped from doing that, or told they could not do that, that was wrong,” DeWine said.

            A following statement from the governor's office said DeWine didn't see the incident because a bank of cameras blocked his view but he did hear a “disagreement toward the back of the gymnasium."" 

            DeWine “has always respected the media’s right to report live before, during, and after his press briefings"" the statement said. 

            Mike Viqueira, NewsNation’s Washington Bureau chief, called the arrest an infuriating violation of the First Amendment.

            The Washington, D.C.-based Lambert could still face charges of disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, NewsNation said.

            The Columbiana County Sheriff's Office administration said the arrest was made by officers from the East Palestine Police Department. A message seeking comment from the department was not immediately returned.

            About 50 train cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash Friday night on the edge of East Palestine. Federal investigators say a mechanical issue with a rail car axle caused the derailment.

            Nearby residents in Ohio and neighboring Pennsylvania were ordered to evacuate when authorities decided on Monday to release and burn chemicals from five tankers filled with vinyl chloride, sending hydrogen chloride and the toxic gas phosgene into the air. 

            At the news conference, authorities said sampling had shown air quality in the area was safe and residents could return home, although DeWine said some residents may want to wait until the air inside their homes is checked. 

            The news conference started more than two hours late and DeWine started speaking at the same instant Lambert had to do a live broadcast from the back of the gym, Preston Swigart, a photographer who was with Lambert, told NewsNation.

            Swigart said police officers approached Lambert and asked him to stop talking. Lambert finished the live report but was then asked to leave by authorities, who tried to forcibly remove him from the event, NewsNation reported.

            “From their standpoint, he didn’t obey orders,” Swigart said. “Gymnasiums are echoey and loud and sound kind of carries, so I’m guessing that they just didn’t like the fact that there was sound competing with the governor speaking, even though it was all the way at the other end of the room.”

            The anchor handling the report said she heard the reporter saying, “The governor has just started speaking. I'm being told that I have to quit my report"" before it was cut short.

            Video captured by NewsNation affiliate WKBN-TV showed Lambert on his face on the ground being handcuffed. He was then taken outside and placed in the back of a sheriff's patrol car.EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — A reporter was pushed to the ground, handcuffed and arrested for trespassing while covering a news conference about the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals in Ohio.NewsNation posted video of correspondent Evan Lambert being arrested Wednesday in the gymnasium of an elementary school in East Palestine where Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804886,Fox's late FTs gives Kings 130-128 win over Rockets,"HOUSTON (AP) — De’Aaron Fox had 31 points, including three free throws with less than a second left, to lift the Sacramento Kings to a 130-128 win over the Houston Rockets on Wednesday night. 

            Fox missed a 3-pointer with .3 seconds left. But Eric Gordon fouled him to set up the game-winning free throws. 

            “I don't want to belittle it because he was he was amazing, but at the end of the day that’s what he gets paid to do,” coach Mike Brown said. “He’s an All-Star. He’s one of our best players and he’s got to be able to make plays for us when we need him to, especially on the road and that’s what he did.”











            Fox, who added 11 assists, made consecutive baskets to get the Kings within 1 with 42.2 seconds to go. 

            Jalen Green missed a shot on the other end before the Kings missed three straight shots but grabbed the rebound each time. Keegan Murray got the last rebound but Kenyon Martin Jr. battled with him, and a jump ball was called. Houston got the ball on the jump ball with 2.4 seconds to go. 

            Gordon was fouled after that, but Malik Monk stole the inbound pass from Alperen Sengun to give the Kings the ball with 1.2 seconds left. They called a timeout to set up the final sequence. 

            “We just have to be able to gut it out on the road,” Fox said. “Some times it's going to be ugly. This was an ugly game for us. We know we have to be better defensively.” 

            Green had 41 points and Sengun finished with 18 points, a career-high 11 assists and nine rebounds as the Rockets dropped their fourth straight. 

            Rockets coach Stephen Silas was disappointed that his team let this one get away after his team played much better than it did in a loss to the Kings on Monday night. 

            “We played with much more conviction, physicality, ball pressure, all those things,” he said. “We should have won that game.”

            Domantas Sabonis added 22 points with nine rebounds for the Kings and Monk added 17 points. 

            Green made an off-balance 3 as he was fouled and crashed to the court with just more than two minutes left to put Houston up 124-123. Harrison Barnes was called for a foul on the play, but the Kings challenged the call, and it was overturned. 

            Green, the second overall pick in the 2021 draft, then scored four points to extend the lead to 128-123 with less than 90 seconds left. 

            Sabonis made a layup to get the Kings within four with about seven minutes left in the third. But he picked up his fifth foul seconds later and headed to the bench for the rest of the quarter.

            The Kings scored five points, with a 3 from Monk, to take a four-point lead late in third. However, Houston ended the quarter with a 4-2 spurt to cut the lead to 99-97 entering the fourth. 

            Houston used a 6-1 run to take a 112-107 lead with eight minutes to go. The Kings then scored the next seven points, with a 3-point play by Harrison Barnes and four points from Fox, to go on top 114-112 a minute later.

            Jae’Sean Tate hit a layup for the Rockets to tie it with less than five minutes to go. But a 7-2 run by the Kings, highlighted by a 3 from Murray, gave them a 121-116 lead with 3 1/2 minutes left. 

            A 5-0 spurt by the Rockets tied it after that before a layup by Sabonis put the Kings on top 123-121.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804926,"Auriemma says he was criticizing officials, not Gamecocks","MILWAUKEE (AP) — UConn coach Geno Auriemma says his postgame comments regarding physical play in the Huskies’ loss to top-ranked South Carolina were directed at the officiating and resembled remarks he’s made throughout his career.

            Auriemma said after the top-ranked Gamecocks’ 81-77 victory on Sunday that Huskies guard/forward Lou Lopez Senechal had bruises on her body from the game. South Carolina coach Dawn Staley responded on her radio show Tuesday by saying when her team has success, “we’re called something other than players that are locked in.”

            “I don’t know whether Dawn was referring to me specifically or whether this has been happening to her team for quite some time now,” Auriemma said Wednesday after the fourth-ranked Huskies’ 59-52 loss at Marquette. “If people have been paying attention, seriously, I’ve been making that statement for 20-some years, since Diana (Taurasi) was playing for us.”











            Auriemma noted he made similar comments after UConn’s wins over Villanova and Providence as well as during his courtside interview with ESPN’s Holly Rowe at halftime of the Huskies’ victory at Tennessee.

            “In each one of those instances, everything I said was directed squarely at the officials,” Auriemma said. “And not one other coach said a word. You have a right to coach your team any way you want. I have enough trouble coaching my own team. But I can have a say in how officials call the game. And if rules are supposed to be the rules as they’re interpreted to me, then they’ve got to be called according to the rules. 

            “If I’m never allowed to question an official about their calls and criticize them for the way they officiate a game, without someone thinking I’m casting (aspersions) toward their team, that’s just asinine. If you’ve been paying attention, I’ve been saying it for 20 years.”

            After the South Carolina game, Auriemma had referred to Senechal’s bruises and said that “it’s just appalling what teams do to her now.” Auriemma added that, “it’s not basketball anymore. I don’t know what it is, but it’s not basketball.”

            Staley responded Tuesday by saying that the Gamecocks “play the right way and approach it the right way whether they win or lose.”

            “We’ve been called so many things and I’m sick of it,” Staley said. “I’m sick of it because I coach some of the best human beings the game has ever had.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804927,T'wolves top Jazz in matchup of teams trading with Lakers,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Anthony Edwards scored 31 points and Jaylen Nowell added a career-high 30 to lead Minnesota to a 143-118 win over Utah on Wednesday night amid word the Timberwolves, Jazz and Los Angeles Lakers were part of an eight-player swap hours ahead of the NBA trade deadline.

            “It was crazy, the last six hours,” Edwards said. “But, I mean, we’re here to play basketball at the end of the day. We can’t really feed into that — we have nothing to do with that. (My teammates) did a great job of staying locked in and they kept me locked in.”

            Playing loose, the Timberwolves set a season high with 79 points in the first half and led 107-80 midway through the third quarter, helped by 64% shooting from the field and 61% from 3-point range.











            While not speaking directly about a trade that hadn’t been announced, Minnesota coach Chris Finch detailed the difficulty if playing while the roster was in flux.

            “We just talked briefly about things before taking the floor. These things, it’s unfortunate timing, you don’t ever get to pick your timing. Maybe in some ways, it was good that we could just play a game and not have to overthink things. But guys were ready,” Finch said.

            Luka Garza scored a career-high 25 points and the Timberwolves made 23 3-pointers at a 54% shooting clip, tying their highest output of the season.

            “It was definitely strange,” Garza said of the deal happening just before the game. “But I don’t want to ever look back in my time in NBA and be like, I didn’t make the most of what was my childhood dream.”

            The three-team trade was confirmed to The Associated Press on Wednesday night by a person with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn’t announced the major deal made ahead of Thursday afternoon’s trade deadline.

            In the deal, the Timberwolves sent D’Angelo Russell to the Lakers, where he played his first two NBA seasons from 2015-17. Utah shipped Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Mike Conley to Minnesota and dealt Jarred Vanderbilt and Malik Beasley to the Lakers. The Jazz received Russell Westbrook, Juan Toscano-Anderson and Damian Jones from the Lakers, as well as a first-round draft pick in 2027.

            The Jazz were short-handed in the game without four players who have logged significant minutes this season, as the teams were just shells of their former selves.

            The Timberwolves were also missing a host of regulars as Rudy Gobert (groin), Kyle Anderson (back) and Austin Rivers (suspension) were held out, and Karl-Anthony Towns is still sidelined with a right calf strain.

            Lauri Markkanen scored 21 points and Collin Sexton had 20 in Utah’s worst home loss of the season. Their worst road loss of the season was a 26-point defeat to Milwaukee on Dec. 17.

            “Credit to Minnesota, they made a lot of shots and we missed a lot of make-able shots,” Utah coach Will Hardy said of his team making just 31 of 65 shots in the paint. “They made 23 3s at 54% and that was too hard for us to overcome.”

            This Jazz have assembled a formidable collection of draft capital, including key pieces from Minnesota in last summer’s Gobert deal.

            Utah has 15 unprotected or lightly protected first-round picks to use through 2029, along with a talented under-25 group of Markkanen, Walker Kessler, Sexton and Ochai Agbaji and more than $60 million under the salary cap if they buy out Westbrook, as expected.

            Conley was Utah’s only true point guard – and one of the last holdovers from the Donovan Mitchell and Gobert era. Now, Sexton will have the opportunity to prove he can be an effective starting playmaker on a winning team.

            Meanwhile, the Timberwolves will see if they can thrive with a veteran, pass-first point guard like Conley, who is averaging a career high 7.7 assists this season.

            Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson said they have something special coming their way in Conley.

            “He’s a leader, great point guard and a guy that makes everybody’s life easier on the court,” Clarkson said. “That guy was like Yoda, honestly. He had so many stories and he had such an enlightenment about him. You just listened to him. … He can communicate with anyone.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804931,"George and Flagler lead No. 14 Baylor over Oklahoma, 82-72","WACO, Texas (AP) — Baylor big man Jonathan Tchamwa Tchatchoua really worked on that outside shot during the nearly full year he was recovering from a devastating knee injury. 

            Now he's becoming a 3-point threat like all those high-scoring Bears guards. 

            
                Keyonte George had 23 points, Adam Flagler scored 20 and “Everyday Jon” made a couple of key 3-pointers for his only points as 14th-ranked Baylor extended its lead down the stretch for an 82-72 win over Oklahoma on Wednesday night. 











            “When he sets a screen and he pops, it’s just different,” Sooners coach Porter Moser said of Tchamwa Tchatchoua.

            
                Flagler scored 14 points in the final 13:11 of the game, the first of those being a jumper that put Baylor back ahead to stay. 

            Not long after that, and Oklahoma's only lead of the second half, Tchamwa Tchatchoua hit his first 3-pointer. The 6-foot-8 forward also made two 3s on Saturday in his first game since last Feb. 12, when he tore multiple ligaments in his left knee. 

            “He just brings a whole new type of energy,” said redshirt freshman Langston Love, who missed last season with a torn ACL and spent plenty of time rehabbing with the big man. ”His vibe is just different for us and I feel like that’s what we needed at this point in the season.""

            Love added 19 points for the Bears (18-6, 7-4 Big 12), who have won eight of nine overall since losing their first three league games. The two-time defending conference champions are within a game of first-place No. 5 Texas in the league standings. 

            “Y’all hear it all the time, but we just focus on controlling what we can control,” said George, the true freshman who had his 10th 20-point game. “That’s playing hard, finding each other, running the floor, playing defense, and those are things you can control.”

            The Sooners (12-12, 2-9) lost their sixth consecutive conference game, the last three since a still-hard-to-explain 93-69 win over then-No. 2 Alabama in the Big 12/SEC Challenge. They were coming off a 93-61 loss at West Virginia last weekend. 

            Grant Sherfield had 15 points, including four 3-pointers, and Milos Uzan scored 11. 

            Oklahoma had its only lead past the opening minute of the game when Tanner Groves regathered the ball after being blocked by Tchamwa Tchatchoua and scored on a putback that made it 48-47 with 13:52 left. That capped a 10-2 run, when Joe Bamisile also had a putback of his own missed shot. 

            Baylor went back ahead to stay on the jumper by Flagler before Tchamwa Tchatchoua hit from 3 after Jalen Bridges and Flagler missed from beyond the arc on the same possession. Tchamwa Tchatchoua and Flagler later made consecutive 3s.

            FOOT ISSUES

            LJ Cryer had seven points for Baylor while playing 15 minutes before halftime, but didn't play in the second half. Bears coach Scott Drew said it was a foot issue, but didn't think it was related to the offseason foot surgery the 6-foot-1 junior guard had after missing 15 games last season. 

            QUICK MAKES

            Baylor hit on its first shot within the opening 30 seconds for the eighth consecutive game, and it was the fourth in a row when that first make was a 3-pointer. Cryer made the first basket for the fourth time in that stretch. 

            BIG PICTURE

            Oklahoma had won 30 in a row against Baylor until 2009, but the Bears have won 19 of 30 meetings since. That includes the last 11 regular-season matchups. 

            Baylor seems to be rediscovering its shooting touch. The Bears shot 46.6% (27 of 58) from the field with nine 3-pointers, after shooting a season-high 53.8% (35 of 65) with 10 3s on Saturday against Texas Tech. That followed four consecutive games at 37.1% or worse.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804961,Fiery Ohio derailment raises railroad safety questions,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The fiery derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals — sending a huge plume of smoke in the air and forcing residents of a small Ohio town to evacuate — has highlighted the potentially disastrous consequences of train accidents and raised questions about railroad safety.

            The railroad industry is generally regarded as the safest option for most goods and federal data show accidents involving hazardous materials are exceedingly rare. But with rails crossing through the heart of nearly every city and town nationwide, even one hazardous materials accident could be disastrous, especially in a populated area. 

            Rail unions believe the industry has gotten riskier in recent years after widespread job cuts left workers spread thin.











            “It raises all kinds of questions,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told “Fox & Friends” this week when he was asked whether hazardous materials are too dangerous to transport by rail. 

            “We’ve seen it up close and personal the last few days,"" DeWine said. ""This is a big, big deal.”

            About half of the 4,800 residents in the eastern Ohio town of East Palestine and those in the surrounding area, including parts of Pennsylvania, had to evacuate as officials monitored air and water quality following a controlled burn of chemicals released from damaged tank cars. The evacuation order was lifted Wednesday after the air was deemed safe. 

            “ I’m scared to go back home, ” resident Brittany Dailey had said Monday. “I’m eventually going to have to go back, but it makes me want to sell my house and move at this point.” 

            Ian Jefferies, head of the Association of American Railroads trade group, said 99.9% of all hazardous materials shipments reach their destinations safely. 

            Federal Railroad Administration data showed hazardous chemicals were released during 11 train accidents nationwide last year, out of roughly 535 million miles (861 million kilometers), with only two injuries reported. In the past decade, releases of hazardous materials peaked at 20 in both 2018 and 2020. 

            “Railroads are the safest form of moving goods across land in the country without question,” Jefferies said. “But railroads are also working to drive toward zero incidents. Until we reach that goal, we haven’t got to where we want to be.”

            Railroads try to route hazardous materials shipments on the safest path. Most of the worst derailments in recent years happened in rural areas, but in 2013 a derailment in Canada killed 47 people in the town of Lac Megantic and caused millions of dollars in damage. A 2005 derailment in Graniteville, South Carolina, killed nine people and injured more than 250 after toxic chlorine gases were released.

            Hazardous materials account for about 7-8% of the 30 million shipments that railroads deliver across the country every year. But because of the way railroads mix freight together, at least a couple cars of hazardous materials can be found on nearly any train besides grain or coal trains.

            “Railroads are a very safe form of transportation from a standpoint of statistics,” said professor David Clarke, who previously led the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Tennessee. ""That doesn’t mean that you’re never going to have an accident. That would be unrealistic for any type of transportation to have zero accidents”

            Some say that's not enough. An East Palestine business owner and two other residents sued the rail operator in federal court on Tuesday, alleging negligence. Among other things, the lawsuit says the railroad failed to maintain and inspect its tracks and rail cars, failed to provide appropriate employee training, and failed to reasonably warn the public.

            Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department coalition, said he worries the chances of a catastrophic derailment are increasing because major freight railroads have eliminated roughly one-third of their workers over the past six years. Companies have shifted to running fewer, longer trains and say they don't need as many crews, mechanics and locomotives.

            Before those operating changes, Regan said inspectors used to have about two minutes to inspect every railcar. Now they only get roughly 30 to 45 seconds to check each car. Signalmen who maintain crossing guards and safety signals along the tracks also have bigger territories, making it harder to keep up with preventative maintenance.

            “They’re really just trying to squeeze as much productivity out of these workers as they can,"" Regan said. ""And when you’re focused on timing and rushing, unfortunately sometimes things can fall through the cracks.”

            Government accident data shows an uptick in accidents in recent years, although the numbers remain quite small at 8,929 last year. Accidents were tallied at a rate of 17.4 per million train miles (17.4 per 1.6 million train kilometers) in 2019, but that drops to 2.9 accidents per million train miles without incidents at railroad crossings and those involving trespassers that are largely out of railroads’ control.

            Regulators at the Federal Railroad Administration say the accident data so far does not show the industry's new operating model is unsafe. But unions say the new system is risky.

            “There isn’t a lot of room for error,” Regan said. ""And certainly when you have hazmat on trains all across the country going through communities, we shouldn’t be making any compromises on safety whatsoever.”

            Professor Allan Zarembski, who leads the University of Delaware's Rail Engineering and Safety Program, said railroads are continually working to improve safety and prevent derailments. 

            Railroads are developing new acoustic detectors being placed along tracks to signal if a bearing is about to fail. Heat sensors also have been in place for years to spot overheating bearings, which is one of the most common causes of an axle failure, Zarembski said. 

            Federal investigators have said the Norfolk Southern train crew received a warning about a mechanical problem shortly before an axle failed and caused the Ohio derailment.

            Railroads and the shipping companies that own tank cars also have been steadily improving them to reduce the chances they will rupture in a derailment. The walls and shields protecting cars have been thickened, more insulation has been added between the walls of those cars and the release valves are better protected to reduce the possibility they will be torn open in a crash.

            Railroads also invest about $24 billion per year in maintaining and improving tracks to help prevent problems.

            Associated Press reporter Kantele Franko in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report.OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The fiery derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals — sending a huge plume of smoke in the air and forcing residents of a small Ohio town to evacuate — has highlighted the potentially disastrous consequences of train accidents and raised questions about railroad safety.The railroad industry is generally regarded as the safest option for most goods and federal data show accidents involving hazardous materials are exceedingly rare. But with rails crossing through the heart of nearly every city and town nationwide, even one hazardous materials accident could be disastrous, especially in a populated area.Rail unions believe the industry has gotten riskier in recent years after widespread job cuts left workers spread thin.“It raises all kinds of questions,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told “Fox & Friends” this week when he was asked whether hazardous materials are too dangerous to transport by rail.“We’ve seen it up close and personal the last few days,"" DeWine said. ""This is a big, big deal.”About half of the 4,800 residents in the eastern Ohio town of East Palestine and those in the surrounding area, including parts of Pennsylvania, had to evacuate as officials monitored air and water quality following a controlled burn of chemicals released from damaged tank cars. The evacuation order was lifted Wednesday after the air was deemed safe.“ I’m scared to go back home, ” resident Brittany Dailey had said Monday. “I’m eventually going to have to go back, but it makes me want to sell my house and move at this point.”Ian Jefferies, head of the Association of American Railroads trade group, said 99.9% of all hazardous materials shipments reach their destinations safely.Federal Railroad Administration data showed hazardous chemicals were released during 11 train accidents nationwide last year, out of roughly 535 million miles (861 million kilometers), with only two injuries reported. In the past decade, releases of hazardous materials peaked at 20 in both 2018 and 2020.“Railroads are the safest form of moving goods across land in the country without question,” Jefferies said. “But railroads are also working to drive toward zero incidents. Until we reach that goal, we haven’t got to where we want to be.”Railroads try to route hazardous materials shipments on the safest path. Most of the worst derailments in recent years happened in rural areas, but in 2013 a derailment in Canada killed 47 people in the town of Lac Megantic and caused millions of dollars in damage. A 2005 derailment in Graniteville, South Carolina, killed nine people and injured more than 250 after toxic chlorine gases were released.Hazardous materials account for about 7-8% of the 30 million shipments that railroads deliver across the country every year. But because of the way railroads mix freight together, at least a couple cars of hazardous materials can be found on nearly any train besides grain or coal trains.“Railroads are a very safe form of transportation from a standpoint of statistics,” said professor David Clarke, who previously led the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Tennessee. ""That doesn’t mean that you’re never going to have an accident. That would be unrealistic for any type of transportation to have zero accidents”Some say that's not enough. An East Palestine business owner and two other residents sued the rail operator in federal court on Tuesday, alleging negligence. Among other things, the lawsuit says the railroad failed to maintain and inspect its tracks and rail cars, failed to provide appropriate employee training, and failed to reasonably warn the public.Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department coalition, said he worries the chances of a catastrophic derailment are increasing because major freight railroads have eliminated roughly one-third of their workers over the past six years. Companies have shifted to running fewer, longer trains and say they don't need as many crews, mechanics and locomotives.Before those operating changes, Regan said inspectors used to have about two minutes to inspect every railcar. Now they only get roughly 30 to 45 seconds to check each car. Signalmen who maintain crossing guards and safety signals along the tracks also have bigger territories, making it harder to keep up with preventative maintenance.“They’re really just trying to squeeze as much productivity out of these workers as they can,"" Regan said. ""And when you’re focused on timing and rushing, unfortunately sometimes things can fall through the cracks.”Government accident data shows an uptick in accidents in recent years, although the numbers remain quite small at 8,929 last year. Accidents were tallied at a rate of 17.4 per million train miles (17.4 per 1.6 million train kilometers) in 2019, but that drops to 2.9 accidents per million train miles without incidents at railroad crossings and those involving trespassers that are largely out of railroads’ control.Regulators at the Federal Railroad Administration say the accident data so far does not show the industry's new operating model is unsafe. But unions say the new system is risky.“There isn’t a lot of room for error,” Regan said. ""And certainly when you have hazmat on trains all across the country going through communities, we shouldn’t be making any compromises on safety whatsoever.”Professor Allan Zarembski, who leads the University of Delaware's Rail Engineering and Safety Program, said railroads are continually working to improve safety and prevent derailments.Railroads are developing new acoustic detectors being placed along tracks to signal if a bearing is about to fail. Heat sensors also have been in place for years to spot overheating bearings, which is one of the most common causes of an axle failure, Zarembski said.Federal investigators have said the Norfolk Southern train crew received a warning about a mechanical problem shortly before an axle failed and caused the Ohio derailment.Railroads and the shipping companies that own tank cars also have been steadily improving them to reduce the chances they will rupture in a derailment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804962,Biden's oil comments spark debate over energy production,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden sparked a firestorm in energy circles when he said in Tuesday's State of the Union address that the United States will need oil “for at least another decade.″

            Republicans in the House chamber laughed in derision at Biden's off-the-cuff remark, which was not in his scripted speech. GOP lawmakers accused the Democratic president of refusing to accept reality and ""living in a green hallucination,'' as Montana Sen. Steve Daines put it.

            ""President Biden implied tonight America would not produce oil beyond the next decade. If you believe that, you have missed a lot and live in a dream world. God help America,'' Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a tweet.











            But environmentalists and some Democrats supported Biden, saying the U.S. needs a plan to wean itself off oil and other fossil fuels — the sooner, the better.

            “I think the president is right,'' said Collin Rees, a senior campaigner for the green group Oil Change International. “We can't continue to pretend we're reducing (greenhouse gas) emissions without addressing oil production, and that means phasing out fossil fuels.''

            “If we’re going to save our future, we need a transition away from dirty, expensive and deadly fossil fuels, and we need to be speeding up — not slowing down,” added Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.

            Biden made the comment as he touted a landmark law to slow climate change. The law he signed last year — supported only by Democrats — authorizes hundreds of billions of dollars to boost renewable energy such as wind and solar power and help consumers buy electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.

            The law is a key part of Biden's ambitious bid to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Most experts say the net-zero goal is unlikely to be fully achieved even under the most optimistic scenarios.

            Phasing out oil within a decade is virtually impossible, said energy analyst Kevin Book.

            “I think the White House may want to workshop the ad-libs” before Biden speaks, Book joked Wednesday, adding that no serious analyst believes oil can be completely phased out in a matter of years.

            ""We rely on oil and gas for 85 to 90 percent of transportation energy,'' he said. Electric vehicles, while growing in popularity, represent less than 6% of new U.S. car sales. 

            Even the U.S. government agrees that oil and gas will likely be needed for decades to come. The Energy Information Administration, a statistical and research arm of the Energy Department, projects that U.S. energy consumption will increase over the next 30 years as population and economic growth outpace energy efficiency gains.

            Petroleum and natural gas are likely to remain the nation's largest energy sources through 2050, the EIA said in a report last year, even as renewable energy such as wind and solar power are the fastest growing.

            The White House said Biden's comments were in line with statements he and other administration officials have made previously — namely that the U.S. is in the midst of an energy transition and will continue to need oil.

            ""Let’s be very clear that fossil fuels will remain in the mix of the energy system of the globe for years to come,'' Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a 2022 remark cited by the White House.

            Ironically, Biden's comment came as he tried to reassure critics that he recognizes the need for continued oil production. “We’re still going to need oil and gas for a while,'' Biden said, before adding the 10-year time frame in a later, ad-libbed remark.

            After GOP lawmakers laughed, Biden quickly responded: ""And beyond that. We're going to need it.''

            Biden's message to the oil industry — “Stay in business, we need you today"" — was the right one, ""but his units were off,'' Book said. ""He was giving a 10-year life expectancy to 50-year assets.''

            Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said Biden “could have used his #SOTU address to unite America. Instead, he has again criticized American businesses that employ millions of Americans, pay taxes and provide energy for the world. U.S. oil and natural gas producers, transporters and refiners deserve better.'' 

            Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, said expanding oil and gas production and extending the life-span of fossil fuel infrastructure such as refineries “would only exacerbate the climate crisis while further padding the profits of the very same companies President Biden rightfully decried'' in the State of the Union.

            ""What we need is doubling down on our investments to equitably transition off of the fuels of the past and to clean energy,'' Jealous said.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden sparked a firestorm in energy circles when he said in Tuesday's State of the Union address that the United States will need oil “for at least another decade.″Republicans in the House chamber laughed in derision at Biden's off-the-cuff remark, which was not in his scripted speech.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804963,Rescuers push to find survivors of 'disaster of the century',"KAHRAMANMARAS, Turkey (AP) — Rescue workers made a final push Thursday to find survivors of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria that rendered many communities unrecognizable to their inhabitants and led the Turkish president to declare it “the disaster of the century."" The death toll topped 20,000.

            The earthquake affected an area that is home to 13.5 million people in Turkey and an unknown number in Syria and stretches farther than the distance from London to Paris or Boston to Philadelphia. Even with an army of people taking part in the rescue effort, crews had to pick and choose where to help.

            The scene from the air showed the scope of devastation, with entire neighborhoods of high-rises reduced to twisted metal, pulverized concrete and exposed wires.











            In Adiyaman, Associated Press journalists saw someone plead with rescuers to look through the rubble of a building where relatives were trapped. They refused, saying no one was alive there and that they had to prioritize areas with possible survivors.

            A man who gave his name only as Ahmet out of fear of government retribution later asked the AP: “How can I go home and sleep? My brother is there. He may still be alive.”

            The death toll from Monday’s 7.8 magnitude catastrophe rose to nearly 21,000, eclipsing the more than 18,400 who died in the 2011 earthquake off Fukushima, Japan, that triggered a tsunami and the estimated 18,000 people who died in a temblor near Istanbul in 1999.

            The new figure, which is certain to rise, included over 17,600 people in Turkey and more than 3,300 in civil war-torn Syria. Tens of thousands were also injured.

            Even though experts say people could survive for a week or more, the chances of finding survivors in the freezing temperatures were dimming. As emergency crews and panicked relatives dug through the rubble — and occasionally found people alive — the focus began to shift to demolishing dangerously unstable structures.

            The DHA news agency broadcast the rescue of a 10-year-old in Antakya. The agency said medics had to amputate an arm to free her and that her parents and three siblings had died. A 17-year-old girl emerged alive in Adıyaman, and a 20-year-old was found in Kahramanmaras by rescuers who shouted “God is great.”

            In Nurdagi, a city of around 40,000 nestled between snowy mountains some 35 miles (56 kilometers) from the quake's epicenter, vast swaths of the city were leveled, with scarcely a building unaffected. Even those that did not collapse were heavily damaged, making them unsafe.

            Throngs of onlookers, mostly family members of people trapped inside, watched as heavy machines ripped at one building that had collapsed, its floors pancaked together with little more than a few inches in between.

            Mehmet Yilmaz, 67, watched from a distance as bulldozers and other demolition equipment began to bring down what remained of the building where six of his family members had been trapped, including four children.

            He estimated that about 80 people were still beneath the rubble and doubted that anyone would be found alive.

            “There’s no hope. We can’t give up our hope in God, but they entered the building with listening devices and dogs, and there was nothing,” Yilmaz said.

            Mehmet Nasir Dusan, 67, sat watching as the remnants of the nine-story building were brought down in billowing clouds of dust. He said he held no hope of reuniting with his five family members trapped under the debris.

            Still, he said, recovering their bodies would bring some small comfort.

            “We’re not leaving this site until we can recover their bodies, even if it takes 10 days,” Dusan said. “My family is destroyed now.”

            In Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the epicenter, a sports hall the size of a basketball court served as a makeshift morgue to accommodate and identify bodies.

            On the floor lay dozens of bodies wrapped in blankets or black shrouds. At least one appeared to be that of a 5- or 6-year-old.

            At the entrance, a man wept over a black body bag that lay next to another in the bed of a small truck. “I’m 70 years old. God should have taken me, not my son,” he cried.

            Workers continued to conduct rescue operations in Kahramanmaras, but it was clear that many who were trapped in collapsed buildings had already died. One rescue worker was heard saying that his psychological state was declining and that the smell of death was becoming too much to bear.

            In northwestern Syria, the first U.N. aid trucks since the quake to enter the rebel-controlled area from Turkey arrived, underscoring the difficulty of getting help to people there. In the Turkish city of Antakya, dozens scrambled for aid in front of a truck distributing children's coats and other supplies.

            One survivor, Ahmet Tokgoz, called for the government to evacuate people from the region. Many of those who have lost their homes found shelter in tents, stadiums and other temporary accommodation, but others have slept outdoors.

            “Especially in this cold, it is not possible to live here,” he said. “If people haven’t died from being stuck under the rubble, they’ll die from the cold.”

            The winter weather and damage to roads and airports have hampered the response. Some in Turkey have complained that the government was slow to respond — a perception that could hurt Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a time when he faces a tough battle for reelection in May.

            “As you know, the earthquake hit an area of 500-kilometer (311-mile) diameter where 13.5 million of our people live, and that made our job difficult,” Erdogan said Thursday.

            In the Turkish town of Elbistan, rescuers stood atop the rubble from a collapsed home and pulled out an elderly woman.

            Rescue teams urged quiet in the hopes of hearing stifled pleas for help, and the Syrian paramedic group known as the White Helmets noted that “every second could mean saving a life.”

            But more and more often, the teams pulled out dead bodies. In Antakya, more than 100 bodies were awaiting identification in a makeshift morgue outside a hospital.

            With the chances of finding people alive dwindling, crews in some places began demolishing buildings. Authorities called off search-and-rescue operations in the cities of Kilis and Sanliurfa, where destruction was not as severe as in other areas. Vice President Fuat Oktay said rescue work was mostly complete in Diyarbakir, Adana and Osmaniye.

            Across the border in Syria, assistance trickled in. The U.N. is authorized to deliver aid through only one border crossing, and road damage has prevented that thus far. U.N. officials pleaded for humanitarian concerns to take precedence over wartime politics.

            It wasn't clear how many people were still unaccounted for in both countries.

            Turkey’s disaster-management agency said more than 110,000 rescue personnel were now taking part in the effort and more than 5,500 vehicles, including tractors, cranes, bulldozers and excavators had been shipped. The Foreign Ministry said 95 countries have offered help.

            A senior Canadian government official said the crash was not a terrorist act and did not pose a threat to national security. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. 

            The driver had worked for Societe de transport de Laval for 10 years. He had no criminal history and a clean work record, police officials and Laval Mayor Stéphane Boyer said at two separate news conferences.

            Laval Police Chief Pierre Brochet said authorities are interviewing the driver. 

            The dead children were both 4 years old, identified in the documents only by their initials. Six children were hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening, Brochet said. 

            The day care is located at the end of a driveway off a cul-de-sac. There is a bus stop on the cul-de-sac, but the driver would have had to veer off the road and head down the long driveway to hit the building.

            “There were no signs of skidmarks ... He went directly into the day care,” said another eyewitness, Mario Sirois. 

            Sirois' wife, Ginette Lamoureux, the neighbor who ran into the day care shortly after the crash, said the driver was hysterical. 

            “His eyes were like popping out,” she said.

            Benchaabane said he and three parents had to strike the driver in order to subdue him, before police cuffed him. 

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his office was “following the situation closely.”

            Members of Parliament observed a moment of silence in Ottawa. 

            Wearing a hospital gown and in a bed, St-Amand was alert but unresponsive during his video appearance as the judge and his lawyer tried to get him to speak. He only nodded his head a few times when asked by his lawyer, Julien Lespérance Hudon, if he understood he was appearing in a courtroom.

            The case returns to court on Feb. 17.

            Neighbors described the suspect as a quiet, pleasant father of two young girls. One man, Thanh-Ry Tran, said his family got together with the suspect’s family a few times a year, and their wives would sometimes help each other in picking up or dropping off children. He said the suspect had never shown signs of distress.

            Another neighbor, Nader Abou-Said, said he would exchange pleasant greetings with the suspect, and would often see him playing with his daughters in the backyard.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804965,"In GOP-held Florida, Biden vows no cuts to Social Security","TAMPA, Florida (AP) — With an eye toward the 2024 campaign, President Joe Biden took direct aim at Republicans who have floated cuts to Social Security and Medicare — telling an audience in Florida on Thursday that he would create a “nightmare” for anyone who dreamed of trying them.

            Venturing into a state defined by its growing retiree population and status as the unofficial headquarters of the modern-day Republican Party, the president sees a chance to use Social Security and Medicare to drive a wedge between GOP lawmakers and their base of older voters who rely on these government programs for income and health insurance. 

            Biden is trying to lay the groundwork for an expected reelection campaign announcement this spring. Florida is also home to some of his potential biggest Republican rivals during next year's race. 











            White House aides have been using the votes and words of Republican lawmakers to make their case that Social Security and Medicare benefits are under threat, while GOP leaders say their statements are being mischaracterized. 

            Even as Biden said his focus is on getting things done, his speech in Tampa — and remarks the day before in Wisconsin — showed how he's trying to rally the public to his side now that Republicans control the House. In a politically divided country, the ability to get support from older voters who rely on the programs could decide which party holds the White House as well as Congress in the 2024 elections.

            At the lectern Thursday, Biden held up a pamphlet about Florida Sen. Rick Scott in which the Republican said he wants to require that the programs be reauthorized every five years.

            “I know that a lot of Republicans — their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare,” Biden said. “If that's your dream, I'm your nightmare.”

            Leading Republican lawmakers insist that spending cuts to Social Security and Medicare are off the table with regard to reaching a deal to increase the government's legal borrowing authority. But enough prominent Republicans have broached the subject that Biden told his audience Thursday that, “I'll believe it when I see it.”

            “I will not cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit,” the president continued. “In fact, I'm going to extend the Medicare trust fund for at least two decades.”

            Top Republicans, recognizing the political liabilities posed by Scott's plan, continued to distance the party from the proposal as Biden repeatedly used it as a cudgel on Thursday. 

            Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Louisville’s 840 WHAS on Thursday that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Social Security and Medicare “are not to be touched and I’ve said the same. And I think we’re in a more authoritative position to state what the position of the party is than any single senator.” 

            In the interview, McConnell — whose feud with Scott is well-known in Washington — took it one step further. Calling Scott's plan a “bad idea,” the minority leader pointedly said, “I think it will be a challenge for him to deal with this in his own reelection in Florida, a state with more elderly people than any other state in America.”

            During Tuesday's State of the Union address, GOP lawmakers jeered when Biden referred to Scott's proposal. The president seized on the impromptu moment, urging Republicans and Democrats alike to pledge to avoid cuts to the income and health insurance programs.

            “Let’s stand up for seniors,” Biden said as most of those in the chamber took to their feet to applaud, knowing the dangers of being on the wrong side of an aging electorate that values these programs.

            To drive home their argument, White House aides distributed handouts in Tampa before the speech summarizing Scott's plan, highlighting the phrase where the senator wrote: “All federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again.”

            Scott said his policy ideas have been misrepresented by the president and he only wants programs up for congressional renewal every five years, which he believes is different from spending cuts to Social Security or Medicare. “They lie about it,"" Scott said in a written statement about how administration officials have described his plan.

            “I am not for cutting Social Security and Medicare,” Scott said in a CNN interview hours before Biden's trip. ""We’ve got to preserve those benefits.”

            It’s a delicate moment for Social Security and Medicare, programs that economists say will drive the national debt to unprecedented highs over the next few decades. The Social Security trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits starting in 2035, prompting some Republican lawmakers to say changes will have to be made to sustain payments.

            But any proposed changes can come across as kryptonite to voters, who want their benefits preserved rather than cut. That's especially true in Republican-held Florida, where census figures show that nearly a third of adults are older than 62.

            Despite its longtime reputation as the nation’s premier swing state, Florida trended toward the GOP in recent years before lurching sharply to the right last fall. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis won reelection by a staggering 19 percentage points in November, even carrying the longtime Democratic stronghold of Miami-Dade County. 

            By this summer, Florida may be the staging ground for at least two top-tier presidential campaigns. Former President Donald Trump launched his 2024 bid nearly three months ago from his Palm Beach estate, and DeSantis is likely to join him in the coming months. Scott, believed to be the wealthiest member of the Senate, also has presidential aspirations. 

            Republicans have flocked to the state in recent years as well, describing it as “the free state of Florida” in a nod to DeSantis’ fierce resistance to pandemic-related mandates and “woke” policies on race and gender. 

            At a news conference Wednesday, DeSantis talked up Florida’s economy and leaned into cultural divisions while flanked by a row of gas stoves. Federal officials recently raised health concerns about the popular appliances. 

            “They are trying to take away your gas stove,” DeSantis said. “It shows they are coming for any little thing in your life.”

            Multiple administration officials have said they are not banning gas stoves, with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying last month, “The president does not support banning gas stoves.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804966,Passport rush blamed on US policy stalls adoptions in Haiti,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Dozens of children are stuck in orphanages across Haiti, unable to leave the increasingly volatile country and start new lives with adoptive parents because a U.S. policy change has unleashed a rush for passports at Haiti’s main immigration office.

            U.S. President Joe Biden announced last month that the U.S. will accept 30,000 people a month from Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela if they pass a background check and have an eligible sponsor and a passport to travel.

            The ensuing demand for Haitian passports has overwhelmed Haiti's passport office in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where people with appointments cannot squeeze through the aggressive crowd or secure new appointments. 











            Meanwhile, adoptive parents say the U.S. State Department has declined to grant passport waivers as they worry their children will succumb to hunger, cholera or gang violence.

            “It’s infuriating,” said Bryan Hanlon, a postal inspector who lives with his wife in Washington.

            They became the legal parents of Peterson, 5, and Gina, 6, last year and fear they won't be able to secure passports for the children and fly them out of Haiti, which has been in a downward spiral since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.

            Last year, the number of reported kidnappings in Haiti soared to 1,359, more than double the previous year, and 2,183 killings were reported, up by a third from 2021, according to the United Nations. Gangs also are raping women and children at an alarming rate, including those as young as 10, officials say.

            Armed groups have attacked more than a dozen schools and set one on fire, and they also have killed one student and kidnapped at least two teachers, according to UNICEF statistics released Thursday.

            Haiti also is fighting a deadly cholera outbreak and a spike in starvation.

            Last year, 5-year-old Peterson became malnourished and had to be taken to a clinic, where he was treated for a couple of months.

            Then in October, the siblings had to flee the orphanage with a caretaker as gangs raided the neighborhood, killing dozens of civilians and setting homes on fire. The violence that erupts as gangs fight over territory has left tens of thousands of Haitians homeless.

            “That was the worst day of our lives,” Hanlon said. “We didn’t know if they were alive or dead.”

            With their orphanage abandoned because of the violence, the children had been taken by one of their caretakers to her home in southern Haiti, where they have remained, he said.

            Hanlon said he and his wife send money to the caretaker, but that “some days, there is just no food to buy or no fuel to cook it.” Other times, she cannot leave the house to pick up the money because it’s too dangerous, he said.

            Brooke Baeth, an elementary school speech therapist in Minnesota, understands the fear and frustration. She and her husband became the legal parents of a 5-year-old girl in Haiti nearly a year ago, but they don’t know when they will be able to meet her.

            In late January, her daughter and caretakers flew from their orphanage in northern Haiti to Port-au-Prince only to encounter a huge crowd at the immigration office. Despite having an appointment, they could not get inside, nor could some of the office’s own employees, Baeth said.

            “It’s just devastating,” she said, adding that like the Hanlons, they haven’t been able to obtain a passport waiver from the State Department. “It feels like our voices are not being heard.”

            A spokesperson for the State Department said intercountry adoption is one of the agency's highest priorities and that it uses all appropriate tools to identify and overcome barriers.

            “We understand that it is currently difficult for prospective adoptive parents to obtain a Haitian passport,” the spokesperson said. “We remain committed to helping prospective adoptive parents navigate the often-complicated journey of intercountry adoption. We will continue to engage with the Haitian government on this issue.”

            Hanlon noted they are the legal parents of Gina and Peterson, not prospective adoptive parents.

            He shared email messages with The Associated Press in which the U.S. government denied his request for a waiver by noting that both Haiti's immigration office and the Ministry of the Interior were open for business, and that passport waivers are for use only on a case-by-case basis and as a last resort.

            Ryan Hanlon, president and CEO of the U.S. National Council for Adoption who is not related to Bryan Hanlon, said in a phone interview that the State Department’s manual calls on officials to prioritize adoption cases.

            “Can we even say we prioritize adoption when we have legal options that we choose not to utilize?” he said. “It’s the safety of the children that’s the concern here.”

            Given the ongoing crush at Haiti's main immigration office, government officials recently opened two makeshift offices in a gymnasium and a soccer field elsewhere in Port-au-Prince. They also implemented a schedule setting aside specific days for groups including women and the elderly. Saturdays have been reserved for children.

            Officials say they don’t know how many Haitian children are in this situation, but two of 11 U.S. agencies that are main providers of adoption services in Haiti say a dozen or more of their children are affected and the number has been rising. From 2016 to 2020, people adopted 827 children from Haiti, according to the most recent statistics from the State Department. Only 96 children were adopted in 2020, down from a high of 227 in 2017. 

            At one adoption agency, Colorado-based A Love Beyond Borders, at least 13 children in Haiti have been adopted but have been unable to obtain passports amid a processing backlog that is growing every day, said Stephanie Thoet, the agency’s Haiti program coordinator.

            She noted that even Haiti’s Ministry of the Interior has been unable to access the passport office to manually deliver the files of adopted children and worries about officials being killed or kidnapped by gangs as they travel back and forth with paperwork that has taken years to complete.

            “I am terrified every time they go,” she said.

            At another agency, Utah-based Wasatch International Adoption, at least a dozen children who already have been adopted can’t obtain a passport, and the number is growing, said Chareyl Moyes, the agency’s Haiti program manager.

            “The situation is dire,” she said, adding that she worries about a child or caretaker being killed. “Do we want to wait until it’s at that point?”

            Baeth said it’s hard for her daughter to understand why it’s taking so long to be together. They tell her how much she means to them and send her images of the snow, prompting her to excitedly ask if she could eat it. The girl, who wants to be a unicorn rider when she grows up, has sent them videos of her doing cartwheels and somersaults.

            Hanlon said his daughter knows what is going on: “She understands enough to be frustrated.”

            He recalled how Gina was upset one day and told her caretaker: “I don’t want to talk to them in videos anymore. I want to talk to them in person.” 

            His son, however, is younger. 

            Hanlon said when the boy is told he can’t travel to certain parts of Haiti, he tells the other children not to worry, assuring them: “My dad’s like Superman. He’ll fly down and kill the bad guys.”

            Hanlon paused as his voice broke.

            “Some days, I feel like I’m letting him down.”

Only 96 children were adopted in 2020, down from a high of 227 in 2017.At one adoption agency, Colorado-based A Love Beyond Borders, at least 13 children in Haiti have been adopted but have been unable to obtain passports amid a processing backlog that is growing every day, said Stephanie Thoet, the agency’s Haiti program coordinator.She noted that even Haiti’s Ministry of the Interior has been unable to access the passport office to manually deliver the files of adopted children and worries about officials being killed or kidnapped by gangs as they travel back and forth with paperwork that has taken years to complete.“I am terrified every time they go,” she said.At another agency, Utah-based Wasatch International Adoption, at least a dozen children who already have been adopted can’t obtain a passport, and the number is growing, said Chareyl Moyes, the agency’s Haiti program manager.“The situation is dire,” she said, adding that she worries about a child or caretaker being killed. “Do we want to wait until it’s at that point?”Baeth said it’s hard for her daughter to understand why it’s taking so long to be together. They tell her how much she means to them and send her images of the snow, prompting her to excitedly ask if she could eat it. The girl, who wants to be a unicorn rider when she grows up, has sent them videos of her doing cartwheels and somersaults.Hanlon said his daughter knows what is going on: “She understands enough to be frustrated.”He recalled how Gina was upset one day and told her caretaker: “I don’t want to talk to them in videos anymore. I want to talk to them in person.”His son, however, is younger.Hanlon said when the boy is told he can’t travel to certain parts of Haiti, he tells the other children not to worry, assuring them: “My dad’s like Superman. He’ll fly down and kill the bad guys.”Hanlon paused as his voice broke.“Some days, I feel like I’m letting him down.”___This story was first published on February 9, 2023. It was updated on February 10, 2023 to delete mention of UNICEF saying 1 million children in Haiti are not going to school. UNICEF has withdrawn its estimate, saying it doesn’t have sufficient evidence to support the figure.",2023/2/10,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804985,"Sen. John Fetterman remains in hospital, undergoing tests","WASHINGTON (AP) — Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, who had a stroke during his campaign last year, remained hospitalized and undergoing tests after feeling lightheaded, with tests so far negative for another stroke or seizure, his office said Thursday evening.

            An MRI at George Washington University Hospital, along with other tests run by doctors, rule out a new stroke, Fetterman's communications director Joe Calvello said in a statement Thursday evening. 

            Fetterman was being monitored with an electroencephalogram (EEG) — an instrument that measures brainwaves — for signs of a seizure, Calvello said. 











            “So far there are no signs of seizure, but he is still being monitored,” Calvello said.

            Calvello gave no indication about when Fetterman might leave the hospital, but had said late Wednesday that Fetterman was “in good spirits and talking with his staff and family.”

            Fetterman felt lightheaded Wednesday while attending a Democratic retreat in Washington and went to the hospital, staying overnight for testing.

            In November, Fetterman, 53, won the seat held by now-retired Republican Pat Toomey after a hard-fought contest against GOP nominee Mehmet Oz. 

            Fetterman, who was the lieutenant governor, defeated the celebrity heart surgeon by 5 percentage points, flipping a seat that was key to Democrats holding the Senate majority. More than $300 million was spent during the campaign, making it the most expensive Senate race in 2022.

            His campaign was derailed on May 13 when he had what he later called a near-fatal stroke just days before the Democratic primary. 

            He underwent surgery to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator to manage two heart conditions, atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy, and spent much of the summer recovering and off the campaign trail. 

            He refused to release his medical records or allow his doctors to answer reporters' questions, as Oz made an issue of whether his opponent was honest about the effects of the stroke and whether Fetterman was fit to serve. The Democrat insisted his doctors said he could have a full recovery.

            As a result of the stroke, Fetterman has struggled with auditory processing disorder, a common aftereffect that can can leave a person unable to speak fluidly and quickly process spoken conversation into meaning.

            The effects of the stroke were apparent in Fetterman's uneven performance during the fall campaign's only debate when he struggled to complete sentences and jumbled words.

            On election night, he told cheering supporters he ran for “anyone that ever got knocked down that got back up.”

            Fetterman, a presence at 6-foot-8 with a clean-shaven head and a goatee and known for wearing hoodies and shorts, was lieutenant governor from 2019-2023. He served as mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, from 2006-2019.WASHINGTON (AP) — Pennsylvania Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804986,No. 25 San Diego State holds off late Utah State rally,"LOGAN, Utah (AP) — Matt Bradley scored 18 points and No. 25 San Diego State held on to beat Utah State 63-61 on Wednesday night. 

            Bradley made his first seven shots and went 7 of 9 from the field overall to help keep the Aztecs (19-5, 10-2 Mountain West Conference) atop the conference standings. 

            “I like the way Matt turns up his game when it’s most needed and it was most needed tonight,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “He turned it up on the biggest stage for us.” 











            Jaedon LeDee had 14 points and 10 rebounds, while Micah Parrish added 12 points for San Diego State. The Aztecs’ top three scorers grabbed a combined 22 rebounds. 

            Utah State trailed by double digits much of the game until Dan Akin made a pair of free throws to cap a 9-0 run that cut San Diego State’s lead to 62-61 with a minute left. 

            Max Shulga missed a potential winning jumper in the final seconds, and Keshad Johnson went 1 of 2 from the line with 1.8 seconds left to seal the victory for San Diego State. The Aztecs didn’t score a basket over the final 5½ minutes. 

            “We knew it was do or die time,” LeDee said. “We needed a stop. I think we really locked in and we got it done.”

            Steven Ashworth had 18 points, six assists and five rebounds for Utah State (19-6, 8-4). Taylor Funk added 11 points and eight rebounds for the Aggies, who lost at home for just the second time this season. 

            Darrion Trammell and Parrish made back-to-back 3-pointers to spark a 20-4 run that gave San Diego State a 28-17 lead late in the first half. Seven players scored for the Aztecs during that stretch. 

            Utah State struggled to find a spark on offense before halftime. After Ashworth hit a 3-pointer to put the Aggies up 13-8, the Aztecs limited Utah State to only three baskets over the final 13 minutes of the first half. 

            “The first half was disjointed in a lot of ways for us,” Utah State coach Ryan Odom said. “Their defense really impacted us in a negative way. They were getting out on Steven, getting out on Taylor. We were not organized as we needed to be.” 

            San Diego State increased its lead to 40-25 after Parrish and Johnson combined to score baskets over three straight possessions. Johnson capped the 7-0 spurt with a layup off a steal. 

            “The stops helped our running game get going,” Dutcher said. “We were able to run a little bit, so we got some transition baskets. We didn’t have to fight everything in the full court.” 

            Utah State hit nine of its first 12 shots after halftime and cut a double-digit deficit to 56-51 midway through the second half. Sean Bairstow capped an 8-0 run with a layup to make it a two-possession game. Bradley and Parrish halted the run with back-to-back jumpers. 

            The Aggies put together another rally in the final five minutes before falling short. Still, Utah State drew several positives from how they fought their way back into the game. 

            “We put ourselves in that position with that run,” Ashworth said. “That’s what we hope the full 40 minutes will be like moving forward.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            San Diego State: Stifling defense and efficient offense helped the Aztecs carve out an early double-digit lead and escape with their ninth win in their last 11 road games against Mountain West opponents.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804987,"Toyota reports 8% drop in Oct-Dec profit, keeps forecast","TOKYO (AP) — Toyota reported an 8.1% drop in fiscal third quarter profit Thursday, as a global shortage of computer chips and soaring raw material costs battering the auto industry hit Japan’s top automaker. 

            Toyota Motor Corp.’s October-December profit totaled 727.9 billion yen ($5.6 billion), down from 791.7 billion yen the previous year. 

            The company said it was doing its best to find other chips suppliers to keep up with demand. Higher material and energy costs slashed profitability, it said. 











            Toyota kept its global consolidated vehicles sales forecast for the fiscal year that ends in March unchanged at 10.4 million vehicles. That would be little changed from what it sold in the previous fiscal year, at 10.38 million vehicles. 

            It expects to sell more Toyota and Lexus vehicles in Japan, but sell less in the U.S. and the rest of Asia, it said. 

            Quarterly sales rose 25% to 9.75 trillion yen ($74 billion). 

            Toyota said although its operating income in Japan got a boost from currency fluctuations recently, in which the Japanese yen has dropped against other currencies, that hurt its profits in the U.S. and Europe.

            A weak yen lifts the earnings of Japanese exporters like Toyota by boosting the value of their overseas earnings when converted into yen. The U.S. dollar was trading at about 115 yen a year ago but is now at nearly 130 yen.

            Toyota expects to earn 2.36 trillion yen ($18 billion) in profit for the full fiscal year, unchanged from its earlier forecast. That’s lower than its year-ago annual profit of 2.85 trillion yen. 

            Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the company founder, plans to step down as Toyota's chief executive, while staying on as chairman in a move apparently aimed at freshening up its image and highlighting that it’s shifting gears for a new era of electric vehicles. 

            The new chief executive, Koji Sato, is in his 50s, young by Japanese standards for top management at mainstream companies. He has an engineering background and has worked in the Lexus luxury brand division and branding operations, and at Toyota Gazoo Racing Company. 

            Sato will be steering Toyota's move to greener vehicles, including electric and hydrogen-powered cars. The personnel changes, which kick in April 1, need shareholders’ approval, scheduled for the next general meeting.

            Like the rest of the industry, the maker of the Camry sedan, Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models faces various challenges, including rising interest rates, inflation, fluctuating exchange rates and political uncertainties around the world. 

            The global auto industry has been slammed for some time by supply chain crunches because of disruptions from the pandemic.

            Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyamaTOKYO (AP) — Toyota reported an 8.1% drop in fiscal third quarter profit Thursday, as a global shortage of computer chips and soaring raw material costs battering the auto industry hit Japan’s top automaker.Toyota Motor Corp.’s October-December profit totaled 727.9 billion yen ($5.6 billion), down from 791.7 billion yen the previous year.The company said it was doing its best to find other chips suppliers to keep up with demand. Higher material and energy costs slashed profitability, it said.Toyota kept its global consolidated vehicles sales forecast for the fiscal year that ends in March unchanged at 10.4 million vehicles. That would be little changed from what it sold in the previous fiscal year, at 10.38 million vehicles.It expects to sell more Toyota and Lexus vehicles in Japan, but sell less in the U.S. and the rest of Asia, it said.Quarterly sales rose 25% to 9.75 trillion yen ($74 billion).Toyota said although its operating income in Japan got a boost from currency fluctuations recently, in which the Japanese yen has dropped against other currencies, that hurt its profits in the U.S. and Europe.A weak yen lifts the earnings of Japanese exporters like Toyota by boosting the value of their overseas earnings when converted into yen. The U.S. dollar was trading at about 115 yen a year ago but is now at nearly 130 yen.Toyota expects to earn 2.36 trillion yen ($18 billion) in profit for the full fiscal year, unchanged from its earlier forecast.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804989,"Lillard has triple-double, Blazers beat Warriors 125-122","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Damian Lillard had 33 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds as the Portland Trail Blazers rallied past the Golden State Warriors 125-122 on Wednesday night. 

            It was just the second triple-double of Lillard's career, and first this season.

            “I didn’t shoot the ball very well. But I think I approached the game with the same mentality, just to be aggressive, be in attack mode,"" Lillard said. “Just tried to put pressure on the defense and when they react to just make the right play.”











            Jordan Poole scored 38 for the Warriors, who played without injured guard Stephen Curry. Klay Thompson added 31 points on his 33rd birthday, including seven 3-pointers. 

            The game was tied at 95 going into the final quarter and it was back and forth the rest of the way. After Poole's 3-pointer got Golden State within 108-107, Andrew Wiggins scored to put the Warriors in front. 

            Trendon Watford's layup for the Blazers evened the game again at 114 with 4:56 left before Jerami Grant's three-point play gave Portland back the lead. Grant added another layup with 1:54 left to make it 119-114 while the Warriors struggled from the field. 

            Lillard added a pair of free throws and Golden State couldn't catch up. Grant finished with 22 points.

            Portland made 31 of 32 foul shots, while the Warriors were 9 for 10 at the line. 

            “When it’s 31-9 from the foul line, that’s a lot to overcome. You’ve got to make a ton of 3s, which we did, and you’ve got to win the turnover battle, which we did,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""That’s why it’s close. But to get over the hump you’ve got to make every shot it seems like. So we got out-boarded and they beat us up at the foul line and I thought that was the difference in the game.”

            The Warriors were minus Curry for the second consecutive game because of a left leg injury he sustained late in the third quarter of a victory over Dallas on Saturday. Thompson stepped up in Curry's absence with 42 points and a season-high 12 3-pointers in Golden State's 141-114 win over Oklahoma City on Monday night. 

            Blazers forward Josh Hart was in the starting lineup but suddenly left the floor during warmups and was replaced by Gary Payton II as reports surfaced that Hart was traded to the New York Knicks for Cam Reddish and a protected first-round draft pick.

            “That was kind of weird. We were warming up and he just shook my hand and walked off the court,” Lillard said. 

            The Blazers had dropped two straight, including a 127-108 loss to Milwaukee on Monday night.

            Portland led by 11 in the first half but the Warriors were up 67-63 at the break after Poole made a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Golden State went on to lead most of the third quarter before Nassir Little's 3 gave the Blazers a 93-91 lead late. 

            TIP-INS

            Warriors: Golden State is 9-8 without Curry, who was previously sidelined from Dec. 16 to Jan. 7 with a shoulder injury. ... Thompson grew up in Lake Oswego outside Portland and his dad, Mychal, played for the Blazers.

            Trail Blazers: It was the second game of a five-game homestand. ... Shortly after he was traded, Hart posted two hearts — one orange, one blue, for the Knicks' colors — on Twitter. 

            GP2's IMPACT

            Payton made a defensive difference off the bench last season for the Warriors when they won the NBA championship. Now he's with the Blazers, lending those same skills. 

            “We know what he’s capable of at both ends,"" Kerr said. ""Defensively he’s one of the best in the league and then offensively, he’s a great finisher and he can step out and make the 3 as well. So he’s an excellent player who helped us win a title last year. So we will always be thankful for Gary.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804990,Sweden opposes threat of force to resolve Taiwan Strait issue,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Sweden does not accept any threat of force in the Taiwan Strait, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said during a parliamentary interpellation session last Thursday (Feb. 2).

            “The use of military threats is of course unacceptable. Conflicts of opinion must be resolved peacefully and in a manner consistent with the democratic will of the people of Taiwan,” Billstrom said in response to lawmaker Rasmus Giertz’s concern that the Nordic nation was not acting fast enough to transform its representative office in Taipei to a “House of Sweden.”

            The foreign minister reaffirmed Sweden’s diplomatic relations with China but said it has long had “well-developed cooperation and exchange with Taiwan.” Sweden wants to continue developing ties with Taiwan within the framework of its “one China” policy, he said.

            He praised Taiwan’s democracy and advocacy for human rights and said it has one of the most important economies in the world. He pointed out that Sweden and Taiwan have close trade ties and cooperate in areas, including human rights, equality, climate, and innovation.











            “We naturally intend to continue developing this in different forms,” he said.

            Billstrom mentioned that lawmaker Bjorn Soder asked him how he would further push for Taiwan’s global participation a day earlier, on Feb. 1.

            He said the Swedish government supports Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO) and has urged the WHO director-general to invite Taiwan to participate as an observer at the World Health Assembly. The foreign minister added Sweden supported the statement France made on behalf of the EU member states at the opening of last year and this year's WHO board meetings, where the EU emphasized the importance of not leaving out any part of the world from the global health network.

            In October, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson highlighted the Chinese threat to Taiwan in a statement of government policy at the Swedish parliament. Kristersson expressed concern about China’s recent rhetoric directed at Taiwan. “Threats of military force are unacceptable,” he said.

            He also said Sweden will not tolerate aggressive states that intervene in a democratic country’s freedom and sovereignty. “Might does not make right,” he said.

            A Swedish parliamentary delegation visited Taiwan in April, affirming its support for Taiwan’s democracy, human rights, and freedom, and expressed optimism about future bilateral ties after a five-day visit.

            That same month, Swedish legislators approved a proposal to change the name of the country’s representative office in Taiwan to “House of Sweden.”TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Sweden does not accept any threat of force in the Taiwan Strait, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said during a parliamentary interpellation session last Thursday (Feb. 2).“The use of military threats is of course unacceptable.

Because of its binding power, xanthan gum can be used to replace gluten in the pastry industry. While some brands claim that they are gluten-free products, there may be some gluten in certain products. Consuming gluten has been linked to certain health issues. Xanthan is a non-hazardous ingredient that is used extensively in the food and beverage industries. It has a wide variety of nutritional properties, high carbohydrate content, and fiber content. Due to growing consumer demand for food, beverages, and xanthan gum, the world market is expanding. Xanthan gum demand is driven by high disposable income, fast urbanization, and a large and growing population of young consumers who are interested in healthy and vegan foods.Cargill

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805057,Indian government asks people to hug cows on Valentine's Day,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s government-run animal welfare department has appealed to citizens to mark Valentine’s Day this year not as a celebration of romance but as ""Cow Hug Day” to better promote Hindu values.

            The Animal Welfare Board of India said Wednesday that “hugging cows will bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness.”

            Devout Hindus, who worship cows as holy, say the Western holiday goes against traditional Indian values.











            In recent years, Hindu hardliners have raided shops in Indian cities, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, saying that Valentine’s Day promotes promiscuity. Hardline political groups like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal say such actions pave the way to reassert Hindu identity.

            Young educated Indians irrespective of their religion typically spend the holiday crowding parks and restaurants, exchanging gifts and holding parties to celebrate like any other Indian festival, especially since India began the process of economic liberalization in the early 1990s.

            The Hindu nationalist government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been pushing a Hindu agenda, seeking supremacy of the religion at the expense of a secular nation known for its diversity. Hindus comprise nearly 80% of its nearly 1.4 billion people. Muslims account for 14%, while Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the remaining 6%.

            The cow has long been embedded in the Hindu psyche and is deeply respected by many similar to one’s mother. Most states in India have banned cow slaughter. The animal welfare board's appeal asks people to go out and physically hug cows on Feb. 14.

            Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the message is ""absolutely crazy. It defies logic.""

            “The unfortunate part is this has now official sanction,"" he added. ""This shows an eraser of one more line between the state and religion, which is very depressing. Now the state is doing what political and religious groups have been campaigning to do.”NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s government-run animal welfare department has appealed to citizens to mark Valentine’s Day this year not as a celebration of romance but as ""Cow Hug Day” to better promote Hindu values.The Animal Welfare Board of India said Wednesday that “hugging cows will bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness.”Devout Hindus, who worship cows as holy, say the Western holiday goes against traditional Indian values.In recent years, Hindu hardliners have raided shops in Indian cities, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, saying that Valentine’s Day promotes promiscuity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805058,"Asia shares mostly fall, eyeing inflation, earnings, growth","TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly lower on Friday after Wall Street retreated for a second day as market watchers considered earnings reports and various indicators about whether inflation is waning in the U.S. and elsewhere.

            Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.3% to 27,650.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.7% to 7,438.50. South Korea's Kospi dropped 1.0% to 2,456.39. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.8% to 21,238.81, while the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6% at 3,250.85. 

            Shares in Mumbai, Taiwan and Singapore also declined.











            China reported that its consumer inflation rate ticked up last month as demand revived due to the lifting of pandemic restrictions and travel and spending connected with the Lunar New Year, the country's biggest holiday. 

            Producer prices fell 0.8% in January after a 0.7% decline the month before. Consumer price inflation rose to 2.1% from a 1.8% climb in December. 

            Next week will bring the release of U.S. and British inflation updates, as well as U.S. retail sales and industrial production data. On Tuesday, Japan will report its economic growth figures for the final quarter of 2022. 

            Wall Street share prices dropped Thursday following another mixed set of profit reports from companies, amid rising expectations for interest rates. 

            The S&P 500 fell 0.9% to 4,081.50, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7% to 33,699.88. The Nasdaq composite sank 1% to 11,789.58.

            Stocks have been flipping from gains to losses and back again amid uncertainty about where interest rates and inflation are heading. A still-strong jobs market has investors buying more into the Federal Reserve’s forecast that it will hike rates a couple more times before holding them at a high level through this year. High rates can drive down inflation but also raise the risk of a recession and hurt investment prices.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.7% to 7,438.50. South Korea's Kospi dropped 1.0% to 2,456.39. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.8% to 21,238.81, while the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6% at 3,250.85.Shares in Mumbai, Taiwan and Singapore also declined.China reported that its consumer inflation rate ticked up last month as demand revived due to the lifting of pandemic restrictions and travel and spending connected with the Lunar New Year, the country's biggest holiday.Producer prices fell 0.8% in January after a 0.7% decline the month before. Consumer price inflation rose to 2.1% from a 1.8% climb in December.Next week will bring the release of U.S. and British inflation updates, as well as U.S. retail sales and industrial production data. On Tuesday, Japan will report its economic growth figures for the final quarter of 2022.Wall Street share prices dropped Thursday following another mixed set of profit reports from companies, amid rising expectations for interest rates.The S&P 500 fell 0.9% to 4,081.50, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7% to 33,699.88. The Nasdaq composite sank 1% to 11,789.58.Stocks have been flipping from gains to losses and back again amid uncertainty about where interest rates and inflation are heading.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805059,Police officer wants badge back after spy charges dropped,"GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) — On a September day in 2020, New York City Police Officer Baimadajie Angwang kissed his toddler goodbye and was about to drive to work when he was surrounded by rifle-toting FBI agents.

            You’re under arrest, the bewildered cop was told. The charge: Being a secret agent for China.

            Angwang, a former U.S. Marine, spent six months in a federal detention center before he was freed on bail while awaiting trial on charges that he fed information about New York’s Tibetan community to officials at the Chinese consulate in New York.











            Then, just as suddenly, it was over. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn dropped the charges Jan. 19, saying only that they were acting “in the interest of justice.” They didn't explain further.

            Now Angwang says he wants to be reinstated to the police force, which suspended him with pay while the case was pending. But more than that, he wants answers.

            “Why did you start the investigation on me? Why did you drop all the charges?” said Angwang, who was born in Tibet but was granted political asylum in the U.S. as a teenager.

            “We want an explanation. We’re demanding it because you owe me,” he said during an interview at his attorney’s office. “You can’t just put me in jail for six months and ruin my name, ruin my reputation and give all this stress to my family members and friends, and then you say, ‘in the interest of justice.’ You just going to leave it like that?”

            China’s Communist Party has ruled over Tibet for seven decades and China has claimed a vast stretch of the Himalayas as part of its territory since the 13th century. But the relationship has been fraught with tension, with many Tibetans — some in exile — seeking independence.

            The original charge against Angwang was that he began supplying information to Chinese officials on Tibetan independence groups in New York in 2018.

            In court documents, prosecutors said Angwang was a threat to national security. He was charged with being an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements to federal investigators, obstruction of justice and wire fraud. There were no allegations of espionage, a more serious accusation.

            In building its initial case against Angwang, prosecutors argued that he provided intelligence on ethnic Tibetans who might cooperate with Chinese officials and advised them on how to expand China’s “soft power” in New York.

            Specifically, the government said, he sought a tit-for-tat arrangement that would give him a 10-year visa to his homeland in return for surveillance information and access to the police department.

            The case was built partly on recorded phone calls, including some in which authorities said Angwang called a consular official “big brother” and “boss.”

            Angwang told The Associated Press his words were either mistranslated from Mandarin or taken out of context. He said he became superficially friendly with Chinese officials because he needed the visa to visit his homeland, so his parents and other relatives could finally meet his daughter.

            The judge presiding over the case sought answers about why the charges were dismissed, but federal prosecutors declined to divulge classified information that might have given clues.

            The U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn declined to comment.

            The judge agreed to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning the government could press charges again, a possibility hanging over Angwang but his lawyer suggests is unlikely.

            The attorney, John Carman, surmised his client became caught up in the Trump administration’s effort to root out Chinese espionage across U.S. institutions, including the economy, academics and other facets of public life. Angwang contends there were shades of racism targeting people with Chinese links.

            “I think our criminal justice system sometimes goes off the track when it has a publicity aspect to it and when it has a political aspect to it. And this case had both,” Carman said.

            Angwang first visited the U.S. as a teen on a cultural exchange visa. He went back to Tibet but later returned to the U.S., saying he had been arrested and beaten by Chinese authorities. He moved in with an uncle in Queens and was granted asylum at age 17.

            In his adopted country, Angwang enlisted in the U.S. Marines and served in Afghanistan. After being discharged, he joined the Army Reserves and enrolled in the police academy.

            He said it was his way of giving back to a country that has been so good to him.

            With the charges dropped, he said he wants to regain the good graces of his Tibetan community, which remains suspicious.

            “I’m very proud of my heritage. I love my culture and I love the community,” Angwang said. He said he was wrongly depicted as a three-way traitor.

            “So I’m a traitor of my birthplace? I’m a traitor of America? I’m a traitor of the Tibetan community — which I was never a traitor. I never betrayed anyone — my fellow Tibetans, my fellow Americans, anybody.”

            Norbu Choezung, the president of the Tibetan Community of New York and New Jersey, a group comprising some 10,000 members of Tibetan heritage, remains wary. He, too, wants the government to provide more details about why it dropped the case.

            “It’s a little fishy,” Choezung said. “We as a community definitely want to dig deeper why his charges have been dropped, and how those things happened.”

            U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee, who presided over the case, was left with questions but said he was glad Angwang’s ordeal was over.

            “In some ways a straightforward case but also in some ways, especially given the landscape of statutes at issue, a complicated matter,” the judge said, also noting the “fanfare” in which the case was brought.

            “It’s unfortunate, obviously, that Mr. Angwang did serve as much time as he did in jail pretrial or in detention pretrial,” the judge said, “but better late, as they say, than never.”GARDEN CITY, N.Y.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805060,US general to aggressors: Allies are battle-ready in Asia,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — American forces and their allies in Asia are ready for battle after years of joint combat exercises, a United States general said Wednesday, adding that Russia’s setbacks in Ukraine should serve as a warning to potential Asian aggressors like China and North Korea. 

            U.S. treaty allies like the Philippines, Japan and Australia, among others, “have shown that they will band together, that they will not stand for aggression from these nations that have decided they want to change the world order out here,” Maj. Gen. Joseph Ryan said.

            Although Asia has no counterpart to NATO, the 30-nation military alliance whose mostly European members vow to defend each other against external attacks, a network of U.S. treaty alliances and defense partnerships upholding the international order provides a regional safeguard, he said.











            “I’m personally very buoyed by what I see by our allies and partners in this region and the way we’ve come together in response to aggression by the PRC, by North Korea to say, 'We will not let that stand,’” Ryan told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. 

            Ryan, Commanding General of the U.S. Army’s 25th Infantry Division based in Hawaii, is in Manila partly for talks with Philippine counterparts ahead of two annual largescale combat exercises that would include live-fire exercises and ground, sea and air assault maneuvers involving thousands of U.S. and Filipino troops in March and April.

            The Philippines, America’s oldest treaty ally in Asia that used to host the largest U.S. naval and air force bases outside the American mainland, has allowed larger numbers of visiting U.S. forces to stay in rotating batches and preposition weapons and combat equipment in at least nine Philippine military camps under a 2014 defense pact. The Philppine decision to allow a broader American military presence was announced during a visit last week to Manila by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. 

            In the broader Asia-Pacific region, Washington has reinforced an arc of alliances to counter what it says are threats posed by an increasingly belligerent China and North Korea.

            China has frowned on combat exercises involving the Americans in coastal areas facing the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety, and has accused Washington of meddling in Asian disputes and dangerously militarizing the region by regularly deploying U.S. Navy warships and jet fighters.

            More recent venues of large-scale exercises by American and Filipino forces included coastal Philippine provinces close to the disputed South China Sea, where China has taken increasingly assertive actions to cement its territorial claims, and in the northern Luzon region, which lies across a narrow sea border from Taiwan. 

            Combat-readiness exercises hopefully would make potential aggressors think twice, Ryan said. 

            The U.S. and the Philippines have agreed to hold about 500 small and major combat exercises in 2023 and expand annual military drills following disruptions caused by two years of coronavirus lockdowns, according to Philippine military officials. 

            “That does provide some deterrent effect against an adversary in the region, who would look at that and say, ‘I don’t want to take a step that may cause a government, a politician, to decide to go because I don’t know that I can win if I’ve got to face that trained, ready force,’” Ryan said.

            While military commanders say the joint exercises are not directed against any particular country, Ryan said China’s increasingly aggressive actions were an alarming reality the region should brace for.

            “Does the backdrop of PRC aggression enter our minds when we train? Absolutely,” he said, and in the case of the Philippines, U.S. forces needed to be ready to fulfill their obligations under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty.

            “We feel duty-bound to ensure that the Philippines can maintain and will maintain their sovereignty,” Ryan said. “So aggression from the People’s Republic of China that makes our treaty ally uncomfortable makes us uncomfortable.”

            The Philippines filed nearly 200 diplomatic protests in 2022 alone against China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea, a resource-rich and busy waterway where Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also lay overlapping territorial claims. 

            Asked if U.S. forces and their Asian allies were ready to respond if a major crisis similar to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine breaks out in the region, Ryan said, “Absolutely.”

            “I’m very comfortable that we’re ready but that doesn’t mean I’m satisfied. We can always get better,” said Ryan, who commands about 12,000 soldiers under his infantry division.

            He said experts would be flown in from Hawaii to train American and Filipino army troops in jungle survival and combat tactics during the Salaknib, the first of two major combat-readiness exercises starting next month in the Philippines.

            Ryan said America’s adversaries should consider political dialogue and diplomacy because “war is complicated … it’s violent, it can go a number of different ways. Russia found that out. They continue to find that out.” 

            “We thought that Ukraine would quickly succumb to Russian military power. That didn’t happen,” he said. “The most important reason in my view, by far, was the will of the Ukraine people to fight.”

            It was also crucial that the United States and NATO had helped train Ukrainian troops and enhanced their capabilities to deal with security contingencies for years before Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, he said.

            “I think our allies in the region value their sovereignty, value their freedom, value their independence. And no adversary should take that lightly,” Ryan said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805075,Australia to remove Chinese-made security cameras from government buildings,"Australia has decided to examine and remove Chinese-made surveillance technology used in government buildings.Defense Minister Richard Marles on Thursday said that the Chinese-made cameras could pose a security risk for the country.Two companies, Hikvision and Dahua, have provided at least 913 cameras, intercoms, electronic entry systems and video recorders in over 250 Australian government buildings.Both companies are partly owned by the Chinese government.""We would have no way of knowing if the sensitive information, images and audio collected by these devices are secretly being sent back to China against the interests of Australian citizens,'' said shadow Minister for Cyber Security James Paterson, who requested the audit.The checks came after Britain in November announced that it would stop installing Chinese-linked surveillance cameras in sensitive buildings.Some US states have also bannedvendors and products from several Chinese technology companies.An audit found that equipment from at least one of the two companies were present in almost every government department, except the Agriculture Department and Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.Paterson urged the government to ""urgently"" come up with a plan.Defense Minister Marles said that issue was significant but added ""I don't think we should overstate it.""Hikvision said that to represent the company as a national security threat is ""categorically false,"" as it cannot sell cloud storage, access the video data or manage databases of end users in Australia.""Our cameras are compliant with all applicable Australian laws and regulations and are subject to strict security requirements,"" said a spokesperson of the company.Dahua Technology has not yet responded.According to James Paterson, both companies are subject to Chinese laws which require them to cooperate with Chinese intelligence.Although they have yet to comment on this specific incident, China's general response to such situations is to defend their high tech companies and present them as good corporate citizens who play no part in intelligence gathering.The Chinese embassy in Australia has also not reacted to the move.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was not concerned about how China might react to the removal of cameras.""We act in accordance with Australia's national interest. We do so transparently and that's what we will continue to do,"" Albanese told reporters.In 2018, Australia decided to ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G broadband network. Since then, China and Australia have been trying to mend their damaged diplomatic ties.Relations were further damaged however when Australia called for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.China responded with tariffs on several Australian commodities.ns/es (Reuters, AP)",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805076,North Korea's military parade displays new solid-fueled ballistic missile,"North Korea conducted a nighttime military parade on Wednesday where it displayed its newest ballistic missile launchers.Analysts believe that the parade showcased what could be a new, solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) designed to reach the United States.While the parade featured multiple tactical nuclear units, the ICBMs showed North Korea's ""greatest"" nuclear strike capability, reported the state news agency.The widely anticipated event, which marked the 75th anniversary of the founding of its army, comes as the country continues to push to cement its status as a nuclear power.Kim Jong Un oversaw the display of weaponry in Pyongyang with his wife and youngest daughter, Ju Ae.This ICBM is part of an extensive wishlist of weaponry announced by Kim under a five-year arms development plan in 2021.Most of the ballistic missiles in the country use liquid fuel, which requires them to be loaded with a propellant at the launch site. This is known to be a time-consuming process.However, the ICBM is a solid-fuel missile, which means it offers greater mobility and reduces launch preparation time.The ICBM could also make North Korea's nuclear missiles difficult to spot and destroy during a conflict.It is unclear when the new missiles will be tested. North Korea has sometimes displayed mockups at the parade.Apart from the ICBM, Kim Jong Un's wishlist also included tactical nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, nuclear-powered submarines and spy satellites.Satellite images released by the US-based firm Maxar Technologies showed huge missile-carrying trucks passing Pyongyang's Kim II Sung Square as thousands of spectators watched.The parade took place after Kim called for an ""exponential"" increase in Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal. This is the fourth nighttime parade held by the country in recent years.""Following the apparent Hwasong-17 ICBM pairs are four unidentified but apparently similarly-sized canisterized systems,"" Joseph Dempsey, a defense researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said on Twitter.Ankit Panda, a US-based security expert with Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said that the canisterized ICBM might be the one seen during the 2017 parade and has not been tested thus far.This parade was followed by a record-breaking year of weapons tests, including firing its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile.Despite the UN security council and resolutions and sanctions, North Korea has forged ahead with its ballistic missile program and launched larger and more advanced missiles than ever before.Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff, said that South Korea along with the US militaries were closely analyzing the photos and reports from the parade.Kim Jong Un, who was previously very private about who his children were, unveiled his second-born, 10 year-old daughter Kim Ju Ae at an intercontinental ballistic missile launch last November.Since then she has appeared alongside her father at multiple high-profile events, including the most recent one being a banquet held on Tuesday to mark the army's founding anniversary.Analysts believe that she is equivalent to being North Korea's ""princess"" and her appearances indicate that she is the anointed successor.At the banquet, Kim praised the ""irresistible might"" of his military and referred to them as the ""strongest army in the world.""ns/es (AP, Reuters)",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805077,Will robots replace dogs in earthquake rescue operations?,"It is entirely unclear how many people are still trapped under the rubble left behind by the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Rescue workers search for survivors virtually around the clock, even though the chances of finding survivors are fading with each passing day.There are several ways to find people still alive under the rubble. Sometimes, direct communication is possible when rescue workers think they hear a sign of life — trapped people drawing attention to themselves by shouting or knocking, or sending text messages to family or friends.Those are exceptions, however.As a rule, rescue workers rely on other methods to search for survivors. On Tuesday, the EU presented the CURSOR (Coordinated use of miniaturized robotic equipment and advanced sensors for search and rescue operations) project: robots and drones to help rescue people from earthquake rubble.Small robots on wheels, equipped with infrared and thermal cameras, use a tube to check the air for CO2 and proteins typical of humans. That can point to people trapped under the rubble. With the help of loudspeakers and microphones, emergency workers can then try to get in touch with potential survivors. Drones can provide additional help with 3D images of the collapse site.During aftershocks, the search for survivors ""is highly dangerous for rescue teams because everything collapses,"" says Karsten Berns, a computer scientist and head of the Robotic Systems Chair at the Rhineland-Palatinate Technical University of Kaiserslautern-Landau. That's something autonomous systems are supposed to improve.Berns is an expert in the field of robot earthquake rescue. In 2016, his team was part of a project similar to CURSOR. The robots used in the ICARUS project were also designed to facilitate relief work, including small tracked vehicles with infrared sensors and large excavator-like robots that can move heavy rubble or parts of buildings. They are operated from a distance of 1 kilometer to make sure no excavator operator is in danger while a camera transmits to the control center what the robot ""sees.""Robots that can drive into collapsed houses were equipped with gas sensors — explosions from damaged gas pipes can pose a serious risk.Cursor projectBoth Berns' robots and the newer ones in the CURSOR project are prototypes developed by researchers and tested in individual presentations. None of these machines can help locate buried victims in the Turkish-Syrian earthquake zone. Production for use in real disasters is still a long way off. Many questions remain: Who is going to pay for the production of the expensive machines, who foots the bill for the transport to earthquake zones? No one in research has the funds, Berns told DW, adding that is where industry comes in.One clear advantage of the rescue dogs is that they are not just prototypes but can be used here and now. Rescue dogs are on site searching for survivors under the rubble in Turkey and Syria. Dogs can smell sweat, hormones, blood, excrement or even people's breath. When they have sniffed out someone lying under the rubble, they bark and paw at the spot.Unlike rescue robots, they need neither electricity nor the internet but only water and food. And the robots are not yet sophisticated enough to beat the nose of a good sniffer dog, says Berns — at this point, the German shepherd is still better. Robots do have some advantages though, he concedes, They can transmit images and can be steered to a precise location.While working on the ICARUS project, Berns and his team thought about using technology to automate the decision process which buildings to send rescuers to. But specialists with real-life experience soon talked them out of the idea, warning that any such decision was already hard enough for a human expert. ""There are people under the rubble who are happy that someone is there and the experts might know that they can't save them,"" Berns says.If the danger of collapse is too big, the rescue team might have to decide to leave trapped people behind so as not to endanger the rescuers' lives. You can't leave that decision to a robot.This article was originally written in German.",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805078,"Japan, Philippines agree to sharply boost defense ties","TOKYO (AP) — The leaders of Japan and the Philippines agreed Thursday to sharply boost their defense ties, allowing Japanese troops greater access to Philippine territory, as tensions rise in Asia amid China’s growing influence.

            Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is visiting Japan shortly after he and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reached an agreement on allowing the United States more access to Philippine military bases to keep China’s territorial ambitions in check.

            The defense arrangement signed by Marcos and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will allow Japanese troops to join training exercises to respond to natural disasters and humanitarian needs in the Philippines. The agreement is seen as a step toward broader military cooperation and could lead to similar agreements between Japan and other Southeast Asian nations.











            Kishida said the two countries will continue talks to further strengthen and streamline their militaries' joint exercises and other operations, while seeking to expand the transfer of Japanese defense equipment and technology to the Philippines and strengthen cooperation trilaterally with the United States.

            “After our meeting, I can confidently say that our strategic partnership is stronger than ever as we navigate together the rough waters buffeting our region,” Marcos said at a joint news conference with Kishida. ""The future of our relationship remains full of promise as we continue to deepen and expand our engagements across a wide range of mutually beneficial cooperation.”

            The new defense agreement allows Japan to deploy its forces for humanitarian missions and disaster response in the Philippines, an arrangement Japan hopes to eventually upgrade to include joint military training, cooperation and mutual visits, Japanese officials said. 

            The two leaders “resolved” to increase the defense capabilities of their own countries and strengthen overall security cooperation with reciprocal port calls and aircraft visits and the transfer of more defense equipment and technology, according to a joint statement released later Thursday. It said Japan will transfer air surveillance radar systems to the Philippines and provide related personnel training.

            They “expressed serious concerns about the situation in the East and China Seas and strongly opposed the actions including force or coercion that may increase tensions,"" the statement said.

            Kishida and Marcos also agreed to strengthen cyber and economic security. They also confirmed Japan’s continuing assistance to the Philippine coast guard in reinforcing its capabilities, including the improvement of port facilities at Subic Bay, a former U.S. naval base.

            Last year, the two island nations held their first four-way security talks among their defense and foreign ministers and agreed to strengthen their defense ties.

            Kishida’s government in December adopted key security and defense upgrades, including a counterstrike capability that breaks from Japan’s post-World War II principle of self-defense only, while also doubling defense spending in five years.

            Under the new strategy, Japan will also use development assistance to support poorer nations as they strengthen their maritime safety and other security capabilities. It’s meant to counter China’s growing regional influence.

            “President Marcos’s visit here gives us impetus for Japan and the Philippines to further elevate our cooperation in recent years to even higher levels as we contribute to the peace and stability of the region and the international community,” Kishida said at the news conference. 

            Kishida announced 600 billion yen ($4.6 billion) in economic assistance from the public and private sector for the Philippines through March 2024, primarily to improve infrastructure, such as construction of a commuter railway, and disaster response. The two sides also signed an agreement to work together in information and communication technology and to cooperate in energy security and industrial development.

            “When you think about the stability in the region and sea lanes and deterrence of China’s maritime assertiveness, deepening cooperation with the Philippines is crucial for the security of Japan and the United States,” said Heigo Sato, a Takushoku University professor and expert on defense and security. “Having access to bases in the Philippines would expand strategic options for the Japan-U.S. alliance” in case of an emergency involving Taiwan and China, he said.

            Japan has been expanding its military cooperation in recent years beyond its main ally, the United States, forging close ties with Australia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe.

            Marcos met with Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako ahead of his talks with Kishida and invited the imperial couple to visit the Philippines. He said he plans to join talks with trade and business officials from the two sides before returning home on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805109,Sudan's tropical disease spike reflects poor health system,"EL OBEID, Sudan (AP) — The two Sudanese women thought they had malaria and were taking their medication, but things took a dire turn. Both complained of a splitting headache and fever that didn’t respond to the anti-malaria treatment.

            By the time she was diagnosed with dengue fever, Raqiya Abdsalam was unconscious.

            “Soon after they examined me, I fell into a coma,” she said, recounting her ordeal some three months ago. Both women have since recovered and are at home in the city of El Obeid in the central province of North Kordofan.











            For decades, Sudan’s underfunded public health sector has struggled to effectively diagnose or treat patients as significant government spending went to its vast security services. A recent spike in mosquito-borne diseases — such as dengue fever and malaria — has underscored the fragility of the African country's health system, boding ill for future challenges driven by climate change.

            Sudan’s best-equipped hospitals are concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, leaving those from far-flung provinces reliant on aid projects. But many of those have disappeared. 

            In October 2021, Sudan’s leading military figure, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, led a coup that derailed the country’s short-lived democratic transition. The move spurred a sharp reduction in aid, with the U.N Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reporting that funding levels fell to less than 50% of required needs for both 2021 and 2022. 

            Burhan with his ruling generals and several other political forces pledged in December to install a new civilian government. But political wrangling is impeding a final deal, and it remains unclear when — and if — donor funding will return to previous levels.

            In late fall, a young doctor at a North Kordofan hospital thought that what she was seeing was a new malaria outbreak. Patients arriving at her hospital had malaria-like symptoms — high fever, body fatigue and a migraine-like headache.

            But after blood samples were sent to a laboratory in Khartoum for testing, a worrisome picture emerged. Some of the patients did have malaria, which is caused by a parasite, but others had dengue fever — similar in symptoms but caused by a virus. If severe and untreated, dengue fever can lead to organ failure and death. 

            The young physician said the hospital lacked the facilities to deal with the outbreak. “Patients had to either lie on the floor or bring their own beds to the hospital,’’ she said.

            While malaria is common across central and southern Sudan, large dengue outbreaks are rare. But, since last fall, dengue fever spread to 12 of the country’s 18 provinces, killing at least 36 people and infecting more than 5,200, according to Sudan’s Ministry of Health. However, the actual numbers are likely higher, given the limitations on testing.

            ‘‘Most hospitals outside of Khartoum are not connected to the Ministry of Health database,’’ said Alaaeldin Awad Mohamed Nogoud, a liver and transplant surgeon who is also a prominent pro-democracy activist.

            The World Health Organization says several factors enabled the dengue outbreak, including the absence of disease surveillance infrastructure and heavy flooding in autumn. The stagnant water allowed mosquitoes to breed and fueled the spread of the disease.

            Health experts also fear that growing mosquito migration, induced by climate change, could spur new surges in dengue fever, among other tropical diseases typically found beyond Sudan’s southern borders. The Aedes aegypti, a long-legged mosquito growing in number across Sudan that can carry the dengue virus, is causing particular concern.

            According to Anne Wilson, an epidemiologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, containing illnesses spread by the Aedes aegypti is difficult because it mostly bites during the day, rendering insecticide-treated nets, similar to mosquito nets for beds, less effective.

            Sudan’s public hospitals are state-run, but patients often still pay for drugs and tests. Hospitals in rural areas are the most depleted, stocked with little more than metal-frame beds and doctors.

            In North Kordofan — the site of the recent dengue outbreak — some believe the virus went unchecked for months due to a widespread lack of blood testing equipment. Abdsalam and Amany Adris, the two women from El Obeid, said several doctors had told them they had malaria before they were correctly diagnosed.

            After the Ministry of Health officially recognized the outbreak in November, officials say free testing and treatment were made available to dengue fever patients. And by January, North Kordofan was declared free of dengue fever.

            But even after that announcement, the young doctor from the province said she was treating suspected cases. Few patients can afford to pay for the blood tests themselves, however, she added, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

            Both Nogoud and the young physician said widespread shortages are forcing physicians to go to black market for basic medicines, such as paracetamol IV drips to treat fever.

            For years, Sudan has been in an economic crisis with annual inflation topping 100% on most months. Since 2018, the Sudanese pound has lost over 95% of its value against the dollar, making it difficult to buy pharmaceuticals or medical equipment from abroad.

            By the end of last year, Sudan’s National Medical Supplies Fund — the body tasked with procuring pharmaceuticals — said the availability of cancer drugs stood at 48% of needed levels, and other emergency medication was at 68%. Doctors, working with little pay and in difficult conditions, have regularly gone on strike. 

            Critics accuse the country's leaders of not putting more funds towards the health sector. The federal budget for 2021, listed on the government’s website, said the country’s health ministry would receive less than half of what would be allocated to the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, the country’s largest paramilitary group. The military spokesperson did not respond to AP’s request for comment.

            With few resources, the Health Ministry has turned to short videos on social media, encouraging people in a catchy song to cover standing water sources and install netting on windows. 

            Few see this as a long-term solution. 

            ‘’The whole country is in a state of chaos'', said Nada Fadul, an infectious diseases physician and associate of the Sudanese non-governmental organization NexGen. 

            ''Health care might not become the priority for survival,"" Fadul added.

If severe and untreated, dengue fever can lead to organ failure and death.The young physician said the hospital lacked the facilities to deal with the outbreak. “Patients had to either lie on the floor or bring their own beds to the hospital,’’ she said.While malaria is common across central and southern Sudan, large dengue outbreaks are rare. But, since last fall, dengue fever spread to 12 of the country’s 18 provinces, killing at least 36 people and infecting more than 5,200, according to Sudan’s Ministry of Health. However, the actual numbers are likely higher, given the limitations on testing.‘‘Most hospitals outside of Khartoum are not connected to the Ministry of Health database,’’ said Alaaeldin Awad Mohamed Nogoud, a liver and transplant surgeon who is also a prominent pro-democracy activist.The World Health Organization says several factors enabled the dengue outbreak, including the absence of disease surveillance infrastructure and heavy flooding in autumn. The stagnant water allowed mosquitoes to breed and fueled the spread of the disease.Health experts also fear that growing mosquito migration, induced by climate change, could spur new surges in dengue fever, among other tropical diseases typically found beyond Sudan’s southern borders. The Aedes aegypti, a long-legged mosquito growing in number across Sudan that can carry the dengue virus, is causing particular concern.According to Anne Wilson, an epidemiologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, containing illnesses spread by the Aedes aegypti is difficult because it mostly bites during the day, rendering insecticide-treated nets, similar to mosquito nets for beds, less effective.Sudan’s public hospitals are state-run, but patients often still pay for drugs and tests. Hospitals in rural areas are the most depleted, stocked with little more than metal-frame beds and doctors.In North Kordofan — the site of the recent dengue outbreak — some believe the virus went unchecked for months due to a widespread lack of blood testing equipment. Abdsalam and Amany Adris, the two women from El Obeid, said several doctors had told them they had malaria before they were correctly diagnosed.After the Ministry of Health officially recognized the outbreak in November, officials say free testing and treatment were made available to dengue fever patients. And by January, North Kordofan was declared free of dengue fever.But even after that announcement, the young doctor from the province said she was treating suspected cases. Few patients can afford to pay for the blood tests themselves, however, she added, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.Both Nogoud and the young physician said widespread shortages are forcing physicians to go to black market for basic medicines, such as paracetamol IV drips to treat fever.For years, Sudan has been in an economic crisis with annual inflation topping 100% on most months. Since 2018, the Sudanese pound has lost over 95% of its value against the dollar, making it difficult to buy pharmaceuticals or medical equipment from abroad.By the end of last year, Sudan’s National Medical Supplies Fund — the body tasked with procuring pharmaceuticals — said the availability of cancer drugs stood at 48% of needed levels, and other emergency medication was at 68%. Doctors, working with little pay and in difficult conditions, have regularly gone on strike.Critics accuse the country's leaders of not putting more funds towards the health sector. The federal budget for 2021, listed on the government’s website, said the country’s health ministry would receive less than half of what would be allocated to the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, the country’s largest paramilitary group. The military spokesperson did not respond to AP’s request for comment.With few resources, the Health Ministry has turned to short videos on social media, encouraging people in a catchy song to cover standing water sources and install netting on windows.Few see this as a long-term solution.‘’The whole country is in a state of chaos'', said Nada Fadul, an infectious diseases physician and associate of the Sudanese non-governmental organization NexGen.''Health care might not become the priority for survival,"" Fadul added.___Jeffery reported from Cairo.",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805110,North Korea shows off largest-ever number of nuclear missiles at nighttime parade,"SEOUL, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Nuclear-armed North Korea showcased its missile production muscle during a nighttime parade, state media reported on Thursday, displaying more intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) than ever before and hinting at a new solid-fuel weapon.The country has forged ahead with its ballistic missile programme, test-launching dozens of advanced missiles last year despite United Nations Security Council resolutions and sanctions.""This time, Kim Jong Un let North Korea’s expanding tactical and long-range missile forces speak for themselves,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. ""The message Pyongyang wants to send internationally, demonstrating its capabilities to deter and coerce, will likely come in the form of solid-fuel missile tests and detonation of a miniaturised nuclear device.""Imagery released by state media outlet KCNAof the Wednesday night parade showed as many as 11 Hwasong-17s, North Korea's largest ICBM, which are suspected to be able to strike nearly anywhere in the world with a nuclear warhead.Eleven missiles could be enough to overwhelm current U.S. missile defences, Ankit Panda of the United States–based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said on Twitter.""This is cumulatively more ICBM launchers than we've ever seen before at a North Korean parade,"" he said in a tweet.The Hwasong-17 was first tested last year. Alongside them at the parade were what some analysts said could be a prototype or mockup of a new solid-fuel ICBM in canister launchers.Developing a solid-fuel ICBM has long been seen as a key goal for the country, as it could make its nuclear missiles harder to spot and destroy during a conflict.North Korea held the parade in Pyongyang to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of its army, KCNA said. Leader Kim Jong Un attended with his daughter, who is seen as playing a possible future leadership role in the hereditary dictatorship.South Korea's foreign ministry criticised North Korea for holding the event when it is facing a worsening food crisis and economic difficulties.""We urge North Korea to immediately stop illegal nuclear and missile development, and reckless nuclear threats, and promptly return to the denuclearisation negotiations,"" South Korea's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lim Soo-suk, told a regular briefing.North Korea has said its missile programme and nuclear weapons development fall under its sovereign right to self defence, and are necessary because of hostile policies by the United States and its allies.SOLID-FUEL MISSILEIn December North Korea conducted the first static ground test of a large solid-propellant rocket motor at its Sohae Satellite Launching Station, but at the time it was unclear whether it was solely for the country's submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) programme, said Dave Schmerler, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).North Korea has not launched its new missile submarine, however, so the parade weapon suggests intentional signalling that Pyongyang is pursuing a complex, land-based ICBM deterrent, he said.""The general takeaway is that we should expect to see North Korea test a large land-based solid-fuel ICBM,"" Schmerler said.Most of the country's largest ballistic missiles use liquid fuel, which requires them to be loaded with propellant at their launch site - a time-consuming process.It is unclear how close the suspected new missile could be to testing. North Korea has sometimes displayed mockups at the parades.",2023/2/9,355,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805130,"Nets trade Durant to Suns, get Bridges in 4-team deal","NEW YORK (AP) — Kevin Durant is leaving Brooklyn, as Kyrie Irving just did and James Harden before that.

            Loading up on superstars didn't pay off in Brooklyn.

            “Let’s be honest there,” general manager Sean Marks said. “We did not reach the full potential of where we thought we could get to, our hopes and honestly our beliefs.”











            Now the Phoenix Suns are giving it a shot.

            The Nets traded Durant to the Suns on Thursday as part of a four-team deal, a blockbuster that kicked off the NBA's trade deadline day. 

            The Nets acquired Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, first-round picks in 2023, 2025, 2027 and 2029, and a first-round pick swap in 2028 from the Suns, who also got T.J. Warren from the Nets. 

            The Nets also acquired second-round picks in 2028 and 2029 from Milwaukee and the draft rights to guard Juan Pablo Vaulet from Indiana in the deal.

            The 34-year-old Durant is still playing at an elite level, averaging nearly 30 points per game this season. He asked for a trade last summer and the Suns were interested, and finally got him before Thursday's 3 p.m. EST trade deadline.

            Durant is recovering from a sprained knee ligament, and when he returns it will be to a Phoenix lineup that suddenly could be one of the best in the Western Conference.

            “He knows how to play. He’s played in a number of different systems. He’s insertable in any of them,” said Suns guard Landry Shamet, who played with Durant in Brooklyn. “You can throw it to him and he’s going to go score every time.”

            He was moved just days after the Nets traded Irving to Dallas, a stunningly fast end to the superstar era in Brooklyn. Harden was traded to Philadelphia at last year's deadline, leaving the Nets with little to show for the brief time they had the Big Three together.

            Now it's the Suns with a top collection of talent, with Durant joining Devin Booker, Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton.

            The trade came just hours after new Suns majority owner Mat Ishbia was introduced in Phoenix. The self-described basketball nut, who was a walk-on at Michigan State under Tom Izzo, didn’t waste any time shaking up the NBA.

            Ishbia called it a “transformative day” for the team.

            “Not only is Kevin one of the greatest and most accomplished players in the history of the sport, but his character also embodies the world-class commitment to excellence we are instilling across every facet of this organization,” Ishbia said in a statement.

            Phoenix has never won a league championship. The Suns made the NBA Finals two seasons ago, but lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in six games. They also played in the finals in 1976 and 1993.

            The Suns have had several injuries this season, but have won nine of their last 11 games and look like contenders again. They jumped to fifth in the Western Conference with a 30-26 record. Booker (groin) and Paul (hip) have both recently returned.

            When Irving heard the news, he said: “I’m just glad that he got out of there.”

            Irving scored 24 points in his Mavs debut against the Clippers on Wednesday. The Nets refused to give him a contract extension last summer, about the same time Durant was telling the team he wanted to be dealt.

            Eventually, Irving left and Durant followed. 

            “We had a lot of conversations throughout the year of what our futures were going to look like,” Irving said. “There was still a level of uncertainty but we just cared about seeing each other be places that we can thrive. Whether that be together or whether that be apart, there has never been one moment where I’ve felt like he’s been angry at me for the decisions I’ve made or I’ve been angry at him.

            “I just love the competition now that we can be in the same conference.”

            Bridges was the runner-up to Boston's Marcus Smart last season for the Defensive Player of the Year award and his offensive game continues to grow. The swingman scored 21 points Tuesday when the Suns beat the Nets 116-112 in Brooklyn. 

            His acquisition, along with Dorian Finney-Smith, who came with Spencer Dinwiddie from Dallas, should make the Nets a much stronger defensive team. But those players can't replace the firepower the Nets lost with Durant and Irving, two All-Star starters. 

            Durant, a two-time NBA Finals MVP with Golden State, was playing some of the best basketball of his career this season. He was averaging 29.7 points and shooting a career-high 55.9% from the field when he was hurt Jan. 8 in Miami. He had his knee checked again this week and Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said Durant was progressing well, but there was no update as to when he could begin taking part fully in practices.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805131,Australia rejects open-pit coal mine near Great Barrier Reef,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia for the first time has rejected a coal mining application based on environmental law, with the government minister citing the open-pit mine's potential harm to the nearby Great Barrier Reef.

            The government is under pressure to curb climate change by blocking all new coal and gas extraction projects. Australia is one of the world’s largest exporters of both fossil fuels, which are major sources of the nation’s wealth. But Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said Thursday she would decide individual projects on their merits.

            “I will make each decision that comes before me on a case-by-case basis according to the law and according to the science that is available,” Plibersek told Parliament.











            On Wednesday, she announced her decision to prevent the Central Queensland Coal Project from being excavated northwest of the Queensland state town of Rockhampton and less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Great Barrier Reef off the northeast Australian coast. 

            The project would have had unacceptable impacts on fresh water in the area and potentially on fragile seagrass meadows that feed dugongs and provide fish breeding grounds, she said.

            The open-pit mine has an estimated excavation capacity of 10 million metric tons (11 million U.S. tons) of coal annually for 25 years.

            Plibersek said the risk of “pollution and irreversible damage to the reef is very real.” 

            “The Great Barrier Reef is responsible for about 6 billion Australian dollars’ ($4.2 billion) worth of economic activity every year, about 64,000 jobs,” Plibersek said. “Given the science before me, it became apparent that the risks were simply too great.”

            The mine was proposed by mining magnate Clive Palmer, who founded and finances the minor conservative United Australia Party.

            Central Queensland Coal, a subsidiary of Palmer's Mineralogy, did not respond to a request for comment. 

            A United Nations-backed mission recommended in November that the Great Barrier Reef be added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites, warning that without “ambitious, rapid and sustained” climate action, the world’s largest coral reef was in peril.

            While warming oceans was the greatest threat to the network of more than 2,500 reefs covering 348,000 square kilometers (134,000 square miles), water quality and runoff from the Queensland coast were also risks.

            Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s center-left Labor Party government has increased Australia’s ambition for reducing the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions since it was elected last year.

            The Parliament enshrined in law Labor’s election pledge to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030. The previous conservative government had a more modest target to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% by the end of the decade.

            Labor has relied on the minor Greens party’s 12 senators to get legislation through the upper chamber.

            The Greens, who lost a senator this week when Sen. Lidia Thorpe became an independent, want Australia to slash emissions by 75% by 2030 and are pressuring the government to ban any further coal and gas projects. 

            The government faces another contentious energy industry decision when it considers extending an offshore gas exploration license off Sydney’s northern beaches.

            In late 2021, the previous conservative government rejected a two-year extension of the PEP-11 drilling license in the face of fierce community opposition only months before an election. The project proponent Asset Energy took the government to court.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805133,"Russian FM, Sudan's military leaders kindle ties in Khartoum","CAIRO (AP) — Russia's foreign minister met with Sudan’s military rulers Thursday, state media in Sudan reported, the final stop on Sergey Lavrov's tour of Africa. 

            The top Russian diplomat's Africa trip was aimed at strengthening ties and expanding influence at a time when the West seeks to isolate Moscow with sanctions over Russia's war on Ukraine.

            Lavrov held talks with Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, the head of Sudan's ruling Sovereignty Council, as well as with his deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, who heads a powerful paramilitary known as the Rapid Support Forces.











            The meetings focused on improving cooperation between the two countries, the state SUNA news agency said, without providing details. 

            At a news conference later, Lavrov acknowledged the presence of Russian-owned mining companies in Sudan, saying they worked “primarily in the field of developing the mineral resource base.″ 

            ’’We appreciate the attention that the Sudanese leadership pays to them,″ Lavrov added. 

            
                According to a recent Associate Press investigation, Wagner Group — a military contractor owned by an oligarch with close ties to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin — has a strong presence in Sudan's far-flung provinces. According to Sudanese officials and documents shared with the AP, the group has been given control of various Sudanese gold mines by the country’s military leaders in exchange for military and intelligence training.

            The Biden administration in January expanded U.S. sanctions against Wagner Group and related companies and individuals for their role in the war in Ukraine and mercenary activities, including human rights abuses, in Africa. 

            When asked about the group at the Khartoum news conference, Lavrov said private Russian companies operate in Africa at the request of African governments, including that of the Central African Republic. In that African country, Wagner fighters ride around the capital of Bangui in unmarked military vehicles, guard the country’s gold and diamond mines and have helped keep President Faustin-Archange Touadera in power. 

            “We have commented more than once on the activities of our private military companies operating in Africa at the direct request of the governments of the respective countries,"" Lavrov said. “This also applies to the Central African Republic, and is a contribution to the normalization of the situation in the region as a whole, where terrorist gangs continue to be active.”

            Lavrov's visit comes as Sudan's military rulers are in talks with some political forces in the country to reinstate a civilian government after more than a year of military rule following the October 2021 military coup. 

            On Thursday, senior diplomats from the United States and other European nations concluded two days of talks with Sudanese representatives to push for a final agreement to restart a transition to democracy in Sudan, deeply embroiled in a spiraling political and economic crisis. 

            The coup derailed Sudan’s short-lived democratic transition that followed the removal of longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 amid a popular uprising against his Islamist-backed rule.

            Lavrov arrived in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, after visiting Mali and Mauritania in what has been his second trip to Africa this year.

            Most demonstrations are led by more ardent factions of Sudan’s sprawling pro-democracy network that refuse to negotiate with the military leaders.

            This story has been corrected to say that two-day talks between U.S. and European diplomats, and Sudanese representatives concluded Thursday, not Wednesday.CAIRO (AP) — Russia's foreign minister met with Sudan’s military rulers Thursday, state media in Sudan reported, the final stop on Sergey Lavrov's tour of Africa.The top Russian diplomat's Africa trip was aimed at strengthening ties and expanding influence at a time when the West seeks to isolate Moscow with sanctions over Russia's war on Ukraine.Lavrov held talks with Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, the head of Sudan's ruling Sovereignty Council, as well as with his deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, who heads a powerful paramilitary known as the Rapid Support Forces.The meetings focused on improving cooperation between the two countries, the state SUNA news agency said, without providing details.At a news conference later, Lavrov acknowledged the presence of Russian-owned mining companies in Sudan, saying they worked “primarily in the field of developing the mineral resource base.″’’We appreciate the attention that the Sudanese leadership pays to them,″ Lavrov added.According to a recent Associate Press investigation, Wagner Group — a military contractor owned by an oligarch with close ties to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin — has a strong presence in Sudan's far-flung provinces. According to Sudanese officials and documents shared with the AP, the group has been given control of various Sudanese gold mines by the country’s military leaders in exchange for military and intelligence training.The Biden administration in January expanded U.S. sanctions against Wagner Group and related companies and individuals for their role in the war in Ukraine and mercenary activities, including human rights abuses, in Africa.When asked about the group at the Khartoum news conference, Lavrov said private Russian companies operate in Africa at the request of African governments, including that of the Central African Republic. In that African country, Wagner fighters ride around the capital of Bangui in unmarked military vehicles, guard the country’s gold and diamond mines and have helped keep President Faustin-Archange Touadera in power.“We have commented more than once on the activities of our private military companies operating in Africa at the direct request of the governments of the respective countries,"" Lavrov said. “This also applies to the Central African Republic, and is a contribution to the normalization of the situation in the region as a whole, where terrorist gangs continue to be active.”Lavrov's visit comes as Sudan's military rulers are in talks with some political forces in the country to reinstate a civilian government after more than a year of military rule following the October 2021 military coup.On Thursday, senior diplomats from the United States and other European nations concluded two days of talks with Sudanese representatives to push for a final agreement to restart a transition to democracy in Sudan, deeply embroiled in a spiraling political and economic crisis.The coup derailed Sudan’s short-lived democratic transition that followed the removal of longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 amid a popular uprising against his Islamist-backed rule.Lavrov arrived in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, after visiting Mali and Mauritania in what has been his second trip to Africa this year. Central to his appeal to African nations has been casting Russia as an anti-imperialist force, tapping into resentment of Western colonialism on the continent.Russia’s growing influence was particularly evident in January in Burkina Faso, when protesters condemning France and the Economic Community of West African States waved Russian flags on the street of the capital, Ouagadougou.Underscoring Sudan’s volatile situation, a 15-year-old was killed Thursday after being struck in the head by a tear gas canister fired by security forces in Omdurman, near Khartoum, a medical group said.The Sudan’s Doctors Committee said the teen was taking part in anti-government protests, which have become near-weekly events in Khartoum and other major cities since the military takeover.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805168,Ukraine's Zelenskyy makes emotional appeal for EU membership,"BRUSSELS (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked his Western allies Thursday for more weapons and said “a Ukraine that is winning” its war with Russia should become a member of the European Union, arguing the bloc won’t be complete without it.

            At the close of a 16-hour summit that ended Friday when Zelenskyy was already gone, the EU leaders pledged they would do all it takes to back Ukraine but offered no firm timetable for EU membership talks to begin as Zelenskyy had hoped.

            French President Emmanuel Macron said the leaders agreed to support Ukraine “tirelessly, over the long term … to win the war.""











            EU leaders pledged to look over the next month at boosting ammunition production for Ukraine's war effort as it faces fresh challenges from Russia.

            EU Council President Charles Michel said the bloc needs to “cooperate with the industrial sector and to ensure that we can speed up the level of production of ammunition and that they can also fulfill the commitments that are needed.”

            EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that a new 10-billion euro sanctions package under discussion would focus on depriving Russia of military goods it needs and cannot get anywhere else.

            ""The sanctions package “is targeted on goods that are almost irreplaceable from somewhere else,” she said.

            While in Brussels, Zelenskyy asked Slovakia’s Prime Minister Eduard Heger to give Ukraine its Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets. Slovakia grounded its fleet of MiG-29s last year. “We will work on” the request, Heger replied.

            Macron didn’t rule out sending French fighter jets to Ukraine, but said Zelenskyy didn’t ask for them and they were not Ukraine’s most urgent need. 

            “In no case could warplanes be delivered in the coming weeks,” Macron said, notably because of the necessary training. He said France may consider “intensifying’’ deliveries of other equipment such as artillery or missile systems.

            The commitments came after an emotional day at EU headquarters where Zelenskyy wrapped up a rare, two-day trip outside Ukraine to seek new weaponry from the West to repel the invasion that Moscow has been waging for nearly a year. As he spoke, a new offensive by Russia in eastern Ukraine was under way.

            Zelenskyy, who also visited the U.K. and France, received rapturous applause and cheers from the European Parliament and a summit of the 27 EU leaders, insisting in his speech that the fight with Russia was one for the freedom of all of Europe. 

            “A Ukraine that is winning is going to be member of the European Union,” Zelenskyy said, building his appeal around the common destiny that Ukraine and the bloc face in confronting Russia. 

            “Europe will always be, and remain Europe as long as we ... take care of the European way of life,” he said. 

            EU membership talks should start later this year, Zelenskyy said, an ambitious request given the huge task ahead. Such a move would help motivate Ukrainian soldiers in their defense of the country, he said.

            “Of course we need it this year,“ he said, then looked at European Council head Charles Michel, and insisted, tongue-in-cheek: “When I say this year, I mean this year. Two, zero, 23.""

            Von der Leyen, however, said “there is no rigid timeline.” In practice, membership often has taken decades to complete. 

            Zelenskyy held up an EU flag after his address and the lawmakers stood in somber silence as the Ukrainian national anthem and the European anthem “Ode to Joy” were played in succession.

            Before Zelenskyy's speech, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said allies should consider “quickly, as a next step, providing long-range systems” and fighter jets to Ukraine. The response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine “must be proportional to the threat, and the threat is existential,” she said.

            Metsola also told Zelenskyy that “we have your back. We were with you then, we are with you now, we will be with you for as long as it takes.”

            Military analysts say Putin is hoping that Europe’s support for Ukraine will wane as Russia is believed to be preparing a new offensive.

            The Kremlin’s forces “have regained the initiative in Ukraine and have begun their next major offensive” in the eastern Luhansk region, most of which is occupied by Russia, the Institute for the Study of War, said in its latest assessment. “Russian forces are gradually beginning an offensive, but its success is not inherent or predetermined.”

            Zelenskyy used the dais of the European Parliament hoping to match Wednesday's speech to Britain's legislature when he thanked the nation for its unrelenting support.

            That same support has come from the EU. The bloc and its member states have already backed Kyiv with about 50 billion euros ($53.6 billion) in aid, provided military hardware and imposed nine packages of sanctions on the Kremlin.

            Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council chaired by Putin, visited a Siberian arms factory Thursday and said his country will respond to the Western aid by churning out thousands of tanks.

            “Our enemy was begging for aircraft, missiles and tanks on a trip abroad,” Medvedev said during a visit to the аactory in Omsk. “We will naturally increase the output of various types of weapons and military equipment, including modern tanks. We are talking about production and modernization of thousands of tanks.”

            Fighting in Ukraine intensified Thursday, with Kyiv's military intelligence agency saying Russian forces have launched an offensive in the the partially occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with the aim to grab full control of the entire industrial region, known as the Donbas. Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces there since 2014.

            “An escalation is underway and the main goal is to seize Donbas by the end of March,” Main Intelligence Directorate spokesman Andriy Yusov told Ukrainian television.

            In Donetsk, the front line expanded significantly over the previous day, with fierce battles taking place as Moscow’s forces closed in on key Ukrainian-held towns, according to regional Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko. Russian shelling struck a kindergarten, hospital, cultural center, factory and apartment buildings, he said.

            “The intensity of the shelling has increased dramatically and we are seeing a significant intensification of activity by the Russian army immediately in the south, center and north of the region,” Kyrylenko said. “Russia is again actively using combat aircraft to shell our cities and villages.”

            Russian forces also stepped up attacks in neighboring Luhansk province, launching “a broad offensive,” regional Gov. Serhii Haidai said.

            In Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv province, 23 cities and villages came under shelling. In the border city of Vovchansk, shelling damaged about 10 apartment buildings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805178,Taiwan inflation exceeds 3% in January,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached 3.04% in January, its highest level in six months, reports said Thursday (Feb.9).Inflation for all of 2022 was 2.95%, the highest annual figure in 14 years, according to data from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).After July 2022, the CPI figure stayed below 3%, until the first month of this year, UDN reported. Price increases for vegetables and the fact that the Lunar New Year holiday fell in January this year were the main factors behind the rise, as the Jan. 20-29 vacation period also entailed extra travel expenses and higher taxi fares.Fruit and communications equipment were the only major products that saw prices fall during January, but eating out, eggs, meat, seafood, transportation, and home appliances all became more expensive.While the DGBAS had forecast higher inflation for January, it originally said the figure would not exceed 3%, per UDN. The government department also revised the makeup of its CPI predictions, giving more weight to food, clothing, housing, healthcare, and health insurance, and cutting back the importance of transport, communication, education, and entertainment.",2023/2/9,1480,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805204,Ryan Ruffels leads men's Vic Open after course record 61,"BARWON HEADS, Australia (AP) — Ryan Ruffels had seven birdies and two eagles in a course record-equaling 61 on Thursday, taking a two-shot lead at 11-under after the first round of the Vic Open at 13th Beach Golf Links on Thursday.

            The Florida-based Ruffels has been playing on the Korn Ferry Tour and was making his first trip home to Australia since 2019.

            He equaled the course record set in 2017 by Jake McLeod after shooting 11 under for the first time in a professional tournament.











            Mathew Goggin eagled his final hole to finish at 63 and move into a tie for second at 9 under with Deyen Lawson.

            Ruffels' playing partners Elvis Smylie and Nathan Barbieri each shot 65 and were in a group of six tied for seventh place at 7 under.

            “We just all got into a good rhythm quite early,” Ruffels said. ""Feeding off each other ... I don’t know if there’s anything to it, but it certainly happened today.”

            The men’s and women’s Vic Opens are being played concurrently on the 36-hole layout at Barwon Heads, near Geelong in Australia's Victoria state.

            Thailand’s Pavarisa Yoktuan and 20-year-old Australian Cassie Porter were tied for the lead in the women’s tournament at 6 under.

            Porter upstaged her playing partners, seven-time major winner Karrie Webb and former No. 1-ranked Jiyai Shin of South Korea, with a bogey-free 66.

            Shin was in a group of five tied for third at 5 under, and Webb birdied the 18th to get back to par.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805205,US says China balloon could collect intelligence signals,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The China balloon shot down by the U.S. was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals as part of a huge, military-linked aerial surveillance program that targeted more than 40 countries, the Biden administration declared Thursday, citing imagery from American U-2 spy planes.

            A fleet of balloons operates under the direction of the People's Liberation Army and is used specifically for spying, outfitted with high-tech equipment designed to gather sensitive information from targets across the globe, the U.S. said. Similar balloons have sailed over five continents, according to the administration.

            A statement from a senior State Department official offered the most detail to date linking China’s military to the balloon that was shot down by the U.S. last weekend over the Atlantic Ocean. The public details outlining the program's scope and capabilities were meant to refute China’s persistent denials that the balloon was used for spying, including a claim Thursday that U.S. accusations about the balloon amount to “information warfare.""











            President Joe Biden defended the U.S. action.

            And, asked in an interview with Spanish language Telemundo Noticias whether the balloon episode represented a major security breach, he said no.

            “Look, the total amount of intelligence gathering that’s going on by every country around the world is overwhelming,” he said. “Anyway, it’s not a major breach. I mean, look ... it’s a violation of international law. It’s our airspace. And once it comes into our space, we can do what we want with it.”

            On Capitol Hill, the House voted unanimously to condemn China for a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty and efforts to “deceive the international community through false claims about its intelligence collection campaigns.” Republicans have criticized Biden for not acting sooner to down the balloon, but both parties' lawmakers came together on the vote, 419-0.

            In Beijing, before the U.S. offered its new information, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning repeated her nation's insistence that the large unmanned balloon was a civilian meteorological airship that had blown off course and that the U.S. had “overreacted” by shooting it down. 

            “It is irresponsible,” Mao said. The latest accusations, she said, “may be part of the U.S. side’s information warfare against China.”

            Underscoring the tensions, China’s defense minister refused to take a phone call from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss the balloon issue on Saturday, the Pentagon said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a planned weekend trip to Beijing.

            The U.S. flatly contradicted China's version of events, saying that imagery of the balloon collected by American U-2 spy planes as it crossed the country showed that it was “capable of conducting signals intelligence collection” with multiple antennas and other equipment designed to upload sensitive information and solar panels to power them.

            Jedidiah Royal, the U.S. assistant defense secretary for the Indo-Pacific, told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that the military has “some very good guesses” about what intelligence China was seeking. More information was expected to be provided in a classified setting.

            Senior FBI officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the bureau said just a few pieces of the balloon had arrived at the FBI’s Quantico, Virginia, lab for investigation. So far, investigators have parts of the balloon canopy, wiring, and what one official called “a very small amount of electronics.” The official said it was “very early for us to assess what the intent was and how the device was operating.”

            According to two U.S. officials, the balloon recovery efforts were temporarily suspended on Thursday due to high seas. They said some balloon debris was intact on the ocean floor and divers had recovered potentially high-value equipment over the past day and a half. Another official said that some of the recovered equipment components had English writing or markings on them but it wasn't clear if they were American parts or from another English speaking country. The official said the more highly technical parts recovered did not have any overt markings.

            Much of the debris is concentrated in two separate sections of an area 15 football fields long and 15 fields across, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the collection process.

            The State Department official, providing details to reporters by email, also on condition of anonymity, said an analysis of the balloon debris was “inconsistent” with China’s explanation that it was a weather balloon that went off course. The U.S. is reaching out to countries that have also been targeted, the official said.

            The U.S. has confidence that the manufacturer of the balloon shot down on Saturday has “a direct relationship with China’s military and is an approved vendor of the” army, the official said, citing an official PLA procurement portal as evidence.

            State Department spokesman Ned Price would not identify the other countries the U.S. says have also been targeted. Nor would he reveal how the U.S. knows there have been Chinese incursions over those countries' territory, saying to do so could compromise intelligence sources and methods.

            The release of new information appeared part of a coordinated administration response, with multiple officials appearing before congressional committees to face questions about the balloon.

            Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said officials had taken “all necessary steps to protect sensitive information” and had been able to study and scrutinize the balloon and its equipment.

            “We will continue to answer the dangers posed by the PRC with determination and resolve,” Sherman said, referring to the People's Republic of China. ""We will make clear to the PRC that violations of our sovereignty and the sovereignty of other countries are unacceptable.”

            At a separate Senate subcommittee hearing, lawmakers repeatedly pressed administration officials, including Pentagon military leaders, about why the balloon was not shot down over sparsely populated areas of Alaska. And they questioned whether allowing the balloon to transit such a large area set a precedent for future spying efforts by China and others.

            “It defies belief that there was not a single opportunity to safely shoot this spy balloon prior to the coast of South Carolina,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. “By the administration’s logic we would allow the Chinese to fly surveillance balloons over the Pentagon or other sensitive sites and populated areas.”

            Melissa Dalton, assistant defense secretary of Homeland Defense, and Lt. Gen. Doug Sims, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. wanted to avoid any injuries or deaths from the debris field if the balloon was shot down over Alaska. 

            And they added that shooting it down over the frigid, icy waters in that region would have made it more difficult and dangerous to recover the pieces for more analysis.

            “We thought before we shot,” said Sims.This is not the first time the U.S. government has publicly called out alleged activities of the People’s Liberation Army. In a first-of-its-kind prosecution in 2014, the Obama administration Justice Department indicted five accused PLA hackers of breaking into the computer networks of major American corporations in an effort to steal trade secrets.

            Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant and Lolita C. Baldor in Washington contributed to this report.WASHINGTON (AP) — The China balloon shot down by the U.S. was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals as part of a huge, military-linked aerial surveillance program that targeted more than 40 countries, the Biden administration declared Thursday, citing imagery from American U-2 spy planes.A fleet of balloons operates under the direction of the People's Liberation Army and is used specifically for spying, outfitted with high-tech equipment designed to gather sensitive information from targets across the globe, the U.S. said. Similar balloons have sailed over five continents, according to the administration.A statement from a senior State Department official offered the most detail to date linking China’s military to the balloon that was shot down by the U.S. last weekend over the Atlantic Ocean. The public details outlining the program's scope and capabilities were meant to refute China’s persistent denials that the balloon was used for spying, including a claim Thursday that U.S. accusations about the balloon amount to “information warfare.""President Joe Biden defended the U.S. action.And, asked in an interview with Spanish language Telemundo Noticias whether the balloon episode represented a major security breach, he said no.“Look, the total amount of intelligence gathering that’s going on by every country around the world is overwhelming,” he said. “Anyway, it’s not a major breach. I mean, look ... it’s a violation of international law. It’s our airspace. And once it comes into our space, we can do what we want with it.”On Capitol Hill, the House voted unanimously to condemn China for a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty and efforts to “deceive the international community through false claims about its intelligence collection campaigns.” Republicans have criticized Biden for not acting sooner to down the balloon, but both parties' lawmakers came together on the vote, 419-0.In Beijing, before the U.S. offered its new information, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning repeated her nation's insistence that the large unmanned balloon was a civilian meteorological airship that had blown off course and that the U.S. had “overreacted” by shooting it down.“It is irresponsible,” Mao said. The latest accusations, she said, “may be part of the U.S. side’s information warfare against China.”Underscoring the tensions, China’s defense minister refused to take a phone call from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss the balloon issue on Saturday, the Pentagon said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a planned weekend trip to Beijing.The U.S. flatly contradicted China's version of events, saying that imagery of the balloon collected by American U-2 spy planes as it crossed the country showed that it was “capable of conducting signals intelligence collection” with multiple antennas and other equipment designed to upload sensitive information and solar panels to power them.Jedidiah Royal, the U.S. assistant defense secretary for the Indo-Pacific, told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that the military has “some very good guesses” about what intelligence China was seeking. More information was expected to be provided in a classified setting.Senior FBI officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the bureau said just a few pieces of the balloon had arrived at the FBI’s Quantico, Virginia, lab for investigation. So far, investigators have parts of the balloon canopy, wiring, and what one official called “a very small amount of electronics.” The official said it was “very early for us to assess what the intent was and how the device was operating.”According to two U.S. officials, the balloon recovery efforts were temporarily suspended on Thursday due to high seas. They said some balloon debris was intact on the ocean floor and divers had recovered potentially high-value equipment over the past day and a half. Another official said that some of the recovered equipment components had English writing or markings on them but it wasn't clear if they were American parts or from another English speaking country. The official said the more highly technical parts recovered did not have any overt markings.Much of the debris is concentrated in two separate sections of an area 15 football fields long and 15 fields across, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the collection process.The State Department official, providing details to reporters by email, also on condition of anonymity, said an analysis of the balloon debris was “inconsistent” with China’s explanation that it was a weather balloon that went off course. The U.S. is reaching out to countries that have also been targeted, the official said.The U.S. has confidence that the manufacturer of the balloon shot down on Saturday has “a direct relationship with China’s military and is an approved vendor of the” army, the official said, citing an official PLA procurement portal as evidence.State Department spokesman Ned Price would not identify the other countries the U.S. says have also been targeted. Nor would he reveal how the U.S. knows there have been Chinese incursions over those countries' territory, saying to do so could compromise intelligence sources and methods.The release of new information appeared part of a coordinated administration response, with multiple officials appearing before congressional committees to face questions about the balloon.Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said officials had taken “all necessary steps to protect sensitive information” and had been able to study and scrutinize the balloon and its equipment.“We will continue to answer the dangers posed by the PRC with determination and resolve,” Sherman said, referring to the People's Republic of China. ""We will make clear to the PRC that violations of our sovereignty and the sovereignty of other countries are unacceptable.”At a separate Senate subcommittee hearing, lawmakers repeatedly pressed administration officials, including Pentagon military leaders, about why the balloon was not shot down over sparsely populated areas of Alaska. And they questioned whether allowing the balloon to transit such a large area set a precedent for future spying efforts by China and others.“It defies belief that there was not a single opportunity to safely shoot this spy balloon prior to the coast of South Carolina,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. “By the administration’s logic we would allow the Chinese to fly surveillance balloons over the Pentagon or other sensitive sites and populated areas.”Melissa Dalton, assistant defense secretary of Homeland Defense, and Lt. Gen. Doug Sims, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. wanted to avoid any injuries or deaths from the debris field if the balloon was shot down over Alaska.And they added that shooting it down over the frigid, icy waters in that region would have made it more difficult and dangerous to recover the pieces for more analysis.“We thought before we shot,” said Sims.This is not the first time the U.S. government has publicly called out alleged activities of the People’s Liberation Army. In a first-of-its-kind prosecution in 2014, the Obama administration Justice Department indicted five accused PLA hackers of breaking into the computer networks of major American corporations in an effort to steal trade secrets._____Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant and Lolita C.

            Videos and photos posted on social media since Wednesday showed dozens of people running in the darkness and cold toward the airport.

            The scene harked back to August, 2021, when thousands of desperate people stormed the airport for the airlift for those fleeing the Taliban takeover in the last weeks of U.S. and NATO troop withdrawal from the country.

            He then added: “Also this can be an opportunity for me to find a way out of the country.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805223,Japan's Nissan reports better profit as chip crunch eases,"TOKYO (AP) — Nissan reported a 55% jump in its October-December profit Thursday, as the Japanese automaker gears up for a less bumpy journey with its French alliance partner Renault.

            Profit for the quarter at Yokohama-based Nissan Motor Co. totaled 50.6 billion yen ($386 million), up from 32.7 billion yen in the previous year. 

            Quarterly sales surged 29% to 2.8 trillion yen ($21 billion), as a shortage of computer chips that has bedeviled the world’s automakers gradually eased, according to Nissan. 











            The crunch was caused by pandemic-related disruptions that also hindered Nissan’s ability to deliver its vehicles to customers.

            Some buyers were waiting for a year for their Z sportscars or Ariya sport utility vehicles, said Nissan's chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta.

            “We really don’t want our customers to wait this long,” he told reporters. 

            The rising cost of raw materials, inflation pressures and volatile exchange rates have added to the risks for the auto industry, including Nissan. 

            Nissan, maker of the Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models, now expects to sell 8% fewer vehicles for the full fiscal year through March than previously projected, at 3.4 million vehicles, because of the semiconductor supply shortages and the impact from the spread of coronavirus infections in China.

            Chief Executive Makoto Uchida acknowledged the quarter was extremely challenging, while expressing optimism for the future. 

            “The new models we introduced in each market have been very well received by customers,” he said. 

            Earlier this week, Nissan, with Renault and smaller Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi Motors, announced how they were redefining their mutual relationship. 

            The boards of both companies approved equalizing the stake each automaker holds in the other to 15%, bringing a better balance to the alliance, according to an announcement in London. 

            Before, Renault Group, whose top shareholder is the French government, was holding 43.4% of Nissan while Nissan owned just 15% of Renault.

            The automakers also vowed to cooperate in markets worldwide, including India and Latin America, while Nissan said it will invest up to 15% in Ampere, Renault’s electric vehicle and software entity in Europe. 

            Nissan has been eager to put behind it the 2018 arrest of Carlos Ghosn, a once-superstar executive who was sent in by Renault to save Nissan from bankruptcy in 1999, and successfully turned it around.

            Ghosn jumped bail and is now in Lebanon. He says he is innocent of financial misconduct charges. The scandal highlighted disgruntlement at Nissan over Ghosn's perks and his power over the company.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805245,Credit Suisse posts $1.4B pre-tax loss as woes go on in 4Q,"GENEVA (AP) — Credit Suisse on Thursday reported a pre-tax loss of more than 1.3 billion Swiss francs (about $1.4 billion) in the fourth quarter of last year, as its new managers vie to right the top-drawer Swiss bank that has faced a string of setbacks in recent years.

            The bank also announced the $175 million purchase of the investment banking business of U.S.-based M. Klein & Co. and plans to roll those operations into the revived CS First Boston investment bank.

            The Zurich-based company, Switzerland's No. 2 bank after UBS, said net revenue sank 20% compared with a year ago, coming in at 3 billion francs for the fourth quarter. The pre-tax loss was nearly 1.32 billion francs, compared with 1.67 billion in the same period a year earlier. 











            Credit Suisse saw its investment bank business shrink and its Swiss bank and wealth management operations increase as a share of revenue. The company says it expects losses in both the investment bank and wealth management units for the first quarter of this year, partly due to a drop in assets under management and lower deposits since announcing a broad restructuring in October. 

            The bank's performance last year overall “was mainly driven by significantly lower” investment banking revenue, pointing to an “industry-wide slowdown in capital markets” with major indices all falling in 2022, it said in a statement. 

            In October, Credit Suisse unveiled a “radical strategy” to revamp itself through measures including cost cuts, staff reductions, steps to lower risk and a cash infusion through a share purchase from the Saudi National Bank.

            Credit Suisse has run into multiple troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds and a spying scandal involving UBS. A Swiss court fined the bank more than $2 million in September for failing to prevent money laundering linked to a Bulgarian criminal gang more than 15 years ago.

            For the year, revenue plunged 34% to 14.92 billion francs, and the pre-tax loss came in at 3.26 billion francs, compared with a pre-tax loss of 600 million francs in 2021.GENEVA (AP) — Credit Suisse on Thursday reported a pre-tax loss of more than 1.3 billion Swiss francs (about $1.4 billion) in the fourth quarter of last year, as its new managers vie to right the top-drawer Swiss bank that has faced a string of setbacks in recent years.The bank also announced the $175 million purchase of the investment banking business of U.S.-based M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805277,Egypt's inflation continues to surge as food prices rise,"CAIRO (AP) — Egypt's annual inflation surged to a new high in January as the country continues to battle ongoing price hikes and a depreciating currency, the Egyptian statistics bureau said on Thursday.

            The state-run Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics published figures showing that the annual inflation stood at 26.5% last month, up from 21.9% in December. In January 2022, the same figure stood at just 8%, before spiking after the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine the following month, shaking the world economy.

            During January, the prices of basic commodities in Egypt rose steadily. The cost of bread and cereal increased on average by 6.6% while the price of meat and poultry climbed by 20.6%, the bureau said. 











            The Egyptian economy has been hit hard by years of government austerity, the coronavirus pandemic and the fallout from the war in Ukraine. Egypt is the world’s largest wheat importer, with most of its imports having traditionally come from eastern Europe.

            Greatly affected by the enduring hikes are Egypt's lower-income households, most of whom are reliant on government subsidies for basic goods such as bread. Nearly 30% of Egyptians live in poverty, according to official figures.

            In December, Egyptian authorities and the International Monetary Fund agreed on a $3 billion bail-out package to ease the crisis. The IMF deal was struck in exchange for Egypt implementing a number of economic reforms, including a shift to a flexible exchange rate. The deal also allows for a further $14 billion in possible financing for Egypt.

            The value of the Egyptian pound has continued to slide following its decision to shift to a flexible exchange rate. The currency has lost around 50% of its value against the dollar since the start of 2022. 

            On Wednesday, the Egyptian government unveiled plans to sell stakes in dozens of state-controlled companies, including banks and energy firms. Economists have long criticized the economic dominance of the Egyptian government and the army, labelling it a barrier to private sector growth. 

            Egypt is also facing a foreign currency shortage. Many banks have placed limits on foreign cash withdrawals, while Egypt’s government announced it is postponing numerous future projects that would require significant foreign expenditure.CAIRO (AP) — Egypt's annual inflation surged to a new high in January as the country continues to battle ongoing price hikes and a depreciating currency, the Egyptian statistics bureau said on Thursday.The state-run Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics published figures showing that the annual inflation stood at 26.5% last month, up from 21.9% in December.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805287,The untold story behind Taiwan legislative speaker’s trip to the US,"Legislative Yuan President You Si-kun (游錫堃) recently made a whirlwind trip to Washington, D.C., where he joined important events including the International Religious Freedom (IRF) and National Prayer Breakfast. Additionally, he spoke publicly to condemn the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) expansionism, which looms over the world’s economic lifeline, the Taiwan Strait.Using “language that Xi Jinping (習近平) understands” You conveyed a resolution to never succumb to China, garnering praise from Washington’s political world. Many figures expressed their desire to meet You, though You could not do so due to time limitations.You only spent a day and a half in Washington, spanning Wednesday (Feb. 1) and Thursday (Feb. 2). He kept a low profile and met with numerous political figures from various countries, mostly in private.In November last year, when IRF Secretariat President Nadine Maenza met with then-former Vice President Chen Chieng-jen (陳建仁) and You during her trip to Taiwan, she told them about important events that would take place in Washington in February, extending a verbal invitation. Maenza, who visited the Tainan Theological College and Seminary the day before meeting You, saw a church newspaper that had been banned by the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1986, which included a story about You speaking at the Gikong Presbyterian Church as a Taiwan provincial assemblyman.After learning that You, now 76, contributed to establishing the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and served as a Taiwan provincial assemblyman, Yilan County magistrate, vice premier, secretary-general to the president, DPP chair, premier, and legislative speaker, Maenza exclaimed that he “is like an emblem of Taiwan’s contemporary history.” On the day of the meeting, she showed You the story on the church newspaper, which led You to share with her in detail Taiwan’s history and struggle to achieve democracy.Maenza told You during the conversation, “People in Washington should hear you speak about Taiwan’s history of fighting for democracy and freedom.” This became the background of You’s trip.During the events in Washington, You, as a key player in the history of Taiwan’s success and a great spokesperson, demonstrated that as a “normalized” country, Taiwan is mature and ready. Backed by his familiarity with Taiwan and U.S. politics, he pointed out that the U.S. government’s claim that its policies towards Taiwan include “one Act, Three Communiques, Six Assurances” is outdated.According to You, in the present situation, the policies include five acts, Six Assurances, and Three Communiques. The “five acts” include the Taiwan Relations Act (effective Jan. 1, 1979), Taiwan Travel Act (effective March 16, 2018), Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (effective Dec. 31, 2018, includes the Six Assurances), Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act (effective March 26, 2020), and Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (effective Dec. 27, 2020, influenced the establishment of the New Guidelines for U.S. Government Interactions with Taiwan Counterparts on April 10, 2021.)In addition to highlighting the increased number of acts bearing Taiwan’s name between 2018 and 2022, You argued that the Six Assurances are now supported by these laws, meaning their status has been elevated above the Three Communiques. This served as a reminder for the U.S.’ government to stay updated and follow the rule of law.You said in the U.S. that he believes Taiwan’s and Taiwan-U.S. relations’ “normalization” is inevitable and that the “abnormal” treatment Taiwan receives from the world’s countries due to China’s bullying will not last.“Integrity,” “honesty,” and “sophistication” sum up You’s trip. Sam Brownback, former U.S ambassador at-large for international religious freedom, said he was glad You visited and condemned China’s violence while U.S. International Religious Freedom Commissioner Frank Wolf told You in person that he should invite all U.S. parliamentarians to Taiwan rather than just a few because they should see the country.",2023/2/9,1738,Opinion

It was the first country to dispatch a rescue team to Taiwan, and the two countries have shared a bond and helped each other through disasters since.Under Chou’s leadership, the association not only made the donation but also called for the public to follow its example. It named parties including its own members, local medical associations, the Taiwan Medical General Practitioners Association, Taiwan Medical Clinics Association, Taiwan Dental Association, National Union of Chinese Medical Doctors’ Association, National Architecture Association R.O.C., Certificate Public Accountant Association R.O.C., Taiwan BAR Association, and E.SUN Bank, urging them to help fundraise.Since the earthquake occurred in Turkey, Taiwan has sent two search and rescue teams and set up an official bank account to accept monetary donations.

He highlighted the importance of democracy for all of European and said that this was ""our people's way home.""The Kremlin — which the Ukrainian president described as ""the most anti-European force"" in the world — wanted to destroy the way of life of all 27 countries of the European Union, he said. ""We will not allow that,"" he said.""This is our Europe, these are our rules, this is our way of life.""""Ukraine that is winning is going to be a member of the European Union,'' Zelenskyy said to further applause. ""Europe will always be, and remain Europe as long as we are together and as long as we take care of our Europe, as we take care of the European way of life,'' he said.Zelenskyy praised and clapped Europeans who had supported his country in ""this historic battle"" against Russia.Ahead of his address, Zelenskyy appeared with his hand on his heart in front of the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag while the European Parliament played his country's national anthem.""Ukraine is Europe and your nation's future is in the European Union,"" Metsola said in her speech.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805324,What's behind the euro's comeback against the US dollar,"The euro has recouped much of the losses it suffered against the US dollar in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the energy crisis that it unleashed.One euro is now worth $1.07, up about 13% from September last year when it sank to around $0.95, a 20-year-low.The resurgence of the common currency used by 20 countries in Europe has been spurred by a drop in energy prices, easing recession fears in the eurozone and at the European Central Bank (ECB), which continues to aggressively hike interest rates.The euro's rebound has also been aided by a weakening dollar as the US Federal Reserve slows its pace of monetary tightening in response to cooling inflation.""Market expectations around the severity of the crisis in Europe just three months ago were just too extreme…too many speculators were betting on a real bad crisis in Europe stemming from the Ukraine energy war,"" Viraj Patel, a foreign exchange analyst at Vanda Research, told DW. ""That just has not materialized in that way.""The euro endured a tumultuous 2022 as the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions against Russia pushed Europe into an unprecedented energy crisis.Natural gas prices soared to record levels, derailing the region's fragile post-pandemic economic recovery. The worsening economic prospects, including soaring inflation and rising borrowing costs, prompted economists to forecast a deep recession in the eurozone, dragging down the euro.While close economic ties with Moscow left the eurozone bearing the brunt of the energy crisis, the economic uncertainty quickly spread around the global economy. That prompted investors to take refuge in the dollar, seeing it as a safe haven. The dollar rose further against the euro.The euro also suffered because of the ECB's initial reluctance to raise interest rates. That meant key rates in the eurozone fell well below those in the US, where the Fed got off the blocks earlier with aggressive hikes. Higher yields in the US attracted foreign investors, boosting the dollar.""There was a feeling in the market that 'there is no alternative' to the dollar and therefore the dollar was so strong,"" Andreas König, head of global currency management at Amundi Asset Management, told DW.The euro's rise in recent months has a lot to do with a milder winter in Europe. Warmer than normal weather, aided by an impressive effort in cutting gas consumption, has not only eased concerns around blackouts and energy rationing but also reined in natural gas prices.The better-than-expected energy situation has brightened the prospects for the region's industries, suggesting that the eurozone may avoid a recession. The eurozone posted a surprise growth in output in the fourth quarter of 2022.The common currency is also being propped up by the ECB's hawkish stance. The central bank continues to aggressively hike rates to arrest inflation, which remains stubbornly high, even as its peers like the US Federal Reserve slow down a bit.""As interest rates in Europe rise faster than in the US, it benefits the euro and attracts capital inflows from elsewhere into the eurozone,"" Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING, told DW.The euro has also gained from a general weakness in the dollar. The greenback has fallen against a host of major currencies, including the British pound and the Japanese yen, in recent months as easing inflationary pressures in the US offers the Fed some more room to tone down its aggressive monetary stance.A stronger euro will help bring down inflation by making imports cheaper, much to the relief of the ECB. Imports like oil and gas and other commodities are mostly denominated in dollars, so, when the dollar weakens, they become less expensive in euro terms.On the other hand, it would also make exports more expensive, hurting growth in export-reliant countries like Germany. However, Brzeski says the euro still hasn't reached levels where it could pose a risk to European exports.""The negative impact [of the euro's rise] should be very limited,"" he said. ""It could also be outweighed, for example, by the reopening of China as there would be more demand for European goods from China now, no matter what the currency is doing.""For European travelers heading to the US, a stronger euro means their currency would be worth a lot more there than it was in September.The outlook for the euro remains uncertain given that the European economy is still not out of the woods. The threat of higher energy prices continues to linger, the war in Ukraine is still raging and a recession still hasn't been completely ruled out.Most analysts agree that the euro wouldn't go much higher from its current levels this year. König and Brzeski see the euro fluctuating between $1.05 and $1.10 in 2023.""The euro has done the easy part of the rally,"" Patel said. ""This is a very tricky environment right now, in the next 6 to 12 months, especially in a recession.""Edited by: Kristie Pladson",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805325,Why Bertolt Brecht is still played around the world,"On February 10, 2023, German author Bertolt Brecht would have turned 125.His native city of Augsburg is honoring him with a festival under the motto ""Worldwide Brecht,"" because the playwright, who was persecuted by the Nazis and had to live in exile for years, has long since become a German export hit.With his ""Threepenny Opera"" (1928), still one of the most performed musical theater pieces in the world, he conquered Great Britain and the US. But his pieces are also still regularly performed today in Japan, Poland and Togo.In Lome, Togo, for instance, director Ramses Alfa is staging one of Brecht's most famous plays, ""Mother Courage and Her Children,"" from 1941. It centers around a mother who tries to get her children through a war in one piece.Ramses Alfa's staging of the work calls to mind the female harvesters in the peanut fields of Togo, who work with their babies on their backs in scorching heat for meager wages, or the street vendors in the capital Lome, who walk around carrying large suitcases filled with lemonade, fruit and fabrics in search of customers in order to secure at least a small income for their families.""Brecht's emphasis on social issues makes him a writer for Africa,"" Alfa tells the Brecht Festival organizers.But Bertolt Brecht is also a well-known figure in Japan.According to research by Monika Ayugai, a scholar at the City University of New York, he was one of the most performed foreign authors at the beginning of the 21st century, only just behind William Shakespeare.A few years ago, Yagi Hiroshi, a theater scholar from Osaka, described Brecht as the German writer most often heard about in Japan.In exile, Brecht himself became involved with Japanese literature. While visiting his colleague Hella Wuolijoki in Finland, he discovered the Japanese drama ""The Sad Tale of a Woman, the Story of Chink Okichi,"" in which a 19th-century geisha seduces a US consul to save her hometown of Shimoda from shelling by the Americans. In return, she is humiliated by her fellow citizens as a tramp and a traitor.Brecht started translating the play, fascinated by the fate of the sex worker who is cast out despite her heroism. However, the translation was never competed.Workers, prostitutes, refugees: Ramses Alfa believes that one of the reasons why Brecht is still so popular almost 70 years after his death is because he relates stories of people who possess little, who are oppressed, who are at the bottom tiers of society. ""Brecht's heroes are often people from humble backgrounds,"" says Alfa, who is also an actor.Brecht spent 15 years in exile before returning to Germany after the Second World War, to East Germany. Again and again, he criticized the injustice of capitalism in his plays.""It sounds paradoxical, but Brecht, as a person and artist with extremely left-wing views, should have been very close to the ideology and aesthetics of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, but he wasn't at all,"" notes Russian theater scholar Marina Davydova.Due to Putin's war against Ukraine, Davydova, who is one of Russia's most important theater scholars, was forced into exile and is currently the designated new drama director of the Salzburg Festival.

""Comrade"" Bertolt Brecht, himself, was admitted to Soviet Russia rather hesitantly, as officials realized the explosive potential of his art. It was only during the so-called Khrushchev Thaw, the period following Josef Stalin's death when repression and censorship in the USSR were somewhat relaxed, that Brecht made a breakthrough there.This made the figure of Bertolt Brecht all the more significant for the independent theater scene in the Soviet Union, Russia and other Eastern Bloc states, Davydova told DW: ""It is no coincidence, for example, that precisely the two most revolutionary theaters in all of Russia's postwar history — the Taganka Theater under director Yuri Lyubimov in the 1960s and 1970s and Kirill Serebrennikov's Gogol Center until its closure in July 2022 — paralleled Brecht's theatrical language.""In addition to the obvious contradiction between Brecht's theater and any totalitarian ideology, Davydova also sees an aesthetic dimension to the contradiction: classical Russian and also largely European theater is rooted in the realist tradition of Konstantin Stanislavski, which represents a certain counterpoint to Brecht's theater. ""With Stanislavski, the action takes place in a room with four walls, so to speak, and the actors pretend that the audience does not exist,"" Davydova analyzes. ""With Brecht, this 'fourth wall' is missing, his characters address the audience directly.""Precisely for this reason, Davydova sees the prospects as rather bleak that Brecht's theater would stand a chance in Putin's Russia of today. ""If Russian theater manages to survive at all, given the censorship that currently exists, then only in a kind of ivory tower, along the lines of: 'Something terrible is happening out there, but I'll take care of my metaphysical problems all by myself.' That kind of stance, however, is actually what Brecht's form of theater doesn't tolerate.""Theater maker Anastasia Patlay, who also fled Russia, confirms this opinion: ""Brecht demands commitment from every audience member, responsibility for what happens, even outside the theater,"" she said.Moscow's Theater.doc, for which Patlay most recently directed, also addressed the theme of social responsibility. The last play Patlay staged in Russia was called ""Memoria"" and was dedicated to two subjects: on the one hand, the closure of the Nobel Prize-winning human rights organization Memorial, and on the other, Bertolt Brecht's attempt to stand up for the actress Carola Näher at the end of the 1930s.Näher, who was the first to play the character Polly at the premiere of ""The Threepenny Opera,"" was arrested in the Soviet Union in 1936 and perished in the Gulag.

Anastasia Patlay is the first fellow of the ""Artists in Residence"" program at Brecht's birthplace in Augsburg, beginning in February. ""So Brecht has now granted us a home,"" Patlay says.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805327,"Supreme Court might have easy outs on elections, immigration","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court soon could find itself with easy ways out of two high-profile cases involving immigration and elections, if indeed the justices are looking to avoid potentially messy, divisive decisions.

            Off-ramps in those cases could prove attractive in a term with no shortage of big cases that could divide the court's six conservatives and three liberals. Affirmative action, voting rights, gay rights and student loan forgiveness also are on the agenda for a court that is less than a year removed from overturning nearly 50 years of constitutional protections for abortion and seeing a significant dip in public confidence.

            The Biden administration provided one possible way out for the court this week. A legal fight over turning away immigrants at the border because of the coronavirus pandemic, under a provision of federal law known as Title 42, is about to become irrelevant, the administration said in a court filing Tuesday.











            That’s because the administration recently announced that the public health emergency that justified the quick expulsion of immigrants will expire on May 11. 

            “Absent other relevant developments, the end of the public health emergency will (among other consequences) terminate the Title 42 orders and moot this case,” wrote the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar.

            The use of Title 42 began during Donald Trump’s presidency and continued after Joe Biden took office. It has been used millions of times to quickly turn away migrants at the border.

            Title 42 is at the root of a Supreme Court case that the justices in December put on a fast track, with arguments set for March 1. At issue isn’t the use of Title 42 itself but the question of whether a group of Republican states can insert themselves into a lawsuit over the policy. The states support keeping it in place. If it ends, they say illegal immigration will increase and they argue their interests aren’t represented in the case.

            The court could still rule before May 11, though that would be faster than usual. It’s also possible the policy's end date will be pushed back beyond that date. But if the public health emergency ends as planned and the justices do nothing until then, the case could end without a decision.

            When the court agreed to take the case in December, the justices were split. Five justices wanted to wade in and four justices — the court’s three liberals and conservative Neil Gorsuch — said they would not have gotten involved in the first place.

            The other case the court could dodge involves a closely watched elections issue and comes out of North Carolina. Last week the state's top court ordered a new look at the case.

            Republicans in North Carolina have asked the justices for a ruling that could leave state legislatures virtually unchecked in making rules for congressional and presidential elections. Such an outcome would for the first time validate what is known as the “independent state legislature” theory, which would dramatically enhance the power of state lawmakers over elections for president and Congress at the expense of state courts.

            The justices heard arguments in December in an appeal from Republicans who argued that the state Supreme Court, then with a Democratic majority, improperly tossed the state’s Republican-drawn congressional districts as excessively partisan and adopted a new map that produced a 7-7 split in November’s elections.

            Now a new Republican majority on the North Carolina high court has set new arguments for March. It’s unclear how long it might to take to reach a decision.

            The justices have been at work on a decision in the North Carolina case for more than two months, but the final word in this and other consequential cases often doesn't come until late June.

            So the court could wait to see what the North Carolina court does before reaching its own conclusions.

            Vikram Amar, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, said the court can always find a way out “if it wants to dodge the case,” including if the justices are finding trouble reaching consensus. 

            But Amar, who filed a brief opposing the Republicans in the case, said it's important for the court to weigh in.

            “The fact that they took the case in the first place tells us they think it needs resolution. Better to resolve this between election cycles,” Amar said.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court soon could find itself with easy ways out of two high-profile cases involving immigration and elections, if indeed the justices are looking to avoid potentially messy, divisive decisions.Off-ramps in those cases could prove attractive in a term with no shortage of big cases that could divide the court's six conservatives and three liberals.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805329,"US, French troops in Romania hold NATO military drills","CAPU MIDIA, Romania (AP) — U.S. and French troops that are part of a NATO battlegroup in Romania held a military exercise on Thursday to test the 30-nation alliance’s eastern flank defenses, as Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine nears its one-year anniversary.

            The joint combat drills at the Black Sea training range in Capu Midia, dubbed Eagle Royal 23, involved some 350 multinational battlegroup troops who practiced firing live ammunition from a U.S.-made HIMARS, a mobile, truck-mounted missile system. The HIMARS have been successfully used by Ukraine’s military against Russia.

            Romania’s defense ministry said that the goal of the drills — held between Feb. 2 to Feb. 10. — is to test NATO’s “interoperability of artillery systems” in a fictitious Article 5 collective defense scenario on the alliance's southeastern territory.











            NATO’s Article 5 is central to its founding treaty. The clause requires every alliance member to come to the assistance of any ally that requests it. Article 5 has been invoked only once: by the U.S. in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

            General Tricand de la Goutte of France, which leads the battlegroup, told the media that the purpose of the drill is to “reinforce common procedures” within the multinational group in case it faces ”a real defensive scenario.”

            In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, NATO bolstered its presence on Europe’s eastern flank, including by sending additional multinational battlegroups to alliance members Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Slovakia.

            Late last month, around 600 French soldiers deployed to Romania also held live combat exercises to test NATO's readiness in the region. That drill took place at a training range near Romania’s eastern town of Smardan and involved some 200 military vehicles, including four French Leclerc battle tanks.

            In January, NATO deployed surveillance planes to Romania, from where they will fly missions for several weeks to monitor Russian military activity near the alliance's borders.

            The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 5.1 earthquake hit residential areas in Jayapura, near Papua's northern coast and was centered at a depth of 22 kilometers (13 miles). Shallow quakes often cause more damage on the Earth's surface.

            “The residents were really panicked. I was in a car, and I felt like the car's wheels were lifted up,” said Tri Asih, a resident of Jayapura, Papua's capital.











            Officials said four people who were inside a floating restaurant died when the quake caused it to collapse into the sea.

            “The bodies of the four victims have been recovered,"" National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said at a news conference. ""The victims were trapped under the rubble of the cafe and covered by the roof.” 

            Rescue divers were searching the area around the cafeteria for possible survivors.

            Muhari said houses, buildings and medical facilities also were damaged. Some patients at the city's hospital were evacuated to its yard.

            A series of strong earthquakes has shaken Papua since January. The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency said it has recorded 1,079 earthquakes in Jayapura city and nearby areas since Jan. 2, with 132 of them strong enough to be felt by residents.

            Indonesia, a vast archipelago and a home to more than 270 million people, is frequently hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Basin.

            A magnitude 5.6 earthquake on Nov. 21 killed at least 331 people in West Java. It was the deadliest in Indonesia since a 2018 quake and tsunami in Sulawesi killed about 4,340 people.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805371,Super League organizers set out 80-team competition idea,"GENEVA (AP) — Organizers of the Super League project presented a long-promised new proposal Thursday for a multi-division competition involving up to 80 European soccer teams and operating outside of UEFA’s authority.

            Setting out 10 principles for the project, Spain-based A22 Sports Management said it had talked to “nearly 50 European clubs” about the revived proposal two years after the original idea collapsed. It is unclear if any clubs have supported the privately owned commercial project that would compete directly with the Champions League.

            The document follows an initial legal setback for A22 in December at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in a challenge to what it claims is monopoly control by UEFA, the governing body of European soccer. Advocate General Athanasios Rantos proposed then that the court recognize UEFA’s authority over European soccer competitions.











            An official ruling from the court is expected before the end of the season.

            “Our objective is to present a sustainable sporting project for European club competitions, available to, at a minimum, all 27 EU member states, as soon as possible after receipt of the judgment,” A22 said Thursday.

            The document provides detail on an idea first conceived by A22 leaders in 2021 that their next proposal would be a more inclusive multi-tier competition involving more countries.

            “Participation should be based on annual sporting merit and there should be no permanent members,” A22 said.

            Twelve clubs from Spain, Italy and England launched the original breakaway plan in April 2021. That project called for a 20-team league with 15 founders protected from relegation. It was backed by J.P. Morgan Chase bank, which later apologized for a “misjudgment.”

            The project collapsed within two days amid a fierce backlash from UEFA, fans and lawmakers, who in England threatened legislation to counter it. Only Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus publicly backed the case at court in Luxembourg.

            Barcelona president Joan Laporta said Thursday that the Super League was “progressing” while urging for more negotiations between its promoters and existing soccer authorities.

            “We don’t want our dialogue with UEFA to break down,” Laporta said. “I believe we need to establish a deeper debate with the national leagues to find a solution shared by all so the new Super League can coexist with the national leagues, just like now the national leagues coexist with the Champions League.”

            The latest proposal was met with derision by the Football Supporters’ Association in England.

            “The waking corpse that is the European Super League twitches again with all the self-awareness one associates with a zombie,” the FSA said in a statement.

            English clubs are still thought to be unlikely to join a revived breakaway plan. The Premier League’s international appeal and financial power has only grown in the past two years.

            The gap between England and the rest — typified by the Premier League’s domination of the January transfer window and record losses posted last year by Barcelona and Juventus — could persuade team officials across Europe to find alternative ways to compete.

            “To stay afloat, clubs in Spain and France have mortgaged their futures,” noted A22, whose initial project was widely seen as a kind out of bailout for storied teams which already had the highest revenues in world soccer.

            For any breakaway from UEFA to succeed, it would likely need support from clubs with international fan bases in smaller leagues like the Netherlands, Portugal and Scotland.

            “Participating clubs should remain fully committed to domestic tournaments, as they do today,” A22 said.

            While plotting two years ago to launch the Super League, the same clubs who also then controlled the European Club Association were in talks with UEFA about reforming the Champions League.

            UEFA approved those reforms in April 2021 despite the rupture in its relationship with clubs and they will take effect next year, creating more games and aiming for a 30% increase in revenue and prize money.

            The ECA on Thursday dismissed the latest announcement as “just another deliberately distorted and misleading attempt to destabilize the constructive work currently taking place between football’s real stakeholders.”

            In the 2024-25 season, a 36-team Champions League, up from the current 32, will guarantee eight games per club instead of six. The traditional group stage will be replaced by a league stage with a single standings.

            The new format will see the top eight teams advance to the round of 16, joined by winners in playoffs involving teams ranked Nos. 9-24. The two finalists will play 15 games throughout the competition, though teams Nos. 25-36 in the standings will play only eight.

            A22 said Thursday its format would offer the 60 to 80 clubs “a minimum of 14 guaranteed European matches each season.”

            UEFA has said 108 teams will play in its revamped competitions starting in 2024, with 36 each in the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805372,"Maryland governor, officials supporting abortion protections","ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and top state lawmakers announced support Thursday for a package of measures protecting abortion rights, including a state constitutional amendment. 

            House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson, who are both Democrats, joined the governor at a news conference to back a measure that would protect patients and providers in Maryland from criminal, civil and administrative penalties relating to abortion bans or restrictions in other states. Dozens of senators and delegates stood by them at a crowded announcement.

            “We’re going to make sure that Maryland is a safe haven for abortion rights long after I’m governor of this state,"" Moore said.











            Jones, who is sponsoring the constitutional amendment, noted that nearly half of the states are banning or heavily restricting abortion, including neighboring West Virginia. The speaker also emphasized the importance of protecting privacy. 

            “For the purpose of reproductive liberty and the safety of Maryland patients, providers and volunteers, what happens in Maryland is going to stay in Maryland,"" Jones said. ""The health care decisions we make about our bodies are deeply personal and should be between a person and their doctor.”

            In the package before lawmakers, a data-privacy bill will aim to protect medical and insurance records on reproductive health in electronic health information exchanges that can be shared quickly and widely across state lines. 

            “And in states that are incentivizing private citizens to turn on individuals who are providing any sort of assistance to those who are choosing to have an abortion we could be putting our health care providers and our patients seeking care in Maryland at risk,” said Sen. Shelly Hettleman, a Democrat who is sponsoring the bill.

            Patients would have to give permission for the records to be released, under the bill.

            Del. Ariana Kelly is sponsoring a measure to ensure public colleges and universities in Maryland have a plan for student access near campuses to birth control, including emergency contraception and abortion pills. 

            Kelly said the state already is seeing an increase in patients from other states after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last year to strike down Roe v. Wade.

            “We do know in Maryland, like in many states that provide access to abortion, there has been an increase in our patient load for some of our providers, particularly providers that border West Virginia,” Kelly, a Democrat, said, adding that Maryland also is seeing more patients from Texas. 

            Democrats hold a 102-39 majority over Republicans in the House, and they have a 34-13 advantage in the Senate. It would take a three-fifths vote in both chambers to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot for voters to have the final say next year.

            Ferguson said the constitutional amendment ""affords the highest level of protection against attacks on reproductive liberties and bodily autonomy.”

            “We protect freedom from prosecution and persecution from antiquated opinions and regressive policies, and we protect freedom from political interference, of political whims denying individuals’ right to self-determination,"" the Senate president said.

            In November, Vermont became the first state to approve a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights.

            The right to abortion already is protected in Maryland law. The state approved legislation in 1991 to protect abortion rights if the U.S. Supreme Court allowed abortion to be restricted. The Maryland law was petitioned to the ballot and voters approved the right in 1992 with 62% of the vote.

            Moore, a Democrat, demonstrated his support for abortion rights in one of his first acts as governor, when he announced last month that he was releasing $3.5 million in state funds to expand abortion training, money that had been withheld by his predecessor, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.

            Last year, lawmakers enacted a law over Hogan's veto to expand abortion access by ending a restriction that only physicians could provide abortions and requiring most insurance plans to cover abortion care without cost. The law removed a legal restriction preventing nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and physician assistants from providing abortions.

            Republicans said the constitutional amendment and related package of bills “are just another sign that the Maryland General Assembly is becoming the playground of symbolic gestures.”

            “Apparently, last year’s bill that created a massive expansion of abortion services was not enough. While we have yet to fully vet the additional bills proposed today, we are certain that becoming the abortion capital of the United States is not something to aspire to or be proud of,"" said Sen. Steve Hershey, the Senate minority leader, and Sen. Justin Ready, the Senate minority whip.ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland Gov.

The law removed a legal restriction preventing nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and physician assistants from providing abortions.Republicans said the constitutional amendment and related package of bills “are just another sign that the Maryland General Assembly is becoming the playground of symbolic gestures.”“Apparently, last year’s bill that created a massive expansion of abortion services was not enough. While we have yet to fully vet the additional bills proposed today, we are certain that becoming the abortion capital of the United States is not something to aspire to or be proud of,"" said Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805373,Former Barcelona coach Setién faces old team with Villarreal,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Quique Setién believed he had reached the pinnacle of his career three years ago when he was tapped to become the new coach of Barcelona.

            An enthusiast of the possession-based style forged in the 1990s by Johan Cruyff and defined by Barcelona ever since, Setién took over a squad led by Lionel Messi and sought to revitalize the team's attack.

            But the former midfielder's tenure ended after eight months following a humiliating 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in August 2020. Setién retreated to his home in rural northern Spain to regroup with his family and the cows that he occasionally mentioned as providing him with some peace. It would take two years for him to return to coaching when he signed with Villarreal in October.











            On Sunday, the 64-year-old Setién will face Barcelona for the first time since he was fired following a title-less campaign and a loss that has marked his career.

            Barcelona is in first place in the Spanish league and is looking to extend its eight-point lead over Real Madrid, which had its game against last-place Elche pushed back to Wednesday while it plays the Club World Cup in Morocco.

            Messi and other players that never seemed to gel with Setién are now gone, but Xavi Hernández has Barcelona playing better than Setién could ever manage in his short stint in charge.

            Setién had grabbed the attention of Barcelona in 2018 when he guided Real Betis to a 4-3 win at Camp Nou, the first home loss for Messi’s team at that point in more than two years. He then got his first job for an elite club in January 2020 when Barcelona let Ernesto Valverde go mid-season despite leading the league. Things, however, quickly fell apart.

            Speaking to former Spain coach Vicente del Bosque for Spanish newspaper El País only months into his coaching hiatus, Setién said that the loss to Bayern “left me seriously damaged.”

            “With that loss, you enter the history books of Barça,” he said. “I went through mourning.”

            Earlier this season, Barcelona beat Villarreal 3-0 in the second-to-last game under Unai Emery, who would soon leave the club he led to a Europa League title and semifinal appearance in the Champions League to take over Aston Villa.

            In came Setién. After a rough start, Villarreal is battling for a return to the Champions League with a top-four finish. The team beat Real Madrid 2-1 last month, but has sputtered recently with back-to-back losses. That included a 3-1 loss to Elche last weekend, the first victory of the season for the league’s worst team. Villarreal is in sixth place, four points behind fourth-place Atletico Madrid.

            “Elche was a very hard blow, but we want to bounce back by winning this Sunday,” said Villarreal defender Pau Torres, who is available to play after missing two games with a leg injury. “For us, the game depends on us pressing well and handling the ball well when we have it.”

            Villarreal will likely not win the possession battle at home against a Barcelona team led by Spain playmakers Pedri and Gavi.

            Striker Gerard Moreno may be doubtful after he trained individually on Thursday, but the club has not indicated if he has any fitness issues.

            If he can't go, then the attack will be left to wingers Yeremy Pino and Samuel Chukwueze, while midfielder Álex Baena leads the team with 10 goals across all competitions. Raúl Albiol anchors the defensive line.

            Sergio Busquets and Ousmane Dembélé remain sidelined with injuries for Barcelona.

            Third-place Real Sociedad visits Espanyol on Monday. Atletico is at Celta Vigo on Sunday, when Rayo Vallecano, which has surprisingly risen into fifth place, is at Getafe in a Madrid derby.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805374,Pepsi price hikes fuel 10% jump in the fourth-quarter sales,"PepsiCo reported better-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter after hiking prices for its drinks and snacks, but it warned that consumers may be less willing to accept those increases as this year progresses.

            Revenue rose more than 10% to $28 billion. That was better than the $26.8 billion Wall Street had forecast, according to analysts polled by FactSet.

            Pepsi raised prices 16% in the October-December period __ and 14% overall in 2022 __ as it battled double-digit percentage cost increases for ingredients like cooking oil, potatoes and seasonings. The price increases boosted results; Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker products booked double-digit revenue gains in North America even though sales volumes were down 1% and 3%, respectively. 











            In Europe, where Pepsi hiked prices by 20%, the company said costs for packaging materials, cooking oil and other commodities surged 141 percentage points. Revenue and sales volumes both fell in that market. Revenue and sales volumes rose elsewhere, including Asia and Latin America.

            Pepsi says consumers have been resilient so far in the face of higher prices, and continue to gravitate toward familiar brands like Doritos and Cheetos. Newer drinks, like the recently reformulated Pepsi Zero Sugar, are also pulling in customers. Pepsi Zero Sugar sales volumes jumped 26% in the fourth quarter, Pepsi Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said Thursday in a conference call with investors.

            But Johnston said the company wouldn't be surprised to see a mild recession in the U.S. and other developed markets in the second half of this year.

            “Right now the consumer is still quite good,"" he said. “But we also have to plan for multiple scenarios.”

            Pepsi’s net income fell 60% to $535 million, largely due to a $1.5 billion impairment charge for its SodaStream brand and other assets. 

            Pepsi said SodaStream, a $130 machine that lets users make their own carbonated drinks, is a discretionary purchase that has struggled in the current economic climate, particularly in Europe. Pepsi Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company reassessed the value of the brand in the fourth quarter, but continues to think SodaStream has great potential.

            Without one-time items, Pepsi earned $1.67 per share in the October-December period, beating analysts’ forecast of $1.65.

            The Purchase, New York, company expects to deliver organic revenue growth of 6% this year, a slower pace from its full-year organic growth of 14.4% in 2022. It also plans $1 billion in share repurchases.

            The company said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $7.20 per share, up 6% from 2022. That came in lower than Wall Street's forecast of $7.27 per share, according to FactSet.

            Pepsi also said it would buy back about $1 billion worth of its own shares and raised its annual dividend by 10%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805375,Far-right party banned from upcoming election in Greece,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s parliament has banned a far-right political party led by a jailed former lawmaker from participating in the general election later this year. 

            Parliament published the text of a legislative amendment Thursday that will disqualify the Greek National Party on the grounds that its leader has been convicted of a serious criminal offense. Lawmakers approved the amendment late Wednesday.

            Ilias Kasidiaris, who founded the breakaway party two years ago, is serving 13-year prison sentence for membership in and being a former leading member of Golden Dawn, a political party of neo-Nazi origins. 











            A court in 2020 designated Golden Dawn as a criminal organization for waging a campaign of violence against migrants and ideological opponents. Kasidiaris and other members of the Golden Dawn leadership were jailed as a result of the ruling. 

            Public Order Minister Takis Theodorikakos told state-run television Thursday that banning the Greek National Party was appropriate.

            “The Government did the right thing by responding to a demand from a vast majority of Greek citizens: to exclude a party led by a convicted member of a criminal organization.” 

            Elections are expected in April with the governing center-right New Democracy party leading but unlikely to gain an outright majority, opinion polls suggest. The likely stalemate is expected to trigger a repeat election the following month, when a new election law takes effect. 

            Recent polls suggest the Greek National Party would cross the threshold of 3% of the national vote needed to gain parliamentary representation. 

            The party on Thursday described the vote in parliament as a violation of the constitution and voters' rights, and vowed to set up its own unofficial ballot boxes on election day. 

            Golden Dawn — a party that held torch-lit rallies and included senior members who openly backed violence against migrants — was represented in parliament between 2012 and 2019 following four consecutive elections held during a major financial crisis. 

            During Wednesday's debate, lawmakers from the Greek Communist Party said they opposed the amendment, arguing that it could be misused to ban political activism in general. 

            A small right-wing opposition party in parliament, Hellenic Solution, also opposed the legislative initiative, describing it as unconstitutional.ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s parliament has banned a far-right political party led by a jailed former lawmaker from participating in the general election later this year.Parliament published the text of a legislative amendment Thursday that will disqualify the Greek National Party on the grounds that its leader has been convicted of a serious criminal offense.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805412,"Ireland, France meet in potential Six Nations title decider","The world’s top two teams meet in Dublin on Saturday for a Six Nations match that some have labeled a title decider — even in Round 2.

            Only one of those teams started the tournament looking like a world beater.

            And it certainly wasn’t France, which labored in seeing off Italy — the favorite again for the wooden spoon — 29-24 on Sunday and finished the game defending its tryline.











            It was top-ranked Ireland which put down a bigger early marker, subduing an expectant Cardiff crowd under the Principality Stadium roof by thrashing Wales 34-10, its worst Six Nations defeat at home in 22 years.

            Two victories. Five points apiece (taking in the attacking bonus point). That’s pretty much the start expected of two teams who look like Europe’s best bets to challenge the dominance of the southern hemisphere at the Rugby World Cup in seven months.

            Now they go head to head, with France protecting a 14-game winning run stretching back to November 2021 and Ireland having not lost in Dublin for two years. The visiting team on that occasion? France, of course.

            “You can’t just say, ‘It’s just another game,’” Ireland captain Jonathan Sexton said, “because it’s not.

            “It’s one we’ve waited a long time for and I’ve read that they want this test — to come to the Aviva (Stadium) and try and overturn us. It’s a huge game.”

            Fabien Galthie backed up Sexton’s assertion.

            “We haven’t played at the Aviva yet in these conditions, in a full stadium,” said the France coach, referencing his time in charge of the team after taking over following the 2019 Rugby World Cup.

            “Often I say to the players, ‘Welcome to the magnificent, to the sublime’ — who wants to swap places at kickoff in such a context, who wants to leave? There are few players who raise their finger.”

            The shadow of the looming World Cup plays a part in shaping this match between teams who were hard to split ahead of the Six Nations. The belief that victory will give cannot be understated, especially since it will establish the triumphant team as the favorite for the Six Nations.

            France is seeking back-to-back titles, after none since 2010, and Ireland a first since 2019.

            Preying on Irish minds will be a run of three straight defeats to France since the World Cup. It is the only major nation yet to lose against an Ireland team coached by Andy Farrell.

            Sexton is delighted to be involved, having been a late withdrawal ahead of the teams' previous two meetings because of injury issues. There were even some doubts this time round, with the 37-year-old flyhalf needing to undergo a head injury assessment and overcome a dead leg sustained against Wales to prove his availability.

            “I grew up in an era of watching Ireland lose to France, heavily,” Sexton said. ""To then sort of see the first teams beating them and then to be part of teams beating them has been amazing.

            “But you still have those memories from a young kid of France coming and demolishing Ireland. You probably naturally feel the underdog at my age, whereas the younger lads probably don’t.""

            One of those younger lads is influential hooker Dan Sheehan, who will be missing because of a hamstring injury. Rob Herring comes in as the replacement for the only change to either team from Round 1.

            France's changes came in the reserves, with flanker Francois Cros and scrumhalf Baptiste Couilloud returning to take the place of the less-experienced Thomas Lavault and Nolann Le Garrec, who made his debut against Italy.

            “We have been working with this starting XV for three weeks,"" Galthie said. ""We have little time, so it is important to create a coherent strategic and tactical structure.”

The belief that victory will give cannot be understated, especially since it will establish the triumphant team as the favorite for the Six Nations.France is seeking back-to-back titles, after none since 2010, and Ireland a first since 2019.Preying on Irish minds will be a run of three straight defeats to France since the World Cup. It is the only major nation yet to lose against an Ireland team coached by Andy Farrell.Sexton is delighted to be involved, having been a late withdrawal ahead of the teams' previous two meetings because of injury issues. There were even some doubts this time round, with the 37-year-old flyhalf needing to undergo a head injury assessment and overcome a dead leg sustained against Wales to prove his availability.“I grew up in an era of watching Ireland lose to France, heavily,” Sexton said. ""To then sort of see the first teams beating them and then to be part of teams beating them has been amazing.“But you still have those memories from a young kid of France coming and demolishing Ireland. You probably naturally feel the underdog at my age, whereas the younger lads probably don’t.""One of those younger lads is influential hooker Dan Sheehan, who will be missing because of a hamstring injury. Rob Herring comes in as the replacement for the only change to either team from Round 1.France's changes came in the reserves, with flanker Francois Cros and scrumhalf Baptiste Couilloud returning to take the place of the less-experienced Thomas Lavault and Nolann Le Garrec, who made his debut against Italy.“We have been working with this starting XV for three weeks,"" Galthie said. ""We have little time, so it is important to create a coherent strategic and tactical structure.”___Lineups:Ireland: Hugo Keenan, Mack Hansen, Garry Ringrose, Stuart McCloskey, James Lowe, Johnny Sexton (captain), Conor Murray; Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier, Peter O’Mahony, James Ryan, Tadhg Beirne, Finley Bealham, Rob Herring, Andrew Porter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805415,"FTX founder keeps talking, ignoring typical legal strategy","NEW YORK (AP) — For federal prosecutors, Sam Bankman-Fried could be the gift that keeps on giving. 

            After the November collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange he founded in 2019, Bankman-Fried unexpectedly gave a series of interviews intended to present his version of events. He was indicted in December and charged with perpetrating one of the biggest frauds in U.S. history — and he’s still talking, either in person or on the internet. 

            The atypical chattiness for a criminal defendant is likely causing Bankman-Fried’s attorneys to scratch their heads, or worse. Prosecutors can use any statements, tweets or other communications against him at his trial, which is scheduled for October. 











            “Prosecutors love when defendants shoot their mouths off,” said Daniel R. Alonso, a former federal prosecutor who is now a white-collar criminal defense attorney. If Bankman-Fried’s public comments before trial can be proven false during the trial, it may undermine his credibility with a jury, he said. 

            Bankman-Fried returned to Manhattan federal court on Thursday for a hearing into whether his bail package will be altered to prevent witness tampering. Prosecutors say he sent an encrypted message over the Signal texting app on Jan. 15 to the general counsel of FTX US, a likely witness for the government.

            Lawyers were scheduled to submit more information to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan by Monday before he makes a decision about the bail package. Bankman-Fried has been confined with electronic monitoring to his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California, since December. 

            Before its collapse, FTX was the world’s second-largest crypto exchange and Bankman-Fried, 30, was its CEO and a billionaire several times over, at least on paper. Celebrities and politicians alike vouched for FTX and its founder, and Bankman-Fried was considered a leading figure in the crypto world. 

            However, the broad collapse of cryptocurrencies last year caused severe financial stress for numerous companies in the crypto universe, from lenders to exchanges to firms focused on investing in digital assets. FTX sought bankruptcy protection in November after customers pulled out their money in the crypto equivalent of a bank run.

            Federal prosecutors have said Bankman-Fried devised “a scheme and artifice to defraud” FTX’s customers and investors right from FTX’s inception. They say he illegally diverted their money to cover expenses, debts and risky trades at Alameda Research, the crypto hedge fund he started in 2017, and to make lavish real estate purchases and large political donations.

            In interviews and Twitter posts, Bankman-Fried has said he never intended to defraud anyone. He’s maintained that running FTX took up all his time and that he was unaware of the financial problems at the hedge fund until it was too late. 

            Those assertions are likely to be refuted by one of the government’s key witnesses. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, has agreed to plead guilty for her role in FTX’s collapse and to testify against Bankman-Fried. In a plea hearing in December, Ellison said she knew FTX had used billions in customer funds to make loans to Alameda and agreed with Bankman-Fried and others to take steps to conceal the nature of the loans.

            Gary Wang, who co-founded FTX with Bankman-Fried, also struck a deal for cooperation. At his own plea hearing, Wang said that he made changes to computer code to enable FTX customer funds to be transferred to Alameda.

            Another claim made often by Bankman-Fried is that he’s trying to help recover funds for FTX customers, but that FTX’s new management has cut him off and has taken steps, including filing for bankruptcy protection, that could inhibit customers from getting their money back. 

            For instance, Bankman-Fried says that when FTX collapsed, outside parties had made funding offers totaling billions of dollars, and if given a few weeks the company could have raised enough money “to make customers substantially whole.” Instead, it was “strong-armed” into filing for bankruptcy protection by its main law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, a claim the firm denies. 

            Bankman-Fried has also frequently taken issue with decisions made by FTX’s new CEO, John Ray. Bankman-Fried has often claimed that FTX’s U.S. operation, which was considerably smaller than the international operations, was solvent at the time of the bankruptcy filing, a contention that Ray disputes. 

            “I’m still waiting for him to finally admit that FTX US is solvent and give customers their money back,” Bankman-Fried tweeted on Jan. 19. 

            Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify under oath in front of Congress in December with Ray, but that appearance was cancelled because of his arrest in the Bahamas, where FTX is based. 

            “The real risk Bankman-Fried runs in making public comments ‘explaining’ what happened is they could be seen as continuing efforts to mislead investors by regulators and prosecutors,” said Jeff Linehan, a former prosecutor in the financial crimes division of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. Linehan is now a criminal defense attorney.

            Some defendants will go through their entire legal ordeal without saying anything that isn’t first cleared by their attorneys.

            Before FTX collapsed, Bankman-Fried had built up a gigantic public persona. He spoke often to reporters, testified in front of Congress, and appeared at conferences to advocate for cryptocurrencies and his firm.

            AP Reporter Larry Neumeister contributed to this report from New York.NEW YORK (AP) — For federal prosecutors, Sam Bankman-Fried could be the gift that keeps on giving.After the November collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange he founded in 2019, Bankman-Fried unexpectedly gave a series of interviews intended to present his version of events. He was indicted in December and charged with perpetrating one of the biggest frauds in U.S. history — and he’s still talking, either in person or on the internet.The atypical chattiness for a criminal defendant is likely causing Bankman-Fried’s attorneys to scratch their heads, or worse. Prosecutors can use any statements, tweets or other communications against him at his trial, which is scheduled for October.“Prosecutors love when defendants shoot their mouths off,” said Daniel R. Alonso, a former federal prosecutor who is now a white-collar criminal defense attorney. If Bankman-Fried’s public comments before trial can be proven false during the trial, it may undermine his credibility with a jury, he said.Bankman-Fried returned to Manhattan federal court on Thursday for a hearing into whether his bail package will be altered to prevent witness tampering. Prosecutors say he sent an encrypted message over the Signal texting app on Jan. 15 to the general counsel of FTX US, a likely witness for the government.Lawyers were scheduled to submit more information to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan by Monday before he makes a decision about the bail package. Bankman-Fried has been confined with electronic monitoring to his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California, since December.Before its collapse, FTX was the world’s second-largest crypto exchange and Bankman-Fried, 30, was its CEO and a billionaire several times over, at least on paper. Celebrities and politicians alike vouched for FTX and its founder, and Bankman-Fried was considered a leading figure in the crypto world.However, the broad collapse of cryptocurrencies last year caused severe financial stress for numerous companies in the crypto universe, from lenders to exchanges to firms focused on investing in digital assets. FTX sought bankruptcy protection in November after customers pulled out their money in the crypto equivalent of a bank run.Federal prosecutors have said Bankman-Fried devised “a scheme and artifice to defraud” FTX’s customers and investors right from FTX’s inception. They say he illegally diverted their money to cover expenses, debts and risky trades at Alameda Research, the crypto hedge fund he started in 2017, and to make lavish real estate purchases and large political donations.In interviews and Twitter posts, Bankman-Fried has said he never intended to defraud anyone. He’s maintained that running FTX took up all his time and that he was unaware of the financial problems at the hedge fund until it was too late.Those assertions are likely to be refuted by one of the government’s key witnesses. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, has agreed to plead guilty for her role in FTX’s collapse and to testify against Bankman-Fried. In a plea hearing in December, Ellison said she knew FTX had used billions in customer funds to make loans to Alameda and agreed with Bankman-Fried and others to take steps to conceal the nature of the loans.Gary Wang, who co-founded FTX with Bankman-Fried, also struck a deal for cooperation. At his own plea hearing, Wang said that he made changes to computer code to enable FTX customer funds to be transferred to Alameda.Another claim made often by Bankman-Fried is that he’s trying to help recover funds for FTX customers, but that FTX’s new management has cut him off and has taken steps, including filing for bankruptcy protection, that could inhibit customers from getting their money back.For instance, Bankman-Fried says that when FTX collapsed, outside parties had made funding offers totaling billions of dollars, and if given a few weeks the company could have raised enough money “to make customers substantially whole.” Instead, it was “strong-armed” into filing for bankruptcy protection by its main law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, a claim the firm denies.Bankman-Fried has also frequently taken issue with decisions made by FTX’s new CEO, John Ray. Bankman-Fried has often claimed that FTX’s U.S. operation, which was considerably smaller than the international operations, was solvent at the time of the bankruptcy filing, a contention that Ray disputes.“I’m still waiting for him to finally admit that FTX US is solvent and give customers their money back,” Bankman-Fried tweeted on Jan. 19.Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify under oath in front of Congress in December with Ray, but that appearance was cancelled because of his arrest in the Bahamas, where FTX is based.“The real risk Bankman-Fried runs in making public comments ‘explaining’ what happened is they could be seen as continuing efforts to mislead investors by regulators and prosecutors,” said Jeff Linehan, a former prosecutor in the financial crimes division of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. Linehan is now a criminal defense attorney.Bankman-Fried’s comments at the time of FTX’s collapse could also come back to haunt him. On Nov. 7, as customers furiously demanded their money back, he tweeted “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.” He deleted the tweet the next day. On Nov. 11, FTX filed Chapter 11.Through a spokesman, Bankman-Fried decline to comment for this article.Some defendants will go through their entire legal ordeal without saying anything that isn’t first cleared by their attorneys.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805438,Toulouse playing 'Moneyball' to survive in French league,"PARIS (AP) — Operating with a small budget and no star player, Toulouse has found a way to survive in the French league.

            It all started in July 2020 when American investment firm RedBird Capital Partners acquired a majority stake in Toulouse and appointed Damien Comolli as president.

            “We work with companies that provide us with data,” Comolli told the French league’s website, “and then we have statisticians, our own software, our own algorithms, which help us in all the decisions we make in the management of the club.”











            The compilation and interpretation of data have helped Toulouse find value in a tough market. Toulouse has a budget of 40 million euros ($43 million) for this season compared to 700 million euros ($754 million) for French league leader Paris Saint-Germain and 250 million euros ($270 million) for Marseille. Only Auxerre, Clermont and Ajaccio have a smaller budget than Toulouse in the league.

            Promoted last year, Toulouse exploits data not just to recruit players, improve performance, limit injuries and analyze opponents, but also to make decisions about financial matters like the transfer budget, payroll and contract extensions.

            This “Moneyball” approach has contributed to Toulouse’s good season. The club is in in 12th place, 11 points above the relegation zone. By contrast, the other promoted teams, Ajaccio and Auxerre, are in the relegation zone.

            Written by Michael Lewis, the book Moneyball explores the success of the Oakland Athletics baseball team under general manager Billy Beane, showing how an emphasis on sabermetrics over more traditional methods helped them sign underrated players and outfox richer competitors.

            A former aeronautical engineer, Toulouse head of data Julien Demeaux and his staff analyze more than 60 leagues around the world. Toulouse also hired Brendan MacFarlane as head of recruitment in March 2021 to better assess things like technique and personality that are not picked up by data. MacFarlane was previously the lead scout in France for English club Brentford.

            Toulouse has relied on its analytical edge to build a smart squad. It gambled on players from the lower leagues in Western Europe, hoping that they would make the step up.

            The club signed English striker Rhys Healey from third-division club Milton Keynes Dons and Dutch playmaker Branco Van den Boomen from second-divison club De Graafschap in 2020. Both Healey and Van den Boomen proved instrumental in Toulouse’s promotion as Healey was the top scorer in the second division last season while Van den Boomen led that league in assists. Healey has only played three games this season because of a serious knee injury. On the other hand, Van den Boomen has had a tremendous impact with five goals and seven assists.

            Thijs Dallinga looked like a safe bet when Toulouse signed him last year. Dallinga scored 36 goals in all competitions for second-division club Excelsior Rotterdam last season. The Dutch striker initially struggled to adapt to a new environment, notching only two goals from his first 13 league games. But Dallinga has improved lately, scoring five goals in his last eight league games.

            A large database has also led Toulouse to snatch players from small, overlooked leagues in Eastern Europe. It signed midfielder Stijn Spierings from Bulgarian club Levski Sofia in 2020 and forward Said Hamulic from Polish club Stal Mielec last month.

            Toulouse prefers to sign players before they peak so that the transfer fee is still affordable. But it can also recruit more established players to bring a winning mentality and find a good mix between youth and experience. Danish center back Rasmus Nicolaisen, Belgian midfielder Brecht Dejaegere and Chilean left back Gabriel Suazo helped Midtjylland, Gent and Colo Colo, respectively, win trophies before joining Toulouse.

            Developing talent in its youth system is another way for Toulouse to keep costs down. Anthony Rouault, who graduated from the club’s academy, has started every league game this season and is already one of the best center backs in France at 21. Meanwhile, midfielder Fares Chaibi is having a breakthrough season at 20. The academy product has scored four goals and has four assists in the league.

            Toulouse has the sixth best academy in France behind PSG, Lyon, Rennes, Monaco and Lens, according to the International Center for Sports Studies, a research and education organization.

            Toulouse is still far from its glory days when it knocked out a Diego Maradona-led Napoli in the first round of the UEFA Cup in 1986 and finished third in the French league a year later, its best ever result.

            But the club’s rebirth feels like redemption for Comolli, whose reputation took a hit after Liverpool fired him as director of football in 2012 because of the huge amount of money spent on flops like Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam and Sebastian Coates. Even successful signings like Luis Suarez and Jordan Henderson couldn’t help Comolli save his job.

            Toulouse beat Reims 3-1 on Wednesday to reach the quarterfinals of the French Cup and will host Rennes in the league on Sunday.

            Toulouse is one of the three clubs owned by Americans in the French league. John Textor’s Eagle Football Holdings acquired Lyon last December and American billionaire Frank McCourt has been the owner of Marseille since 2016.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805439,Zelenskyy: Ukraine caught Russian plan to 'destroy' Moldova,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that his country has intercepted plans by Russian secret services to destroy Moldova, and Moldovan intelligence confirmed the claim.

            Speaking to European Union leaders in Brussels, Zelenskyy said he recently told Moldovan President Maia Sandu about the alleged scheme.

            “I have informed her that we have intercepted the plan of the destruction of Moldova by the Russian intelligence,"" Zelenskyy said through a translator. He said the documents showed “who, when and how"" the plan would “break the democracy of Moldova and establish control over Moldova.”











            Zelenskyy said the plan was very similar to the one devised by Russia to take over Ukraine. He added that he did not know whether Moscow ultimately ordered the plan to be carried out.

            After Zelenskyy’s comments, Moldova’s Intelligence and Security Service released a statement confirming it has received “respective information from our Ukrainian partners” and said it has also identified “subversive activities, aimed to undermine the Republic of Moldova, destabilize and violate public order.”

            “At the moment, we cannot provide more details as there is a risk of jeopardizing various ongoing operational activities,” the statement read, adding that all of Moldova’s state institutions “are working at full capacity and will not allow these challenges to happen.”

            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov charged last week that the West was considering turning Moldova into “another Ukraine.” He alleged that the West backed the 2020 election of the pro-Western Sandu, claiming that she is eager to take the country into NATO, merge Moldova with Romania and “practically is ready for anything.”

            In December, Moldova’s national intelligence agency warned that Russia could launch a new offensive this year with the aim of creating a land corridor through southern Ukraine to Moldova’s Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria.

            Transnistria broke away after a 1992 civil war but is not recognized by most countries. It extends roughly 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the eastern bank of the Dniester River to the country’s border with Ukraine. Russia has about 1,500 troops nominally as “peacekeepers” in the breakaway region.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805440,Eritrean leader dismisses as 'fantasy' alleged Tigray abuses,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Eritrea’s president in rare public comments has dismissed as “a fantasy” allegations that his country’s forces carried out rape, looting and other abuses in the war in neighboring Ethiopia’s Tigray region.

            President Isaias Afwerki, the only leader Eritrea has known in its 30 years since independence, spoke to journalists Thursday during a visit to Kenya during which the two countries announced the expected return of the long-reclusive Eritrea to a regional organization addressing security and drought.

            Since the start of the two-year Tigray conflict that killed an estimated half-million civilians and ended with a peace agreement in November, the presence of Eritrean forces allied with Ethiopian ones was a major issue.











            For months Ethiopia's government denied that Eritrean forces were even in Tigray. But human rights groups and United Nations experts alleged they were responsible for many abuses against ethnic Tigrayans, such as gang rapes.

            Eritrea is not a party to the peace deal, and some of its forces have remained inside Tigray, though the United States recently said they have withdrawn to the border area.

            The Eritrean president, who rarely speaks to independent media, said his country has “no intention of interfering” in the peace process in Ethiopia and has “no agenda"" there.

            “You talk about withdrawal, non-withdrawal, we say this is nonsense,” the 77-year-old leader said. “Don’t provoke us” to cause misunderstandings, he added: “Let’s assume that the peace process in Ethiopia is going without obstacles.”

            Growing visibly irritated with questions, Isaias also accused those alleging human rights abuses of “fabricating lies and misinformation” with an aim of disrupting the peace process. “You’re wasting your time,” he said.

            “Everybody talking about human rights, violations here and there, rape, looting, this is a fantasy,” the Eritrean leader said.

            Kenyan President William Ruto, for his part, asserted there has been “huge progress, tremendous progress” in Ethiopia’s peace process. Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was a facilitator of the peace talks.

            The conflict erupted in Tigray a year after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed received the Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with longtime rival Eritrea. The Ethiopian and Eritrean governments saw the Tigray regional leaders, who had long dominated Ethiopia’s government before Abiy took office, as a common threat.

            The conflict killed an estimated half-million civilians in Tigray alone, according to researchers with Ghent University in Belgium. Eritrea’s leader on Thursday didn’t respond to questions about the number of Eritreans killed.

            While the Kenyan and Eritrean leaders’ statement spoke of Eritrea considering a return to the Horn of Africa regional body the Intergovernmental Authority on Development as a member, Eritrea’s leader in his remarks said, “I readily say there is no question about that,” to applause.

            Eritrea and Kenya also are abolishing visa requirements for each other’s citizens effective immediately, and Kenya will open a diplomatic mission in Eritrea’s capital.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805442,6 Nations: Scotland seeks consistency vs much-changed Wales,"We’ve been here before with Scotland.

            An opening-round win over England in the Six Nations has sparked chatter about whether this, finally, could be the year the Scots put up a genuine challenge for a first title triumph this century.

            Indeed, it happened in each of the last two years — after an 11-6 victory at Twickenham in 2021 and a 20-17 victory over the auld enemy at Murrayfield in 2022.











            And what did Scotland go on to do in Round 2? Lose tight games to Wales both years.

            So, fans of the talented but underachieving boys in blue will likely head to Murrayfield with a certain amount of trepidation for the latest meeting with the Welsh on Saturday.

            “It’s already been a point of discussion in the group,” Scotland scrum coach Pieter de Villiers says.

            “Having a good win at Twickenham might have been such a moment of pleasure in the past that we might have been a bit slow to move on to the next game and that’s why I’m saying we can’t dwell on it. . . . We hope to show the growth this week.”

            Scotland actually hasn't won its opening two matches since 1996, but there are reasons to believe this year could be different — and it’s as much to do with the team Scotland will be facing.

            Wales appears to be in transition at the start of Warren Gatland's second spell as coach, with his first two team selections highlighting the dilemma he is facing.

            Does Gatland stick with the old guard who were pillars in his first successful stint from 2008-19 — the likes of Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric and Taulupe Faletau, who all started the 34-10 loss to Ireland last week — or try to bring through some of the country's promising youngsters in view of the Rugby World Cup?

            For the Scotland game, it's the latter. Jones (156 caps) and Tipuric (90 caps) haven't made the squad while Faletau, with his 96 caps, had to settle for a place among the reserves in a team featuring five changes in personnel — all in the pack.

            The inexperienced back row of Tommy Reffell, Christ Tshiunza and Jac Morgan has a combined age of 67, with Gatland saying he is “looking a bit to the future.”

            “We need to think about what’s important in this tournament — we still want to do well and Saturday is important — but we need to think long-term in the next seven or eight months,” Gatland says.

            Of the youngsters, he adds, “We don’t know how they can handle it.”

            Wales was blown away by the Irish inside the opening 30 minutes then the visitors eased up. Gatland felt his players held their own, which he is taking as a positive. Indeed, so happy was he with the inroads his backs made — for the paltry return of one try — that he selected an unchanged backline against Scotland.

            Gatland said he had never seen a stronger Scotland team during his time coaching in the Six Nations yet also noted the Scots' penchant for following one good result with a bad one.

            “I'm sure what they are talking about this week is consistency,” he says.

            Scotland's only change from 29-23 win over England has prop Zander Fagerson returning in place of WP Nel, who drops into the reserves.

            The team needed a wonder try from Duhan van der Merwe in the first half, a try by the same winger late in the match and also a few mistakes by England to claim victory. For that reason, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend is taking nothing for granted going into the Doddie Weir Cup — named after the Scotland great who died last year at the age of 52.

            “After a defeat, that's when a side comes out even stronger,” Townsend says. “They are fighting to stay in this championship, we are fighting to build on our win last week and be better.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805459,South Africa's Ramaphosa calls 'state of disaster' on power,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a state of disaster with immediate effect to deal with the country’s severe electricity crisis including prolonged daily power blackouts.

            “Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures. The energy crisis is an existential threat to our economy and social fabric,” said Ramaphosa in his State of the Nation address Thursday night. 

            The declaration of a state of disaster comes as rolling power cuts of up to 8 hours per day are hitting homes, factories and businesses across the nation of 60 million. The state of disaster is an emergency measure previously implemented to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the deadly floods that killed over 400 people last year.











            According to Ramaphosa, the declaration will enable his government to exempt essential services like hospitals and water treatment plants from power blackouts and enable the government to purchase additional power from neighboring countries on an emergency basis.

            It will also enable the government to assist businesses to deal with the effects of widespread power cuts, including making diesel-powered generators and solar panels more widely available.

            The country’s power utility Eskom is unable to produce adequate power due to frequent breakdowns at its aging coal-fired power stations and years of corruption.

            Ramaphosa also announced that he will appoint a minister of electricity, whose sole focus would be to deal with the electricity crisis.

            Ramaphosa’s speech was delayed for 45 minutes after disruptions by members of parliament from the leftist Economic Freedom Fighters opposition party, who were eventually removed from the sitting by security personnel.

            He is expected to reshuffle his Cabinet following the resignation of deputy president David Mabuza and changes in the leadership of the ruling African National Congress party. Ramaphosa is expected to appoint newly-elected ANC deputy president Paul Mashatile to replace Mabuza.JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a state of disaster with immediate effect to deal with the country’s severe electricity crisis including prolonged daily power blackouts.“Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805460,Rugby team Worcester Warriors 'will disappear' after merger,"WORCESTER, England (AP) — It seems the Worcester Warriors rugby team is no more.

            The English club was placed in compulsory liquidation and therefore automatically relegated from the Premiership last year while being pursued for unpaid tax, and was set a deadline of Feb. 14 to provide evidence that it met conditions to compete in the second-tier Championship.

            However, one of the men who led a consortium that took over Worcester told the BBC on Thursday the Warriors will be renamed Sixways Rugby — after the name of the team's stadium — and would instead be merging with fourth-tier team Stourbridge.











            “This decision will clearly upset and annoy a number of people,"" said director Jim O'Toole of ownership group Atlas. ""The sad fact of life is that the Worcester Warriors brand and the Worcester Warriors business is gone.

            “The name sadly will disappear.""

            England's Rugby Football Union would need to approve the club relocation and change of name. 

            The governing body said it asked “repeatedly” for information required to enable Worcester to compete in the second tier.

            “Deadlines were extended to provide the best possible chance for this to happen,” the RFU said.

            Players and staff at Worcester — including Scotland star Duhan van der Merwe — had their contracts terminated amid its financial problems, with the club owing Britain’s tax authority about 6 million pounds ($6.8 million). Owners Colin Goldring and Jason Whittingham were accused of asset-stripping the Warriors.

            Worcester's men’s team had been in the Premiership since 2015. It won England's Premiership Rugby Cup last season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805470,"Applications for jobless aid rise last week, but remain low","More Americans filed for jobless benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy, and hiring, to bring down inflation.

            Applications for jobless aid in the U.S. for the week ending Feb. 4 rose by 13,000 last week to 196,000, from 183,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It’s the fourth straight week claims were under 200,000.

            Jobless claims generally serve as a proxy for layoffs, which have been relatively low since the pandemic wiped out millions of jobs in the spring of 2020.











            The four-week moving average of claims, which flattens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 2,500 to 189,250. It’s the third straight week that the four-week moving average has been below 200,000 and the ninth straight weekly decline.

            Last week, the Fed raised its main lending rate by 25 basis points, its eighth rate hike in less than a year. The central bank’s benchmark rate is now in a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. Chair Jerome Powell appeared to suggest that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes.

            So far, the Fed’s aggressive policy has pushed inflation down, but has had less impact on a resilient U.S. job market.

            Last Friday, the government reported that employers added a sizzling 517,000 jobs in January and that the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, the lowest level since 1969. Analysts were expecting job gains of around 185,000.

            Last month’s job gains were so large it confounded economists, who struggled to explain why the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes haven’t slowed hiring at a time when many foresee a recession nearing.

            Also last week, the government reported that U.S. job openings rose to 11 million in December, up from 10.44 million in November and the highest since July. For 18 straight months, employers have posted at least 10 million openings — a level never reached before 2021 in Labor Department data going back to 2000. The number of openings in December meant that there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.

            Though the U.S. labor market remains robust, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, which is dealing with falling demand after a pandemic boom. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook parent Meta, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs recently.

            On Wednesday, The Walt Disney Co. said it will cut about 7,000 jobs as part of an ambitious companywide cost-savings plan and “strategic reorganization” announced by newly returned CEO Bob Iger. The job cuts amount to about 3% of the entertainment giant’s global workforce

            The Fed’s interest rate hikes have hit the real estate sector the hardest, largely due to higher mortgage rates — currently above 6% — that have slowed home sales for 11 straight months. That’s almost step-in-step with the Fed’s rate hikes that began last March.

            About 1.69 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended Jan. 28, an increase of 38,000 from the week before.More Americans filed for jobless benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy, and hiring, to bring down inflation.Applications for jobless aid in the U.S. for the week ending Feb. 4 rose by 13,000 last week to 196,000, from 183,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

The number of openings in December meant that there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.Though the U.S. labor market remains robust, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, which is dealing with falling demand after a pandemic boom. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook parent Meta, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs recently.On Wednesday, The Walt Disney Co. said it will cut about 7,000 jobs as part of an ambitious companywide cost-savings plan and “strategic reorganization” announced by newly returned CEO Bob Iger. The job cuts amount to about 3% of the entertainment giant’s global workforceThe Fed’s interest rate hikes have hit the real estate sector the hardest, largely due to higher mortgage rates — currently above 6% — that have slowed home sales for 11 straight months. That’s almost step-in-step with the Fed’s rate hikes that began last March.About 1.69 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended Jan. 28, an increase of 38,000 from the week before.",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805471,"Barcelona mayor brands Israel apartheid state, cuts ties","MADRID (AP) — The mayor of Barcelona has severed her city’s official ties with Israel, accusing the country of “the crime of apartheid against the Palestinian people.”

            Wednesday’s decision by Mayor Ada Colau has little practical impact – with the most concrete effect being a halt to its 25-year-old twinning agreement with Tel Aviv. 

            But the announcement by the city, a popular tourist destination and home to one of the world's best-known soccer clubs, carries significant symbolism and adds to a growing list of critics that have labeled Israel an apartheid state. Israel rejects such accusations as delegitimizing and antisemitic and called the decision “unfortunate.”











            In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Colau said the step came in response to a campaign by dozens of local groups and thousands of activists.

            She cited a number of Israeli policies, including its 55-year military occupation of the West Bank, its annexation of east Jerusalem and its construction of settlements on lands claimed by the Palestinians for a future state.

            “As mayor of Barcelona, a Mediterranean city and defender of human rights, I cannot be indifferent to the systematic violation of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian population,” she wrote. “It would be a severe mistake to apply a policy of double standards and turn a blind eye to a violation that has been, for decades, widely verified and documented by international organizations.” 

            In recent years, three well-known human rights groups – Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Israel’s B’Tselem – have accused Israel of apartheid, both inside the country as well as in the occupied territories.

            Amnesty and the other groups say the very fragmentation of the territories in which Palestinians live is part of an overall regime of control designed to maintain Jewish hegemony from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River.

            They point to discriminatory policies within Israel and in annexed east Jerusalem, Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been ruled by the Hamas militant group since 2007, and its continued control of the West Bank and construction of Jewish settlements that most of the international community considers illegal. The election of Israel's new hard-line government, dominated by ultranationalists opposed to Palestinian independence, has added to these concerns.

            The Palestinians seek the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza, areas captured by Israel in 1967, for a future independent state.

            Israel says its own Arab citizens, who make up about 20% of the population, enjoy equal rights, including the right to vote, and have reached the upper echelons of business, entertainment, law and entertainment. It considers the West Bank to be disputed territory whose status should be resolved through negotiations and says it it withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, two years before Hamas seized control.

            Israel’s Foreign Ministry called Barcelona’s decision “unfortunate” and claimed it went against the wishes of the majority of the city’s population. 

            “The decision gives support to extremists, terrorist organizations and antisemitism,” it said. “The friendship between Israel and Barcelona is long-standing, and is based on shared culture and values. Even this unfortunate decision will not damage this friendship.” 

            The grassroots Palestinian-led movement promoting a boycott of Israel welcomed Barcelona’s decision. Alys Samson, an activist with the “Stop Complicity with Israel” coalition in Barcelona, said the group had gathered almost 5,000 signatures for its campaign.

            “We are very happy,” she said. “We hope many more governments and institutions will follow suit.”

            Meanwhile, the mayor of Barcelona's arch rival Madrid immediately offered to take up the twinning agreement with Tel Aviv, as both he and Colau jostle for position on international issues and investment in an election year.

            José Luis Martínez-Almeida, the Spanish capital's conservative mayor, accused Barcelona's leader of antisemitism and tweeted that he had written to Tel Aviv's mayor to share “Madrid’s commitment to democracy and freedom."" 

            “It would be an honor to be twinned with Tel Aviv,” he added. Spain’s right-wing politicians are increasingly making diplomatic and commercial outreach to Israel.

            Spain’s two largest cities are constantly at odds on everything from politics to soccer. Colau, distrusted by the Catalan pro-independence movement, is a leading left-wing politician who is facing a difficult election in May.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805472,UK gives Northern Ireland more time to form a new government,"LONDON (AP) — The U.K. is giving Northern Ireland more time to form a new power-sharing government, eliminating the threat of elections that could derail efforts to renegotiate a post-Brexit trade deal for the region.

            Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris on Thursday introduced legislation extending the deadline for forming a new government by up to a year. Without the move, elections for the Northern Ireland Assembly would have been required by mid-April after the previous deadline passed on Jan. 19.

            Northern Ireland has been without a government for more than a year after politicians who want the region to remain part of the U.K. resigned over their opposition to the existing trade deal with the European Union, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.











            The protocol was an effort to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland by preserving the free flow of trade between the region and the Republic of Ireland, which share the only land border between the United Kingdom and the EU.

            The protocol requires border checks on some goods shipped from other parts of the U.K. to Northern Ireland to ensure that trade flows freely between the region and the Republic of Ireland to the south. The Democratic Unionist Party opposes the deal because it says the protocol treats Northern Ireland differently than the rest of U.K., undermining the region’s ties to Britain.

            Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris met Wednesday with EU Vice President Marcos Sefcovic amid efforts to renegotiate the protocol.

            “After considering my options, and engaging widely in Northern Ireland, I know that an election in the coming weeks will not be helpful or welcome,” Heaton-Harris said. “So I am introducing a bill to create more time for the parties to work together and return to government.”

            A new executive could be formed at any time over the next year if Northern Ireland's politicians agree.LONDON (AP) — The U.K. is giving Northern Ireland more time to form a new power-sharing government, eliminating the threat of elections that could derail efforts to renegotiate a post-Brexit trade deal for the region.Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris on Thursday introduced legislation extending the deadline for forming a new government by up to a year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805473,Everton manager Dyche aiming to add to Liverpool's woes,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Fresh from bringing Arsenal down to earth, Sean Dyche now has Liverpool in his sights and the chance to make himself an immediate icon among Everton fans.

            As one of English soccer’s ultimate disrupters, Everton’s new manager can upset the odds in Monday’s Merseyside derby and heap more misery on Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp.

            While Dyche has taken over a team in a fight for Premier League survival, Liverpool has troubles of its own.











            “I have no words for it really. I’m sorry,” Klopp said after a 3-0 loss at Wolverhampton last week that left the team in 10th place.

            It's now becoming a case of damage limitation for a team that challenged for an unprecedented four trophies last season, with Champions League qualification looking increasingly unlikely unless Liverpool goes on to win the competition this year.

            Such problems must sound like the stuff of dreams for an Everton team that had not won in the league since Oct. 22 before Dyche ended that run in his first game last week against leader Arsenal. Even after that morale-boosting result, the team remains in the relegation zone and only three points above last-place Southampton.

            In normal circumstances, a trip to Anfield might be considered the worst possible prospect — Everton has only won one of the last 27 derbies against its biggest rival. Dyche, however, has a history of upsetting the favorites, including a 1-0 win for Burnley at then-champion Liverpool in 2021.

            This is also not the same Liverpool that has dominated the Premier League — along with Manchester City — over the past four years. The loss at Wolverhampton was the seventh in the league this season and 10th in all competitions.

            Nottingham Forest, Leeds, Brentford and Brighton have all beaten Klopp’s once formidable team, which has only won one game this year.

            Klopp is struggling to cope after a host of injuries to key players, as well as the loss of forward Sadio Mane last year. His team is in transition and it is uncertain if he will be able to rebuild it to the point that he can continue to challenge City for major honors.

            Dyche, conversely, has the stage set to capitalize and fuel belief among Everton fans that he can lead the club to safety.

            Back-to-back games against Arsenal and Liverpool represented a daunting start for the new manager, while also explaining why Everton decided to fire Frank Lampard before that run. The club needed the energy and bounce that a change at the top can bring and that was evident against Arsenal.

            If Dyche can avoid losing on Monday, he would consider three of the next four games to be winnable against Leeds and Aston Villa at home and at Nottingham Forest. There is also a trip to Arsenal coming.

            While points are vital to Everton, so is the message that a win against Liverpool would send out.

            As the red half of Merseyside has flourished in recent years, the blue half has sunk to the point that Everton’s very place in the top division of English soccer is in jeopardy.

            Dyche was hired to avoid relegation and try to cut the gap between the teams. On Monday, he has the chance to make an immediate impression on one of the sport’s most historic rivalries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805475,"Ghana soccer player Atsu's well-being, whereabouts unknown","Ghana international soccer player Christian Atsu is missing after the earthquake in Turkey, his club and agent said Thursday, following earlier reports he was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building and taken to a hospital.

            Atsu's well-being and whereabouts were unknown. Aydin Toksoz, the deputy head of Hatayspor soccer club, told Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency news service that club sporting director Taner Savut was also missing after the massive earthquake that struck southern Turkey and Syria and has now killed more than 19,000 people, with that number expected to rise.

            The 31-year-old Atsu, who previously played for English clubs Chelsea and Newcastle, signed for Hatayspor late last year. The club is based in the southern city of Antakya, near the epicenter of the earthquake that struck in the early hours of Monday and devastated the region. Atsu and Savut were believed to have been in buildings that collapsed, the club had said.











            Nana Sechere, the agent for Atsu, said in messages to The Associated Press that he traveled to Turkey to try to find Atsu but the player “is yet to be found.”

            Hatayspor and the Ghana soccer association announced on Tuesday that Atsu was rescued from a ruined building on Monday night and taken to a medical facility for treatment.

            Toksoz said Hatayspor was now ""not able to confirm this information.”

            ""We have not been able to reach Atsu or Taner Savut,” Toksoz told the Anadolu Agency.

            Ghana's ambassador to Turkey said she was also searching for Atsu. Francisca Ahsitey-Odunton told Ghanaian radio she was given a list of 200 hospitals or medical facilities that Atsu could have been sent to if he was rescued and she had also been unable to confirm where the player was.

            She said she hoped he was in one of those hospitals and his location hadn't been confirmed “in all the confusion, which is understandable under the circumstances.""

            Antakya is one of the cities hardest hit by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which has destroyed thousands of buildings in Turkey alone and sent more than 110,000 rescue personnel scrambling to find survivors trapped under wreckage. More than 63,000 people have been injured in Turkey.

            Atsu scored late in injury time to give Hatayspor a 1-0 win over Istanblul-based Kasimpaşa S.K. in the Turkish league on Sunday, earning him praise from his new club hours before the earthquake struck.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805476,Russian diplomat says ties with US in 'unprecedented crisis',"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia-U.S. relations are in a state of “unprecedented crisis” without any sign of improvement, a senior Russian diplomat said Thursday.

            Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov argued that the White House's emphasis on increasing weapons supplies to Ukraine to ensure Russia's defeat leaves no room for diplomacy.

            “I don't see any prospect for a productive political and diplomatic process,” Ryabkov said at a briefing. “We have a very deep and unprecedented crisis in Russia-U.S. relations. The Biden administration has driven them into a deadlock.”











            Ryabkov warned that the U.S. and its allies must carefully assess the risks stemming from supplying increasingly powerful Western weapons to Ukraine.

            “The Americans need to thoroughly and deeply weigh the risks linked to their unabashedly cavalier course,” he said.

            Ryabkov noted that Moscow doesn't trust Western statements about self-imposed restrictions on a range of weapons supplied to Ukraine in order to avoid escalation, adding that such assurances in the past have served as cover for a steady expansion of the assortment of arms deliveries.

            “We don't see any sign of reason in any of the NATO and EU members' capitals,” Ryabkov said. “What they are doing isn’t going to strengthen their security.”

            He rejected the U.S. argument that Russia’s refusal to allow the resumption of inspections of its nuclear facilities represents a breach of the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact between the two countries.

            The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.

            Just days before the treaty was due to expire in February 2021, Russia and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years.

            Russia and the U.S. have suspended mutual inspections under New START since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Moscow last fall refused to allow their resumption, raising uncertainty about the pact’s future. Russia also indefinitely postponed a planned round of consultations under the treaty.

            The U.S. State Department last week said that Russia's refusal to allow the inspections “prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control.” It noted that nothing prevents Russian inspectors from conducting inspections of the U.S. facilities.

            Ryabkov on Thursday insisted that Russia has continued to comply with the treaty and exchange information in accordance with it. “We adhere to the treaty and observe its provisions,” he said.

            At the same time, he reaffirmed Moscow’s view that resuming inspections wasn’t possible in the current environment.

            Ryabkov’s comments followed a Russian Foreign Ministry’s statement declaring that it was impossible to maintain “business as usual” with Washington at a time when “the U.S. has effectively unleashed a total hybrid war against Russia, which is fraught with a real danger of a direct military confrontation between the two nuclear powers.”

            It charged that Washington’s demand for resuming inspections of Russian nuclear facilities sounds “cynical” after a recent series of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian air bases housing nuclear-capable strategic bombers that the ministry said relied on U.S. intelligence assistance.

            Ryabkov, who met recently with the new U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Lynne Tracy, also said that the Russian Foreign Ministry has lodged a formal complaint to the U.S. Embassy, charging that its use of social networks represented interference in Russia's domestic affairs.MOSCOW (AP) — Russia-U.S. relations are in a state of “unprecedented crisis” without any sign of improvement, a senior Russian diplomat said Thursday.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov argued that the White House's emphasis on increasing weapons supplies to Ukraine to ensure Russia's defeat leaves no room for diplomacy.“I don't see any prospect for a productive political and diplomatic process,” Ryabkov said at a briefing. “We have a very deep and unprecedented crisis in Russia-U.S. relations. The Biden administration has driven them into a deadlock.”Ryabkov warned that the U.S. and its allies must carefully assess the risks stemming from supplying increasingly powerful Western weapons to Ukraine.“The Americans need to thoroughly and deeply weigh the risks linked to their unabashedly cavalier course,” he said.Ryabkov noted that Moscow doesn't trust Western statements about self-imposed restrictions on a range of weapons supplied to Ukraine in order to avoid escalation, adding that such assurances in the past have served as cover for a steady expansion of the assortment of arms deliveries.“We don't see any sign of reason in any of the NATO and EU members' capitals,” Ryabkov said. “What they are doing isn’t going to strengthen their security.”He rejected the U.S. argument that Russia’s refusal to allow the resumption of inspections of its nuclear facilities represents a breach of the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact between the two countries.The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.Just days before the treaty was due to expire in February 2021, Russia and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years.Russia and the U.S. have suspended mutual inspections under New START since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Moscow last fall refused to allow their resumption, raising uncertainty about the pact’s future. Russia also indefinitely postponed a planned round of consultations under the treaty.The U.S. State Department last week said that Russia's refusal to allow the inspections “prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control.” It noted that nothing prevents Russian inspectors from conducting inspections of the U.S. facilities.Ryabkov on Thursday insisted that Russia has continued to comply with the treaty and exchange information in accordance with it. “We adhere to the treaty and observe its provisions,” he said.At the same time, he reaffirmed Moscow’s view that resuming inspections wasn’t possible in the current environment.Ryabkov’s comments followed a Russian Foreign Ministry’s statement declaring that it was impossible to maintain “business as usual” with Washington at a time when “the U.S. has effectively unleashed a total hybrid war against Russia, which is fraught with a real danger of a direct military confrontation between the two nuclear powers.”It charged that Washington’s demand for resuming inspections of Russian nuclear facilities sounds “cynical” after a recent series of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian air bases housing nuclear-capable strategic bombers that the ministry said relied on U.S. intelligence assistance.Ryabkov, who met recently with the new U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Lynne Tracy, also said that the Russian Foreign Ministry has lodged a formal complaint to the U.S. Embassy, charging that its use of social networks represented interference in Russia's domestic affairs.",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805477,Frankfurt's Kolo Muani emerging as Bundesliga's new star,"BERLIN (AP) — Randal Kolo Muani is quickly emerging as the new star of the Bundesliga, filling a void left by the departures of Robert Lewandowski and Erling Haaland.

            The 24-year-old France forward has started the year as he left off before the winter break — in blistering form for Eintracht Frankfurt.

            So far this year, he has six goals in five games for Frankfurt. He set up another in the team’s 3-0 win over Schalke in the first game back after the winter break. He scored in both league games before the break.











            “An unbelievable forward with brutal quality,” Frankfurt captain Sebastian Rode said of Kolo Muani, who equalized for a 1-1 draw at league leader Bayern Munich on Jan. 28.

            Kolo Muani has nine goals and set up 10 more in the Bundesliga — more assists than any other player in the league.

            Bad news for Cologne, which hosts Frankfurt on Sunday.

            Kolo Muani, who joined Frankfurt on a free transfer after his contract expired with Nantes last year, scored twice to help the team reach the German Cup quarterfinals with a 4-2 win over local rival Darmstadt on Tuesday.

            “I’m happy that I can show my qualities more and more and of course I benefit from my teammates, who play me in,” Kolo Muani said. “My deep runs work for my teammates who work hard for me to look good. We just work well together. Things are going really well for us at the moment.”

            Last weekend, Kolo Muani was feted by the home fans who sang “Kolo, Kolo, Kolo, Kolo, Kolo, Kolo, Kolo Muani!” after he scored twice against visiting Hertha Berlin.

            “It was a great feeling when the fans dedicated a song to me for the first time,” the player said. “I’ll keep working hard to make it happen again.”

            His goals have helped Frankfurt move up to fifth in the Bundesliga, only five points behind Bayern.

            “He’s an enrichment for the Bundesliga,” former West Germany captain Lothar Matthäus said after Kolo Muani scored in Munich. “I’m impressed with his performances over the whole season. He plays with joy, confidence and speed.”

            Kolo Muani earned his first call-up for France in September and was part of the squad that reached the World Cup final. He scored his penalty in the shootout loss to Argentina.

            So far this season, Kolo Muani has 14 goals in all competitions for Frankfurt. He has scored in each of his last four games.

            Also this weekend, Bayern hosts Bochum, which was knocked out of the German Cup by Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, Dortmund visits Werder Bremen and Union Berlin travels to Leipzig.

            Bayern leads Union by a point, with Dortmund two points further back. Both Union and Dortmund have won all their games so far this year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805541,Vatican touts new memoir by Benedict XVI's 2nd secretary,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Retired Pope Benedict XVI’s second secretary came out with a new memoir Thursday, a light, photo-filled daily journal that sharply contrasts with the bombshell tell-all book published last month by the late German pope’s main assistant.

            “My Days With Benedict XVI” by Archbishop Alfred Xuereb is the latest book to hit Italian bookshelves following Benedict's Dec. 31 death. It was launched Thursday at a semi-official Vatican event alongside another book by a longtime Vatican reporter “The Resignation: I Didn’t Flee.”

            The two new publications served to blunt, in some ways, the negative criticism of Francis that erupted in the weeks after the death of the first “emeritus pope” by refocusing attention on Benedict himself.











            Pope Francis recently acknowledged that Benedict’s death had been “instrumentalized” by conservatives to accentuate the idea of competing papal camps, a reference to the books, interviews and memos published by Benedict's longtime secretary, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, and some conservative cardinals that were highly critical of the reigning pontiff.

            Xuereb was the “second secretary” to Benedict during his 2005-2013 pontificate, and remained on as secretary to Francis for the first months of his papcy. Francis then placed Xuereb in his new Economy Ministry before making him ambassador to Korea and Mongolia, where Francis is expected to visit later this year in the first-ever papal visit.

            All of which suggests Xuereb remained on excellent terms with both Benedict and Francis, as his memoir “My Days with Benedict XVI” makes clear. The book reads as a daily journal, retracing Benedict’s travels, audiences, intimate lunches and jokes, as well as the tear-filled moments surrounding his historic resignation. But it ends when Xuereb bids Benedict farewell a few weeks into his retirement, and makes few comments about the current pontificate.

            The same cannot be said for “Nothing but the Truth: My Life Beside Pope Benedict XVI,” by Gaenswein, which also chronicled Benedict’s papacy but dedicated several chapters to his 10-year retirement and Gaenswein's not-so-easy relations with Francis.

            The Xuereb book launch Thursday suggested that his is the Benedict memoir the Vatican wants to promote: Held in the press conference room of Vatican Media, the launch was attended by the hierarchy of the Vatican communications office and was covered by Vatican Media. The book features a prologue by a former Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi.

            Xuereb, who attended via video conference from Seoul, was asked about Francis’ recent comments that Benedict’s death head been “instrumentalized” by critics of the current pontificate.

            “I agree, unfortunately,” Xuereb said, without elaborating.

            In one indiscretion, he confirmed that indeed Benedict had suffered from sleep problems though he said he had never heard him complain of insomnia. Recently, Benedict’s biographer said that chronic, years-long insomnia was the primary reason behind the 2013 resignation.

            “We never heard him talk about that with us, but we knew he had problems sleeping,” Xuereb said. He recalled the 2012 papal visit to Mexico, when Benedict fell during the night and hit his head. The episode was later cited as one of the reasons why Benedict resigned, believing that global travel was a pre-requisite for any pope and that he no longer was up to the task.

            “I remember that night in Mexico, he couldn’t sleep at all,” Xuereb said.VATICAN CITY (AP) — Retired Pope Benedict XVI’s second secretary came out with a new memoir Thursday, a light, photo-filled daily journal that sharply contrasts with the bombshell tell-all book published last month by the late German pope’s main assistant.“My Days With Benedict XVI” by Archbishop Alfred Xuereb is the latest book to hit Italian bookshelves following Benedict's Dec. 31 death.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805542,Super Bowl ads will tout Jesus 'gets us' to the masses,"The religiously wary, the spiritually curious — and anyone inclined to appeal to a higher power on game day — are the target audience for a Super Bowl ad campaign with a simple message: Jesus loves them.

            A group that includes wealthy Christian boosters is using the biggest megaphone TV marketing money can buy on Sunday to spread the word with two new ads that proclaim “He Gets Us.” 

            They hope to counter the notion that religion is used to divide people, spending about $20 million to reach more than 100 million viewers at a time when the nation’s Christian population — and religious affiliation of any kind — are in decline. 











            Because religion is a touchy subject and prime-time advertising is so expensive, it is rare for faith to be promoted alongside the Super Bowl 's perennially buzzed about beer and fast-food commercials. But the backers of the “He Gets Us” campaign see it as a great opportunity to reach so many people at once. 

            “It fits with our target audience really well,” said campaign spokesperson Jason Vanderground about the NFL and its big game. “We’re trying to get the message across to people who are spiritually open, but skeptical.” 

            Christianity is still in the majority in the U.S., with 63% of adults defining themselves as believers, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey. But that figure is down from 78% in 2007. About 29% of Americans define themselves as religiously unaffiliated, up from 16% in 2007.

            Within the NFL, Christianity has long permeated the culture, and regular fans are accustomed to expressions of faith, from locker-room prayers to Hail Mary passes to players pointing skyward after touchdowns. 

            That may help explain why there are so few faith-related ads during the big game, said Paul Putz, assistant director of Baylor University’s Faith & Sports Institute. “Football players themselves have often been the advertisements for Jesus,” he said.

            The league's religious undercurrent was thrust into the spotlight last month after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed during a crucial game with Cincinnati. Those watching witnessed players praying on the field as medics worked to save Hamlin’s life. An outpouring of public prayer followed for days.

            Some advertisers, like the Church of Scientology, have opted to air regional ads during the game. But the 30-second and 60-second “He Gets Us” spots will join a modest list of past faith-based ads aired nationally, including some that spurred controversy. 

            In 2010, the anticipated debut of a Super Bowl ad by Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian ministry long involved in anti-abortion efforts, received pushback from abortion-rights advocates and others in the run-up to the game. The ad featured Pam Tebow, mother of football star Tim Tebow, talking about her challenging pregnancy with her son. She chose not to have an abortion despite medical concerns.

            “I think we ended up in the Top 10 for the most controversial ads … that wasn’t the one I wanted, but it’s OK. I communicated a message,” said Focus on the Family CEO Jim Daly. He said the goal was to reach the most people with “a quick story about the positivity of choosing life.” 

            In spite of the controversy, Daly said he considers the ad a success. The ministry later shared the story of a woman who said she decided not to get an abortion after seeing the ad.

            On other occasions, religious themes have been used in a light-hearted way to sell everyday products: In 2018, a Toyota ad featured nuns, a priest, a rabbi, an imam and a Buddhist monk. A California church created a humorous Doritos ad that aired in 2010 after winning the snack brand's Super Bowl ad contest.

            On Sunday, one “He Gets Us” ad will be shown during each half. One will focus on how children demonstrate Jesus’ love, while the other deals with anger, and how Jesus modeled a different way. 

            “We think Jesus is a big deal and we want to make a big deal out of it,” Vanderground said. “What better way to do that than to put him in the biggest cultural moment that we have the entire year?”

            The “He Gets Us” campaign, which was launched in March 2022, is funded by Hobby Lobby CEO David Green and other anonymous donors. The ads direct people to a website, where they can learn more about Jesus, find Bible reading plans and connect with people online or in-person who can answer their questions. 

            Super Bowl ads draw enormous attention — sometimes too much — so any company or organization considering spending $6.5 million for 30 seconds of air time needs to weigh the pros and cons, experts say.

            “It’s incredibly powerful because you really get to reach people, but you also are inviting lots of discussion and scrutiny and feedback,” said Tim Calkins, a Northwestern University marketing professor. A religious organization might decide, for example, that its money would be better spent directly funding programs that benefit people in their community, he said. 

            There just isn't a huge need to spend millions on Super Bowl ads about Jesus, said Putz of the Faith & Sports Institute.

            “Christians can get the word out for free through the network of Christian athletes and coaches developed by sports ministries,” he said. These ministries began building connections across the NFL during the 1950s — before the Super Bowl had become a major televised event — and believed that players and coaches would serve as unofficial ambassadors for Christianity, on and off the field, through their words and deeds.

            Putz said Don McClanen, founder of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, put it best: “If athletes can endorse shaving cream, razor blades and cigarettes, surely they can endorse the Lord, too.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805544,"New ""Toy Story,"" ""Frozen"" and ""Zootopia"" movies on tap","Disney is working on sequels for “Toy Story,” “Frozen” and “Zootopia,” three huge hits as the entertainment powerhouse attempts to find its footing under newly returned CEO Bob Iger. 

            The Walt Disney Co. is undergoing a “strategic transformation,” Iger said on Wednesday. That includes 7,000 job cuts announced this week and a renewed focus on core brands and franchises. 

            Iger, who returned as CEO in November following a challenging two-year tenure by his handpicked successor, Bob Chapek, announced the plans for the new movies during Disney's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. 











            Disney owns Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar. Its latest Marvel movie, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” opens on Feb. 17. 

            The Burbank, California, company said it wants to make sure that executives in charge of content creation have a prominent say in what movies, TV shows or other content to produce, as well as the marketing and distribution of those products. 

            “Toy Story” is a long-time movie franchise for Disney. The original film, which was the first computer-animated feature film and the debut feature release from Pixar Animation Studios, came out in 1995. It received a Special Achievement Academy Award in 1996, as there was no best animated feature film category at the time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805545,"Nicaragua frees 222 opponents of Ortega, sends them to US","MEXICO CITY (AP) — In the middle of the night, political leaders, priests, students and activists languishing inside Nicaragua's most notorious prisons were awoken, given the clothes they had been arrested in and told to dress. Hours later, 222 of them, widely considered political prisoners, landed at a Washington-area airport, deported from their own country.

            The United States government said the massive release was both a “unilateral decision” by the government of President Daniel Ortega and the result of concerted diplomatic efforts.

            President Joe Biden said Thursday that the U.S. believes all political prisoners should be released.











            “And whether this is a token of their demonstration that they’re ready to begin to change the human rights policies or not remains to be seen,"" Biden said in an interview with Telemundo Noticias. ""But the fact that they were released, we’re happy to receive them and I’m glad they’re out.” 

             U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was a positive step.

            “The release of these individuals, one of whom is a U.S. citizen, by the government of Nicaragua marks a constructive step towards addressing human rights abuses in the country and opens the door to further dialogue between the United States and Nicaragua regarding issues of concern,” he said.

            It was a surprise move after months of intransigence by Ortega, including show trials and the sentencing of five Catholic priests earlier this week, all of whom were apparently on Thursday's flight. Ortega had not tempered his rhetoric about alleged “Yankee” interference in his country and at least publicly had not signaled that mounting U.S. sanctions against his family and inner circle were having the desired effect.

            Ortega has maintained that his imprisoned opponents and others were behind 2018 street protests he claims were a plot to overthrow him. Tens of thousands have fled into exile since Nicaraguan security forces violently put down those antigovernment protests. 

            In a televised national address Thursday evening, Ortega denied there was any negotiation with the U.S.

            He said Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo said to him in recent days: “Why don’t we tell the ambassador to take all of these terrorists?”

            “It wasn’t about negotiating anything. That has to be clear,” Ortega said. “We’re not asking that they lift the sanctions. We aren’t asking for anything in return.” Nicaragua's president said the U.S. should “take their mercenaries.”

            U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Nicaragua had identified 224 prisoners to be sent on the plane, but two of them declined. They were not identified.

            Roman Catholic Bishop Rolando Álvarez was on a list of 39 prisoners who were not on the plane compiled by the nongovernmental group Mechanism for Recognition of Political Prisoners. Ortega said that Álvarez had refused to board the plane, saying he had to speak with the bishops. The bishop had been in house arrest, but Ortega said he was now being held in Modelo prison.

            Price said those who arrived in Washington came voluntarily and would receive humanitarian parole allowing them to stay in the country for two years. They were staying at hotels under responsibility of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security and the government would work with nongovernmental organizations to help in their resettlement.

            “It was the Nicaraguan government that decided to offer the opportunity to these individuals to travel the United States,” Price said. “When I say this is a product of American engagement, as you know, we have long called for the release of individuals imprisoned in Nicaragua for exercising their fundamental freedoms as a first step towards the restoration of democracy and an improved human rights climate in Nicaragua.”

            Outside a hotel in Northern Virginia where the Nicaraguans were staying, Juan Sebastian Chamorro, an opposition and pre-candidate to challenge Ortega for the presidency in 2018, told reporters of the information vacuum in which the expulsions occurred.

            “It was a complete surprise,” said Chamorro, a nephew of former President Violeta Chamorro. “Things were happening in the middle of the night that had never happened.” He said he was placed in a cell with some 25 other prisoners, which had never occurred before in the maximum security prison where he had virtually no contact with any other prisoners. 

            They were loaded onto buses and driven through the capital. They passed the court and for a moment they thought they were being taken there, but when the buses continued they saw only two options: the notorious Modelo prison near the airport or they would be put on a plane and expelled from Nicaragua.

            “Personally, I thought we were going to Modelo,” he said. At the door to the plane they were asked to sign forms assuring they were going voluntarily. Chamorro, who had been arrested June 8, 2021, said that being reunited with his wife and daughter was like a dream.

            Back in Nicaragua, while their plane was still in the air, a judge read a statement saying the 222 prisoners had been “deported.”

            Octavio Rothschuh, a magistrate on the Managua Appeals court, said the deportation was carried out under an order issued Wednesday that declared the prisoners “traitors to the country.” He said they were deported for actions that undermined Nicaragua’s independence and sovereignty. 

            Later Thursday, Nicaragua’s Congress unanimously approved a constitutional change allowing “traitors” to be stripped of their nationality. It will require a second vote in the next legislative session later this year.

            Wilma Nuñez, president of the Nicaragua Center for Human Rights, said in a statement that while the prisoners’ release was welcome, “deportation is a legal term that applies to foreigners who commit crimes in a country. They want to call exile a deportation, which is absolutely arbitrary and prohibited by international human rights norms.”

            Berta Valle, the wife of opposition leader Felix Maradiaga, also appeared with her husband in Virginia after the plane landed.

            According to U.S. officials, also among those aboard the flight were Cristiana Chamorro, who had been a leading presidential contender before her arrest in 2021. Daughter of former president Chamorro, she was sentenced last March to eight years in prison. She was convicted of money laundering through her mother’s nongovernmental organization as Ortega pursued NGOs that received foreign funding. She was being held under house arrest.

            Another one-time presidential hopeful Arturo Cruz was also on the flight, U.S. officials said.

            Ortega upped his pursuit of political opponents in early 2021, looking to clear the field ahead of presidential elections in November of that year. Security forces arrested seven potential presidential contenders and Ortega romped to a fourth consecutive term in elections that the U.S. and other countries termed a farce.

            Nicaraguan judges sentenced several opposition leaders, including former high-level officials of the governing Sandinista movement and former presidential contenders, to prison terms for “conspiracy to undermine national integrity.”

            Given the notoriously bad conditions at the infamous El Chipote prison and others, as well as the age of some of the opposition leaders, relatives had feared the terms may effectively be death sentences.

            Hugo Torres, a former Sandinista guerrilla leader who once led a raid that helped free then rebel Ortega from prison, died while awaiting trial. He was 73.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805546,Damar Hamlin put prayer in football back in the spotlight,"PHOENIX (AP) — When medical personnel rushed onto the field to save Damar Hamlin’s life after the Buffalo Bills’ defensive back collapsed during a game last month in Cincinnati, many people witnessing the horrifying scene did the only thing they could to help. They prayed.

            Players and coaches from both teams took a knee, held hands and through tear-filled eyes called on God to heal their fallen brother.

            Fans inside the stadium and millions of viewers watching at home did the same, sharing and posting their prayers on social media. In a moment of fear and desperation, prayer took center stage in the NFL.











            Over the next few days, #PrayForDamar was trending. Hamlin’s family and friends requested more prayers while he was hospitalized and after his release. Faith was back at the forefront in the NFL for the first time since praying on the field was referred to as Tebowing. 

            “They were impacted because they were seeing themselves,” Philadelphia Eagles chaplain Ted Winsley told The Associated Press. “They were smacked in the face with the reality of what this is. Damar was in that situation but that could be me. They were feeling for him but it reminded them that this is life or death. … And then it also causes you to come to grips with the fact that there is someone greater than me I have to trust in.""

            Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, who has established a Christ-centered culture in the organization, was pleased to see prayer emphasized during a difficult time.

            “We're very happy to see Damar doing well and it was very comforting to see a huge outpouring of support for him and people turning to God in what was a very scary time,"" Hunt told the AP. ""One of the things I’ve enjoyed about being associated with the NFL is all the locker rooms I’ve been in, God is always there. Players pray before the game, they pray after the game. So that wasn’t unusual in that regard but I think you saw more fans, more media recognizing the importance of prayer in a situation like that.”

            Hamlin believes there was a greater purpose for his pain.

            “What happened to me … is a direct example of God using me as a vessel to share my passion and my love directly from my heart with the entire world,” Hamlin said in a video. 

            Public display of faith is nothing new in football or sports. It started long before Tim Tebow and is part of each game.

            The late Herb Lusk is considered the first NFL player to pray on the field. Lusk was a little-used tailback for the Eagles when he ran 70 yards for a touchdown against the New York Giants on Oct. 9, 1977. 

            Lusk had already scored on a 1-yard run in that game. After his second score, he took a knee in the end zone and prayed.

            “I said, ‘Thank you, Jesus,’” Lusk recalled years later. “And then I said to myself, ‘It’s about time.’”

            Lusk never scored another touchdown and quit playing two years later to pursue ministry. Pastor Lusk led Greater Exodus Baptist Church in Philadelphia for 40 years until he died last September at age 69. Lusk also served as the chaplain for Eagles coaches for about 17 years. Winsley, who has been the players’ chaplain for over 20 years, now fills both roles.

            Hamlin’s recovery inspired a spiritual awakening among his teammates. In Buffalo’s first game after the incident, Nyheim Hines returned two kickoffs for TDs. It had a profound effect on Bills star quarterback Josh Allen.

            “I was just going around to my teammates saying, ‘God’s real,’” Allen said about his reaction when Hines scored.

            Players understand God doesn't have a rooting interest but they found comfort in feeling his presence in that moment.

            Many players struggle with success and failure. It’s difficult for some to deal with temptations away from the field. When it’s over, transitioning to life after football isn’t easy. Team chaplains try to help players better handle whatever comes their way, positive and negative.

            “My main message is helping athletes realize that their life is more than their sport,” Denver Broncos chaplain Reza Zadeh told the AP. “Sport is what they do. It’s not who they are. A football player is just simply what their vocation is, but it’s not their identity.""

            Hall of Fame defensive lineman Reggie White — a former Eagles, Packers and Panthers player known as the “Minister of Defense” — is credited with starting the postgame prayer circle at midfield in the 1980s. Now, it’s common to see players come together, hold hands and pray immediately after spending three hours hitting and tackling each other.

            “Regardless of winning or losing, or good or bad, it would be to honor God, that he would get the glory and that it’s about him, not about me,” Tebow told the AP.

            Jaguars kicker Riley Patterson made sure he did just that last month after kicking the game-winning field goal to cap Jacksonville’s 31-30 comeback victory over the Chargers in an AFC wild-card game.

            Patterson held his cross necklace in front of cameras while teammates lifted him on their shoulders.

            “I was making sure that not I, but he gets the glory for any action that I have here,” Patterson said on the AP Pro Football Podcast. “Nothing that I’ve done or my family will do is anything but a gift from God. … I’ve prayed many times that if I ever got in that situation that I would praise God with my actions and my words.""

            Winsley was part of a unique team that had a strong faith culture in 2017. The Eagles won the first Super Bowl in franchise history that season. The foundation for the team’s success was built by men of faith like Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles, Carson Wentz, Zach Ertz, Trey Burton, Jordan Hicks and others.

            Winsley and Burton baptized players in the cold tub at the team’s practice facility in 2016. Through weekly Bible studies together, a close-knit group of men bonded over their faith and overcame plenty of adversity on their way to a championship.

            These Eagles (16-3) are one win away from another Super Bowl title. They’ll face the Kansas City Chiefs (16-3) on Sunday.

            Winsley has watched them grow and develop in their faith journey throughout the year. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni is a steady presence at the weekly sessions for coaches. 

            “We’re just brothers trying to be better men and it’s creating a culture that I believe will remain,” Winsley said.

            Eagles QB Jalen Hurts, a finalist for AP NFL MVP, cited his favorite Bible verse when answering a question about criticism after leading the team to a 31-7 victory in the NFC championship over San Francisco.

            “It was a big surprise to many,” Hurts said about the Eagles drafting him in 2020. “My favorite verse, I went through a lot of stuff in college and it kind of stuck with me, John 13:7: ‘You may not know now but later you’ll understand.’ Hopefully people understand.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805562,Jan Vermeer's paintings remain shrouded in mystery,"The facades of two red brick houses stand out against a cloudy sky. In a narrow passageway between them a housemaid bends over a container, framed by a doorway. She's been scrubbing; the water is still shimmering in the gully. Two children are playing on the curb, while a woman sits in the open door of the house and sews. This scene of 17th-century middle-class life in the Dutch city of Delft is but a moment, one that is over in the blink of an eye — and yet it is one that lasts forever, immortalized by the Dutch painter Jan Vermeer (1632-1675), whose full name was Johannes Vermeer.Vermeer is considered the greatest painter of his era, alongside Rembrandt (1606-1669). He masterfully captured different materials and surfaces on his canvas: the rough brick, lead-glazed windows, weathered wooden shutters, whitewashed sections of walls. Everything looks real, almost photographic: the contrast of light and dark, the perspectives, the quiet that quivers with energy.""The Little Street"" is a masterpiece, as are all of Vermeer's other paintings that have survived, though there are not many of them.When he died in December 1675 at the age of 43, his oeuvre comprised 37 paintings; 28 are now on show at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, eight more than 26 years ago in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague. The works of art were borrowed from major international museums and from private collections in Europe and the US. Private sponsors reached deep into their wallets. It's the largest solo Vermeer show to date.What attracts Vermeer fans is difficult to describe: Vermeer's handling of the brush and paint, his technical skill, the virtuoso play with lighting effects, the composition, the fidelity of perspective. ""Vermeer was a master of light,"" said Gregor Weber, co-curator of the exhibition in Amsterdam. No artist has ever painted light like Vermeer, in a way that is realistic and yet full of enigmatic calm, he noted..Diana, the goddess of the hunt, is surrounded by companions. One of them washing Diana's feet. It's a scene from ancient mythology. The story of the chaste goddess was a popular subject of Dutch painting.The young Vermeer also idealized such figures. Italian influences are also evident in his work, even though the Delft native never left his hometown.At 21, Vermeer enrolled in the Delft Guild of Saint Luke as a master painter.He initially took up historical themes: scenes from the Bible, from ancient history, legends of saints.His brushstrokes are bold, creating large areas of color whose strong contrasts of light and dark are reminiscent of Italian role models, Caravaggio (1571-1610), for example.Scholars still puzzle over why Vermeer changed his subject of interest from 1656 onward.Was it a breakaway? No, Vermeer's switch to genre paintings was a leap in development. He began incorporating everyday scenes into his paintings: a maid pouring milk into a jug; a young girl writing letters; a daughter from a good family at a music lesson on the virginal, a small harpsichord.They are all interior scenes, with the exception of those two famous city views, ""The Little Street"" and the ""View of Delft.""They are imagined interiors and yet they provide intimate glimpses of everyday life in the 17th century. Time seems to stand still. ""Vermeer's paintings are not narratives in the sense that there's a lot going on, a lot of running around, like horses galloping or something falling to the ground or people fighting or something like that,"" says Vermeer expert Weber.

""His paintings are always very quiet, very introverted,"" adds Weber. Vermeer's works hold a secret. It's that very stillness that so fascinates today's audiences.Was it Pieter de Hooch (1629-1684) who influenced Vermeer?Scholars are still searching for answers. Vermeer refined his painting technique over the years.With small dabs of color, he created the illusion of light dancing on the surface. The elements of the painting become vivid, almost three-dimensional. The pearl of the girl with the pearl earring, for example, is simply depicted through reflections of light — no more, but also no less!His pointillism — a technique employing small, distinct dots of color in a pattern to create an image — made Vermeer famous.In 1664 and 1665, he painted interiors that stylistically belong together: It is always the young woman, sometimes with scales, sometimes with a water jug at the window, with a pearl necklace or even as a ""letter writer in yellow."" They are idealized scenes from daily life, each one well composed in and of itself.The master from Delft did not use the camera obscura, the pinhole camera, to find his perspective, as was previously assumed. The current theory is that he used the so-called pin-and-string method, in which he stuck a pin in his canvas and attached threads to it to draw his perspective lines. Other painters also used this technique. Restorers discovered by X-ray a barely detectable hole in many of the Vermeer paintings they examined.But that's not all. They also unearthed what the artist had originally intended to portray: a lute, for example, in the painting ""Woman with a Pearl Necklace,"" or a naked youth in the painting ""Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window,"" which Vermeer or an artist after him painted over because this would have been understood as an erotic allusion.Vermeer's late paintings are characterized by a strong incidence of light, yet the painting technique appears simplified.The Delft master may have painted his last picture in 1675, ""Lady Seated at a Virginal.""In Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, unlike previously in The Hague, the works hang in spacious rooms where heavy curtains provide atmosphere.All paintings are protected by a glass pane. For good reason: As recently as October, climate activists had attacked the world-famous ""Girl with the Pearl Earring"" with glue and red liquid, but the work remained undamaged.Jan Vermeer died impoverished in 1675. He left behind a wife and 10 underage children. Soon after his death, the artist was forgotten. It was not until the 19th century that art historians rediscovered his work.Today, Vermeer is considered one of the world's greatest painters, mainly because of the quality and originality of each painting — all masterpieces.Just days before the exhibition opens on February 10, over 150,000 tickets have already been sold. The show at the Rijksmuseum, which runs through June 4, 2023, has what it takes to become the art event of the year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805565,India: Electronic waste provides poor children a dangerous living,"Seelampur on the outskirts of New Delhi is home to India's largest electronic waste (e-waste) dismantling market where nearly 50,000 people scrape out a living extracting metals. Many of them are children who earn a living by dismantling, extracting and recycling e-waste.Thirteen-year-old Arbaz Ahmad and his friend Salman comb through the e-waste carrying a big plastic bag and breaking apart circuit boards and other parts of devices with their bare hands. They burn the material on the roadside to extract metals without wearing any protective gear. The duo sells the valuable metals they've managed to extract for around €5 ($5.4).""There are days when we work for more than 10 hours and earn more money. My earning depends on how fast I reach the dumping ground and what I get my hands on. There are days when I find useful metals,"" Ahmad said.Five years ago, Ahmad and his family had relocated to the Indian capital from Uttar Pradesh state in search of a living. To support and feed a family of six members, Ahmad's father, who also works as a laborer at the e-waste market, decided to put his son into this work.He is among thousands of children who burn toxic metals — including mercury, lead and arsenic — in the street. This massive industry at Seelampur is informal and unregulated.According to the Global E-waste Monitor 2020, the world dumped 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste in 2019. India produced 3.2 million metric tons of e-waste, much of which is dumped for dismantling and recycling in Seelampur with no regulations.Every day, trucks laden with discarded computers, desktops, screens, mobile phones and air conditioners deliver loads early in the morning.Pickers sift through the scrap and sort out circuit boards, batteries and capacitors. Some of it is submerged in chemical solutions or burned to retrieve small quantities of gold, copper and other metals. This acid bath exposes workers to toxins.India has tried to tackle this unregulated industry and introduced a series of laws in 2011 and 2016 mandating the authorization and registration of all e-waste recycling facilities, along with directives for workers to use protective equipment while dismantling the waste.However, activists say these laws are not strongly enforced and the majority of the e-waste market in India remains unregulated.The environmental NGO Toxics Link has spent years trying to pressure the government to introduce more stringent laws and oversee effective enforcement on ground. The NGO is concerned about the situation of children working in these hazardous conditions.Satish Sinha, associate director at Toxics Link, visits the Seelampur site regularly. During these visits, the NGO observed how poverty drives families to have their children extract e-waste for additonal income.""To stop child labor and prevent children from hazardous exposure of e-waste chemicals, the government should ensure effective implementation of existing laws on child protection and waste management. This can be achieved only if different agencies like children's rights groups work closely with other departments, like district-level administration,"" Sinha told DW.Parvez Mian, a doctor who treats patients from Seelampur area, is concerned about health risks for child e-waste pickers.His clinic is located in the congested alleys of Seelampur and treats many children every day who suffer from serious skin diseases and chronic lung infections due to continuous exposure to chemical-laden toxins found in the metals.""Every year the health situation only gets worse as the number of patients increases each year. There is a clear lack of awareness among the people working with hazardous chemicals, which is the reason for the growing number of children getting chronically sick,"" Mian told DW.Back in the narrow side streets of Seelampur, Ahmad and his friend are getting ready to dismantle and sort out the new batch of e-waste that arrived in the market. For them, this means more income. But it comes at a heavy price to their health.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805566,How Nagelsmann deals with Neuer and co. could define him,"The end can be sudden. A serious injury, a dramatic dip in form, a lucrative move to a less demanding competition. But, even if it's slower, the twilight of an athlete's career is difficult for both the person and the organization they represent. When a group of decorated players reach that stage together, the challenge can be enormous and the solutions opaque.It's what happened to the men's German national football team in the last few years. And it looks to be what's happening to Bayern Munich right now. With Robert Lewandowski sold to Barcelona, captain Manuel Neuer at loggerheads with the club after breaking his leg skiing and Thomas Müller's role diminished, coach Julian Nagelsmann is in the midst of a generational overhaul.""All great teams consist of players who recognize that as great as they might be, they're part of something that's bigger. And so the decisions that you make are in line with your commitment to the team. So there are things you wouldn't do, such as going skiing,"" Fergus Connolly told DW.Connolly has coached at elite teams across several sports including Liverpool FC, the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL, the Welsh national rugby team and teams in the Australian Football League (Aussie Rules). Similar scenarios to that in Bavaria can apply in different sporting contexts, he said.""Really good coaches can start to spot those players starting to put their own needs and desires in front of the team because they see it on the training ground beforehand,"" he added. ""It could be really small things, but they start to see those add up. That's when they know it's time to develop the replacement.""Elite level sportspeople require innate belief in their abilities in order to make it to the top. So, for them, recognizing decline can be difficult, if not impossible. The issues are exacerbated when a group of players of a similar age have success together but also decline at similar times.Former coach Joachim Löw was slow to recognize that his team of World Cup winners from 2014 needed refreshing. He then axed several senior players, including Müller, after 2018, only to re-open the door again for last year's tournament. He, and his team, paid the price for that indecision with successive group-stage exits at the last two World Cups and a lack of any clear succession plan.""It works both ways,"" said Connolly. ""Players become attached to a team and to a coach, and coaches also become attached to players. They get to know them, they do care for them. So it's a difficult decision to make.""In such circumstances, a change at the top can make moving on from a so-called golden generation easier.""I've been in conversations with coaches who have just been hired, and need to have tough conversations about getting rid of a player before they even start, because it will be more difficult to do later. I've even seen coaches use the injury of senior players as that glimmer of that moment they were waiting for. They've got his understudy ready to go, primed, and then they use that to push forward their replacement.""Sports psychologist Dan Abrahams, who has also worked with numerous high level athletes and clubs, believes that a generational change in an organization has to be treated carefully.""We have to appreciate that these are player's careers,"" Abrahams told DW.""If they've been in a successful team, they will feel a sense of belonging to the team that they've been associated with and feel they belong to a social group. If that group of players have been successful, then of course they're going to be quite protective of that. Then if somebody from the outside comes in and there is a feeling that this person, or these people, want to disband this force, that can that can cause stress responses, anxiety, anger and frustration.""On that human level, it's easy to see why great teams, such as 2020 treble winners Bayern, can struggle with such change. Whatever the sport and whatever the team, those in charge must decide whether changing leadership structures among the players (Neuer), transferring certain senior players out (Lewandowski) or simply reducing their roles (Müller) is the best way to deal with sporting decline.Abrahams says there are ways to make it easier for those players. ""You've always got to give them plausible, honest answers to questions about their status at the club and also try to lessen the threat to them.""That threat often comes in the form of younger players, or replacements lined up from outside the organization. The competitive nature of most top-level sportspeople means few will help those who will eventually replace them, even if it would be to the benefit of their team, said Connolly. But he added that those who do have great value to a coach, particularly if they buy in to the culture he or she is trying to create.""If you're not on the bus, you're not in the cafeteria, or you're not at training, you don't know who's actively contributing, and then who might be undermining the culture,"" Connolly said. ""And sometimes that's where a coach's decision might be difficult to understand. But a coach has a lot more to think about than just the game.""That much is clear. The problem of replacing a cluster of senior players without upsetting a successful side is solvable but requires coaches and organizational leaders to lean much more on empathy and communication than tactics or strategy. Nagelsmann picked up on this at the start of the season, saying he wanted to: ""be a bit less focused on tactics, more on leadership.""It hasn't always gone entirely to plan just yet. How Nagelsmann handles the issues around Neuer and other senior players will have an impact that stretches beyond the immediate and the pitch.",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805567,"For Pakistani women, social media can be deadly","In Pakistan, the brutal practice of ""honor killing"" is often carried out by male family members when they consider a woman's behavior ""disgraceful,"" whether that means by refusing an arranged marriage, being the victim of rape, or in the internet age, posting videos on social media.In January, a teenage girl was shot dead in a village in Pakistan's northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a male colleague uploaded a video of her dancing on TikTok. She worked as a maid and refused the man's romantic advances. In response, he uploaded the video and sent it to some residents of her village.It is not the first time in the conservative Islamic nation that a girl was killed for dancing in a video on social media.In May 2012, five women were killed after a video surfaced on social media showing them singing and dancing at a wedding ceremony in Kohistan region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one of the most conservative areas of the province.Both incidents sparked outcry, but little is being done to protect women on social media. Nighat Dad, founder of Digital Rights Foundation, an NGO that advocates women's rights in the digital space, said that many women get into trouble after allowing their friends and family access to their personal information online, including images and videos.Dad told DW that she receives complaints from women about non-consensual use of information and content, which leads to blackmailing, threats, unsolicited contact, as well as defamation.These types of complaints make up about 72% of the cases she receives via her organization's hotline, she said.Women from all sections of Pakistani society face threats, blackmail and harassment online. Bushra Gohar, a former lawmaker from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told DW she has been threatened online by her political opponents and that social media has become a toxic space for women in the South Asian country.In Pakistan's extremely religious conservative regions, women face harm if they are photographed or if their images are made public.This can create mortal danger for women if their families consider ""honor"" to have been disgraced.  Dad said that some women have physically been abused by their families just for having their names and faces up on the internet.Blasphemy accusations are another danger on Pakistani social media, with numerous cases seen over the years involving people accused of insulting Islam online.Last year, a Pakistani court sentenced a Muslim woman to death for allegedly posting blasphemous material on WhatsApp.Kishwar Zehra, a Pakistani parliamentarian, believes that allegations of blasphemy against women are very difficult to disprove, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws also exacerbate the problem.""Instead of abolishing this law, which has also been used against women, we are introducing more religious laws that would create more problems,"" she said.Former lawmaker Gohar said that when she faced threats, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) did not take effective measures to address the issue.Zehra, whose party is part of the current government, also said that the agency is not effectively performing its duties.She said that the system works against women. ""I know women working at parliament who were harassed and blackmailed, but when I talked to male members to take up this case, they showed extreme reluctance,"" she said.Zehra added that the FIA asks too many irrelevant questions. ""If you are defamed on social media then you become socially outcast, and if the authorities also pester the complainants instead of nabbing the accused, why would women come forward to lodge their complaints?""Activist Dad said that the FIA has ""shown progress in how they respond to cases that victimize women, especially over intimate images,"" but added there is much more than can be done, if more resources were available.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805568,Charlie Hebdo earthquake cartoon triggers angry reaction,"A new cartoon published by the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo has sparked strong reactions on social media.Tweeted on Monday, the cartoon by artist Pierrick Juin is captioned ""Earthquake in Turkey,"" and shows heaps of rubble and collapsing buildings, along with a second caption: ""Don't even need to send tanks.""Many users reacted with anger, saying the cartoon makes light of the tragedy that has killed at least 17,500 people, leaving many more homeless.Omar Suleiman, a US Muslim scholar, wrote on Twitter that mocking the death of thousands of Muslims is the ""peak of how France has dehumanized us in every way.""Reactions on Twitter, in Turkish, French and some in English, ranged from decrying what is perceived as ""hate speech,"" ""stupid"" and ""racist"" to calling the magazine a ""disgrace to humanity"" for publishing the cartoon.A Turkish presidential spokesperson, Ibrahim Kalin, also reacted to the drawing: ""Modern barbarians!"" he tweeted. ""Suffocate in your hatred and grudges.""The cartoon can be interpreted as a snide comment on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's attacks against Kurdish militias in northern Syria, a region that corresponds to the areas affected by the earthquake.It also indirectly refers to Europe's weapons exports. Germany's long hesitation to send tanks to Ukraine has been a topic of international discussion, but in the 1990s the country provided hundreds of Leopard tanks to Turkey, a NATO ally, with the only condition being that it did not sell or give them to any third party. Turkey later used those tanks in a 2018 military operation against Kurds in northern Syria.With its provocative illustrations, Charlie Hebdo is no stranger to controversy.Following a publication of a caricature of Muhammad on its cover, the strongly secularist magazine was added to al-Qaeda's most wanted list in 2013. The offices of the publication were the target of a terrorist attack in 2015, which killed 12 people and injured 11 others. The world rallied for freedom of speech in the ensuing ""Je suis Charlie"" campaign.Earthquakes in Europe have equally inspired the Charlie Hebdo illustrators in the past.In 2016, a cartoon with the heading ""Earthquake Italian style"" lampooned the victims of a massive earthquake in Italy. The cartoon depicted blood-streaked victims as various pasta dishes.Critics attacked the magazine, saying ""This is not satire,"" while one of the cartoonists defended the cartoon as black humor.Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier",2023/2/9,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805570,'Shame for WHO': Victim of sex misconduct slams UN response,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — A woman who says she was victimized by a World Health Organization doctor during a recent Ebola outbreak in Congo said she is shocked that no senior officials were punished for the sexual abuse and exploitation claims involving dozens of women in the conflict-ridden country.

            On Monday, the AP reported on a confidential U.N. report that excused senior staffers for their mishandling of another case due to a “loophole” in how WHO defines victims of such behavior. 

            Anifa, a young Congolese woman who worked at an Ebola treatment center in Beni during the outbreak, said she could not understand WHO’s seeming excusal of misconduct. 











            “It is a shame for WHO to give work to the kinds of men who do not respect women,” she said, declining to share her full name, for fear it could hurt her future job prospects. Anifa said she had been offered a job by a WHO doctor in exchange for sex during the Ebola epidemic, but refused. The AP does not identify victims of sexual abuse.

            “Perhaps WHO does not consider us because we are Africans?” she asked. “As long as I am alive, I will hate the entire World Health Organization until (the perpetrators) are charged and punished.”

            Paula Donovan, co-leader of the Code Blue campaign, which seeks to hold the U.N. accountable for sexual offenses, said WHO member countries looked the other way on the agency’s sexual misconduct charges because they could not afford to weaken the institution during the coronavirus pandemic. 

            “Countries could not go after WHO because it was doing what the U.S. and other rich countries would not do during COVID, which is try to figure out how to get vaccines to the poor.”

            She said donor countries had likely made a disturbing calculation about the costs of responding to global health crises.

            “It is very depressing, but officials have essentially concluded this is the price that has to be paid, that some women are going to be sexually exploited.”

            The U.N. report was focused on a case first reported by the AP in May 2021, involving Dr. Jean-Paul Ngandu, who worked on the Ebola response in northeastern Congo in 2019. Shortly after his arrival, Ngandu met a young woman at a local restaurant. The two had sex later that evening, but the relationship soured, and the woman and her aunt complained to WHO that Ngandu had impregnated her. 

            AP obtained a copy of a notarized agreement between Ngandu and the woman, signed by two WHO staffers, in which he agreed to cover her health care costs and buy her land. 

            After concerns about the Ngandu case were raised to WHO's Geneva headquarters, “a decision was made not to investigate the complaint on the basis that it did not violate WHO’s (sexual exploitation and abuse) policy,” the U.N. report said. The report said this was because the woman was not a “beneficiary” of WHO, meaning she didn’t receive any humanitarian aid, and thus, did not qualify as a victim under WHO policy. 

            WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said repeatedly he is “outraged” by reports of sexual misconduct. But to date, no senior staffers linked to the sexual abuse allegations in Congo’s 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak — where more than 80 workers under the direction of WHO and other agencies were found to have abused or exploited women — have been fired.

            A panel appointed by Tedros to investigate the Congo sex abuse claims found numerous allegations of sexual assault by WHO staffers, including women forced to have abortions by their attackers and a 13-year-old girl who said a WHO driver took her to a hotel where she was raped.

            Tudi Diane Tumba, a coordinator at a Congolese organization that advocates for women’s rights, said they were still assessing complaints from young women and girls who alleged they were sexually abused or exploited by WHO officials during the Ebola epidemic.

            “It is very shameful if the WHO will not sanction Dr. Ngandu,” Tumba said. “I encourage women to denounce and shout louder so that these sexual abuses end.” Ngandu was not fired; his contract was not renewed, but he was not reprimanded by WHO.

            Some global health experts were unconvinced by Tedros’ professed indignation. 

            “It undermines the complete integrity of WHO that no one has lost their job over this,” said Sophie Harman, a professor of international politics at Queen Mary University in London. “If WHO is serious about gender equality, then it is time for Tedros to go.”

            WHO's director of communications insisted the agency was committed to addressing sexual misconduct. 

            “WHO is focused on continuing the deep and broad strengthening of our policies and practices, staffing, training and resourcing to prevent sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment,” said Gabriella Stern. 

            After the Congo allegations became public, WHO created a new department to address sexual exploitation, headed by Dr. Gaya Gamhewage. 

            In her interview with U.N. investigators, Gamhewage said that prior to being appointed, she had no knowledge of the WHO’s sexual misconduct policies and had not even read them.

The two had sex later that evening, but the relationship soured, and the woman and her aunt complained to WHO that Ngandu had impregnated her.AP obtained a copy of a notarized agreement between Ngandu and the woman, signed by two WHO staffers, in which he agreed to cover her health care costs and buy her land.After concerns about the Ngandu case were raised to WHO's Geneva headquarters, “a decision was made not to investigate the complaint on the basis that it did not violate WHO’s (sexual exploitation and abuse) policy,” the U.N. report said. The report said this was because the woman was not a “beneficiary” of WHO, meaning she didn’t receive any humanitarian aid, and thus, did not qualify as a victim under WHO policy.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said repeatedly he is “outraged” by reports of sexual misconduct. But to date, no senior staffers linked to the sexual abuse allegations in Congo’s 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak — where more than 80 workers under the direction of WHO and other agencies were found to have abused or exploited women — have been fired.A panel appointed by Tedros to investigate the Congo sex abuse claims found numerous allegations of sexual assault by WHO staffers, including women forced to have abortions by their attackers and a 13-year-old girl who said a WHO driver took her to a hotel where she was raped.Tudi Diane Tumba, a coordinator at a Congolese organization that advocates for women’s rights, said they were still assessing complaints from young women and girls who alleged they were sexually abused or exploited by WHO officials during the Ebola epidemic.“It is very shameful if the WHO will not sanction Dr. Ngandu,” Tumba said. “I encourage women to denounce and shout louder so that these sexual abuses end.” Ngandu was not fired; his contract was not renewed, but he was not reprimanded by WHO.Some global health experts were unconvinced by Tedros’ professed indignation.“It undermines the complete integrity of WHO that no one has lost their job over this,” said Sophie Harman, a professor of international politics at Queen Mary University in London. “If WHO is serious about gender equality, then it is time for Tedros to go.”WHO's director of communications insisted the agency was committed to addressing sexual misconduct.“WHO is focused on continuing the deep and broad strengthening of our policies and practices, staffing, training and resourcing to prevent sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment,” said Gabriella Stern.After the Congo allegations became public, WHO created a new department to address sexual exploitation, headed by Dr. Gaya Gamhewage.In her interview with U.N. investigators, Gamhewage said that prior to being appointed, she had no knowledge of the WHO’s sexual misconduct policies and had not even read them.____Cheng reported from London.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805571,"Burt Bacharach, legendary composer of pop songs, dies at 94","NEW YORK (AP) — Burt Bacharach, the singularly gifted and popular composer who delighted millions with the quirky arrangements and unforgettable melodies of ""Walk on By,"" ""Do You Know the Way to San Jose"" and dozens of other hits, has died at 94.

            The Grammy, Oscar and Tony-winning Bacharach died Wednesday at home in Los Angeles of natural causes, publicist Tina Brausam said Thursday.

            Over the past 70 years, only Lennon-McCartney, Carole King and a handful of others rivaled his genius for instantly catchy songs that remained performed, played and hummed long after they were written. He had a run of top 10 hits from the 1950s into the 21st century, and his music was heard everywhere from movie soundtracks and radios to home stereo systems and iPods, whether “Alfie” and “I Say a Little Prayer” or “I’ll Never Fall in Love Again” and “This Guy’s in Love with You.”











            Dionne Warwick was his favorite interpreter, but Bacharach, usually in tandem with lyricist Hal David, also created prime material for Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones and many others. Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Frank Sinatra were among the countless artists who covered his songs, with more recent performers who sung or sampled him including White Stripes, Twista and Ashanti. “Walk On By” alone was covered by everyone from Warwick and Isaac Hayes to the British punk band the Stranglers and Cyndi Lauper.

            Bacharach was both an innovator and throwback, and his career seemed to run parallel to the rock era. He grew up on jazz and classical music and had little taste for rock when he was breaking into the business in the 1950s. His appeal often seemed more aligned with Tin Pan Alley than with Bob Dylan, John Lennon and other writers who later emerged, but rock composers appreciated the depth of his seemingly old-fashioned sensibility.

            “The shorthand version of him is that he’s something to do with easy listening,” Elvis Costello, who wrote the 1998 album “Painted from Memory” with Bacharach, said in a 2018 interview with The Associated Press. “It may be agreeable to listen to these songs, but there’s nothing easy about them. Try playing them. Try singing them.”

            A box set, “The Songs of Bacharach & Costello,” is due to come out March 3.

            He triumphed in many artforms — and even at the racetrack. He was an eight-time Grammy winner, a prize-winning Broadway composer for “Promises, Promises” and a three-time Oscar winner. He received two Academy Awards in 1970, for the score of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and for the song “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head” (shared with David). In 1982, he and his then-wife, lyricist Carole Bayer Sager, won for “Best That You Can Do,” the theme from “Arthur. His other movie soundtracks included “What’s New, Pussycat?”, “Alfie” and the 1967 James Bond spoof “Casino Royale.”

            Bacharach was well rewarded, and well connected. He was a frequent guest at the White House, whether the president was Republican or Democrat. And in 2012, he was presented the Gershwin Prize by Barack Obama, who had sung a few seconds of “Walk on By” during a campaign appearance.

            In his life, and in his music, he stood apart. Fellow songwriter Sammy Cahn liked to joke that the smiling, wavy-haired Bacharach was the first composer he ever knew who didn’t look like a dentist. Bacharach was a “swinger,” as they called such men in his time, whose many romances included actor Angie Dickinson, to whom he was married from 1965-80, and Sager, his wife from 1982-1991. 

            Married four times, he formed his most lasting ties to work. He was a perfectionist who took three weeks to write “Alfie” and might spend hours tweaking a single chord. Sager once observed that Bacharach’s life routines essentially stayed the same — only the wives changed.

            It began with the melodies — strong yet interspersed with changing rhythms and surprising harmonics. He credited much of his style to his love of bebop and to his classical education, especially under the tutelage of Darius Milhaud, the famed composer. He once played a piece for piano, violin and oboe for Milhaud that contained a melody he was ashamed to have written, as 12-point atonal music was in vogue at the time. Milhaud, who liked the piece, advised the young man, ""Never be afraid of the melody.""

            ""That was a great affirmation for me,"" Bacharach recalled in 2004.

            Bacharach was essentially a pop composer, but his songs became hits for country artists (Marty Robbins), rhythm and blues performers (Chuck Jackson), soul (Franklin, Luther Vandross) and synth-pop (Naked Eyes). He reached a new generation of listeners in the 1990s with the help of Costello and others. 

            Mike Myers would recall hearing the sultry “The Look of Love” on the radio and finding fast inspiration for his “Austin Powers” retro spy comedies, in which Bacharach made cameos. 

            In the 21st century, he was still testing new ground, writing his own lyrics and recording with rapper Dr. Dre.

            He was married to his first wife, Paula Stewart, from 1953-58, and married for a fourth time, to Jane Hansen, in 1993. He is survived by Hansen, as well as his children Oliver, Raleigh and Cristopher, Brausam said. He was preceded in death by his daughter with Dickinson, Nikki Bacharach.

            Bacharach knew the very heights of acclaim, but he remembered himself as a loner growing up, a short and self-conscious boy so uncomfortable with being Jewish he even taunted other Jews. His favorite book as a kid was Ernest Hemingway’s “The Sun Also Rises”; he related to the sexually impotent Jake Barnes, regarding himself as “socially impotent.”

            He was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but soon moved to New York City. His father was a syndicated columnist, his mother a pianist who encouraged the boy to study music. Although he was more interested in sports, he practiced piano every day after school, not wanting to disappoint his mother. While still a minor, he would sneak into jazz clubs, bearing a fake ID, and hear such greats as Dizzy Gillespie and Count Basie.

            “They were just so incredibly exciting that all of a sudden, I got into music in a way I never had before,” he recalled in the memoir “Anyone Who Had a Heart,” published in 2013. “What I heard in those clubs turned my head around.”

            He was a poor student, but managed to gain a spot at the music conservatory at McGill University in Montreal. He wrote his first song at McGill and listened for months to Mel Torme’s “The Christmas Song.” Music also may have saved Bacharach’s life. He was drafted into the Army in the late 1940s and was still on active duty during the Korean War. But officers stateside soon learned of his gifts and wanted him around. When he did go overseas, it was to Germany, where he wrote orchestrations for a recreation center on the local military base.

            After his discharge, he returned to New York and tried to break into the music business. He had little success at first as a songwriter, but he became a popular arranger and accompanist, touring with Vic Damone, the Ames Brothers and Stewart, his eventual first wife. When a friend who had been touring with Marlene Dietrich was unable to make a show in Las Vegas, he asked Bacharach to step in.

            The young musician and ageless singer quickly clicked and Bacharach traveled the world with her in the late 1950s and early '60s. During each performance, she would introduce him in grand style: “I would like you to meet the man, he’s my arranger, he’s my accompanist, he’s my conductor, and I wish I could say he’s my composer. But that isn’t true. He’s everybody’s composer ... Burt Bacharach!”

            Meanwhile, he had met his ideal songwriter partner — David, as businesslike as Bacharach was mercurial, so domesticated that he would leave each night at 5 to catch the train back to his family on Long Island. Working in a tiny office in Broadway’s celebrated Brill Building, they produced their first million-seller, ""Magic Moments,"" sung in 1958 by Perry Como. In 1962, they spotted a backup singer for the Drifters, Warwick, who had a “very special kind of grace and elegance,” Bacharach recalled.

            The trio produced hit after hit. The songs were as complicated to record as they were easy to hear. Bacharach liked to experiment with time signatures and arrangements, such as having two pianists play on “Walk on By,” their performances just slightly out of sync to give the song “a jagged kind of feeling,” he wrote in his memoir.

            The Bacharach-David partnership ended with the dismal failure of a 1973 musical remake of ""Lost Horizon."" Bacharach became so depressed he isolated himself in his Del Mar vacation home and refused to work.

            ""I didn't want to write with Hal or anybody,"" he told the AP in 2004. Nor did he want to fulfill a commitment to record Warwick. She and David both sued him.

            “Burt’s transition is like losing a family member. These words I’ve been asked to write are being written with sadness over the loss of my Dear Friend and my Musical Partner,"" Warwick wrote in a statement Thursday. ""On the lighter side we laughed a lot and had our run ins but always found a way to let each other know our family like roots were the most important part of our relationship.”

            Bacharach and David eventually reconciled. When David died in 2012, Bacharach praised him for writing lyrics “like a miniature movie.” 

            Meanwhile, Bacharach kept working, vowing never to retire, always believing that a good song could make a difference.

            “Music softens the heart, makes you feel something if it’s good, brings in emotion that you might not have felt before,” he told the AP in 2018. “It’s a very powerful thing if you’re able to do to it, if you have it in your heart to do something like that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805572,Review: Magic Mike bids farewell with a 'Last Dance',"The words Magic Mike may conjure up images of sweaty, sculpted, undulating men, dancing unthreateningly for hoards of screaming women, but there has always been a backdrop of brutal economic reality looming over the fantasy world. 

            The unlikely franchise has explored the escalating devaluation of physical laborers, the suffocating effects of the college industrial complex, predatory loan businesses, recession and even COVID-19, which has effectively destroyed poor Mike Lane’s furniture business in this latest film.

             When we re-meet Channing Tatum’s gentle hunk in “ Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” in theaters Friday, he’s bartending at parties for the very rich in Miami. The gig could be worse, but though he doesn’t quite say it, the implication is that he’s even aged out of dancing now. He has to seriously think about it when his wealthy employer offers him $6,000 for a dance later that evening.











            Asking why sequels exist doesn’t usually produce satisfying answers, but “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” is a film that was born backwards, a fit of inspiration from Steven Soderbergh after seeing what Tatum had done with Magic Mike Live. The Las Vegas stage show, inspired by the first two movies, is described on its website as “an unforgettably fun night of sizzling, 360-degree entertainment,” “hot,” “hilarious,” “the great time you’ve been looking for” and “the ultimate girl’s night out.”

            But “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” is not quite any of those things and perhaps might even annoy some of its most enthusiastic fans — the ones who simply want to holler at the six-packs in front of them. Because this film is that thing that many sequels promise but don’t deliver on: It’s both a true evolution and a conclusion. It’s also part fantasy, part bleak reality, part commentary the fundamental value of dance and what’s lost in a society that has forgotten how. It is not, in other words, simply another striptease.

            “Magic Mike” and “XXL” (directed by Gregory Jacobs) both latched on to a kind of pure joy in the spectacle of the male stripper. But that audience, by nature of its venues, is inherently limited and “down market.” In “Last Dance,” Soderbergh gives Mike a wealthy benefactor, in the form of the operatically named Maxandra Mendoza (Salma Hayek) who is in the midst of a messy divorce from an obscenely successful media mogul and looking to shake things up.

            After an acrobatic, but fully clothed, encounter with Mike, she decides to whisk him away to London, dress him up and put him in charge of staging a show that promises to make its audiences feel the way she did the night she met Mike. In the process, she, and Soderbergh, Tatum and screenwriter Reid Carolin, set a historic London theater, and all of its fussy rules, ablaze (figuratively). If only all scorned socialites could do something so charitable with their rage.

            It’s a clever conceit for a filmmaker who never tires of singeing the establishment he continues work in. And like many Soderbergh films, “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” shaggy, earnest and innocently tawdry, goes down so easy that it’s almost impossible to appreciate it fully on a first watch. I imagine it will only improve with more.

            If there is a quibble, it’s that Hayek and Tatum don’t quite inspire the will-they-won’t-they tension that the movie seems to be asking of them. They work well together when they’re working together, but the romantic chemistry is a bit lacking. Besides, his great unrequited love isn't a person but his furniture business, right? It doesn't help that Maxandra is also an extremely underdeveloped character.

            Even so, Mike manages to wrest an inspired dance in the rain out of the idea of them (his co-dancer is Kylie Shea) that pays homages to classic movie musicals with just a bit more skin and writhing.

            This story is told like a fairy tale, or a poetically composed school paper from a particularly precocious student, with a silky voiced young narrator telling us about Mike’s woes and the waning significance of dance in the culture. She’s not just a disembodied voice, but an important character the story reveals later. But it’s a lovely little flourish in Mike Lane’s journey. He’s a guy who just wants to make furniture but seems destined (or doomed) to continue performing in one way or another. Like his director, he’s just too good at it to say goodbye forever, no matter how much they both keep trying.

            “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” a Warner Bros. release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “sexual material and language.” Running time: 112 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

It doesn't help that Maxandra is also an extremely underdeveloped character.Even so, Mike manages to wrest an inspired dance in the rain out of the idea of them (his co-dancer is Kylie Shea) that pays homages to classic movie musicals with just a bit more skin and writhing.This story is told like a fairy tale, or a poetically composed school paper from a particularly precocious student, with a silky voiced young narrator telling us about Mike’s woes and the waning significance of dance in the culture. She’s not just a disembodied voice, but an important character the story reveals later. But it’s a lovely little flourish in Mike Lane’s journey. He’s a guy who just wants to make furniture but seems destined (or doomed) to continue performing in one way or another. Like his director, he’s just too good at it to say goodbye forever, no matter how much they both keep trying.“Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” a Warner Bros. release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “sexual material and language.” Running time: 112 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.___MPA Definition of R: Restricted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805573,Kyrgyz government seeking to shut down radio station,"MOSCOW (AP) — A court in Kyrgyzstan’s capital Bishkek on Thursday rescheduled for March 15 the hearing of a request by the country’s Culture Ministry to close down Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s local branch, called Radio Azattyk.

            Radio Azattyk’s website was blocked in Kyrgyzstan in October 2022 and its bank accounts frozen under national money laundering laws, over a video report about clashes on the Kyrgyz-Tajik border in the Batken region.

            According to the Culture Ministry, the coverage violates Kyrgyz media law, which bans “propaganda of war, violence and cruelty, national, religious exclusion and intolerance to other peoples and nations.” The website ban was declared “indefinite” in December 2022.











            The Reporters Without Borders group condemned the Culture Ministry’s move to seek Radio Azattyk’s closure, saying the case poses “a major new obstacle to press freedom” which is “under growing pressure” in Kyrgyzstan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805574,Osimhen's scoring streak on line when Napoli hosts Cremonese,"MILAN (AP) — Before scoring two goals, Victor Osimhen apologized for missing a shot.

            During the warmup ahead of Napoli’s match at Spezia last weekend, a shot from Osimhen hit a female fan in the stands. The Nigeria striker immediately climbed over the barriers to say sorry.

            “I was making a practice shoot and then I kicked the ball so hard and there was a lady there and the ball hit her so hard so I had to go there to give her a hug and say, ‘I’m sorry. It wasn’t intentional,’” Osimhen said.











            The Spezia fans would have probably wished his shooting was as wayward during the match — Osimhen scored two second-half goals to help runaway Serie A leader Napoli win 3-0.

            His eye for goal, technique and precision is impressive, as is his speed and physicality. Osimhen's second goal against Spezia was a header that had echoes of one of Cristiano Ronaldo's most famous scores in Italy but the Napoli forward leapt even higher than the Portugal great.

            It was the fifth straight league match Osimhen had scored in and took his tally to 16 in 17 Serie A matches this season.

            Just as Napoli is leading the Italian league, Osimhen is leading the scoring chart, with the forward having scored four more goals than Atalanta’s Ademola Lookman and Inter Milan's Lautaro Martínez.

            “I believe my confidence is getting higher every day, each training,” the 24-year-old Osimhen said. “And I’m really happy about this, about this form.

            “And of course I have to say a big thank you to my teammates, most especially the coach that has given me this confidence and to repay him I have to continue to work for the team, to try to score as much as I can for the team to help them get to victory.”

            Next up for Osimhen and Napoli is a home game against last-place Cremonese.

            Napoli has a 13-point lead in Serie A, while Cremonese is 10 points from safety and hasn’t won a single league match this season while scoring only 15 goals.

            Osimhen alone has scored more than the entire Cremonese team this season.

            But Cremonese pulled off a big upset when it won at Napoli on penalties in the Italian Cup three weeks ago. It then went on to eliminate Roma, too, and reach the semifinals for only the second time in its history.

            “Cremonese and these players need to show that we belong in this league,” Cremonese coach Davide Ballardini said. “We showed that in the Italian Cup, we also want to show it in Serie A.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805578,Pilot shortage puts pressure on airline operations,"GOODYEAR, Ariz. (AP) — Until last summer, Ashley Montano had never flown. Now she was preparing to land a small plane with three passengers after a previous touch-and-go that had been rough. 

            “The plane is a bit heavy, so give it just a little more power to make a smooth landing,” flight instructor Jason Fink told her.

            There was the tiniest of bounces as the plane's nose came down, then a smooth touchdown and taxi in to end Montano's training flight late last year at a United Airlines school in the Arizona desert. 











            On the ground, Montano was happy with her progress. “You guys were my first real passengers!” she gushed to a reporter and video journalist who had been in the rear seats.

            Montano hopes that in a few years she will be flying airline jets and carrying many more passengers. If she does, she'll be helping solve a critical problem facing the industry: not enough pilots.

            Airlines have complained about a shortage for several years, but they made it worse during the pandemic by encouraging pilots to take early retirement when air travel collapsed in 2020. Helane Becker, an analyst for Cowen who has tracked the issue closely, estimates that 10,000 pilots have left the field since then.

            Meanwhile, airlines have been in a hiring frenzy that is likely to continue for several years as the carriers replace pilots who reach the federal mandatory retirement age of 65.

            The government estimates that there will be about 18,000 openings per year for airline and commercial pilots this decade, with many of those replacing retirees. However, the Federal Aviation Administration issued on average only half that number of pilot licenses from 2017 through 2021.

            Private forecasts are dire, too. Consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that despite efforts to close the gap, airlines in North America will face a shortage of nearly 30,000 pilots by 2032. The supply of new pilots will grow, but not enough to offset a continuing wave of retirements, the consultant says.

            There is cause for hope, however. Last year, the FAA issued 9,588 airline-transport licenses — the type needed to fly for an airline. That topped even the recent peak of 9,520 in 2016. 

            The key question is whether that pace can be maintained. Some of last year's spurt might have been catch-up from low numbers in 2020 and 2021, which were held down by the pandemic.

            “The airlines are doing their best to move things along, but it’s an uphill slog,” Becker said. 

            Southwest Airlines has more than 700 planes but parks 40 to 45 of them each day because it lacks pilots to fly them, said CEO Bob Jordan at a recent media event. That amounts to more than 200 flights a day or up to 8% of the Dallas-based airline’s flying. Southwest expects to hire 2,250 pilots this year after adding about 1,200 last year, mostly by drawing from smaller airlines. 

            United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby says the lack of pilots will continue to prevent airlines from expanding as much as they would like to take advantage of strong travel demand.

            “Pilots are and will remain a significant constraint on capacity,” he said during an earnings call last month.

            Kirby figures that his airline, American, Delta and Southwest combined will hire about 8,000 pilots this year, up from the normal 6,000 to 7,000.

            The pilot shortage is most severe at smaller carriers that don't pay as well and serve as stepping stones to the big airlines. Many of them operate regional flights under the names of American Eagle, United Express and Delta Connection. 

            Faye Malarkey Black, president of the Regional Airline Association, says those carriers have parked more than 400 planes for lack of pilots, “and air service is collapsing as a result.” Black estimates that regional airlines are short by 8,000 pilots and the trade group says a dozen smaller cities have lost all air service — about 50 more have lost half or more of their flights — despite the broad rise in travel demand.

            If a pilot calls in sick, often there is no one immediately available to replace them, and that is leaving tens of thousands of travelers stranded. The lack of pilots contributed to a 52% increase in flight cancellations last year compared with 2021, although it is unclear how much of that was also related to weather and air traffic congestion.

            The shortage is giving pilot unions leverage in contract negotiations that were paused by the onset of the pandemic. New contracts are certain to include hefty pay raises that will drive up costs for airlines.

            Delta pilots are voting on a contract that their union says would raise pay by more than 30% over four years. If ratified, it likely would become the model for deals with pilots at American, United and Southwest. 

            The median annual pay for U.S. airline pilots last year topped $200,000, according to the Labor Department, and was likely much higher at the biggest airlines.

            The pilot shortage started even before the pandemic. Over the past decade or two, industry officials warned it was coming as travel boomed and thousands of U.S. pilots approached mandatory retirement age. The Federal Aviation Administration raised that age from 60 to 65 in 2007, which pushed the problem off for a few years.

            For decades, airlines enjoyed an ample supply of pilots, most of whom came out of the military fully trained and with extensive experience, but the military has its own shortage.

            The Air Force said it had a shortfall of about 1,900 pilots at the end of September. It is trying to increase retention and the training of new pilots after producing nearly 1,300 in the previous 12 months. 

            Not everyone agrees, however, that there is a shortage. The Air Line Pilots Association, the largest union of pilots in North America, says that over the past decade, airlines hired only about half of the people who received FAA licenses that let them fly airliners.

            The union argues that airlines are hyping a shortage narrative to water down qualification standards and hire inexperienced flyers at lower pay. It says that airlines should increase pay to attract more applicants.

            That is beginning to happen at regional airlines — the smaller carriers that handle flights for American Eagle, United Express, Delta Connection and Alaska Airlines’ Horizon Air subsidiary. Three of American’s regional affiliates recently announced that it would offer $100,000 bonuses to some new pilots.

            Several U.S. airlines have started their own training programs or partnered with flight schools to ensure a pipeline of future pilots that would be more diverse – fewer than 4% of current airline pilots are Black, fewer than 5% are women.

            “Even though I saw my dad fly planes, saw my brother fly planes, I never saw a woman fly planes,” says Sara McCauley, a student at United’s Aviate Academy who hopes to follow her father and fly for United. “The world is going to change, and aviation will be more inclusive.""

            Tuition for flying schools and the cost of flight time are not cheap. Reaching 1,500 hours of required flight time is often estimated to cost between $70,000 and $100,000. 

            Aviate charges $71,250, and when students are done they need to find work as a flight instructor to build enough hours to get hired by a regional airline. 

            Montano, who has two degrees in criminology, left her job analyzing prison-sentencing data and took out a loan to attend Aviate. 

            “I saw that as a great investment in my future,” she says. “I absolutely think it will pay off.”GOODYEAR, Ariz. (AP) — Until last summer, Ashley Montano had never flown.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805580,"Most disaster giving goes to relief efforts, not rebuilding","The COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated a long-running pattern in giving by foundations and charities for health and natural disasters, a new Chronicle analysis of nine years of data show.

            Ninety percent of the $5.2 billion donated in 2020, the most recent year for which data is available, went to dealing with immediate disaster needs. In other years, about half of disaster grantmaking went to such purposes. The rest went to helping communities prepare for hurricanes, droughts, life-threatening spread of disease, and other problems as well as to recovery and rebuilding.

            The amount of money foundations and charities gave in response to COVID-19 is stunning compared with the past. The 2020 figures are 15 times as much as the contributions in 2019. To be sure, grantmakers aren’t keeping up that pace: Preliminary figures for more recent giving show that foundations are slowing their giving considerably.











            The review of data from the Center for Disaster Philanthropy and Candid, a research organization that tracks giving of all kinds, shows that the sums flowing to disasters aren’t always going where they are most needed, namely for long-term recovery efforts and ensuring that communities are resilient enough to withstand the growing number of natural disasters caused by climate change.

            _____

            Here are five trends revealed by the Chronicle’s analysis:

            — THE SPIKE IN COVID GIVING COOLED QUICKLY.

            Private and community foundations, along with United Ways and other groups, gave $5.2 billion to disaster relief in 2020 compared with $352 million in 2019, primarily due to the urgency and the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic.

            “There’s nobody who wasn’t affected in some way by the pandemic,” says Tanya Gulliver-Garcia, director of learning and partnerships at the Center for Disaster Philanthropy. “And I think philanthropy saw that as a moment to step up and make a change and respond.”

            The money went to a wide variety COVID relief efforts, such as vaccine research, hunger relief, and direct cash payments to people in need.

            Grace Sato, Candid’s director of research, says that it is already clear that the increase in giving fueled by Covid-19 has subsided. A survey of foundations released by Candid in May found that Covid-related funding declined by 31 percent from 2020 to 2021.

            Other major epidemics have led to spikes in disaster giving in the past nine years: The second highest was after the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, which attracted $158 million.

            — THE FOCUS IS MOSTLY ON IMMEDIATE RELIEF

            Our review of the nine years of data found that funding for immediate relief was far more abundant than for anything else, including preparing for disasters or helping communities recover and rebuild. Those efforts have consistently received about half of the giving on average in the eight years before 2020.

            Gulliver-Garcia says media coverage helps fuel grant makers’ and donors’ interest in spending more on response and relief. Most of the philanthropic funding for disasters is given within the first five days of a crisis and is earmarked for immediate relief, she says, so it can’t be used later.

            “Long-term recovery doesn’t paint a dramatic picture for the 6 o’clock news,” she says. “Our goal is to help funders understand they can give money now, but they should also save some money and think about what long-term investments communities are going to need.”

            That disparity is apparent in places like New Orleans, where she lives. “There is still damage and loss that you can trace directly back to (Hurricane) Katrina,” she says. “There’s infrastructure that hasn’t been repaired, and that’s because the focus was all in those immediate first few days.”

            Providing more funding to local grassroots organizations working over the long term to rebuild communities is essential, says Sandrina da Cruz, director of disaster response at GlobalGiving, which connects donors and companies to community-led organizations.

            “We need to be able to trust that community leaders are in the best position to respond to longer-term needs, and we must invest in infrastructure,” says da Cruz. “And all that hard work is happening long after a crisis has made headlines.”

            — GIVING DOESN'T KEEP UP WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

            The reports over nine years show that natural disasters, particularly storms, usually received the most philanthropic funding. Philanthropic support shifted year-to-year depending on which disasters were more prevalent. Funding spiked in 2017 after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, which devastated communities in the United States and the Caribbean.

            Climate change is expected to make such natural disasters, including wildfires and droughts, more common and more severe. Extreme weather events have doubled in the past decade, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information.

            Beth Gazley, a professor who has researched disaster philanthropy at Indiana University, says the latest report’s findings demonstrate the need to fund planning and resiliency efforts for disasters caused by climate change. That means foundations must examine whether their funding “addresses the symptoms and not the problem itself.”

            Humanitarian emergencies like refugee crises and wars, which get substantial government funds, and accidents caused by human mistakes, such as chemical spills, received the least philanthropic dollars.

            — THE BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION REIGNS AS TOP DONOR

            The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given more to disaster relief than any other grant maker each year except in 2017 and 2018. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation took the number one spot in 2017 as it awarded two grants totaling $38.1 million to support the removal of land mines in Colombia. And the Texas-based OneStar Foundation, which was founded in 1974 by then-Gov. Dolph Briscoe, overtook Gates in 2018 when it collected and distributed money for Hurricane Harvey relief efforts.

            In 2020, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave six times as much as the year before. The global grant maker contributed $485.9 million to support research into Covid-19 testing, treatments, vaccines, and other relief efforts.

            The American Red Cross, which provides support in the immediate aftermath of disasters, has regularly been a top recipient of funding from big foundations and other donors.

            “An organization like the Red Cross is so well known, so connected, and has that immediate connection in people’s minds after a disaster,” says Gulliver-Garcia.

            However, large aid organizations have faced criticism for their slow response to local needs. The Red Cross, for instance, was slow to respond to Superstorm Sandy and spent large sums of money on administrative costs.

            — DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS GIVE MORE

            The nine-year review shows that Americans are channeling more money from donor-advised funds to support disaster relief. DAFs allow people to get an immediate tax deduction for contributions to their accounts and then send funds to causes they care about. But there is no requirement for the money to go to a working charity within a certain time frame.

            Fidelity Charitable, which manages donor-advised funds, recorded $7.8 million in giving to disasters such as the Ebola outbreak and the Syrian refugee crisis in 2014, the first time donor-advised fund data was provided to researchers. That amount jumped to $60 million by 2017, largely in response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Fidelity and Vanguard Charitable reported an even more significant spike in 2020, with about $592 million going to groups working on COViD-related issues.

            The increase in giving to disaster causes comes as giving to donor-advised funds has grown sharply over the last few years..

            Donor-advised funds and corporations have frequently contributed to relief for severe weather disasters during the past nine years.

            Corporate giving has been more variable. It was at its highest in 2020, when $650 million went to COVID-19 efforts, and in 2017, in response to the hurricanes.

            ____

            The Center for Disaster Philanthropy and Candid used data from a variety of sources, such as the informational tax forms that foundations and charities file with the Internal Revenue Service, other government entities, and Fidelity Charitable. The research organizations cautioned that some data for 2019 and 2020 is incomplete because of lags in reporting grants, especially the IRS’s processing of informational tax forms.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805586,"Days after quake, aid trucks reach northwest Syrian enclave","BAB AL-HAWA, Syria (AP) — A small convoy crossed from Turkey into Syria’s rebel-held northwest Thursday with desperately needed medicines, blankets, tents and U.N. shelter kits, the first aid to reach the enclave, three days after the devastating earthquake killed thousands.

            Before the convoy of six trucks, the only cargo coming across the Bab al-Hawa crossing on the Turkey-Syria border was a steady stream of bodies of earthquake victims — Syrian refugees who had fled the war in their country and settled in Turkey but perished in Monday’s 7.8 magnitude quake. Tearful survivors carried the remains of their loved ones wrapped in sheets, while others waited on the Syrian side to receive them.

            Even before the earthquake wreaked havoc on both sides of the border — the death toll on Thursday surpassed 19,000 — the Syrian enclave of 4.6 million people was plagued by extreme misery, with many living in displacement camps and relying on humanitarian aid to survive. 











            Under an agreement at the U.N. Security Council, Bab al-Hawa is the only crossing the United Nations is allowed to use to deliver aid from Turkey to the enclave. But the chaos in the aftermath of the quake, damaged roads and piles of debris around the crossing prevented the U.N. from delivering aid.

            Smaller aid groups have reportedly brought in some aid across other border crossings, but U.N. officials have been reluctant to break protocol.

            Cross-border aid is politically charged, with the Syrian government and top ally Russia pushing for deliveries to the enclave from Damascus, the Syrian capital, rather than Turkey. Damascus officials insist they are ready to distribute aid everywhere in Syria but critics say President Bashar Assad's government has a history of blocking or misdirecting aid intended for rebel-controlled areas.

            “Assad has a long history of politicizing aid, diverting it to his supporters, or selling it at the black market,"" said Karam Shaar, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute.

            Local rescue crews said aid delays may have cost more lives. Lack of heavy machinery and other equipment forced rescuers to clear the rubble with whatever they had — including their bare hands.

            “After 50 hours of work, we pulled out a man and little girl alive,” Abada Zikri, a first responder with the White Helmets, described one such rescue in Harem, a town of about 20,000 people in Syria's Idlib province.

            The White Helmets lost at least four volunteers in the earthquake, which also killed two Syrian employees with the International Rescue Committee and several several people from the area who worked with the U.N. on aid deliveries. 

            While Thursday's convoy was a delivery delayed from before the earthquake, the U.N. said more convoys with earthquake-response aid would follow.

            “Today is just the beginning of it,"" Sanjana Quazi, who run's the Turkey office of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told the Associated Press on the Turkish side of the border. 

            Some have criticized the U.N. for not taking exceptional measures to deliver aid after the earthquake. Shaar said the world organization should have broken protocol and used other crossings into Syria or provided airdrops.

            In Damascus, the parliament on Thursday called for the immediate lifting of Western-led sanctions on Syria, after the Syrian Red Crescent earlier this week urged the same amid fuel shortages and insufficient equipment. 

            Monday's quake also damaged the Afrin Dam, often locally called the Maydanki Dam, in northern Syria. The dam’s concrete cracked open on Thursday, and flooded the northwestern village of Tlool in the Salqin region, in the rebel enclave, partially submerging the buildings that withstood the quake. 

            Residents in the area scrambled to collect whatever personal belongings they could find and loaded them in trucks. The flooding further compounded the woes of the displaced Syrians. 

            The quake's death toll rose Thursday across Syria's front lines, with more than 1,900 killed in the rebel-held enclave and over 1,200 on the government side. Assad's adviser Bouthaina Shaaban told London's Sky News that Syria is willing to receive assistance from any country in the world, except Israel, which has offered help to both Turkey and Syria.

            The United States and European Union have slammed Damascus' demand for the lifting of sanctions, saying the measures affect Assad's government and do not include humanitarian aid.

            But several Syrians living abroad said in social media posts that online fundraising platforms have blocked their efforts to wire money to Syria due to the sanctions. 

            Several planes from Assad's key allies Iran and Russia, as well as a handful of Arab countries — the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Iraq — have airlifted aid to Damascus and Aleppo, two major Syrian airports.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805593,Senate panel probes holiday meltdown at Southwest Airlines,"A senior executive of Southwest Airlines apologized to a Senate committee Thursday for a December meltdown and said the airline is upgrading software to help fix its inability to reassign crews after the winter storm.

            The president of the Southwest pilots’ union told senators that airline leaders ignored calls to improve technology for years, then botched the recovery from the storm — losing track of employees and operating more than 500 empty flights while passengers were stuck on the ground over the holidays.

            The comments came during a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, which focused on the Southwest breakdown as it began to probe disruptions that affect millions of air travelers every year. 











            “We know this won’t be the last snowstorm to hit this country. So let’s figure why Southwest’s operations collapsed and what needs to change so this never happens again on Southwest or any other airline,” said the committee chair, Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.

            Democrats on the committee were frustrated that Southwest didn’t respond to warnings from its unions that it needed to improve its crew-scheduling system long before December’s debacle in which the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, stranding more than 2 million customers.

            “You were warned,” Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., told Southwest's chief operating officer, Andrew Watterson. “That mismanagement absolutely led to real pain, real harm for families.” 

            Cantwell said she heard from constituents who got no help or instructions from Southwest after their flights were canceled. 

            “They were on their own, all of them,” she said.

            Republicans and a lobbyist for the airline industry used the hearing to argue against proposals — including ones that President Joe Biden promoted this week in his state of the union speech — to impose new regulations on airlines, such as expanding compensation for delayed flights and limiting airline fees. 

            Republicans said such measures would cause fares to rise.

            “Instead of rushing to regulate prices and how many drink coupons you get, the Biden Department of Transportation should instead let the flying public vote with their feet,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

            Southwest and other airlines were hit by a winter storm on Dec. 21, but Southwest failed to recover when other carriers did. The breakdown has cost the airline more than $1 billion.

            Watterson said Southwest had a plan, but the storm was worse than expected. Southwest struggled with deicing equipment and jet bridges in Denver and Chicago, eventually canceling most flights at those airports, logistics problems which rippled nationwide.

            By Dec. 24, as the storm moved east, Southwest’s ability to reschedule crews was in tatters, and pilots and flight attendants were stranded just like the passengers. It took another week for the airline to recover.

            “Let me be clear — we messed up,” Watterson told the senators. 

            The executive said the Dallas-based airline has provided refunds and processed nearly all the claims for reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs that it has received.

            Watterson said that starting Friday, Southwest will upgrade software that suggests how to reassign crews to flights after disruptions. That software, from General Electric, was overwhelmed with the number of changes needed during the storm. He said the airline has also increased the ratio of employees to planes.

            Cantwell pressed Watterson on whether Southwest had planned for a worst-case storm. He said it planned by estimating how many planes could be deiced, but those calculations “proved to be incorrect for this storm.”

            Southwest led all U.S. airlines in canceled flights last year, accounting for more than 40,000 of the total 210,000 cancellations, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.

            Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said the airline struggles to deal with any disruptions, even minor ones. He said the December debacle was avoidable — unions had warned company leaders about problems with crew scheduling many times, including after a smaller crisis in October 2021 — but the airline failed to invest enough in better technology. 

            “Managers’ overconfidence in their planning and a systemic failure to provide modern tools to employees doomed SWA’s recovery before the first snowflake hit the ground,” he said.

            During the crisis, Murray said, pilots and flight attendants who tried to call headquarters to get assignments spent hours on hold.

            Murray said Southwest’s current leaders don’t listen to frontline workers and have drifted away from the airline’s longstanding employee-centered culture. He pointed to $8.8 million in stock options that the company disclosed last week for seven top executives. 

            Watterson stood in for CEO Robert Jordan, who had a scheduling conflict, according to the airline. That did not go over well.

            “Your CEO didn’t want to be here,” Cantwell told Watterson. In a reference to the airline’s co-founder, she added, “I definitely think Herb Kelleher would be here if he was the CEO.”A senior executive of Southwest Airlines apologized to a Senate committee Thursday for a December meltdown and said the airline is upgrading software to help fix its inability to reassign crews after the winter storm.The president of the Southwest pilots’ union told senators that airline leaders ignored calls to improve technology for years, then botched the recovery from the storm — losing track of employees and operating more than 500 empty flights while passengers were stuck on the ground over the holidays.The comments came during a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, which focused on the Southwest breakdown as it began to probe disruptions that affect millions of air travelers every year.“We know this won’t be the last snowstorm to hit this country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805609,Pence group to run ads in Iowa against school trans policies,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence is stepping up his outreach in Iowa ahead of a possible 2024 presidential campaign by rallying conservatives against transgender-affirming policies in schools, like one adopted in an eastern Iowa district last year.

            The effort by Advancing American Freedom, a group formed by Pence in 2021 and financed by his supporters, will include digital ads, rallies, canvassing and perhaps radio and television spots. It comes as a federal court in Minnesota is scheduled next week to hear a case brought by a group representing parents of students in Linn-Mar Community School District outside Cedar Rapids.

            “The strength of our nation is tied to the strength of our families, and we cannot stand idly by as the radical left attempts to indoctrinate our children behind parents’ backs,” Pence said in a statement provided to The Associated Press. “Advancing American Freedom will not rest until parental rights are restored in Iowa and across the nation.""











            The Linn-Mar board last year adopted a policy allowing students to request a gender support plan to begin socially transitioning at school and without the permission of their parents. The group representing the parents is suing to overturn the policy.

            The planned budget for the effort is more than $1 million, and the push is expected to last several months, said a Pence aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement later Thursday.

            The moves by the outside group — separate from any potential Pence candidacy — comes as school policy, notably involving gender identification and sexual orientation, has become an early focus of 2024 Republican presidential prospects.

            The issue is particularly relevant in Iowa, given both the court case and the Republican-controlled Legislature advancing legislation barring schools from supporting a student’s social change in gender identity.

            Pence's outreach comes before a trip to the early-voting state to headline an event next Wednesday in Cedar Rapids. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, is planning to campaign across Iowa after announcing her 2024 campaign, while South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson are expected to visit Iowa later in the month.DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence is stepping up his outreach in Iowa ahead of a possible 2024 presidential campaign by rallying conservatives against transgender-affirming policies in schools, like one adopted in an eastern Iowa district last year.The effort by Advancing American Freedom, a group formed by Pence in 2021 and financed by his supporters, will include digital ads, rallies, canvassing and perhaps radio and television spots.

The group representing the parents is suing to overturn the policy.The planned budget for the effort is more than $1 million, and the push is expected to last several months, said a Pence aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement later Thursday.The moves by the outside group — separate from any potential Pence candidacy — comes as school policy, notably involving gender identification and sexual orientation, has become an early focus of 2024 Republican presidential prospects.The issue is particularly relevant in Iowa, given both the court case and the Republican-controlled Legislature advancing legislation barring schools from supporting a student’s social change in gender identity.Pence's outreach comes before a trip to the early-voting state to headline an event next Wednesday in Cedar Rapids. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, is planning to campaign across Iowa after announcing her 2024 campaign, while South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson are expected to visit Iowa later in the month.",2023/2/9,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805610,Liquor before beer: Spirits beat brews in new market data,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Producers of spirits have new bragging rights in the age-old whiskey vs. beer barroom debate.

            New figures show that spirits surpassed beer for U.S. market-share supremacy, based on supplier revenues, a spirit industry group announced Thursday.

            The rise to the top for spirit-makers was fueled in part by the resurgent cocktail culture — including the growing popularity of ready-to-drink concoctions — as well as strong growth in the tequila and American whiskey segments, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said.











            In 2022, spirits gained market share for the 13th straight year in the fiercely competitive U.S. beverage alcohol market, as its supplier sales reached 42.1%, the council said.

            After years of steady growth, it marked the first time that spirit supplier revenues have surpassed beer — but just barely, the spirit industry group said. Beer holds a 41.9% market share, it said.

            “Despite the tough economy, consumers continued to enjoy premium spirits and fine cocktails in 2022,” Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO Chris Swonger said.

            Overall spirit supplier sales in the U.S. were up 5.1% in 2022 to a record $37.6 billion, the group said. Volumes rose 4.8% to 305 million 9-liter cases.

            Seemingly unfazed, Brian Crawford, president and CEO of the Beer Institute, insisted that beer “remains America’s number one choice in beverage alcohol.""

            ""It’s interesting to hear liquor companies boast about making money hand-over-fist while simultaneously going state-to-state hunting for more tax carveouts from state legislatures,” Crawford said in a statement.

            Benj Steinman, president of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a leading beer industry trade publication, said the beer industry saw unprecedented growth in the 1970s, growing at a pace of 4% annually. As recently as 2000, beer’s share in the alcohol market was 58%.

            Over the past several decades, beer's growth has essentially been flat. Meanwhile, spirits have flourished, especially over the past two decades.

            “I think there’s just a long arc on these things,” Steinman said.

            Steinman and Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association, a craft beer industry trade group, agreed there are several reasons for the shift to spirits.

            “Some of it’s just the younger generation coming up, looking for a lot of variety,” Steinman said. “They sometimes like spirits. Cocktail culture is another thing.”

            Watson cited data showing that liquor has become 20% cheaper relative to beer in recent decades.

            “Price is a particularly large part of the story,” he said.

            Another factor is advertising and marketing. Watson pointed to the success of spirits in its outreach to women. Steinman said distilled spirits now advertise freely, something they didn’t do generations ago.

            “They’ve increased their availability. They’ve increased their ability to advertise. They’ve had a lot of legislative and policy wins that have enabled growth for distilled spirits,” Steinman said.

            For spirit producers, reaching the market share milestone was worth toasting.

            At Baltimore Spirits Company in Maryland, the head distiller and the manager of its cocktail bar said they are pleased with the rise in the consumption of spirits.

            Eli Breitburg-Smith, head distiller and cofounder, said the distillery founders saw a space in the market to make rye whiskey as consumer demand was growing.

            “We did see that it was going to be on the rise,"" he said. ""Now, I don’t know that we thought it would be overtaking beer or anything like that, but we felt like there was a good space in the market for new whiskey, original whiskey, and people that ... were making a unique product.”

            Gregory Mergner, the general manager of the distillery’s cocktail gallery, said he didn’t anticipate spirits rivaling or surpassing beer for market share.

            “As ubiquitous as beer is. I don’t think anybody could have foreseen whiskey overtaking it,” he said.

            The spirit sector's rise has coincided with a growing thirst for high-end, super-premium products. 

            That trend toward premiumization slowed overall in 2022. But it remained strong because of growth in the tequila/mezcal and American whiskey categories, the Distilled Spirits Council said.

            More than 60% of the spirit sector’s total U.S. revenue last year came from sales of high-end and super-premium spirits, mostly led by tequila and American whiskey, said Christine LoCascio, the group's chief of public policy and strategy. Those high-end products fetch the highest prices.

            “While many consumers are feeling the pinch from inflation and reduced disposable income, they are still willing to purchase that special bottle of spirits choosing to sip a little luxury and drink better, not more,” LoCascio said.

            Within the spirit sector, vodka maintained its as status the top revenue producer at $7.2 billion, though sales were flat in 2022, the group said.

            In the tequila/mezcal category, sales rose 17.2%, or $886 million, totaling $6 billion, it said.

            Sales for American whiskey were up 10.5%, or $483 million, to reach $5.1 billion, it said. The American whiskey category includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey.

            Brandy and cognac sales were down 12.3%, with revenues totaling $3.1 billion.

            Premixed cocktails were the clear leader as the fastest-growing spirit category. 

            Sales for premixed cocktails, including ready-to-drink spirit products, surged by 35.8%, or $588 million, to reach $2.2 billion, the council said.

            Meanwhile, spirit sales volumes in restaurants and bars — referred to as on-premise sales — continued to recover from pandemic-era shutdowns but they remained 5% lower than 2019 levels, the council said. Those sales represent about 20% of the U.S. market.

            Off-premise sales volumes at liquor stores and other retail outlets remained steady in 2021 and 2022, after experiencing sharp gains during the pandemic restrictions in 2020, it said.

            Meanwhile, there is a crossover strategy brewing in the alcohol market.

            Steinman said that even the big players in the beer industry “are playing in all these different growth arenas, including spirits.”

            Molson Coors changed its name in 2019, going from Molson Coors Brewing Co. to Molson Coors Beverage Co. Watson noted that the No. 2 canned ready-to-drink liquor product, Cutwater, is made by Anheuser-Busch InBev.

            For beer producers, the reversal in market-share rankings is no reason to cry in their suds.

            Watson cautioned that the market share trend could flip, calling it “likely at some point we’ll see beer grow again at the expense of other segments.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805611,"Eugene Lee, award-winning Broadway, 'SNL' set designer, dies","NEW YORK (AP) — Eugene Lee, the six-time Emmy Award-winning production designer for ""Saturday Night Live"" who won three Tony Awards for his Broadway sets, including the complicated, greenified Emerald City of “Wicked,” has died. He was 83.

            Lee died Tuesday in Providence, Rhode Island, said Trinity Repertory Company, where he had been a resident artist since 1967 and designed sets for more than 100 productions.

            “Eugene Lee was a once-in-a-generation theater artist, one of the greatest minds to ever answer the question ‘What is theater?’” artistic director Curt Columbus said in a statement.











            His numerous Broadway productions include the original Stephen Sondheim musicals “Sweeney Todd” in 1979 and “Merrily We Roll Along” in 1981, “Seussical” in 2001, the “Show Boat” revival of 1994-1997 and, more recently, “Amazing Grace” and “Bright Star.”

            His work for the Broadway stage varied from building a seedy Chinese restaurant for David Mamet's “Glengarry Glen Ross” to spare, interlocking wood frames for “The Other Place.” His most imaginative work can be seen today in “Wicked,” complete with a smoke-breathing dragon, a giant fantasy clock and a bubble-blowing pendulum that carries a witch.

            Lee designed the big clock, based on a mention in the Gregory Maguire novel, and defined his vision by creating a series of moving panels of gears and cog wheels that became the central image for the set. Cued to the music and lighting by computers, the panels and the wheels seem in constant motion during transitions from one song and scene to the next, rolling and sliding along the floor in grooves disguised by clouds of smoke. The clock image envelops all the characters in the Oz story.

            During a set visit in 2004, Lee smiled often when he talked about this project. 

            “Where else can you build a dragon?” he asked.

            Lee was the production designer on “Saturday Night Live” from the show’s premiere until his death. He also led the production design for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “Late Night with Seth Meyers” and the 2000 television movie “On Golden Pond,” among others. For his work in TV production design, Lee was nominated for 18 Emmys, winning six.

            “His contribution to the arts and our culture, at both a local and national level, is massive and he will forever be remembered as one of the giants of the field,"" said Lee's longtime co-designer and assistant Patrick Lynch at Trinity.

            Lloris was hurt late in the 1-0 win over Manchester City on Sunday in the English Premier League and was pictured wearing a brace on his leg.

            Backup keeper Fraser Forster will stand in as Tottenham prepares to face AC Milan in the Champions League round of 16 next week.











            “We are all disappointed about Hugo, he is injured,” Tottenham assistant coach Cristian Stellini said Thursday. “But we have a good experienced keeper like Fraser. We have a tough five weeks in front of us.”

            The London club is also in contention for a top-four finish in the league and has reached the fifth round of the FA Cup.

            “We trust in Fraser,” Stellini said. “Also we say to Hugo, ‘See you soon,’ because he needs a good recovery. He needs maybe five, seven weeks to be back with us.”

            Later Thursday, Tottenham said midfielder Yves Bissouma will undergo surgery Friday to repair a stress fracture to his left ankle.

            A timeframe for his return will be determined after surgery, the club said.

            Meanwhile, Tottenham manager Antonio Conte has returned to work after he had surgery in Italy last week to remove his gallbladder.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805613,Malaysian PM vows to help Thailand solve southern violence,"Bangkok (AP) — Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Thursday that his government is committed to helping Thailand solve a Muslim insurgency in its far south but does not condone the use of violence to end the conflict.

            Anwar spoke after meeting in Bangkok with his Thai counterpart, Prayuth Chan-ocha. It was Anwar's first visit to his country’s northern neighbor since he took office last November. He has previously met with leaders from Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore.

            Their talks covered a range of economic and security issues, but a top joint concern is the Muslim separatist insurgency in Thailand’s deep south, which has taken the lives of about 7,000 civilians, soldiers, government workers and rebels since it flared in 2004. The fighting in Thailand’s three southernmost provinces, the only ones with Muslim majorities, is intermittent but brutal, with the separatists carrying out drive-by shootings and bombings, and the government accused of torturing suspects and other abuses.











            Southern Thai Muslims — whose ethnicity, culture and language differ from the Buddhist majority — believe they are treated as second-class citizens and have the sympathy of many Malaysians, about 60% of whom are Muslim.

            Malaysia has hosted and facilitated peace talks between the separatist groups and the Thai government, but little progress has been made. Anwar has expressed particular interest in the efforts and appointed a former top Malaysian general to be the chief facilitator.

            Addressing reporters after meeting with Prayuth, Anwar said his country is committed to assisting Thailand in finding a solution to the violence in the south.

            “It is unfortunate because these small skirmishes have led to a lot of tensions, some sort of resentment and distrust, so we have to appeal to all forces both in Thailand, and in the south and even some in Malaysia, to understand and appreciate that peace must be paramount, of paramount consideration,” he said.

            “I come here with a very clear, categorical message that the government of Malaysia will not condone any sort of violence to resolve any conflict,” Anwar said. “We will exercise our right as friends … to express our concerns, our legitimate concerns, whilst acknowledging that south Thailand is purely an internal issue within Thailand. But it is our duty as good neighbors and family to do whatever is required and necessary to facilitate the process.”

            Anwar, referring to what he called the “trust deficit” between southern Thai Muslims and the Thai authorities, said he believes it is his duty to see that their concerns about religion, culture, and language are addressed. He added that Prayuth agrees on the importance of economic development in the region.

            Anwar also said that the two leaders discussed “the more contentious issue” of Myanmar, where violence continues after the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021. He called for Thailand and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to come up with viable actions to ease, if not solve, the crisis because of its ramifications throughout the region.

            “Both leaders also had the opportunity to exchange views on the current international and regional challenges and expressed satisfaction with the longstanding cordial relations between Thailand and Malaysia,"" Thailand said in its statement about the meeting. “They reaffirmed their commitment to further deepen the bilateral cooperation and collaboration at all levels, and to seek new cooperation for Thailand-Malaysia border area to become peaceful and prosperous ‘Golden Land.’”

            It said the two leaders set a goal of achieving $30 billion in bilateral trade by 2025, in part by strengthening linkages between special economic zones in Thailand’s southernmost provinces and Malaysia’s northern states. The zones are meant to promote development through industrial and agricultural projects supported by infrastructure improvements.Bangkok (AP) — Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Thursday that his government is committed to helping Thailand solve a Muslim insurgency in its far south but does not condone the use of violence to end the conflict.Anwar spoke after meeting in Bangkok with his Thai counterpart, Prayuth Chan-ocha.

The zones are meant to promote development through industrial and agricultural projects supported by infrastructure improvements.",2023/2/9,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805617,Kraken place leading scorer Andre Burakovsky on IR,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The Seattle Kraken placed leading scorer Andre Burakovsky on injured reserve Thursday with a lower body injury. 

            Before their game at New Jersey, Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said Burakovsky is being listed as week to week.

            Burakovsky's leg appeared to buckle on his first shift of Tuesday's game against the New York Islanders, and he played just 31 seconds in the 4-0 loss. 











            Burakovsky had appeared in 49 of the first 50 games in his first season with Seattle after signing as a free agent. He leads the Kraken with 39 points, including 13 goals and 26 assists, and is averaging a career-high 16 minutes and 33 seconds of ice time per game. He’s one of six skaters for Seattle with at least 30 points this season. 

            The Kraken activated defenseman Justin Schultz off injured reserve ahead of facing the Devils after missing six games with an undisclosed injury. Seattle also recalled forward John Hayden from Coachella Valley of the AHL to add depth to the forward group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805621,"NBA trade deadline sees Irving, Durant bolster West teams","First it was Kyrie Irving to Dallas. Then came Kevin Durant to Phoenix.

            The breakup in Brooklyn is rebuilding some contenders in the West.

            Trade deadline day in the NBA on Thursday featured plenty of moves, with the Suns making the biggest as they chase the first championship in franchise history.











            They acquired Durant by sending Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, first-round picks in 2023, 2025, 2027 and 2029, and a first-round pick swap in 2028 to the Nets, who also sent T.J. Warren back to his original team in Phoenix.

            New Suns owner Mat Ishbia called it a “transformative day” for the team.

            “Not only is Kevin one of the greatest and most accomplished players in the history of the sport, but his character also embodies the world-class commitment to excellence we are instilling across every facet of this organization,"" Ishbia said in a statement.

            Jae Crowder, who didn't play this season in Phoenix, was moved to Milwaukee in the four-team trade. The Bucks sent Jordan Nwora, George Hill, Serge Ibaka and three future second-round picks to the Indiana Pacers.

            Bridges, Johnson and Crowder helped the Suns reach the NBA Finals in 2021, and a return trip looks possible with Durant in their lineup.

            “It’s a close group,” coach Monty Williams said. “You can imagine that’s a tough blow to the group for the human side of it, but also exciting about what could be.”

            A day earlier, the Lakers agreed to send Russell Westbrook to Utah as part of a three-way deal including Minnesota that brought D'Angelo Russell back to Los Angeles.

            “Just like that it’s a war in the West!” Sacramento Kings guard Terence Davis II tweeted.

            Trying to stay in it, defending champion Golden State reacquired Gary Payton II but dealt 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman in a four-team trade with Detroit, Portland and Atlanta.

            The Lakers stayed busy up until the deadline with a couple more moves as they try to build a contender around NBA career scoring leader LeBron James. They added another big man in Mo Bamba from the Orlando Magic for Patrick Beverley, a second-round pick and cash considerations. The Magic said they would not require Beverley to report to the team. 

            The deadline was 3 p.m. EST, though most of the deals weren't approved by the league office until much later as teams swapped not only players, but plenty of draft picks.

            “I’ll show you how wrong I was,” said Cleveland president of basketball operations Koby Altman, whose team was one of few that made zero moves. “I thought it was going to be a quiet, quiet deadline. But this is the NBA, and the NBA never stops.""

            Phoenix could end up being more powerful than last season's squad, which won an NBA-best 64 games, then flamed out with a second-round loss to Dallas. The Suns just got Devin Booker back from a groin injury that had sidelined him since Christmas and soon will add Durant to the lineup when he recovers from a sprained knee ligament. That's on top of Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton. 

            In another move, the Suns dealt Dario Saric, a 2029 second-round pick and cash to Oklahoma City for forward Darius Bazley.

            The Mavericks also may be stronger after acquiring Irving to pair with Luka Doncic. Irving asked out of Brooklyn last week, frustrated by his negotiations for a contract extension, and he was headed West a few days later. 

            Then it was Durant, who had gone to Brooklyn with Irving in 2019.

            “I just love the competition now that we can be in the same conference,” Irving said.

            The Lakers are still hoping they can make some noise. They acquired Russell — who began his career with the franchise — from Minnesota, and guard Malik Beasley and forward Jarred Vanderbilt from the Jazz. The deal sent Westbrook to Utah after the 2017 NBA MVP never thrived alongside James and Anthony Davis.

            Minnesota got Mike Conley and Nickeil Alexander-Walker from Utah, along with three second-round picks.

            The Lakers made yet another move, sending center Thomas Bryant to Denver and getting back Davon Reed and a second-round pick from the Nuggets. Bryant, who started 25 games and is averaging 12.1 points, could be a good backup to two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic. 

            The other team in Los Angeles was also busy. The Clippers reacquired Eric Gordon, who began his career with them in 2008, from Houston and landed Bones Hyland from Denver for two second-round picks as the third team in the swap with the Lakers and Nuggets.

            The Clippers, who traded Luke Kennard to Memphis and John Wall back to Houston, also acquired center Mason Plumlee from Charlotte for point guard Reggie Jackson and a 2028 second-round draft pick in another deal.

            San Antonio traded center Jakob Poeltl back to the Toronto Raptors for Khem Birch plus a first-round pick in the 2024 draft and a pair of second-round selections. Poeltl was one of the most-wanted centers on the market. He’s averaged 12.1 points and a team-high 9.0 rebounds for the Spurs, who acquired Poeltl from the Raptors as part of the Kawhi Leonard-DeMar DeRozan trade in 2018.

            The Philadelphia 76ers acquired forward Jalen McDaniels from Charlotte and sent forward Matisse Thybulle to Portland as part of a multi-team trade that also involves multiple draft picks.

            Thybulle twice made the NBA All-Defensive second team but he has averaged just 4.4 points over four seasons with the Sixers. The 25-year-old McDaniels is averaging a career-best 10.6 points for the Hornets in his fourth season.

            It was the second move in two days for the Blazers, who sent Josh Hart to the New York Knicks on Wednesday for Cam Reddish and a protected first-round draft pick.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsFirst it was Kyrie Irving to Dallas. Then came Kevin Durant to Phoenix.The breakup in Brooklyn is rebuilding some contenders in the West.Trade deadline day in the NBA on Thursday featured plenty of moves, with the Suns making the biggest as they chase the first championship in franchise history.They acquired Durant by sending Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, first-round picks in 2023, 2025, 2027 and 2029, and a first-round pick swap in 2028 to the Nets, who also sent T.J. Warren back to his original team in Phoenix.New Suns owner Mat Ishbia called it a “transformative day” for the team.“Not only is Kevin one of the greatest and most accomplished players in the history of the sport, but his character also embodies the world-class commitment to excellence we are instilling across every facet of this organization,"" Ishbia said in a statement.Jae Crowder, who didn't play this season in Phoenix, was moved to Milwaukee in the four-team trade. The Bucks sent Jordan Nwora, George Hill, Serge Ibaka and three future second-round picks to the Indiana Pacers.Bridges, Johnson and Crowder helped the Suns reach the NBA Finals in 2021, and a return trip looks possible with Durant in their lineup.“It’s a close group,” coach Monty Williams said. “You can imagine that’s a tough blow to the group for the human side of it, but also exciting about what could be.”A day earlier, the Lakers agreed to send Russell Westbrook to Utah as part of a three-way deal including Minnesota that brought D'Angelo Russell back to Los Angeles.“Just like that it’s a war in the West!” Sacramento Kings guard Terence Davis II tweeted.Trying to stay in it, defending champion Golden State reacquired Gary Payton II but dealt 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman in a four-team trade with Detroit, Portland and Atlanta.The Lakers stayed busy up until the deadline with a couple more moves as they try to build a contender around NBA career scoring leader LeBron James. They added another big man in Mo Bamba from the Orlando Magic for Patrick Beverley, a second-round pick and cash considerations. The Magic said they would not require Beverley to report to the team.The deadline was 3 p.m. EST, though most of the deals weren't approved by the league office until much later as teams swapped not only players, but plenty of draft picks.“I’ll show you how wrong I was,” said Cleveland president of basketball operations Koby Altman, whose team was one of few that made zero moves. “I thought it was going to be a quiet, quiet deadline. But this is the NBA, and the NBA never stops.""Phoenix could end up being more powerful than last season's squad, which won an NBA-best 64 games, then flamed out with a second-round loss to Dallas. The Suns just got Devin Booker back from a groin injury that had sidelined him since Christmas and soon will add Durant to the lineup when he recovers from a sprained knee ligament. That's on top of Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton.In another move, the Suns dealt Dario Saric, a 2029 second-round pick and cash to Oklahoma City for forward Darius Bazley.The Mavericks also may be stronger after acquiring Irving to pair with Luka Doncic. Irving asked out of Brooklyn last week, frustrated by his negotiations for a contract extension, and he was headed West a few days later.Then it was Durant, who had gone to Brooklyn with Irving in 2019.“I just love the competition now that we can be in the same conference,” Irving said.The Lakers are still hoping they can make some noise. They acquired Russell — who began his career with the franchise — from Minnesota, and guard Malik Beasley and forward Jarred Vanderbilt from the Jazz. The deal sent Westbrook to Utah after the 2017 NBA MVP never thrived alongside James and Anthony Davis.Minnesota got Mike Conley and Nickeil Alexander-Walker from Utah, along with three second-round picks.The Lakers made yet another move, sending center Thomas Bryant to Denver and getting back Davon Reed and a second-round pick from the Nuggets. Bryant, who started 25 games and is averaging 12.1 points, could be a good backup to two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic.The other team in Los Angeles was also busy. The Clippers reacquired Eric Gordon, who began his career with them in 2008, from Houston and landed Bones Hyland from Denver for two second-round picks as the third team in the swap with the Lakers and Nuggets.The Clippers, who traded Luke Kennard to Memphis and John Wall back to Houston, also acquired center Mason Plumlee from Charlotte for point guard Reggie Jackson and a 2028 second-round draft pick in another deal.San Antonio traded center Jakob Poeltl back to the Toronto Raptors for Khem Birch plus a first-round pick in the 2024 draft and a pair of second-round selections. Poeltl was one of the most-wanted centers on the market. He’s averaged 12.1 points and a team-high 9.0 rebounds for the Spurs, who acquired Poeltl from the Raptors as part of the Kawhi Leonard-DeMar DeRozan trade in 2018.The Philadelphia 76ers acquired forward Jalen McDaniels from Charlotte and sent forward Matisse Thybulle to Portland as part of a multi-team trade that also involves multiple draft picks.Thybulle twice made the NBA All-Defensive second team but he has averaged just 4.4 points over four seasons with the Sixers.

Both are looking to curb China's rising geopolitical influence in the region.The arrangement will see Japanese soldiers join natural and humanitarian disaster response training exercises in the Philippines. It has been seen as a first step towards broader defensive cooperation.""After our meeting, I can confidently say that our strategic partnership is stronger than ever as we navigate together the rough waters buffeting our region,"" President Marcos said at a joint news conference.""The future of our relationship remains full of promise as we continue to deepen and expand our engagements across a wide range of mutually beneficial cooperation.""Marcos's visit to Tokyo comes shortly after the Philippines agreed to expand US access to its military bases, following a meeting with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.Kishida said Thursday's agreement would be followed by further talks that would strengthen defensive ties and enable the transfer of equipment and technology to the Philippines — including air surveillance radar systems.He added that trilateral cooperation with the US would also be strengthened.The government in Tokyo amended its defensive doctrine in December, breaking with its defense-only principles since the end of World War II by adopting a retaliatory strike capability. It also plans to double military spending in five years.Japan also aims to support poorer nations in the region with development assistance focused on maritime security in an attempt to counter China's regional influence.Kishida and Marcos ""expressed serious concerns about the situation in the East and China Seas and strongly opposed the actions including force or coercion that may increase tensions,"" according to their joint statement.Tensions have risen between Beijing and Manila over China's increasing presence in the South China Sea where it has made claims contested by other regional states.China's navy and coastguard have been accused of encroaching on waters claimed by the Philippines and have allegedly blocked access to Filipino fishing boats.Marcos met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a three-day visit to China in early January in which the two agreed to cool down their tensions and boost trade.Marcos — the son of a former Filipino dictator who took power in June — has worked to redirect Manila's foreign relations after his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte brought the country closer to China.ab/jcg (AP, EFE)",2023/2/9,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805631,Belarus seeks to jail Nobel Peace Prize winner for 12 years,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarusian authorities on Thursday requested a lengthy prison sentence for jailed human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, one of the winners of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. 

            The prosecutor has asked a court in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, to hand Bialiatski a 12-year prison sentence for financing anti-government protests. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate stood trial along with three of his colleagues from the Viasna human rights center that he had founded. 

            The charges in the trial, which is taking place behind closed doors in the Leninsky court in Minsk, are connected to Viasna’s provision of money to political prisoners and helping pay their legal fees. The four human rights advocates have been accused of tax evasion, financing actions violating public order and smuggling. 











            The prosecutor requested lengthy prison terms for Bialiatski's colleagues, as well: 11 years for Valiantsin Stefanovich, 10 years for Dzmitry Salauyou, and nine years for Uladzimir Labkovicz. Salauyou is being tried in absentia, because he has managed to leave Belarus. All four should serve their time in an enhanced security prison — conditions in those are notoriously harsh. 

            Each of the four is also facing a fine of 185,000 Belarusian rubles (about $73,200).

            The rights advocates have already spent 20 months behind bars. They were arrested after the months-long mass protests in Belarus that followed the 2020 presidential election, which handed authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko his sixth term in office and was denounced by the opposition and the West as rigged. 

            Lukashenko, who has ruled the ex-Soviet country with an iron fist since 1994, unleashed a brutal crackdown on the protesters, the largest in the country's history. More than 35,000 people have been arrested, and thousands have been beaten by police. 

            During the trial, the 60-year-old Bialiatski and his colleagues were held in a caged enclosure in the courtroom. Photos of the Bialiatski released by Belarus' state news agency, Belta, showed him wearing black clothes and looking wan. 

            “Criminalizing help to the victims of political repressions, which is taking place after 2020, is immoral and inhumane,” Bialiatski said in court. 

            Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to flee Belarus in 2020, urged to free the human rights advocates immediately. 

            “I am appalled by the injustice in the fake trial against Viasna human rights defenders, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski” she said. ""They must be freed!”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805632,Minnesota factory workers subdue armed person at plant,"NEW YORK MILLS, Minn. (AP) — A man who fired a shot at a co-worker during a dispute at a Minnesota boat factory Thursday was subdued by other workers as he tried to flee, preventing any serious injuries, authorities said.

            Officers responding to a call about an active shooter found David Jeremiah Gadsen, 21, being held by his co-workers at the Lund Boat Company in New York Mills, Minnesota, Otter Tail County Sheriff Barry Fitzgibbons said.

            Fitzgibbons said in a news release that the two men were arguing inside the plant when Gadsen pulled a handgun and fired one shot, which did not strike the 31-year-old intended victim.











            One other shot was “possibly” fired as the shooter chased the other man out of the factory, Fitzgibbons said. The victim escaped unharmed.

            Gadsen tried to get back inside the factory but a worker held the door shut and prevented him from entering, according to the sheriff.

            When Gadsen tried to run away, other workers caught him and held him for officers, Fitzgibbons said.

            “If it wasn’t for the quick actions of the staff here, it could have been a much different outcome,” he said. “They intervened, they acted quickly and as a result we didn’t have any additional people shot at or injured. They did a fantastic job.”

            Gadsen was being held in the Otter Tail County jail. He was charged with second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon, second-degree intent to murder, carrying/possessing a gun without a permit and intentionally pointing a gun.

            The sheriff said there were only minor injuries suffered during the scuffle with Gadsen.

            In a statement, the company thanked the workers involved in stopping the shooter. There will be increased security at the plant when it reopens Monday.

            “The health and safety of our employees and the New York Mills community is our No. 1 priority, and we are fortunate that there were no injuries during this morning’s incident,” the statement said.

The company is a subsidiary of Illinois-based Brunswick Corp. and employs about 85 workers in New York Mills.NEW YORK MILLS, Minn. (AP) — A man who fired a shot at a co-worker during a dispute at a Minnesota boat factory Thursday was subdued by other workers as he tried to flee, preventing any serious injuries, authorities said.Officers responding to a call about an active shooter found David Jeremiah Gadsen, 21, being held by his co-workers at the Lund Boat Company in New York Mills, Minnesota, Otter Tail County Sheriff Barry Fitzgibbons said.Fitzgibbons said in a news release that the two men were arguing inside the plant when Gadsen pulled a handgun and fired one shot, which did not strike the 31-year-old intended victim.One other shot was “possibly” fired as the shooter chased the other man out of the factory, Fitzgibbons said. The victim escaped unharmed.Gadsen tried to get back inside the factory but a worker held the door shut and prevented him from entering, according to the sheriff.When Gadsen tried to run away, other workers caught him and held him for officers, Fitzgibbons said.“If it wasn’t for the quick actions of the staff here, it could have been a much different outcome,” he said. “They intervened, they acted quickly and as a result we didn’t have any additional people shot at or injured. They did a fantastic job.”Gadsen was being held in the Otter Tail County jail. He was charged with second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon, second-degree intent to murder, carrying/possessing a gun without a permit and intentionally pointing a gun.The sheriff said there were only minor injuries suffered during the scuffle with Gadsen.In a statement, the company thanked the workers involved in stopping the shooter. There will be increased security at the plant when it reopens Monday.“The health and safety of our employees and the New York Mills community is our No. 1 priority, and we are fortunate that there were no injuries during this morning’s incident,” the statement said.Lund was founded in 1948 in New York Mills, which is about 170 miles (274 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805633,Tennis player banned for life for 135 match-fixing offenses,"LONDON (AP) — A former tennis player from Morocco was banned for life Thursday after being found guilty of 135 match-fixing offenses.

            It is the highest number of match-fixing offenses by one person detected in the sport, the International Tennis Integrity Agency said.

            Younes Rachidi, who had a highest doubles ranking of No. 473, has been banned from ever playing in, coaching at or attending any tennis event sanctioned by governing bodies the ATP and WTA. He was also fined $34,000.











            Independent anti-corruption hearing officer Janie Soublière ruled that all charges against the 36-year-old Rachidi were proven.

            The International Tennis Integrity Agency said Rachidi was involved in match-fixing with two Algerian players who were recently banned following investigations in Belgium.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805634,GM reaches computer chip supply deal with GlobalFoundries,"DETROIT (AP) — With the global shortage of semiconductors still crimping U.S auto production, General Motors has signed a deal with chipmaker GlobalFoundries to dedicate part of an upstate New York factory to supply the automaker.

            In a joint statement from the companies Thursday, Malta, New York-based GlobalFoundries said it will expand production capacity inside its Malta plant exclusively for GM's supply chain.

            The factory would supply finished computer chips to GM parts suppliers that manufacture computer modules to control everything from transmissions to brakes to radios. 











            GM said the deal is for a “long term,” but the company wouldn't say how long the agreement lasts. The companies also wouldn't say how many wafers would be produced or release financial details.

            “It's a partnership that includes investment from both sides,” GF spokeswoman Laurie Kelly said. It will take at least two years for the chips to start flowing as the company installs equipment and chips are designed, she said.

            New vehicles now have more than 1,000 chips in them, and that need will only grow with automated driving systems and connectivity that will be expanded in the coming years. GM and other automakers hope to make millions from selling software packages to customers, and chips will be needed to support those.

            Doug Parks, GM's head of purchasing and product development, said in the statement that the company expects to double its need for semiconductors over the next several years “as vehicles become technology platforms.”

            At the same time, GM, the largest automaker in the U.S., is trying to reduce the number of unique chips in each vehicle so the ones used by the company can be produced in higher volumes. 

            “GF will expand its production capabilities exclusively for GM's supply chain, enabling us to strengthen our partnership with the automotive industry and New York State,” Thomas Caulfield, GF's CEO, said in the statement.

            The deal won't create any new jobs immediately, but will shore up semiconductor supplies for the auto industry, GF said. 

            Shares of GM rose 3% in midday trading Thursday. 

            The auto industry has been hit hard by the global computer chip shortage that surfaced in 2020 as the novel coronavirus pandemic was spreading. Auto plants were forced to shut down early in the pandemic to help prevent the virus from spreading, but came back online faster than expected. At the same time, chipmakers switched production to semiconductors for computers, tablets and games as demand soared.

            That left the auto industry with too few chips, forcing companies to slow assembly lines and causing shortages at dealerships, driving up prices. Industry analysts expect the shortage to improve, but to continue at least into 2024.

            In an interview last summer, GM CEO Mary Barra said the company is throwing out its old business model of letting parts supply companies acquire the chips with GM knowing little about them. Instead, by 2025, it will move toward three families of chips that Barra said the company will buy and control itself. They will be able to do multiple tasks, eliminating the need for dozens of chips in every vehicle.

            That standardization will give GM the scale to buy in bulk and make sure supplies don’t get interrupted in the future, Barra said last July. “We’re also working with a select group of strategic companies to source these for the volumes. We’ll have much better control and a stable supply,"" she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805637,"Peltz, citing changes at Disney, ends push for seat on board","Activist investor Nelson Peltz has called off a proxy fight with Disney one day after newly returned CEO Bob Iger announced a major restructuring of the company that includes thousands of job cuts. 

            Peltz phoned into CNBC on Thursday to say that his firm, Trian Fund Management, got everything it wanted with the changes imposed by Iger. 

            “We will be watching, we will be rooting, and the proxy fight is over,"" Peltz said. 











            Peltz last month announced that he would seek a seat on the board of the entertainment company, citing a failed succession after Iger departed about two years ago and named Bob Chapek as his replacement. Peltz cited “over-the-top” compensation for executives and other issues.

            Disney on Wednesday said that it would cut about 7,000 jobs as part of an ambitious companywide cost-savings plan and “strategic reorganization."" 

            The job cuts amount to about 3% of the entertainment giant’s global workforce and were unveiled after Disney reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street’s forecasts. 

            That was apparently good enough for Peltz, who launched a fight for a board seat even after Chapek was ousted and Iger returned. 

            The company, which owns Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar, said this week that it will focus more on its core brands and franchises, Iger said.

            The executive also announced changes to how executives will operate Disney’s various divisions. Specifically, creative executives will now be responsible for determining what movies, TV series or other content to produce, as well as the marketing and distribution. 

            Shares of Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 2% Thursday. 

            Iger had handpicked Chapek as his successor, whose two-year tenure was marked by clashes, missteps and a weakening financial performance. Iger's return to Disney and ousting of Chapek came just a couple of weeks after Disney’s quarterly financial performance fell well short of Wall Street expectations on both profit and revenue, a rarity.

            While Disney's theme parks business has been performing well, many visitors over the past two years have been highly critical of increased prices and other moves that the company made, including the end of the Magical Express bus service from the airport in Orlando, Florida to Walt Disney World resorts, the implementation of the Genie planning and ride reservation system and its theme park reservation system.Activist investor Nelson Peltz has called off a proxy fight with Disney one day after newly returned CEO Bob Iger announced a major restructuring of the company that includes thousands of job cuts.Peltz phoned into CNBC on Thursday to say that his firm, Trian Fund Management, got everything it wanted with the changes imposed by Iger.“We will be watching, we will be rooting, and the proxy fight is over,"" Peltz said.Peltz last month announced that he would seek a seat on the board of the entertainment company, citing a failed succession after Iger departed about two years ago and named Bob Chapek as his replacement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805640,Average long-term US mortgage rates inch back up this week,"The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate ticked up slightly this week after four weeks of declines, a possible sign of stability that could draw in home shoppers with spring buying season weeks away.

            Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate inched up to 6.12% this week from 6.09% last week. The average rate a year ago was 3.69%.

            The average long-term rate reached a two-decade high of 7.08% in the fall as the Federal Reserve continued to raise its key lending rate in a bid to cool the economy and and bring down stubborn, four-decade high inflation. 











            At its first meeting of 2023 last week, the Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by a quarter point, its eighth increase in less than a year. That pushed the central bank’s key rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. 

            While acknowledging that some measures of inflation have eased, Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to suggest last week that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes this year.

            Though those rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investors’ expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.

            The big rise in mortgage rates during the past year has devastated the housing market, with sales of existing homes falling for 11 straight months to the lowest level in more than a decade. Higher rates can add hundreds of a dollars a month in costs for homebuyers, on top of already high home prices.

            The National Association of Realtors reported earlier this month that existing U.S. home sales totaled 5.03 million last year, a 17.8% decline from 2021. That is the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since 2008, during the housing crisis of the late 2000s. 

            The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, rose this week to 5.25% from 5.14% last week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805641,Native Americans renew protests of Kansas City Chiefs mascot,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs are the reason Rhonda LeValdo is in Arizona for the Super Bowl. But she won't be here to watch the game.

            LeValdo and other Native Americans will be pushing again for the Chiefs to abandon the team's name, mascot and fan-driven “tomahawk chop."" It's the same goal they had in 2021 when the Chiefs were vying for a second-consecutive Super Bowl win in Tampa, Florida.

            “People are trying to be really positive about Kansas City and what it does and how like ‘Yes, sports binds us all together,’” LeValdo, founder of the Kansas City-based Indigenous activist group Not In Our Honor, said at a news conference Thursday. “It’s not bringing our people into this celebration together. Really, it’s hurting us more because now it’s the bigger spotlight where you’re seeing this all over the world.”











            LeValdo will be joined by others from Kansas City and tribes in Arizona to demonstrate outside State Farm Stadium in Glendale. The president of the Kansas City franchise says he respects their right to protest.

            Fights against the appropriation of tribal cultures and images have endured for decades — not just with the Chiefs. Native Americans say using iconography and words with Native connotations demeans them and perpetuates racist stereotypes.

            “The anti-Native mascot movement has always been about the betterment of our Native people, not hatred towards others who are football fans,” said Amanda Blackhorse, who is Diné. “We want to live in a world where our children can attend school and feel included and not met with reenactments of fake war dances on the football field.”

            Some major sports teams have countered that the mascots are meant to honor and respect the tribes. But the racial reckoning and protests of 2020 after the murder of George Floyd compelled some franchises to do soul-searching. 

            The Cleveland Indians baseball team officially changed to the Guardians in November 2021. The team also axed Chief Wahoo, a logo that was a caricature of a Native American.

            A significant victory came when Washington dropped the name “Redskins, ” which is seen as a racial slur, and the logo after nearly nine decades. The team later became the Commanders.

            Chiefs President Mark Donovan gave no indication there is room for change. 

            “We also respect that we need to continue to educate and raise awareness of the Native American culture and the things we do to celebrate, that we’ve done more over the last seven years — I think — than any other team to raise awareness and educate ourselves,” Donovan said.

            The Super Bowl is playing out in a state that's home to 22 Native American tribes who collectively oversee about a quarter of the land base. The NFL has been emphasizing its collaborations with Native and Indigenous people based in Arizona.

            The Chiefs recently highlighted its long snapper James Winchester, a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, and center Creed Humphrey, who is from the Citizen Potawatomi Nation of Oklahoma.

            Lucinda Hinojos, who was born in Glendale and is of Apache and Yaqui descent, became the first Native and Chicana artist to partner with the NFL. Her painting is featured on all Super Bowl tickets and throughout the NFL Experience. 

            Colin Denny, a University of Arizona researcher and a member of the Navajo Nation, will perform “America the Beautiful” during the game’s pre-show. Denny, who is deaf, will utilize both American Sign Language and North American Indian Sign Language.

            The Chiefs have made efforts to address concerns about cultural insensitivities going back a decade but always stop short of altering the team name or fan-favorite gestures and chants. In 2013, the team created the American Indian Community Working Group, which has Native Americans serving as advisers to the team on promoting tribal cultures.

            “I'm going to them and saying, ‘What do you think about this? How does this make you feel?’"" Donovan said. ""I'm really proud of the things we've done and the people we've worked with.”

            This led to invitations for Cheyenne spiritual and ceremonial leaders to participate at some games. In 2020, the Chiefs banned fans from donning headdresses, war paint and clothing at Arrowhead Stadium. 

            The team also changed the ""tomahawk chop” with cheerleaders using a closed fist instead of an open palm — a move that Native American organizations in Kansas City called “laughable.”

            The Kansas City team started as the Dallas Texans. When the franchise moved to Kansas City in 1963, it became the Chiefs.

            Mayor H. Roe Bartle got permission from the Northern Arapaho at the time, and the team recently documented tribal officials confirming it, Donovan said.

            “We haven’t released it yet. We are waiting for the right timing to tell the story right,” Donovan said.

            LeValdo, who is friends with a former Northern Arapaho leader, called that assertion “fake.”

            She said Native organizers won't give up on trying to rid major sports of offensive mascots, names and imagery.

            ""There are young people that come with us as well,” said LeValdo, of Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico. “We’re looking forward to the next generation that’s going to carry that. There’s always going to be Native people who are against it. It’s not going to stop.”PHOENIX (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs are the reason Rhonda LeValdo is in Arizona for the Super Bowl. But she won't be here to watch the game.LeValdo and other Native Americans will be pushing again for the Chiefs to abandon the team's name, mascot and fan-driven “tomahawk chop."" It's the same goal they had in 2021 when the Chiefs were vying for a second-consecutive Super Bowl win in Tampa, Florida.“People are trying to be really positive about Kansas City and what it does and how like ‘Yes, sports binds us all together,’” LeValdo, founder of the Kansas City-based Indigenous activist group Not In Our Honor, said at a news conference Thursday. “It’s not bringing our people into this celebration together. Really, it’s hurting us more because now it’s the bigger spotlight where you’re seeing this all over the world.”LeValdo will be joined by others from Kansas City and tribes in Arizona to demonstrate outside State Farm Stadium in Glendale. The president of the Kansas City franchise says he respects their right to protest.Fights against the appropriation of tribal cultures and images have endured for decades — not just with the Chiefs. Native Americans say using iconography and words with Native connotations demeans them and perpetuates racist stereotypes.“The anti-Native mascot movement has always been about the betterment of our Native people, not hatred towards others who are football fans,” said Amanda Blackhorse, who is Diné. “We want to live in a world where our children can attend school and feel included and not met with reenactments of fake war dances on the football field.”Some major sports teams have countered that the mascots are meant to honor and respect the tribes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805643,French religious orders demand change over L'Arche abuses,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — The umbrella group of Catholic religious orders in France is demanding church authorities assume responsibility for horrific evidence of sexual, spiritual and psychological abuse in L’Arche, once a preeminent lay community dedicated to people with developmental disabilities.

            Sister Veronique Margron, president of the conference of religious orders in France, issued a devastating analysis Thursday of the implications of the findings of a two-year investigation into L’Arche, its founder, Jean Vanier, and his spiritual guru, the Rev. Thomas Philippe.

            The 437-page report, published on Jan. 30, offers a detailed forensic study of how Vanier created a secretive ""sect” within the heart of the Catholic Church designed entirely to feed his sexual appetites through “collective delirium” and mystical-sexual practices that he justified on spiritual grounds.











            Using seduction, manipulation, secrecy and coercion, the charismatic Vanier initiated as many as 25 young women into the “mystico-sexual practices” of the sect within L'Arche, convincing them of his sanctity while abusing them sexually and spiritually, the report found.

            In a statement on Thursday, Margron said the report prompted questions about the Catholic Church’s “entire ecclesial, theological and pastoral culture, since it has been the breeding ground for abuse, manipulation, aggression, lies and even death.”

            She said the report also laid bare how secrecy, and “the great silence” by the Vatican had enabled the “gnostic delusions"" of Vanier and Philippe, as well as their impunity and abuse.

            Philippe, who was subjected to a canonical trial for abuse and false mysticism in the 1950s, died in 1993. Varnier died in 2019; the following year, L’Arche came out with a preliminary report detailing the abuses he committed as founder of L’Arche. 

            The organization commissioned the more ample report from six researchers in different disciplines — history, sociology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis and theology. They conducted 119 interviews and had access to church archives, including from the then Holy Office investigation into Philippe.

            The findings are the latest to document cases of sexual and spiritual abuse of adult women by priests or charismatic lay leaders, which the Vatican has long dismissed as mere “boundary violations” by otherwise chaste men.

            Recently, in an interview with The Associated Press, Pope Francis acknowledged how women can be abused by these “seducing” personalities who manipulate their victims on spiritual grounds to take advantage of them sexually.VATICAN CITY (AP) — The umbrella group of Catholic religious orders in France is demanding church authorities assume responsibility for horrific evidence of sexual, spiritual and psychological abuse in L’Arche, once a preeminent lay community dedicated to people with developmental disabilities.Sister Veronique Margron, president of the conference of religious orders in France, issued a devastating analysis Thursday of the implications of the findings of a two-year investigation into L’Arche, its founder, Jean Vanier, and his spiritual guru, the Rev.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805644,"U.S., UK impose cybersecurity sanctions on Russian group","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday announced a joint U.S.-U.K. effort to sanction Russian cybercriminals as the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nears and Treasury tightens its efforts to financially punish violators of existing sanctions. 

            The U.S. coordinated with the United Kingdom to impose sanctions on seven people that it said are part of the Russia-based cybercrime gang Trickbot. All members are listed as living in Russia or Russian-occupied Ukraine.

            
                Trickbot is named for a strain of trojan viruses originally used to steal financial data. The viruses have infected millions of computers worldwide, including ransomware attacks that targeted hospitals in the United States at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, U.K. officials said. 











            In a statement, Treasury said the sanctioned men included developers, money-launderers and a senior figure, Vitaly Kovalev, who it said was indicted in federal court in New Jersey in connection with 2009 and 2010 bank hacks that predated his involvement with the Trickbot Group. 

            The U.S. statement said current members of the Trickbot Group are associated with Russian intelligence services but did not allege the sanctioned men worked with those services.

            Calling the actions “historic,” Treasury says these are the first sanctions of their kind for the U.K., and result from a partnership between the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and several U.K. agencies aimed at disrupting Russian cybercrime. 

            In a separate Treasury action, nine entities across Iran, Malaysia and Singapore were sanctioned on Thursday for their role in shipping sanctioned Iranian oil to buyers in Asia — continuing a trend of punishing firms that ship Iranian oil. 

            Six Iran-based petrochemical manufacturers and subsidiaries, and three firms in Malaysia and Singapore involved in facilitating the sale and shipment of oil, were hit with blocks to the U.S. financial system.

            Sanctions were imposed last July and September on a group of firms tied to the sale and shipment of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products to East Asia.

            U.S. sanctions on Iran have accelerated in recent months, as President Joe Biden's administration tries to bring Tehran back to negotiations for a return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805646,US House votes to condemn China over balloon surveillance,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted unanimously Thursday to condemn China's balloon surveillance program as a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty, a rare and swift bipartisan rebuke of Beijing as questions mount about the craft the U.S. says was part of a vast aerial spy program.

            The 419-0 action came as lawmakers clamoring for information about the balloon that flew across American skies were being briefed by U.S. officials in a classified session. The Senate also held a hearing Thursday about the balloon, which was shot down by the U.S. military last weekend.

            “This resolution, I believe, sends a clear bipartisan signal to the CCP and our adversaries around the world that this action will not be tolerated,” said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.











            In a Congress riven by partisan splits, the shared anxiety over China's stealthy balloon surveillance program and the reach of the Beijing's global military and economic force provided an unusual opening for bipartisan agreement. The four-page resolution came together quickly, overcoming initial partisan divisions.

            The top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, said China “needs to come clean” about its surveillance activities. “It is now up to Beijing to demonstrate not just to the United States but to the world that it is serious about respecting international rules and law,” he said.

            The balloon flew from Alaska to the Atlantic Coast, but the U.S. didn't shoot it down until it was over the Atlantic, off South Carolina. That decision sparked bipartisan concerns, questions and outrage, some of it directed at President Joe Biden for not acting sooner. But the GOP-led House set criticism of Biden aside for now and focused instead on the People's Republic of China.

            While it doesn't carry the force of law, the resolution approved by the House stands as an expression of concern as Congress delves into questions about the balloon and China's surveillance activity.

            Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who chaired a Senate subcommittee hearing Thursday on the balloon, said earlier this week he wanted to know where ""exactly it flew — particularly in Montana because I’m very familiar with where the (missile) silos are — and questions like, Did it have capability to hover?”

            Congress has been delving into such questions since the balloon captured America's attention late last week, refocusing lawmakers on China.

            “There are very few bipartisan issues in Washington these days, but our national concern about the PRC is one of them,” said retired U.S. Navy Adm. Harry Harris in testimony this week before the House Armed Services Committee.

            “Make no mistake, that balloon was intentionally launched as a calculated show of force,” said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chair of the House Armed Services Committee, during Tuesday's hearing. “We have to stop being naïve about the threat we face from China.”WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted unanimously Thursday to condemn China's balloon surveillance program as a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty, a rare and swift bipartisan rebuke of Beijing as questions mount about the craft the U.S. says was part of a vast aerial spy program.The 419-0 action came as lawmakers clamoring for information about the balloon that flew across American skies were being briefed by U.S. officials in a classified session.

            Legge will enter the race in the No. 44 Honda with sponsorship from Hendrickson, a global manufacturer and supplier of suspension systems. 

            She is one of only nine women to compete in the Indy 500; she finished 22nd in 2012 and 26th in 2013.











            “I am thrilled to be back at Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing for the biggest race in the world, the Indy 500,"" Legge said. ""Bobby gave me my first chance to win races for the team in the Jaguar I-PACE series a few years ago and it feels like a homecoming of sorts to be back with the team.

            “Racing at Indy with an Indy 500-winning team and with Honda is an amazing opportunity, and one I am very grateful for and intend to make the most of.”

            Legge will be teammates with Graham Rahal, Christian Lundgaard and Jack Harvey. RLL won the Indy 500 in 2020 with Takuma Sato.

            She has 11 career IndyCar starts and the British racer has been competing in the IMSA GTD class in an Acura NSX GT3. She scored a win, a pole and three podiums with RLL in the Jaguar I-PACE eTROPHY series in the 2018-19 ABB FIA Formula E season.

            Legge competed in the Champ Car World Series fulltime in 2006 and 2007.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805658,Church of England allows blessings for same-sex couples,"LONDON (AP) — The Church of England’s national assembly on Thursday voted to let priests bless same-sex marriages and civil partnerships, while continuing to ban church weddings for the same couples.

            Bishops proposed the compromise measure after five years of discussions about the church’s position on sexuality. It was approved by the church’s General Synod, which is made up of bishops, clergy and lay people from around the country, following eight hours of debate over two days at a meeting in London.

            The measure included an apology for the church’s failure welcome LGBTQ people. But it also endorsed the doctrine that marriage is between one man and one woman, meaning priests are still barred from marrying same-sex couples.











            “I know that what we have proposed as a way forward does not go nearly far enough for many but too far for others,” the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, said in a statement. “It is my prayer that what has been agreed today will represent a step forward for all of us within the Church — including LGBTQI+ people — as we remain committed to walking together.”

            Jayne Ozanne, a gay rights campaigner and member of the synod, said she was “deeply disappointed” that conservatives had stifled the church’s debate on sexuality. The synod earlier this week rejected an amendment proposed by Ozanne that would have put the issue of marriage equality back on the agenda later this year.

            “By continuing to tell LGB people that they cannot hope to get married any time soon in their church or that their desire for sexual intimacy is sinful, we send a message to the nation that few will understand,” Ozanne said on Twitter. “More importantly, it is a message that will continue to cause great harm to the LGBT community and put young LGBT+ lives at risk.”

            Same-sex marriage has been legal in England and Wales since 2013, but the church didn't alter its teaching on marriage when the law changed.

            Public opinion surveys consistently show that a majority of people in England support same-sex marriage. But the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the church continues to have “deep divisions” on the issue.

            The measure approved Thursday endorses a proposal from the church’s bishops to allow clergy to bless the unions of same-sex couples after they marry or have a partnership recognized by civil authorities. But clergy members won’t be required to perform such blessings if they disagree with them.

            The blessings are expected to begin later this year after the bishops refine their guidance and issue prayers for the clergy to use.

            Welby said last month that he wouldn’t personally bless any same-sex couples because it's his job to unify the 85 million members of the Anglican Communion around the world. Welby is the spiritual leader of both the Church of England and the global Anglican church of which it is a member.

            Still, he celebrated Thursday’s decision.

            “It has been a long road to get us to this point,” Welby said in a statement issued jointly with the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell. “For the first time, the Church of England will publicly, unreservedly and joyfully welcome same-sex couples in church.”LONDON (AP) — The Church of England’s national assembly on Thursday voted to let priests bless same-sex marriages and civil partnerships, while continuing to ban church weddings for the same couples.Bishops proposed the compromise measure after five years of discussions about the church’s position on sexuality.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805659,Spain's constitutional court rejects abortion law challenge,"MADRID (AP) — Spain’s constitutional court on Thursday rejected a challenge lodged more than a decade ago by the conservative Popular Party against a law allowing abortions in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. 

            The legal challenge had “not obtained the support” of the court, the verdict said. The main opposition PP's legal argument had centered on the constitutionality of the right to life of the fetus.

            Four new judges were appointed to the 12-member court last year, shifting its political balance to the left.











            “The Abortion Law is constitutional,” tweeted Spain's Equality Minister Irene Montero, who represents the far-left United We Can party within the coalition government. “Never again should 13 years go by questioning a single right” for women.

            Such delays are not uncommon in Spanish courts.

            Abortion has once again become a politically sensitive issue in Spain in an election year. A far-right member of the regional government of Castile and Leon proposed in January that doctors should have to give women a chance to listen to fetal heartbeats and see four-dimensional ultrasound scans before any abortion procedure. The idea was subsequently dropped. Spain’s regional governments have jurisdiction over public health policy at a regional level. 

            The 2010 abortion law was a major shift for a traditionally Catholic country under the leadership of former Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The law allowed for on-demand abortion at up to 14 weeks, and at up to 22 weeks if there was a serious threat to the health of the mother, or fetal malformation.

            The Popular Party has long sided with the Roman Catholic Church on moral and social issues. However, following the court’s decision, the PP’s current leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo said the existing window for abortion access in Spain was “correct” and that he would respect the court’s decision.MADRID (AP) — Spain’s constitutional court on Thursday rejected a challenge lodged more than a decade ago by the conservative Popular Party against a law allowing abortions in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.The legal challenge had “not obtained the support” of the court, the verdict said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805660,Texas gives interim coach Rodney Terry raise to $1.2M,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas officials have more than doubled interim coach Rodney Terry's salary to $1.2 million this season as he leads the No. 5 Longhorns after the midseason firing of former coach Chris Beard.

            Terry took over the team as acting head coach when Beard was initially suspended following his arrest on a felony domestic violence charge on allegations he choked, hit and bit his fiancée.

            
                Terry was given the interim head coach title when Beard was fired on Jan. 5. Texas (19-4, 8-3) sits in first place in the Big 12, which the Longhorns haven't won since 2008.











            Terry's previous salary was $500,000. When the raise took effect was not immediately clear. It was first reported Thursday by the Austin American-Statesman.

            “He's doing the duties of a head coach and we chose to adjust his salary as he leads our program the rest of the year,” Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte said Thursday.

            Terry has recently increased his off-court duties, stepping into previously-contracted slots for the head coach on weekly television and radio programs.

            Del Conte declined comment on the search to fill the job permanently, but has praised Terry's results with the Longhorns (19-4, 8-3) after Beard's suspension and firing.

            Beard, who school officials said was “unfit” to continue leading the program, has put his Austin house up for sale for nearly $5 million. Online court records show a hearing in his case scheduled for March 1.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805661,Racist video spurs protest at Catholic high school,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Two students at a Catholic high school in Philadelphia who allegedly were responsible for a racist video that showed teenage white girls in blackface “are not present in school"" and are being disciplined, according to school officials.

            The video, which was circulated on social media this week, sparked a protest Wednesday at St. Hubert Catholic High School for Girls. The protesters included parents of two former students who told The Philadelphia Inquirer their children faced a hostile and unwelcoming climate because they were Black. 

            The school has switched to flexible instruction, with students completing coursework at home this week, after unspecified “reactionary general threats” were made, according to administrators. The school also canceled extracurricular activities on campus for the remainder of the week on the advice of the Philadelphia Police Department, the newspaper reported.











            The video shows several white teen girls, with one spray-painting the face of another with a dark color and yelling “Know your roots!” and “It’s February!” and “You’re nothing but a slave.” The girl with the blackface then declares: “I’m Black and I’m proud!” Other girls present laugh throughout the video.

            In a Facebook post Tuesday, school officials said they were aware of the video and were investigating. On Wednesday, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia declined to provide specific details about how the students involved with the video were being disciplined, but noted one of the girls is from a non-Catholic high school in Philadelphia.

            St. Hubert’s has directed all media inquiries to the archdiocese, which has released a statement condemning the video post. Spokesperson Ken Gavin told the newspaper that the archdiocese was not familiar with the claims made by the parents at the protest.

            “We view racism as a mortal sin. There is no place for it in our hearts and minds and there is no tolerance for such behavior at Saint Hubert’s or any Catholic School,"" Gavin said in a statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805662,Lawyer: Missouri executed man with appeal still pending,"The attorney for a man who was executed this week is calling for an investigation, accusing Missouri officials of moving ahead with the lethal injection while federal appeals were pending.

            
                Raheem Taylor, 58, was executed Tuesday night for the 2004 deaths of his girlfriend and her three children in suburban St. Louis. Taylor claimed he was out of state when the family was killed. Investigators don't deny he was in California when the bodies were found but a medical examiner determined the victims had died up to three weeks earlier — at a time when Taylor was still in Missouri.

            The innocence claim was turned aside repeatedly in the days leading up to the execution. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, a Democrat, declined to ask a judge for a new hearing, stating the “facts are not there to support a credible case of innocence.”











            Republican Gov. Mike Parson denied clemency, saying evidence showed that “Taylor committed these atrocities and a jury found him guilty.” The Missouri Supreme Court declined to grant a stay on Monday, and the U.S. Supreme Court did the same about two hours before the execution.

            While appeals over Taylor's claims of innocence had been exhausted, Taylors attorneys asked a federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay because Taylor's spiritual adviser, Anthony Shahid, was not allowed to be in the execution room. A Supreme Court decision last year allows inmates to have spiritual advisers near them at executions. The appeal also questioned why two lawyers who supported Taylor couldn’t witness the execution.

            “It was being appealed at the time they killed him,” Kent Gipson, an attorney for Taylor, said Thursday. “And although there technically wasn't a stay in place, they've never done this before — this has never happened before in almost 100 executions. That's what's disturbing about it.”

            Taylor's lawyers urged an internal investigation by the Missouri Department of Corrections and investigations by “other law enforcement agencies.”

            Madeline Sieren, spokeswoman for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, said there was no reason not to move ahead with the execution.

            “As there was no stay in place, the Attorney General’s Office fulfilled its legal obligation to notify the Governor’s Office and the Department of Corrections at the appropriate time that there was no legal impediment to carrying out the execution warrant set forth by the Missouri Supreme Court,” Sieren said in a statement on Thursday.

            Missouri Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said Taylor initially declined to have Shahid with him for the execution. He changed his mind over the weekend but by then it was too late to change the witness list because the prison needs time to conduct background checks, Pojmann said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805663,GOP asks for records from Biden's family on business deals,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans made the first official requests Thursday for documents from Hunter and James Biden regarding their foreign business dealings, further escalating a wide-ranging investigation into the president's family. 

            Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent letters to President Joe Biden's son, Hunter; the president's brother, James; and their former business manager seeking documents and communications related to foreign business pursuits ""with individuals who were connected to the Chinese Communist Party.”

            “If President Biden is compromised by deals with foreign adversaries and they are impacting his decision making, this is a threat to national security,” Comer said in a statement. 











            The letters are the most recent action by Republicans in pursuit of the Biden family for what they have alleged is “influence peddling,"" but have so far failed to produce evidence supporting those claims. 

            The broad requests include any record “designated classified"" and communications between the president or James Biden and his wife, Sara Jones Biden, and Hunter Biden from Jan. 20, 2009, regarding travel and financial activity.

            A lawyer for Hunter Biden dismissed the request Thursday as an effort by Comer to peddle his own “inaccurate and baseless conclusions under the guise of a real investigation.”

            “As your Letter is a sweeping attempt to collect an expansive array of documents and communications from President Biden and his family, I write to explain that the Committee on Oversight and Accountability lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and oversight basis for requesting such records from Mr. Biden, who is a private citizen,” attorney Abbe Lowell wrote in a letter to the committee. 

            Shortly after taking over control of the House, Republicans, led by Comer and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, launched a series of sprawling inquiries into the president's family, sending records requests to nearly every government agency.

            Last month, Comer wielded the power of the new Republican House majority to seek information from the Treasury Department about financial transactions by members of the Biden family that were flagged as suspicious activity. Those reports are routine, with larger financial transactions automatically flagged to the government, and are not evidence on their own of misconduct.

            Weeks later, the Kentucky Republican asked for a transcribed interview with Georges Bergès, the art dealer who has been showcasing Hunter Biden’s work in New York and Los Angeles galleries since 2021. He requested communications between the gallery and the White House, citing Republican concerns that the younger Biden is trading in on his father’s name.

            And Wednesday, former Twitter executives testified before Congress about the company’s decision to initially block from Twitter a New York Post article in October 2020 about the contents of a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden. 

            The former employees conceded during an hours-long and at time intense hearing that Twitter made a mistake by blocking a story about the president’s son in the run-up to the 2020 election, but adamantly denied Republican assertions they were pressed by Democrats and law enforcement to suppress the story.WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans made the first official requests Thursday for documents from Hunter and James Biden regarding their foreign business dealings, further escalating a wide-ranging investigation into the president's family.Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805664,Mexico: Ex-security chief stole $745 million from contracts,"Mexican authorities said Thursday that former top security official Genaro Garcia Luna embezzled as much as $745.9 million from government technology contracts.

            Pablo Gómez, the head of Mexico's anti-money laundering unit, said Garcia Luna and associates set up companies that got 30 dubious government contracts while he was Mexico's top security official in 2006-2012 and for six years afterward. 

            Garcia Luna “put together a network of corruption and money laundering to benefit himself and his close associates,” Gómez said.











            Gómez described some of the properties the Mexican government is seeking to recover in a lawsuit filed in Florida against Garcia Luna and his alleged associates, who he described as a “family business conglomerate.” Garcia Luna moved to Florida after leaving office in Mexico.

            García Luna is currently on trial in New York, accused of accepting millions of dollars to let the Sinaloa cartel traffic tons of cocaine to the U.S.. The lawsuit is separate from the criminal trial.

            Garcia Luna allegedly channeled money from prison security and government intelligence technology contracts to offshore accounts, many in Barbados, then sent it to Miami to buy fancy condos and vintage cars.

            Gómez suggested Garcia Luna and his associates had a penchant for vintage Mustangs from the 1960s and '70s, saying they had bought several of them. He said they also bought luxury sports cars like Lamborghinis and Ferraris.

            Gómez said the Florida lawsuit was filed in September 2021. 

            The contracts were for things like surveillance, monitoring and communications equipment used in prisons and in intelligence work. The contracts were presumably inflated. In one case, Gómez said, the contract was simply falsified. 

            In New York, Garcia Luna is on trial accused of accepting briefcases full of cash — millions of dollars, in all — to let the notorious Sinaloa cartel operate with impunity as it sent cocaine to the U.S. His defense has denied the charges, noting the prosecution's evidence is based on verbal testimony from imprisoned former drug traffickers. 

            Garcia Luna served as secretary of public security under President Felipe Calderon from 2006 to 2012. His lawyers say he was a legitimate businessman who did consulting in Florida before he was arrested in 2019.

            Mexico's current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has long complained that when corrupt politicians and drug traffickers are convicted in the United States, the U.S. seizes and keeps their fortunes, which were often largely made in Mexico. López Obrador wants Mexico to recover that money.Mexican authorities said Thursday that former top security official Genaro Garcia Luna embezzled as much as $745.9 million from government technology contracts.Pablo Gómez, the head of Mexico's anti-money laundering unit, said Garcia Luna and associates set up companies that got 30 dubious government contracts while he was Mexico's top security official in 2006-2012 and for six years afterward.Garcia Luna “put together a network of corruption and money laundering to benefit himself and his close associates,” Gómez said.Gómez described some of the properties the Mexican government is seeking to recover in a lawsuit filed in Florida against Garcia Luna and his alleged associates, who he described as a “family business conglomerate.” Garcia Luna moved to Florida after leaving office in Mexico.García Luna is currently on trial in New York, accused of accepting millions of dollars to let the Sinaloa cartel traffic tons of cocaine to the U.S..

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805667,"Stewart, Vandersloot aim to bring 1st WNBA title to New York","NEW YORK (AP) — Breanna Stewart and Courtney Vandersloot have won titles together playing overseas. The pair hope their championship pedigrees can help the New York Liberty win their first WNBA championship.

            The Liberty made the biggest splash in the offseason by signing the two free agents and trading for Jonquel Jones, giving New York one of the most potent lineups in the league. Stewart and Vandersloot play together in Turkey, but are currently on break from the overseas league. They've also played on teams with Jones during the winter in Russia.

            “I speak for myself and I believe Sloot, when I say we both wanted to play together in the WNBA and go after a WNBA championship together,” Stewart said during a press conference on Thursday at the Barclays Center. ""It’s much better to be on her side than against her.”











            While Stewart was in New York, she was thinking about Turkey and neighboring Syria, as the area is dealing with the aftermath of an earthquake that hit the region Monday and has killed over 20,000 people. 

            “It's so devastating and I know the only way to get through this is to unite and have hope and faith that they'll find as many people as possible,” Stewart said. ""I don't know anyone directly impacted by it, but playing for Fenerbahçe with my teammates I'm sure there are many who are indirectly impacted. I'm working on what I can do individually to help, but I know when I get back to Turkey we'll do something as a team.” 

            The pair took less than maximum salaries of $228,000 to play together in New York so that the team could fit all of its stars under the league's salary cap. They don't see themselves as starting a trend of signing with teams that get financial discounts on top talent.

            “I think what we're setting a precedent for is to be willing to play with other great players and to want to win and to do whatever we can to make that happen,"" Stewart said.

            Stewart had spent her entire career in Seattle since the Storm drafted her No. 1 overall in 2016. She won championship with the team in 2018 and 2020.

            The 28-year-old wing has averaged 20.3 points and 8.6 rebounds in her WNBA career. She missed the 2019 season with an Achilles tendon injury.

            “Today is a historic day for the New York Liberty organization and fanbase,” said Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb. “Stewie and Sloot are winners and choosing the Liberty in free agency shows that we’re all in on our commitment to bring a championship to New York. Both players are among the league’s all-time greats, consummate teammates, and high-character individuals.”

            Vandersloot had played with Chicago since the Sky drafted the Gonzaga guard third in 2011. She helped Chicago win their lone championship in 2021. Vandersloot, who is No. 3 all-time on the WNBA’s assist list, averaged 11.8 points and 6.5 assists for the Sky last season. 

            “I was a part of a first-time champion in the Chicago Sky. I do know how special that first time is,"" Vandersloot said. “So to bring that first one for the Liberty, it is something special. There’s a lot of work to do before that.”

            Coming to New York brings former UConn star Stewart closer to home. She grew up in Syracuse, which is an hour flight away. She’ll also have a shorter flight to Spain to visit relatives of her wife, Marta.

            New York representatives, including coach Sandy Brondello and co-owner Clara Wu Tsai, met with Stewart in Turkey last week. 

            “At the beginning of the offseason you know we set a goal to really assemble the best possible team that we could in order to contend for a championship,"" Tsai said. ""I really think that we are in a position to do this.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805668,"Scaloni, Ancelotti, Guardiola on FIFA coach award shortlist","ZURICH (AP) — Lionel Scaloni, Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola were shortlisted Thursday for a “best coach” award, while Walid Regragui didn’t get enough votes despite leading Morocco on a stunning run to the World Cup semifinals.

            A worldwide selection panel of national team coaches and captains, plus selected media and fans voting online chose Scaloni of Argentina, Real Madrid’s Ancelotti and Manchester City’s Guardiola as finalists for FIFA's Best Men’s Coach award for 2022.

            Argentina won the World Cup, Madrid won the UEFA Champions League and City captured the English Premier League title.











            Regragui was appointed in August less than three months before the World Cup started and led his team unbeaten through a group that included Belgium and Croatia. Morocco then eliminated Spain and Portugal before an injury-stricken team lost to defending champion France. During the run, Regragui had voiced concerns about a lack of respect for Arab coaches.

            No coach from Africa or of an African team has ever been voted into a top-three shortlist since the first FIFA coaching award was made in 2010.

            Only European and South American coaches have ever finished in the top-three places despite two-thirds of the voting panel members coming from outside the continents.

            Scaloni is a likely favorite to get the award on Feb. 27 in Paris after World Cup-winning coaches Didier Deschamps and Joachim Löw also won the FIFA votes for 2018 and 2014, respectively.

            After winning the 2010 World Cup, Spain’s then-coach Vicente del Bosque was just beaten in the FIFA-organized vote by José Mourinho, whose Inter Milan team had won the Champions League and Serie A.

            Guardiola won the FIFA coaching award for 2011 when he was with Barcelona. Ancelotti has never won; he was runner-up in 2014 to Löw for winning a Champions League in his first spell with Madrid.

            On the women’s coaching award shortlist Thursday, two-time winner Sarina Wiegman — who won the 2017 and 2020 votes for coaching her native Netherlands — seeks a third FIFA win for leading England to the European Championship title last year.

            Another European champion, Sonia Bompastor, who guided Lyon to a sixth Women’s Champions League title in seven years, is on the list that is completed by Pia Sundhage. She led Brazil to win the 2022 Copa América Femenina.

            Sundhage won the FIFA award for 2012 as coach of the United States’ Olympic champion team.

            FIFA is scheduled to announce the three-candidate shortlists Friday for the men’s and women’s Best Player award.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805669,Bill that would restrict drag shows passes Tennessee Senate,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Legislation designed to restrict where certain drag shows can take place passed the Tennessee Senate on Thursday, the latest bill state Republican leaders have advanced targeting LGBTQ people. 

            Senate lawmakers voted 26-6 in favor of the bill, with only Democrats opposing. The bill is slightly different than a version moving through the House chamber.

            Under the Senate's bill, the words “drag show” are not explicitly stated. Instead, the legislation would expand the definition of adult cabaret in Tennessee’s law to include that such “adult-oriented performances that are harmful to minors,"" as defined in Tennessee’s obscenity law.











            The legislation then bans adult cabaret from taking place on public property or in a location where minors might be present.

            “We don’t want to have the door open that they can go see advertent nudity and sexual acts or the depiction of sexual acts,” said Republican Sen. Becky Massey. ""I’m sorry, that’s not what Tennessee is about.”

            In Tennessee and across the country, drag has been cast in a false light by right-wing activists and politicians who complain about the “sexualization” or “grooming” of children. 

            Drag does not typically involve nudity or stripping, which are more common in burlesque, a separate form of entertainment. Explicitly sexual and profane language is common in performances meant for adult audiences. These routines can consist of stand-up comedy that may be raunchy — or may pale in comparison with some mainstream comedians.

            “Leveraging fear of others may be politically advantageous, but it's the antithesis of good governance,"" Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell said. 

            During Thursday's debate, Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson declined to directly answer questions on how his legislation would be enforced — particularly if it would effect drag brunches, performers who wear drag attire during pride events or grooms who wear kilts during a wedding ceremony — and chose to read the legislation and definitions in current law instead.

            “I would encourage you to direct (constituents) to the obscenity statute,” Johnson said. 

            The attention now moves to the House, which is debating a slightly different version.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the deal had not yet been announced. 

            The move bolsters the front court for Boston, which currently has the best record in the Eastern Conference, but is looking for backup for Robert Williams and Al Horford.

The Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual head of both the Church of England and the Anglican Communion.Anglicanism is the third-largest Christian communion after the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, with its number of followers reaching around 85 million.Some of the largest Anglican Churches are found in sub-Saharan Africa where many countries are highly religious and conservative and where homosexuality still remains banned outright and can result in prison sentences.ab/jcg (AFP, AP)",2023/2/9,,

Other multinational energy firms have simultaneously registered record windfalls, among them BP ($28 billion) and fossil fuel powerhouse, Exxon Mobil ($56 billion).The super profits are thanks in large part to spiraling energy prices driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Amid skyrocketing consumer energy costs, the likes of US president Joe Biden have labelled the wins a ""windfall of war"" and demanded higher taxes.But the oil and gas bonanza has sparked a parallel concern that climate mitigation targets are being sacrificed for profits.BP this week announced record earnings and a higher dividend for shareholders. At the same time, it also watered down pledges to reduce climate-warping greenhouse gas emissions and raised oil and gas production targets.BP head Bernard Looney was accused of making a complete U-turn, after pioneering commitments to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 just three years ago.""We need a rapid transition to net zero. Society has got to deliver on the Paris goals,"" said Looney in 2020.Now a promised emissions cut of 35-40% by 2030 will be scaled back to 20-30%. Commitments to reduce fossil fuel production by 40% by 2030 will be decreased to 25%.""The shift in BP's strategy flies in the face of the world's urgent need to reduce fossil fuel production,"" said Maeve O'Connor, an oil, gas and mining analyst at UK-based climate think tank, Carbon Tracker.BP told DW that 35% of its capital expenditure will be invested in ""transition growth engines,"" that is to say energy transition investments that include electric vehicle (EV) chargers and sustainable aviation fuels. The figure is ""expected"" to grow to 50% by 2030, said a spokesperson.But the $8 billion BP has earmarked for transition growth engines by 2030 will be offset by a planned $8 billion ""capital spending on oil and gas,"" said O'Connor.BP isn't the only company scaling back. Analysts say a negligible proportion of oil and gas profits are being reinvested into the clean energy transition that is key to keeping temperature rise below 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).About 1.5% of Shell's total expenditure in 2021 was invested in wind and solar electricity projects —defined as renewables under the ""EU taxonomy for sustainable activities"" — according to reporting by environmental campaigners Global Witness.While Shell said that 12% of its capital expenditure was earmarked for ""renewable and energy solutions,"" the UK-based climate group found a ""significant portion"" of this spending ""actually goes to investments in climate-wrecking [natural] gas.""Natural or fossil gas is commonly referred to as a bridge or ""transition"" fuel, including by the EU. While burning gas pumps out less carbon than coal, it emits a lot of methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 — even if it dissipates faster.Global Witness have lodged a complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling on the watchdog to investigate Shell's ""misleading claims that overstate its energy transition efforts.""""Shell shouldn't get away with using its tiny investments in renewables as a fig leaf to cover up the reality that it is continuing to profit from the energy crisis at the expense of people and the planet,"" said Zorka Milin, a senior legal advisor at Global Witness.Including gas under renewables was a form of greenwashing, added Milin.Shell boss Wael Sawan said he would ""refute the claim"" that the fossil fuel firm's renewable energy solutions' accounting is misleading due to the high gas component.The company said it had invested about $3.5 billion in 2022 in renewables and energy solutions and that would remain steady in 2023.Sawan said in a call with reporters in a call with reporters that there ""had been a real pivot toward energy transition investments,"" but that those investments ""go into the areas where we can see line of sight toward attractive returns to be able to reward our shareholders.""Shell told DW in a statement that the reported ""capital expenditure in our renewables and energy solutions (RES) business"" doesn't account for ""energy-transition"" spending in other areas like ""EV charging or biofuels, or investments in renewable natural gas.""But Milin of Global Witness said that activities such as EV charging also include ""Shell's global network of petrol stations which power conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles.""According to a recent report by Influence Map, a think tank monitoring the impact of lobbying on climate policy, companies are misleading the public about their clean energy commitments.The big five supermajor oil and gas companies — Shell, TotalEnergies, BP, ExxonMobil, and Chevron — spent an average of $750 million in 2021 on climate-related communications activites. That's a conservative estimate, said the authors.Around 60% made ""green claims,"" including about their pro-climate credentials, that were ""inconsistent"" with investment plans, according to the study.Around 12% of the oil majors' 2022 capital expenditure was forecast to be earmarked for ""low carbon"" activities, which is well short of the Paris Agreement climate goals, the report said.""It's an effort to push action to actually mitigate climate change further and further down the line,"" Faye Holder, an analyst at Influence Map, said of the strategy.Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting scramble for gas ""a lot of that green PR has fallen to the wayside,"" said Holder, adding that communications are now back ""to overtly promoting oil and gas"" as a way to achieve ""energy security.""Reporting by Influence Map and researchers at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands found that three European oil and gas companies posted signifiantly more ""patriotic"" claims on social media about ""energy security"" and ""energy independence,"" while green claims were steady or decreased by almost 20% in the case of Shell.Assertions by oil and gas majors like BP and shell that fossil fuels like gas are key to energy security are ""disingenuous,"" considering the potential to quickly accelerate renewable capacity, said Thomas Day, an analyst at the Berlin-based think tank, the New Climate Institute.As renewable energy prices plummet, and in a scenario where oil prices again fall precipitously, traditional energy companies face the risk of holding into a portfolio of ""stranded"" assets, said Guy Prince, oil analyst at Carbon Tracker. These are assets that become a liability as they are no longer economically viable.But Prince says oil and gas companies are willing to take the risk because renewables go ""against their core business model.""""They [oil and gas majors] can't make as much money from it,"" he said of investing in renewables.The oil and gas majors enjoy effective monopoly market share, Prince said. This will not be the case with renewables, with more established playersalready leading the market.""The decades of technical experience they have is in oil and gas,"" Prince said. ""These companies are not going to lead us out of the climate crisis.""Kristie Pladson contributed to this report.Edited by: Jennifer Collins",2023/2/9,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805677,"Nuggets acquire Bryant from Lakers, send Hyland to Clippers","DENVER (AP) — The Western Conference-leading Denver Nuggets picked up center Thomas Bryant from the Los Angeles Lakers in a four-team deal that also saw guard Bones Hyland wind up with the Los Angeles Clippers.

            As part of a trade that also involved the Orlando Magic, Denver sent guard Davon Reed and a second-round pick to the Lakers, general manager Calvin Booth announced Thursday.

            The arrival of Bryant gives the Nuggets another big man to back up two-time reigning NBA MVP Nikola Jokic. Bryant averaged 12.1 points and 6.8 rebounds for the Lakers this season, while shooting 65.4% from the floor.











            The 25-year-old Bryant was taken in the second round by Utah in 2017, but was quickly sent to Lakers as part of a trade.

            Reed has played sparingly for the Nuggets this season. The 27-year-old shooting guard is averaging 2.3 points.

            With Jokic averaging a triple-double this season, the Nuggets have risen to the top of the West. But the conference got a whole lot more difficult with Kyrie Irving's arrival in Dallas and the Phoenix Suns trading for Kevin Durant.

            Jokic has plenty of help this season, though, with the return of max players Jamal Murray (he missed all of last season as he recovered from a torn ACL) and Michael Porter Jr. (sidelined last year by a balky back). Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has been a big addition, along with Bruce Brown. Aaron Gordon is posting big numbers, too.

            Hyland was a crowd favorite with his long-range shooting and charismatic personality. But he saw his role as the backup point guard reduced over the past few games with his name surfacing in trade rumors. Hyland hasn't played for Denver since Jan. 31. 

            The 22-year-old player out of Virginia Commonwealth was selected to the NBA’s Jordan Rising Stars Challenge, which is part of All-Star weekend. He's averaging 12.1 points and three assists this season. 

            Hyland's teammates respected his game and were lamenting the possibility of losing him in the lead-up to the trade deadline.

            “If it didn’t work out here, I know he’s going be a star,” Porter said Tuesday night after a 146-112 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. “I know we’re going to be looking back like, ‘Dang.’ We have a certain offense and maybe some people don’t think that Bones fits that. But I always appreciated his game. I think he’ll blossom into a star somewhere.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805678,Nevada battery recycler wins $2B loan from Energy Department,"MCCARRAN, Nev. (AP) — A Nevada company that recycles batteries for electric vehicles has won a $2 billion green energy loan from the Biden administration.

            Redwood Materials, a recycling venture founded by the former chief technology officer at Tesla Inc., secured the conditional loan from the Energy Department's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, which helped Tesla more than a decade ago.

            Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced the grant Thursday at Redwood’s facility in Nevada with Gov. Joe Lombardo, where they spoke from a stage to dozens of employees.











            “This region is leading the way to a broader story of what is happening in the country,” Granholm said, pointing to a map of 80 battery manufacturing or supply chain companies that are expanding or opening in the U.S. Most have been announced in response to the infrastructure law President Joe Biden signed in 2021 and the climate law he signed last year, she said.

            Battery recycling will help the U.S. establish its own electric-vehicle supply chain, a major goal of the Biden administration as it seeks to move away from gas-powered cars in the larger fight against climate change. Biden also has promoted domestic production of critical minerals used in EVs and other electronics, as part of the climate fight and to counter China's longtime dominance in the supply chain.

            With Redwood and other projects underway, “China might be starting to worry,″ Granholm boasted. “And to that I say we’re just getting started.″

            The Energy Department said its conditional commitment demonstrates its intent to finance the Nevada project, but several steps remain before officials approve a final loan.

            Redwood Materials was founded in 2017 by Jeffrey “JB” Straubel, Tesla’s former chief technology officer. It now has more than 300 employees who recycle used batteries and has supply contracts with Ford and with Panasonic, which makes batteries for Tesla.

            Straubel said the company already has more material than it can process from spent consumer batteries from lawnmowers, cellphones and toothbrushes, as well as production scraps from lithium-ion battery manufacturing.

            The company says it can recover more than 95% of the elements in a spent battery, including lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper. The metals are then used to make anode and cathode components for new battery cells.

            Redwood Materials “is going to play this outsized role in bringing the batteries supply chain home — because you’re focused on the pieces that we don’t have in the United States,'' Granholm told employees at Thursday's event. “You guys are making history in this.''

            Redwood Materials is expected to create about 3,400 construction jobs and employ about 1,600 full-time workers, the department said.

            Redwood Materials’ history in Nevada started under former Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, who was in attendance on Thursday. It continued under Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak before the loan was conditionally approved under Lombardo, who acknowledged he was a latecomer to negotiations. The investments and subsequent jobs help fulfill a campaign pledge by Lombardo and past governors to diversify Nevada’s casino and tourism-based economy.

            “This is what we’re going to have to do to have success in the state of Nevada,” Lombardo said. “We can’t have all our eggs in one basket.”

            In December, the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development awarded $105 million in tax incentives to Redwood, the second-largest capital investment in the office’s history, behind Tesla.

            Last month, the Energy Department announced a conditional loan of $700 million to an Australian company to mine lithium in northern Nevada as the U.S. seeks domestic supplies for the key component in electric vehicle batteries.

            Redwood also has announced plans to build a $3.5 billion battery manufacturing and recycling factory in South Carolina. 

            Once fully operational, the battery materials campus in McCarran, Nevada, outside Reno, will be the first domestic facility to support production of anode copper foil and cathode active materials for a lithium-ion battery manufacturing process. The process would recycle end-of-life battery and production scrap and remanufacture it into critical materials, the Energy Department said in a blog post. 

            Straubel, Redwood’s CEO, told The Associated Press last year that recycling battery materials will help the U.S. establish its own electric-vehicle supply chain. China now dominates the EV supply chain, including critical minerals needed for EV batteries.

            “Redwood fills a critical gap in that whole piece, and our goal is to close the loop on all the materials that we’ve already mined and produced into products, keep them in the regions where they were bought and are being used,'' Straubel told the AP. ""Every battery that we can recycle is one battery worth of materials that we don’t need to mine again.''

            Weatherford defeated Anadarko 4-2 on Tuesday after Anadarko chose to stall. The result came a month after the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA), the sport's governing body, voted 8-7 against adding a shot clock. 

            The game matched two of the top teams in Class 4A, the state’s third-largest class. Weatherford is ranked No. 3 in the OSSAA’s rankings, while Anadarko is ranked ninth. 











            Neither team scored in the first quarter, and Weatherford led 2-0 at halftime. Anadarko didn’t score until the final three minutes of the game and had the ball in the final minute with a chance to win.

            “ Eagles win the offensive shootout against Anadarko,” the Twitter account for Weatherford athletics posted.

            Weatherford had scored at least 50 points in each of its previous 12 games, with a high of 88. Anadarko had scored fewer than 50 points in its previous 11 contests.

            Anadarko basketball coach Doug Schumpert, who was inducted into the Oklahoma Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2019, was heavily criticized on social media for his coaching decision. 

            Anadarko superintendent Jerry McCormick defended Schumpert.

            “While this game has gained much media attention in regard to how the game was played, our basketball coach Doug Schumpert and his staff utilized their knowledge of the game along with the skills of our players to provide us with the best opportunity to win and we support those efforts,” McCormick said in a statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805680,Appeals court will hear dispute over control of van Gogh art,"DETROIT (AP) — A federal appeals court has agreed to hear a dispute over control of an 1888 painting by Vincent van Gogh that was recently displayed for months at a Detroit museum.

            The court granted an injunction Monday and ordered the Detroit Institute of Arts to continue to hold onto the painting while the case is pending.

            A painting of a woman with a book, titled “The Novel Reader,” was part of a rare U.S. exhibition of dozens of van Gogh's works lent by collectors around the world.











            As the show was nearing an end in January, Brokerarte Capital Partners LLC filed a lawsuit claiming to be the owner of the painting. It said it acquired it in 2017 for $3.7 million, gave temporary possession to a third party and hasn't seen the art since.

            The museum is not accused of wrongdoing. It has not publicly explained how it got the painting on loan, saying only that it came from a collection in Brazil. Brokerarte Capital's sole proprietor is Gustavo Soter, a Brazilian.

            Brokerarte Capital wants the museum to turn over the painting. It appealed after a judge in Detroit dismissed a lawsuit, saying federal law governing the international sharing of art prevented him from stepping in.

            The art world is watching. The Association of Art Museum Directors had urged the appeals court to dismiss the case. It said art collectors outside the U.S. would be reluctant to share in the future if they might somehow get tied up in litigation.

            “The entire U.S. museum community, with its reputation for mounting groundbreaking loan exhibitions, will suffer. So will the museum-going public, which will lose the opportunities to experience otherwise inaccessible works,” association attorney Dennis Rose said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805681,"MATCHDAY: AC Milan hosts Torino, Wolfsburg visits Schalke","A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Friday:

            ITALY

            AC Milan is hoping the return of the mercurial Zlatan Ibrahimović will help it get over a miserable run when it hosts Torino — the team that knocked it out of the Italian Cup last month. The 41-year-old Ibrahimović has not played since undergoing a knee operation in May but could be on the bench against Torino. Milan is winless in seven matches and fell to a fourth straight defeat on Sunday, against Inter Milan in the city derby. That saw the defending champion slip to sixth in a tight battle for the Champions League places. Milan hosts Tottenham when this season’s Champions League resumes next week. Torino has only lost one of its league matches since that cup upset and that has pushed the team up to seventh, eight points behind Milan.











            GERMANY

            Wolfsburg visits last-placed Schalke looking to reignite its push for Champions League qualification. Wolfsburg started 2023 in style with 6-0 and 5-0 wins in its first two Bundesliga games but momentum has ground to a halt with three consecutive losses. A game at struggling Schalke seems the perfect chance for Niko Kovač's team to turn things around. Beset by financial problems and without a league win since November, Schalke's chances of avoiding relegation are fading despite making six loan signings in January.

            FRANCE

            Nice looks to make up ground in the race for European spots when it hosts struggling Ajaccio in the league. Since Didier Digard replaced Lucien Favre as coach last month, Nice has taken 13 points from 15 to climb to eighth place. Nice will miss Nicolas Pepe, Youcef Atal and Marcin Bulka — all injured — but will be able to rely on striker Gaetan Laborde, who has scored in his last three games. Ajaccio has lost five of its last six games and will field a weakened team because Ismael Diallo and Vincent Marchetti are suspended while Thomas Mangani, Yoann Touzghar, Youssouf Kone and Mathieu Coutadeur are sidelined by injuries. The Corsican club is 18th, one point from safety.

            SPAIN

            Cadiz hosts Girona hoping for a win that would lift it out of the Spanish league’s relegation zone and push Valencia down into the bottom three. While struggling, Cadiz has managed to go unbeaten in its last seven homes games, winning two and drawing five. Girona is in 11th place with only two losses in the previous six rounds.

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsA look at what’s happening in European soccer on Friday:ITALYAC Milan is hoping the return of the mercurial Zlatan Ibrahimović will help it get over a miserable run when it hosts Torino — the team that knocked it out of the Italian Cup last month. The 41-year-old Ibrahimović has not played since undergoing a knee operation in May but could be on the bench against Torino. Milan is winless in seven matches and fell to a fourth straight defeat on Sunday, against Inter Milan in the city derby. That saw the defending champion slip to sixth in a tight battle for the Champions League places. Milan hosts Tottenham when this season’s Champions League resumes next week. Torino has only lost one of its league matches since that cup upset and that has pushed the team up to seventh, eight points behind Milan.GERMANYWolfsburg visits last-placed Schalke looking to reignite its push for Champions League qualification. Wolfsburg started 2023 in style with 6-0 and 5-0 wins in its first two Bundesliga games but momentum has ground to a halt with three consecutive losses. A game at struggling Schalke seems the perfect chance for Niko Kovač's team to turn things around. Beset by financial problems and without a league win since November, Schalke's chances of avoiding relegation are fading despite making six loan signings in January.FRANCENice looks to make up ground in the race for European spots when it hosts struggling Ajaccio in the league. Since Didier Digard replaced Lucien Favre as coach last month, Nice has taken 13 points from 15 to climb to eighth place. Nice will miss Nicolas Pepe, Youcef Atal and Marcin Bulka — all injured — but will be able to rely on striker Gaetan Laborde, who has scored in his last three games. Ajaccio has lost five of its last six games and will field a weakened team because Ismael Diallo and Vincent Marchetti are suspended while Thomas Mangani, Yoann Touzghar, Youssouf Kone and Mathieu Coutadeur are sidelined by injuries. The Corsican club is 18th, one point from safety.SPAINCadiz hosts Girona hoping for a win that would lift it out of the Spanish league’s relegation zone and push Valencia down into the bottom three. While struggling, Cadiz has managed to go unbeaten in its last seven homes games, winning two and drawing five. Girona is in 11th place with only two losses in the previous six rounds.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/10,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805683,Rihanna promises a 'jam-packed' Super Bowl halftime show,"PHOENIX (AP) — Rihanna is putting in the work ahead of her Super Bowl halftime show, focusing so hard on what she promises will be ""a jam-packed show” that her upcoming birthday and Valentine's Day almost slipped her mind.

            “The setlist was the biggest challenge. That was the hardest, hardest part. Deciding how to maximize 13 minutes but also celebrate — that’s what this show is going to be. It’s going to be a celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together,"" Rihanna said.

            At a media preview Thursday ahead of Sunday's matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, the music superstar and new mom said her appearance — her first live event in seven years — feels “like it could have only been now.” 











            The singer said she was initially unsure about taking on the challenge of performing during a time when she was three months postpartum and wondered “should I be making major decisions like this right now? I might regret this.”

            “But when you become a mom, there’s something that just happens where you feel like you can take on the world, you can do anything,"" Rihanna said. ""The Super Bowl is one of the biggest stages of the world. As scary as that was, because I hadn't been on stage in seven years, there’s something exhilarating about the challenge of it all.""

            A nine-time Grammy Award-winner, Rihanna has 14 No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including “We Found Love,” “Work,” “Umbrella” and “Disturbia.” She and rapper A$AP Rocky recently welcomed her first child.

            “At the end of the day, if it flops or it flies, my name has to stand by that. And so I really get involved with every aspect of anything I do,” she said.

            Halftime performance sponsor Apple Music held a moderated event Thursday, but moderator Nadeska Alexis was the only journalist allowed to ask Rihanna questions.

            Rihanna joins a list of celebrated entertainers who have played during Super Bowl halftime shows, including Beyoncé, Madonna, Coldplay, Katy Perry, U2, Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and The Weeknd. Last year, hip-hop was celebrated with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar all performing.

            The singer had previously declined to perform in the 2019 halftime show out of solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. But she has said that the timing and circumstances this time around were right for her.

            Country music star Chris Stapleton will sing the national anthem, while R&B legend Babyface will perform “America the Beautiful.” Actor-singer Sheryl Lee Ralph will also perform “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” When asked who they were cheering for on Sunday, Ralph said she was rooting for the Eagles while Stapleton and Babyface said they were backing Rihanna.

            Ralph applauded the NFL for making an effort toward being inclusive and “represent all people” through the three songs. 

            ""On a day, Super Bowl Sunday, 200 million people coming together to sit and experience it here, what a time and what a way to bring us all together,"" she said. “I’m very pleased and very happy to be able to be on the 40-yard line.”

            Babyface said he first started singing “America the Beautiful” as a sophomore for a play in high school.

            “It's hard to believe that so many years ago, which is a lot of years ago, that I'm here to sing ‘America the Beautiful,'” he said. “Back then, my mom was in the audience and she couldn't believe I was up there on the stage singing. Like the shy kid who actually got up there singing. To think of her looking at this now and see me at this moment singing ‘America the Beautiful,’ it's full circle.”

            
                Oscar winner Troy Kotsur will perform the national anthem in American sign language. Colin Denny will sign “America the Beautiful” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” will be signed by Justina Miles.

            Through an interpreter, Kotsur said performing makes him feel prouder to be an American. Miles said “Lift Every Voice and Sing"" represents resilience. 

            ""The national anthem never really resonated with me personally, but the Black national anthem is really inspiring and empowering,"" Miles said. “This song is so positive and so beautiful. You don't really hear or see it very often. There's many folks who don't even know the Black national anthem even exist. It's not only for me to share this experience with the whole world, but to really bring that empowerment to millions of Black, deaf people all over the country who've never seen that before.”

            Apple Music this year replaced Pepsi, which sponsored the show for the past 10 years. Terms were not announced, but analysts had expected the league to get at least $50 million per year for the rights.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805684,Menstrual questions cut from athletic forms amid criticism,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Questions about female athletes’ menstrual history will no longer appear on the medical forms that Florida high school students have to fill out before participating in sports, though the new form will still ask athletes for their sex assigned at birth, rather than just their sex. 

            The Florida High School Athletic Association axed the questions on Thursday after listening to a flood of complaints contained in letters read aloud during an emergency meeting of the board. 

            Answering the questions was previously optional. But an association advisory committee recently recommended that it be mandatory, sparking the firestorm of criticism. 











            Some called the questions “humiliating” and “invasive,” and others suggested they were connected to a recent bill barring transgender girls and women from playing on public school teams intended for student athletes identified as girls at birth.

            ""This is another way to shame girls,” Connie DeWitt said in a letter.

            Dr. Deborah White wrote that there was “zero” reason for a school to know about students’ menstrual history.

            “The only reason is to weed out transgender kids who may not have periods,” White’s letter said. “As a doctor I would never fill out this form.”

            Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the bill in 2021, thrusting the state into the national cultural debate over transgender rights. DeSantis is widely believed to be considering a run for president next year on a deeply conservative platform. 

            The association’s spokesperson has said the proposed changes were not in response to concerns about transgender athletes competing in women’s sports, as some social media users have claimed. And association president John Gerdes stressed that politics played no part in the discussions, though the newly adopted form does ask for “sex assigned at birth.""

            “This governor and his office had nothing to do with this,” Gerdes said Thursday.

            Many other states ask or order female athletes to include details about their menstruation cycles with other health information.

            The four-page form adopted by the board will still contain questions about mental health, alcohol and drug use and family health history. But the answers will stay in the offices of the health care practitioners who conduct the students' medical screenings. Schools will only get the page declaring a student’s medical eligibility.

            The association's medical advisory committee, which recommended to the board that it make menstrual histories on the form mandatory, has said it was following national guidelines for sports physicals developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Sports Medicine and other groups. 

            The guidelines state that menstrual history is an “essential discussion for female athletes” because period abnormalities could be a sign of “low energy availability, pregnancy, or other gynecologic or medical conditions.”

            However, the chair-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Sports Medicine & Fitness told The Associated Press on Thursday that the earlier Florida proposal wasn't consistent with its guidelines since the academy only recommends that a medical eligibility form be sent to the school, not personal medical information.

            “And we recognize that is very problematic,"" said Rebecca Carl, an associate professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University. “These were not designed to be shared with the schools.""

            Two of the board members who voted against eliminating the questions altogether said there was no reason menstrual information couldn't still be included on the forms and stored at medical practitioners' offices. 

            Sports eligibility evaluations are the only opportunity some students have to meet with health care providers, and having the questions on the form can help detect any medical problems, board member Chris Patricca said.

            “Student athletes are safer and better protected by the inclusion of these questions,"" she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805685,Man arrested for assault on Minnesota congresswoman in DC,"WASHINGTON (AP) — District of Columbia police said Thursday night that they had arrested a suspect in an assault on Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota. 

            Craig was assaulted in the elevator in her Washington apartment building around 7:10 a.m., police said, but the assailant fled when she defended herself.

            Craig suffered bruises while escaping serious injury in the attack, which did not appear to be politically motivated, her chief of staff, Nick Coe, said in a statement.











            The Metropolitan Police Department said it had arrested 26-year-old Kendrick Hamlin, of no fixed address, and charged him with simple assault.

            The attack followed an assault on the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in their San Francisco home in October by a man who told police his motive was political and that his intended target was the speaker. 

            Members of Congress have faced a sharp rise in threats since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. Capitol Police investigated nearly 10,000 threats to members last year, more than twice the number from four years earlier.

            Craig won a third term in November in the suburban-to-rural 2nd District south of Minneapolis and St. Paul in one of the most expensive House races in the country, frustrating the GOP’s best hope of flipping a Minnesota seat in an election that gave Republicans a narrow House majority.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805686,Woman sues after Louisiana lawmaker blocked her on Twitter,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A Louisiana woman filed a lawsuit Thursday arguing that a state senator's Twitter account is a public forum and therefore the lawmaker shouldn't be allowed to block posts critical of her anti-abortion efforts.

            Maya Detiege, a supporter of abortion rights, was blocked from posting on the Twitter account of Monroe Democratic Sen. Katrina Jackson, according to the lawsuit that was filed in federal court in Monroe.

            Detiege's lawsuit comes amid continued political battles and international scrutiny of Twitter and other social media platforms and their efforts to avoid spreading misinformation. 











            The Louisiana lawsuit seeks a declaration that Jackson violated Detiege's First Amendment right to free speech, and a court order that her access to post comments on Jackson's account be restored. 

            “Because as a public official she opened up a public forum, she cannot silence views she does not like from that public forum,” attorney Katie Schwartzmann, who filed the suit as head of the New Orleans-based Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic, said in an email. 

            In an email responding to a request for comment, Jackson’s legislative assistant said the lawmaker had not yet seen the lawsuit.

            Federal courts in at least two other regions have agreed, with perhaps the most prominent case resulting in a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling against former President Donald Trump. After Trump left office hat case was ordered dismissed as moot by the Supreme Court, which hasn't made a definitive ruling on the issue. 

            Jackson, like Gov. John Bel Edwards, is a rare prominent Democrat who opposed abortion rights. She was a main sponsor of legislation to make abortion in Louisiana illegal following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning abortion rights. 

            Detiege's lawsuit notes her angry responses to Jackson's support of anti-abortion legislation and also notes other people who were blocked by Jackson after posting opinions opposed to hers.

            “Senator Jackson has no compelling or important interest in blocking users engaged in lawful speech, including Ms. Detiege,” the lawsuit states.NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A Louisiana woman filed a lawsuit Thursday arguing that a state senator's Twitter account is a public forum and therefore the lawmaker shouldn't be allowed to block posts critical of her anti-abortion efforts.Maya Detiege, a supporter of abortion rights, was blocked from posting on the Twitter account of Monroe Democratic Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805687,Syria orphans from quake taken in by overwhelmed relatives,"BEIRUT (AP) — A Syrian baby girl whose mother gave birth to her while trapped under the rubble of their home during this week’s devastating earthquake now has a name: Aya, Arabic for “a sign from God.” With her parents and all her siblings killed, her great-uncle will take her in. 

            Aya is one of untold numbers of orphans left by Monday’s 7.8-magnitude quake, which killed more than 20,000 people in northern Syria and southeastern Turkey. The pre-dawn quake brought down thousands of apartment buildings on residents as they were roused from sleep, so entire families often perished. 

            In most cases, relatives take in orphaned children, doctors and experts say. But those surviving relatives are also dealing with the wreckage of their own lives and families. In the continued chaos days after the quake, with the dead and a dwindling number of survivors still being found, doctors say it’s impossible to say how many children lost their parents. 











            At one hospital in northwest Syria, a red-haired 7-year-old girl, Jana al-Abdo, asked repeatedly where her parents were after she was brought in, said Dr. Khalil Alsfouk, who was treating her. “We later found out she was the only one who survived among her entire family,” he said Thursday. 

            In the case of the newborn Aya, her father’s uncle, Salah al-Badran, will take her in once she is released from the hospital. 

            But his own house was also destroyed in the northwest Syrian town of Jenderis. He and his family managed to escape the one-story building, but now he and his household of 11 people are living in a tent, he told The Associated Press. 

            “After the earthquake, there’s no one able to live in his house or building. Only 10% of the buildings here are safe to live in and the rest are unlivable,” he said, communicating via voice messages.

            Rescue workers in Jenderis discovered Aya on Monday afternoon, more than 10 hours after the quake hit, as they were digging through the wreckage of the five-story apartment building where her parents lived. Buried under the concrete, the baby still was connected by her umbilical cord to her mother, Afraa Abu Hadiya, who was dead. along with her husband and four other children. The baby was rushed to a hospital in the nearby town of Afrin.

            Abu Hadiya probably gave birth to the girl and then died a few hours before they were discovered, said Dr. Hani Maarouf at Cihan Hospital in Afrin.

            “We named her Aya, so we could stop calling her a new-born baby,” said Maarouf. Her condition is improving by the day and there was no damage to her spine, as initially feared, he said. 

            The U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, said it has been monitoring children whose parents are missing or killed, providing food, clothes and medicine and coordinating with hospitals to track down extended family members who might be able to care for them.

            In Turkey, the Ministry of Family and Social Services appealed to potential foster families to submit applications. It said children whose families or relatives could not be found were currently being taken care of in state institutions. Staff were assessing their needs and placing them with registered foster families, the ministry said.

            Near the opposition-held Syrian town of Azaz, a non-governmental organization has set up a makeshift orphanage that is now housing about 40 children.

            But in many cases, the extended family steps in. Syrians have experience in facing the tragedy of parentless children: Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Syria's long civil war, which began in 2011, creating unknown numbers of orphans. 

            Jana, the 7-year-old, was found by rescue workers on Tuesday after 30 hours under the rubble of her family’s home in Harem, a Syrian town near the Turkish border, Alsfouk said. Her mother, father and three siblings were killed. 

            She was brought to a hospital in the nearby town of Bab al-Hawa, which was already overwhelmed.

            “In our children’s section, we have 24 beds and five incubators, but we have been receiving dozens of children. We barely had capacity. And we were the only hospital with a section for pediatric surgery in the area,” Alsfouk said.

            Seen by an AP journalist Wednesday, Jana cried out in pain and confusion in her bed, waving the IV tubes in her arms. Her face was covered with cuts. 

            Later, an aunt came, and Jana was released to her, Alsfouk said.

            “But now people are beginning to realize there are many children now without families. There is a great embrace of them by society.

            Associated Press reporters Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Ghaith Alsayed in Afrin, Syria, and Omar Albam in Bab al-Hawa, Syria, contributed to this report.BEIRUT (AP) — A Syrian baby girl whose mother gave birth to her while trapped under the rubble of their home during this week’s devastating earthquake now has a name: Aya, Arabic for “a sign from God.” With her parents and all her siblings killed, her great-uncle will take her in.Aya is one of untold numbers of orphans left by Monday’s 7.8-magnitude quake, which killed more than 20,000 people in northern Syria and southeastern Turkey. The pre-dawn quake brought down thousands of apartment buildings on residents as they were roused from sleep, so entire families often perished.In most cases, relatives take in orphaned children, doctors and experts say. But those surviving relatives are also dealing with the wreckage of their own lives and families. In the continued chaos days after the quake, with the dead and a dwindling number of survivors still being found, doctors say it’s impossible to say how many children lost their parents.At one hospital in northwest Syria, a red-haired 7-year-old girl, Jana al-Abdo, asked repeatedly where her parents were after she was brought in, said Dr. Khalil Alsfouk, who was treating her. “We later found out she was the only one who survived among her entire family,” he said Thursday.In the case of the newborn Aya, her father’s uncle, Salah al-Badran, will take her in once she is released from the hospital.But his own house was also destroyed in the northwest Syrian town of Jenderis. He and his family managed to escape the one-story building, but now he and his household of 11 people are living in a tent, he told The Associated Press.“After the earthquake, there’s no one able to live in his house or building. Only 10% of the buildings here are safe to live in and the rest are unlivable,” he said, communicating via voice messages.Rescue workers in Jenderis discovered Aya on Monday afternoon, more than 10 hours after the quake hit, as they were digging through the wreckage of the five-story apartment building where her parents lived. Buried under the concrete, the baby still was connected by her umbilical cord to her mother, Afraa Abu Hadiya, who was dead. along with her husband and four other children. The baby was rushed to a hospital in the nearby town of Afrin.Abu Hadiya probably gave birth to the girl and then died a few hours before they were discovered, said Dr. Hani Maarouf at Cihan Hospital in Afrin.“We named her Aya, so we could stop calling her a new-born baby,” said Maarouf. Her condition is improving by the day and there was no damage to her spine, as initially feared, he said.The U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, said it has been monitoring children whose parents are missing or killed, providing food, clothes and medicine and coordinating with hospitals to track down extended family members who might be able to care for them.In Turkey, the Ministry of Family and Social Services appealed to potential foster families to submit applications. It said children whose families or relatives could not be found were currently being taken care of in state institutions. Staff were assessing their needs and placing them with registered foster families, the ministry said.Near the opposition-held Syrian town of Azaz, a non-governmental organization has set up a makeshift orphanage that is now housing about 40 children.But in many cases, the extended family steps in. Syrians have experience in facing the tragedy of parentless children: Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Syria's long civil war, which began in 2011, creating unknown numbers of orphans.Jana, the 7-year-old, was found by rescue workers on Tuesday after 30 hours under the rubble of her family’s home in Harem, a Syrian town near the Turkish border, Alsfouk said. Her mother, father and three siblings were killed.She was brought to a hospital in the nearby town of Bab al-Hawa, which was already overwhelmed.“In our children’s section, we have 24 beds and five incubators, but we have been receiving dozens of children. We barely had capacity. And we were the only hospital with a section for pediatric surgery in the area,” Alsfouk said.Seen by an AP journalist Wednesday, Jana cried out in pain and confusion in her bed, waving the IV tubes in her arms. Her face was covered with cuts.Later, an aunt came, and Jana was released to her, Alsfouk said.Alsfouk’s own home had been destroyed, and his family had moved in with friends. For days he has been treating the rush of injured children, some of whom didn’t survive.“The whole experience was awful. It’s hard to hold back your grief after trying to save a child but not being able to,” he said, “because you have to then move on to dozens of other children who needed help.”For now, things are too confusing to determine the number of orphans, said Dr. Muheeb Qaddour, deputy chief of the health department in Syria’s Idlib province, which is the center of the country’s last opposition-held enclave in the northwest and which was hard hit by the quake.“But now people are beginning to realize there are many children now without families.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805688,"Firm: Faulty weld, pressure on pipe led to Kansas oil spill","TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — A faulty weld at a bend in an oil pipeline contributed to a spill that dumped nearly 13,000 bathtubs' worth of crude oil into a northeastern Kansas creek, the pipeline's operator said Thursday, estimating the cost of cleaning it up at $480 million.

            Canadian-based TC Energy said the flawed weld caused a crack that then grew over time because of the stress on the bend in its Keystone pipeline system in rural pastureland in Washington County, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Kansas City. The company said the weld was for a fitting that connected two sections of pipe, and the fitting and weld came from a manufacturing plant.

            The company, which is responsible for overseeing inspections of its pipeline system, said it still is investigating the cause of the pipeline stress and is analyzing “other areas with potentially similar conditions.” The Dec. 7 rupture spilled nearly 13,000 barrels of crude oil, with each barrel containing 42 gallons (159 liters), the size of a standard household bathtub.











            “Our focus continues to be the safe operation of the pipeline system,” the company said in a statement.

            No one was evacuated following the spill, and officials said it did not affect the two larger rivers and reservoir downstream. With federal regulators' permission, the company reopened the affected segment a little more than three weeks after the spill, though at a lower pressure than before.

            But Bill Caram, executive director of the advocacy group Pipeline Safety Trust, said it's “troubling” that TC Energy said the flawed weld came from a “fabrication facility.” He said conditions there should have been ideal for making a weld that would not fail — as opposed to welding in the field.

            “It begs the question of how many other bad welds are on the Keystone pipeline from this same fabrication facility,” Caram said. 

            Caram also said pipeline companies and pipeline regulators in the U.S. Department of Transportation struggle to deal with a combination of multiple threats that on their own don't appear to need immediate attention but together add up.

            The spill was the largest onshore in nine years and larger than than 22 previous spills on the Keystone system combined, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data. That's even though the company decreased its estimate for its size from its initial figure of 14,000 barrels.

            Zack Pistora, who lobbies the Kansas Legislature for the Sierra Club, argued that the company's explanation shows the pipeline's design was flawed. In July 2021, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report said the four biggest previous spills on the Keystone system were caused by issues tied to its original design, its construction or the manufacturing of the pipe.

            The company's statement Thursday said an analysis of the pipeline’s metal showed no issues with it or its strength.

            The Kansas House energy committee plans to have hearings on the oil spill in March, according to its chair, state Rep. Leo Delperdang, a Wichita Republican whose career includes a stint with a pipeline company.

            “I’ve got lots of questions,” he said.

            The 2,700-mile (4,345-kilometer) Keystone system carries heavy crude oil extracted from tar sands in western Canada to the Gulf Coast and to central Illinois.

            Concerns that spills could pollute waterways spurred opposition to plans by TC Energy to build another crude oil pipeline in the same system, the 1,200-mile (1,900-kilometer) Keystone XL, across Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. President Joe Biden’s cancelation of a permit for the project led the company to pull the plug on the project in 2021.

            Pistora argued that people don't have any real assurances that the existing Keystone pipeline won't “fail again.”

            “It should be unsettling to everyone along the pipeline path and to Americans generally,” he said.

            Local farmer Bill Pannbacker said the rupture occurred near his property line, spraying crude onto his pasture at a point after the pipe goes under a creek and starts to ascend an 80-foot (24-meter) hill. He suggested that a straight section of pipe would be less prone to problems but added, “I'm not an engineer.”

            Pannbacker said crews swarmed over the area as they cleaned up the mess, aided by relatively dry weather. The company said its estimate for the cost of the cleanup may change, calling its commitment to the work “unwavering.”

            “It is like a little city out there,"" said Pannbacker, also a former Kansas House member. ""I just went by last night, and the lights get your attention, but I mean, they’re working hard.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805689,Stone Age discovery fuels mystery of who made early tools,"NEW YORK (AP) — Archaeologists in Kenya have dug up some of the oldest stone tools ever found, but who used them is a mystery.

            In the past, scientists assumed that our direct ancestors were the only toolmakers. But two big fossil teeth found along with the tools at the Kenyan site belong to an extinct human cousin known as Paranthropus, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.

            This adds to the evidence that our direct relatives in the Homo lineage may not have been the only tech-savvy creatures during the Stone Age, said study author Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian’s Human Origins Program.











            “Those teeth open up an amazing whodunit — a real question of, well, who were these earliest toolmakers?” Potts said.

            The tools date back to around 2.9 million years ago, when early humans used them to butcher hippos for their meat, the researchers report.

            Older stone tools have been found in Kenya, dating back to around 3.3 million years ago, long before our own Homo ancestors appeared. Those tools were a bit simpler and so far have only been found in one spot, said Shannon McPherron, an archaeologist at Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology who was not involved with the study.

            The latest discovery matches up with a much bigger tradition known as the Oldowan toolkit. These same kinds of tools show up across Africa and beyond during more than a million years of prehistory, Potts said, showing they really caught on among early humans.

            They held a rock in one hand and hit it with another stone, chipping off thin, razor-sharp flakes, explained anthropologist Kathy Schick of the Stone Age Institute in Indiana, who wasn't involved in the research.

            With the rocks and flakes, early humans could slice and crush a wide range of materials, said lead author Thomas Plummer, an anthropologist at Queens College of the City University of New York. And the tools from the Kenya site — likely the most ancient Oldowan tools found to date — suggest this gave them an advantage in a key area: eating. 

            The site, known as Nyayanga, is a lush, hilly landscape on the shores of Lake Victoria. Since starting excavations there in 2015, researchers have found a trove of artifacts and animal bones, along with the two Paranthropus teeth.

            Slice marks on several hippo bones show they were cut up for their meat, which would have been eaten raw as a hippo steak tartare, Plummer said. The early humans also likely used their tools to break open antelope bones for their fatty marrow inside, and to peel the outer rinds of tough plant roots, the authors concluded. 

            “Stone tools are allowing them, even at this really early date, to extract a lot of resources from the environment,” Plummer said. “If you can butcher a hippo, you can butcher pretty much anything.”

            In the past, it was easy to assume that our direct ancestors were the ones using these tools, Plummer said. But the teeth make it hard to rule out that other early humans were picking up tools of their own, researchers said — even extinct cousins like Paranthropus, with their big teeth and small brains.

            The mystery will be a tough one to solve.

             After all, we can’t say for sure whether Paranthropus was using these tools, or just happened to die in the same place, Schick said: “When we find hominin fossils with stone tools, you always have to ask, is this the dinner or the diner?”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805690,Attorney: I trusted Alex Murdaugh despite odd fee payments,"A lawyer testifying in Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial in South Carolina said he trusted Murdaugh even though the disgraced lawyer suggested an unusual way to split fees from a case the two had worked on together.

            Attorney Chris Wilson said he had no reason to be suspicious when Murdaugh asked to have the $792,000 fee deposited directly into his account, rather than paying it directly to the Murdaugh family law firm. At the time, Murdaugh said his intention was to protect money because his son, Paul, was involved in a wrongful death lawsuit - even though the direct payment was a violation of the firm's rules.

            “I’d known him for 30-plus years. I didn’t have any reason not to trust him,” Wilson told the jury. 











            Murdaugh, 54, faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murdering his wife, 52-year-old Maggie, and their 22-year-old son Paul. Prosecutors are arguing that Murdaugh killed them to get sympathy and buy time to hide a string of thefts. The defense says it makes no sense to think there wouldn’t be more scrutiny into Murdaugh’s life and finances after his wife and shot were shot to death.

            The judge in the murder trial is allowing prosecutors to present a wide range of evidence that Murdaugh was stealing money from clients and his law firm. Defense attorneys have constantly objected before each witness, saying the financial crimes aren't directly linked to the killings and are meant to smear Murdaugh and make him look like a horrible person.

            Another witness Thursday testified that his mother was a housekeeper and nanny for the Murdaughs for more than 20 years before she fell at their home, dying weeks later from her injuries.

            The witness, Tony Satterfield, said Murdaugh told him he would get his insurers to take care of him and his brother financially. Murdaugh eventually got settlements of more than $4 million, but Satterfield said his family found out after the killings and never saw any of it.

            “When the defendant came to you around the time of your mom's funeral and said he was going to help you and file a claim on your behalf, why did you agree?” prosecutor Creighton Waters asked.

            ""Because I trusted him,” said Satterfield, who has since, with the help of other lawyers, collected more than $4 million from banks, officials and other lawyers involved in the settlements.

            Thursday's testimony ended with attorney Mark Tinsley testifying about a wrongful death lawsuit he filed against Murdaugh after a 19-year-old passenger died in the 2019 crash of a boat driven by Paul Murdaugh. Police said Paul Murdaugh was underage and had a blood alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit.

            “He was going to have to pay $10 million out of his pocket,” Tinsley said when asked his goal for the suit on behalf of the teen's family.

            Tinsley said Murdaugh's lawyer said he was broke and might be able to scrape together $1 million. That led Tinsley to ask for records of all of Murdaugh's finances, a request being put before a judge at a June 10, 2021, hearing postponed after Murdaugh's son and wife were killed.

            Murdaugh faces nearly 100 other criminal charges unrelated to the killings, ranging from theft to running a money laundering and drug ring to tax evasion to fraud for trying to arrange his own death in a roadside shooting in September 2021 so his surviving son could get $10 million in life insurance.

            Wilson was the 40th witness called in the trial, which began Jan. 23. He testified away from the jury last Thursday as the judge decided whether to allow financial misdeed evidence.

            Wilson said he paid Murdaugh his $792,000 fees directly when questions popped up. Murdaugh’s law firm demanded that Wilson send a second check for the fees, which he did out of his own pocket. Murdaugh promised to pay Wilson back but could only come up with $600,000.

            Wilson said he had no choice but to loan his friend the remaining $192,000 and has never gotten that money back.

            “I can’t tell somebody I’m holding money in my trust account that I’m not holding in my trust accounts,” Wilson said. “Trust accounts are money that belongs to someone else.” 

            Wilson at times had to pause as he was asked about his friend he met in high school. Their wives were sorority sisters. Their kids grew up together. They spoke several times a week.

            Wilson rushed the hour and 40 minutes to Murdaugh's home as soon as he found out about the June 7, 2021, killings.

            “I walked in, hugged his neck and cried. I didn’t know what to say,” Wilson said. “I didn’t want to know what he found. I didn’t want him to have to describe it to me.”

            In cross-examination, the defense mostly asked Wilson personal questions, getting him to talk about how much he loved his family. Wilson said Murdaugh appeared to never stay at the family's home after the killings and was staying with his brothers or in-laws every time he called.

            “He was distraught. He was destroyed, upset all the time, not eating, not sleeping,” Wilson said.

            Murdaugh’s family dominated the legal system in tiny Hampton County for generations, both as prosecutors and private attorneys. The influence extended to banks in the rural South Carolina Lowcountry.

            Palmetto State Bank CEO Jan Malinowski testified that Murdaugh's accounts were frequently overdrawn by hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2021 and a former executive, convicted in federal court in November, would loan himself and Murdaugh money from client trust funds.

            Malinowski's dry testimony did have moments of levity. He testified Murdaugh's account balance was overdrawn by more than $347,000 in August 2021.

            Waters noted a fee on the statement. ""How much is the overdraft charge?” the prosecutor asked.

            “Five dollars,"" Malinowski said as many in the courtroom laughed.A lawyer testifying in Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial in South Carolina said he trusted Murdaugh even though the disgraced lawyer suggested an unusual way to split fees from a case the two had worked on together.Attorney Chris Wilson said he had no reason to be suspicious when Murdaugh asked to have the $792,000 fee deposited directly into his account, rather than paying it directly to the Murdaugh family law firm.

That led Tinsley to ask for records of all of Murdaugh's finances, a request being put before a judge at a June 10, 2021, hearing postponed after Murdaugh's son and wife were killed.Murdaugh faces nearly 100 other criminal charges unrelated to the killings, ranging from theft to running a money laundering and drug ring to tax evasion to fraud for trying to arrange his own death in a roadside shooting in September 2021 so his surviving son could get $10 million in life insurance.Wilson was the 40th witness called in the trial, which began Jan. 23. He testified away from the jury last Thursday as the judge decided whether to allow financial misdeed evidence.Wilson said he paid Murdaugh his $792,000 fees directly when questions popped up. Murdaugh’s law firm demanded that Wilson send a second check for the fees, which he did out of his own pocket. Murdaugh promised to pay Wilson back but could only come up with $600,000.Wilson said he had no choice but to loan his friend the remaining $192,000 and has never gotten that money back.“I can’t tell somebody I’m holding money in my trust account that I’m not holding in my trust accounts,” Wilson said. “Trust accounts are money that belongs to someone else.”Wilson at times had to pause as he was asked about his friend he met in high school. Their wives were sorority sisters. Their kids grew up together. They spoke several times a week.Wilson rushed the hour and 40 minutes to Murdaugh's home as soon as he found out about the June 7, 2021, killings.“I walked in, hugged his neck and cried. I didn’t know what to say,” Wilson said. “I didn’t want to know what he found. I didn’t want him to have to describe it to me.”In cross-examination, the defense mostly asked Wilson personal questions, getting him to talk about how much he loved his family. Wilson said Murdaugh appeared to never stay at the family's home after the killings and was staying with his brothers or in-laws every time he called.“He was distraught. He was destroyed, upset all the time, not eating, not sleeping,” Wilson said.Murdaugh’s family dominated the legal system in tiny Hampton County for generations, both as prosecutors and private attorneys. The influence extended to banks in the rural South Carolina Lowcountry.Palmetto State Bank CEO Jan Malinowski testified that Murdaugh's accounts were frequently overdrawn by hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2021 and a former executive, convicted in federal court in November, would loan himself and Murdaugh money from client trust funds.Malinowski's dry testimony did have moments of levity. He testified Murdaugh's account balance was overdrawn by more than $347,000 in August 2021.Waters noted a fee on the statement. ""How much is the overdraft charge?” the prosecutor asked.“Five dollars,"" Malinowski said as many in the courtroom laughed.",2023/2/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805691,"For New York City mayor, his war on rats becomes personal","NEW YORK (AP) — Every New York City mayor in history has battled rats. But for current mayor Eric Adams, the war on vermin has taken a peculiar turn as he tries to burnish his image as the city's exterminator-in-chief.

            Adams went before a hearing officer Thursday — for the second time — to contest two tickets he got from his own health department for allegedly allowing broods of rodents to take residence at his Brooklyn townhouse.

            Participating via telephone, Adams contested the findings of an inspector who found rat burrows along a fence line and “fresh rat droppings” in front of the mayor's garbage bins.











            The city issued the summonses Dec. 7, just a day after another hearing officer dismissed an earlier $300 ticket for failing to control the rat population at the same property. Each of the new tickets could also carry a fine of $300 or more.

            The mayor, who usually prides himself on conducting himself with a little “swagger” during his public appearances, was subdued and respectful during the hearing.

            Adams denied he has a rat problem. His own inspections of his property, he said, did not produce signs of any rodents. Adams said he pays an exterminator monthly and spent $7,000 a year ago to keep the property rodent-free. At one point, the mayor could be heard during the half-hour hearing searching his electronic files for receipts and other documents to make his case.

            Adams, a Democrat, also assured the hearing officer his tenants were heeding city rules about how to handle garbage and recyclables.

            “We all don’t like rats, and we’re all cooperating together,” Adams said.

            A handful of reporters listened in as the mayor seemed to profess surprise over the most recent citations, saying some of the alleged infractions observed were actually on his neighbor's property.

            City records show that Adams has gotten at least 18 summonses over the years at his Brooklyn address, many of them related to the handling of garbage. Many times he simply paid the fines, but not this time.

            The hearing officer told Adams that she would decide within 30 days if any fines are due.

            In his first year in office, Adams launched battles against guns and homelessness — and rats have also proved vexing for a mayor who is currently interviewing applicants for a new director of rodent mitigation, a title promptly dubbed the “ rat czar.”

            Before he became mayor, Adams, as the Brooklyn borough president, was known for his dislike of rats. He famously turned stomachs when he demonstrated a trap for reporters that relied on a bucket filled with a vinegary, toxic soup to drown rats lured by the scent of food.

            The trap wasn’t very effective, nor was every other attempt by previous mayors to vanquish the city’s rat population.

            Former Mayor Bill de Blasio spent tens of millions of dollars on efforts to reduce the rat population in targeted neighborhoods through more frequent trash pickup, more aggressive housing inspections and replacing dirt basement floors with concrete.

            In a prior attempt that proved to be more amusing than lethal, city officials unveiled a scheme to use dry ice to suffocate rats in their burrows but elicited guffaws when workers chased — but never caught — one of the fleeing vermin.

            Adams has held press conferences to periodically bemoan rodents as a scourge on New York society.

            “Let’s be clear: I hate rats, and we have too many of them and we have to get rid of them,” he said in June while announcing a proposed city spending plan.

            In November, he signed a slate of legislation intended to reduce the city’s rat problems, including new rules limiting how long garbage can sit out on curbs and established what the city calls “rat mitigation zones.”

            Soon after, he began looking for a rat czar, who, according to the job description, would be “highly motivated and somewhat bloodthirsty.”NEW YORK (AP) — Every New York City mayor in history has battled rats.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805693,Freedom-versus-common-good debate roils New Jersey forests,"SHAMONG, N.J. (AP) — Sprawling across 1.1 million acres of pine trees, sandy soil, remote wetlands and home to rare plants and animals, the New Jersey Pinelands is the personification of the free-as-a-bird Great Outdoors.

            Locals speak passionately of walking or riding through the woods that their parents or grandparents introduced them to, hiking, fishing, hunting or driving motorcycles or 4-wheel-drive vehicles along the unpaved sand and gravel roads.

            But the Pinelands is being loved to death in many places.











            The illegal use of off-road vehicles has cut wide swaths of damage into the ecologically sensitive region. Some riders veer off approved trails into sensitive areas, marring them with tire tracts and litter.

            New Jersey officials have been struggling with this situation for decades, particularly in Wharton State Forest, a 124,350-acre track of woods and wetlands in the southern part of the state where tensions between vehicle lovers and opponents have been rising.

            And what appears to be the state's preferred solution — instituting a permit system to use parts of the forest — is pleasing few people.

            At an online public hearing Wednesday night on the issue, the age-old freedom-versus-the-common-good debate dominated the discussion.

            Virtually no one supported permits, even at a nominal cost. 

            Most locals viewed it as government overreach by charging them to use land they already own as members of the public. Many riders said they meticulously follow the rules, and they don't want to be punished for the actions of what John Cecil, assistant commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection described as “a small percentage of people abusing the space.""

            On the other side are those who argue the state has an obligation to crack down on illegal behavior to protect the Pinelands for future generations. Yet many of them doubt that the need for a permit will stop irresponsible riders from continuing to damage the woods.

            The Department of Environmental Protection, which has not yet decided whether to require permits or how much they might cost, says the system would check incoming vehicles to ensure they are safe for the woods and comply with requirements on the type of vehicles that are allowed. Dirt bikes, motorcycles, pickup trucks and 4-wheel-drive vehicles are allowed as long as they are street-legal, licensed and insured. Vehicles designed for off-road terrain, which are not allowed on city streets, are also banned from the Pinelands.

            “When someone from the government says you should give up some freedom in the name of safety, that should be a red flag,” said Jason Stetser, who swims, camps and canoes in Wharton State Forest. 

            He said state-imposed restrictions on where vehicles can go have already placed a favorite hunting spot off limits to him because it is three miles from the nearest road.

            But Deb Smith, who loves living in the Pinelands, said things are getting dangerous.

            “I have been physically and verbally attacked in the forest, so I'm leery now,” she said. “People say, ‘This is our land, no one should tell us how to use it.’ That's a bad attitude.”

            Created by an act of Congress in 1978, the Pinelands district is overseen by a joint federal and state commission. It occupies 22% of New Jersey’s land area, and it is the largest body of open space on the mid-Atlantic seaboard between Richmond, Virginia, and Boston. It also includes an aquifer that is the source of 17 trillion gallons of drinking water.

            It contains many rare plant and animal species, some existing nowhere else on Earth, and it has been designated by the United Nations as an internationally significant site worthy of special protection.

            Wharton State Forest draws 800,000 visitors a year. As part of the ongoing debate over its future use, New Jersey officials sought input from people who live in or near the forest, or who travel to visit it.

            From the 1,610 surveys received, several themes emerged: Most oppose the imposition of permits to use parts of the forest; many want more enforcement of existing rules and regulations regarding its use; but many also want to keep things as they are, or to have no restrictions at all.

            “It seems to me the DEP came up with this permit system instead of doing its job,” said Paula Yudkowitz, who said she has constantly reported illegal activity in Wharton State Forest, to no avail. “The destruction is incredible because the DEP is afraid to do its job. You're afraid of the off-road people.”

            Department of Enironmental Protection spokesman Larry Hajna said state Park Police issued 12 summonses for illegal off-road vehicle use in Wharton State Forest last year.

            “Keep in mind that Wharton is the largest of New Jersey’s state parks and forests ... with areas that are difficult to access and consistently monitor,” he said. “In addition, Park Police must exercise discretion when conducting enforcement so as not to pose a safety risk to the public or to themselves. (All-terrain vehicles) are highly maneuverable, very difficult for police to follow within rural forested settings, and they are often not registered or visibly marked in a way that allows for enforcement actions to be taken.”

            He said there are 82 Park Police statewide. But he would not say how many are assigned to Wharton State Forest.

            Kenny Taylor was born and raised in the Pinelands, part of a family whose roots in the area date to the 1700s; he said his ancestors helped cut sand roads through the forest with the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.

            “These are our woods,” he said. “Will a permit system convince people who are doing illegal things to stop? I don't think so.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805694,Rangers acquire Vladimir Tarasenko in trade with Blues,"Vladimir Tarasenko is going to the New York Rangers in a trade that answers another big move by a rival and sets the stage for more to come before the March 3 deadline.

            The Rangers acquired the prolific scoring winger and defenseman Niko Mikkola from the St. Louis Blues on Thursday for conditional 2023 first- and 2024 fourth-round picks, forward Sammy Blais and prospect Hunter Skinner. 

            Tarasenko gives New York even more of an offensive boost in the hopes of making another deep playoff run following a surprise trip to the Eastern Conference Final. The 31-year-old Russian has 29 points in 38 games this season but is also a proven scorer who has surpassed 30 goals six times in his NHL career.











            Getting Tarasenko comes on the heels of the New York Islanders acquiring 30-goal-scoring center Bo Horvat from Vancouver and signing him to a $68 million, eight-year extension.

            It puts more pressure on the teams around the Rangers and Islanders in the Metropolitan and the rest of the East, most notably the division-leading Carolina Hurricanes and second-place New Jersey Devils, who lost All-Star center Jack Hughes to a week-to-week injury. Any of those teams would be a good fit for 26-year-old San Jose Sharks winger Timo Meier, who's under team control for at least next season at $10 million and could sign a long-term extension.

            The Rangers targeted Tarasenko among the top wingers available, given the high asking price and salary cap ramifications of acquiring Meier or Chicago's Patrick Kane, the latter of whom still has not decided if he wants to be traded from the Blackhawks. St. Louis retained half of Tarasenko's salary and $7.5 million cap hit, giving New York some flexibility to make more moves over the next three weeks.

            “It’s something we’ve been looking at for a while,” Rangers general manager Chris Drury said on a video call with reporters. “It gives the two new players a little more time to acclimate to our group, so excited to do it now and get them in the lineup.”

            As part of their roster shuffle, the Rangers put defenseman Libor Hajek on waivers to clear roster space for Mikkola, a 6-foot-5, 26-year-old Finn who gives them more depth on the blue line. Rookie forward Will Cuylle was also sent back to Hartford of the American Hockey League.

            Blais returns to the Blues after less than two years since they traded him to the Rangers with a second-round pick for Pavel Buchnevich.

            Dealing Tarasenko could be the start of a selloff in St. Louis with the Blues on track to miss the playoffs for just the second time in 12 years. Captain Ryan O'Reilly and gritty forward Ivan Barbashev are also pending free agents who could be valuable rental pickups for contenders.

            Asked if he was done trading, Blues general manager Doug Armstrong laughed and said, “Finished for tonight.” He declined to answer about the possibility of signing O'Reilly beyond this season.

            “Ryan’s our captain,” Armstrong said. “I'm a big fan of Ryan. He and I talked behind closed doors, and I’m going to keep it there. He knows how I feel about him.”

            Tarasenko, who in 2019 helped the Blues win the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history, initially requested a trade in the summer of 2021 because he was unhappy with how the team handled his shoulder injuries. He nevertheless reported to camp and played for them since, including being a point-a-game player last season.

            “A couple years ago I was provided a list of teams that he would like to go to, so I started with that group and I was able to find a match out of that group,"" Armstrong said. “I was hoping that that didn’t change. Obviously New York’s a marquee city for all players in the league, so I was comfortable that when I called (his agent), I would have been surprised if that had have been an issue.”

            Blues coach Craig Berube got to talk to Tarasenko after the trade and told him, “Good luck moving forward (and) thanks for everything.”

            “Tough situation, for sure,” Berube told reporters after practice. “Obviously we haven’t performed well enough. That’s what happens: Trades are made. Both of them have been good players for us.”

            The first-round pick St. Louis received will be the later of the Rangers' or Stars' — from the trade that sent defenseman Niks Lundkvist to Dallas — this year, unless the Stars' pick winds up in the top 10. The fourth-rounder next year becomes a third as long as New York makes the playoffs this season, which is very likely.

St. Louis retained half of Tarasenko's salary and $7.5 million cap hit, giving New York some flexibility to make more moves over the next three weeks.“It’s something we’ve been looking at for a while,” Rangers general manager Chris Drury said on a video call with reporters. “It gives the two new players a little more time to acclimate to our group, so excited to do it now and get them in the lineup.”As part of their roster shuffle, the Rangers put defenseman Libor Hajek on waivers to clear roster space for Mikkola, a 6-foot-5, 26-year-old Finn who gives them more depth on the blue line. Rookie forward Will Cuylle was also sent back to Hartford of the American Hockey League.Blais returns to the Blues after less than two years since they traded him to the Rangers with a second-round pick for Pavel Buchnevich.Dealing Tarasenko could be the start of a selloff in St. Louis with the Blues on track to miss the playoffs for just the second time in 12 years. Captain Ryan O'Reilly and gritty forward Ivan Barbashev are also pending free agents who could be valuable rental pickups for contenders.Asked if he was done trading, Blues general manager Doug Armstrong laughed and said, “Finished for tonight.” He declined to answer about the possibility of signing O'Reilly beyond this season.“Ryan’s our captain,” Armstrong said. “I'm a big fan of Ryan. He and I talked behind closed doors, and I’m going to keep it there. He knows how I feel about him.”Tarasenko, who in 2019 helped the Blues win the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history, initially requested a trade in the summer of 2021 because he was unhappy with how the team handled his shoulder injuries. He nevertheless reported to camp and played for them since, including being a point-a-game player last season.“A couple years ago I was provided a list of teams that he would like to go to, so I started with that group and I was able to find a match out of that group,"" Armstrong said. “I was hoping that that didn’t change. Obviously New York’s a marquee city for all players in the league, so I was comfortable that when I called (his agent), I would have been surprised if that had have been an issue.”Blues coach Craig Berube got to talk to Tarasenko after the trade and told him, “Good luck moving forward (and) thanks for everything.”“Tough situation, for sure,” Berube told reporters after practice. “Obviously we haven’t performed well enough. That’s what happens: Trades are made. Both of them have been good players for us.”The first-round pick St. Louis received will be the later of the Rangers' or Stars' — from the trade that sent defenseman Niks Lundkvist to Dallas — this year, unless the Stars' pick winds up in the top 10. The fourth-rounder next year becomes a third as long as New York makes the playoffs this season, which is very likely.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805695,Quebec parents recount moments after bus hit daycare center,"LAVAL, Quebec (AP) — Parents returned Thursday to the Montreal-area daycare center where two children were killed when a bus rammed into the building, stopping to grieve and to recount the difficult moments they witnessed.

            André Beaudoin, a father of a 2-year-old boy who attends the center in Laval, said he had to push through debris Wednesday to help pull injured children from under the bus, which had shattered the front of the building.

            “I managed to get four out; the last girl … her head was stuck really bad,” he said. 











            Beaudoin said he had just parked to drop off his son when he saw the city bus barrel into the daycare. He said he ran into the building, and although most of the children had fled, “we heard the screams” of those still trapped.

            Two children, both 4years old, were killed and six were hospitalized. Pierre Ny St-Amand, a 51-year-old driver with the Laval transit corporation, was arrested at the scene and later charged with two counts of first-degree murder as well as seven other charges, including attempted murder and aggravated assault.

            Large sheets of plywood covered the damaged wall Thursday, next to a cheerful sign with pink letters bearing the name of the center, Garderie Éducative Ste-Rose. Piles of debris from the damaged roof and interior lay in the snow. 

            People, many in tears, stopped by to pay their respects and add to the growing memorial of flowers and stuffed toys in a snowbank outside the center where two 4-year-olds died in the incident.

            Two of the six children had been released from the hospital, while four youngsters remained under treatment, Montreal health officials said.

            Montreal’s Sainte-Justine children’s hospital said in a statement that the two children remaining there were in a “favorable” state of health. Two kids remained at a Laval hospital, and doctors said their lives were not in danger.

            Pierre Ny St-Amand, a 51-year-old driver with the Laval transit corporation, was arrested at the scene Wednesday. He faces two counts of first-degree murder as well as seven other charges, including attempted murder and aggravated assault.

            Authorities said Thursday that they were still trying to understand what could have led someone to drive a bus into the daycare center. 

            “The motive remains incomprehensible still today,” Public Security Minister François Bonnardel told reporters in Quebec City.

            Asked what authorities could have done to prevent the incident, Bonnardel said: “No one can predict this kind of event. No one can predict that someone gets up in the morning, takes off with a bus and decides to hit a daycare with a bus.”

            Witnesses said the driver was delirious after exiting the bus, tore off his clothes and screamed as several people restrained him on the ground until police arrived.

            Late Wednesday, a police cruiser and two officers were stationed outside St-Amand’s home on a quiet suburban street about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the daycare center. Several neighbors described him as a quiet, pleasant father of two young girls.

            One man, Thanh-Ry Tran, said his family got together with St-Amand’s family a few times a year, adding that their wives would sometimes help each other in picking up or dropping off children. He said St-Amand had never shown signs of distress.

            Lionel Carmant, the government minister responsible for social services, told reporters in Quebec City that regional health officials in Laval found no evidence that St-Armand had received care for mental health issues.LAVAL, Quebec (AP) — Parents returned Thursday to the Montreal-area daycare center where two children were killed when a bus rammed into the building, stopping to grieve and to recount the difficult moments they witnessed.André Beaudoin, a father of a 2-year-old boy who attends the center in Laval, said he had to push through debris Wednesday to help pull injured children from under the bus, which had shattered the front of the building.“I managed to get four out; the last girl … her head was stuck really bad,” he said.Beaudoin said he had just parked to drop off his son when he saw the city bus barrel into the daycare.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805696,Vermont gun center must rid property of buildings by summer,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — A Vermont man has until summer to remove all unpermitted structures on a 30-acre firearms training center in Pawlet that neighbors complain is a menace.

            The property, known as Slate Ridge, includes multiple buildings and two firing ranges on land about the size of 30 football fields (12 hectares). Authorities say owner Daniel Banyai built the facility without proper zoning permits. It has been at the center of various legal actions since September 2019.

            In a scathing order issued Wednesday, the Vermont Environmental Court said that Banyai was in contempt of court for deliberately flouting a series of court orders issued since the legal case began. This time, he faces jail and fines that could exceed $100,000 if he fails to comply by June 23.











            The fines are stacking up at a rate of $200 a day because Banyai has not followed a series of court orders calling for him to remove a number of buildings, including what is called a “school house;” and other structures, as well as shooting ranges that were constructed without the required town zoning permits, the court said.

            “Respondent has demonstrated a willfulness, perhaps even an enthusiasm, for disregarding the Town’s Bylaws, this Court’s Orders, and the authority of the Judiciary,"" the Environmental Court said in an order issued Wednesday by Judge Thomas Durkin. The Environmental Court is charged with, among other duties, hearing appeals of Vermont municipal enforcement actions.

            Banyai bought the property in 2013. In 2017, he began operating what he calls a firearms training facility, though the property is only permitted for a garage with an apartment on the grounds. 

            Slate Ridge neighbors have complained for some time about the gunfire and what they say are threats and intimidation by Banyai and his supporters. Many neighbors say they are afraid to talk publicly because they fear for their safety.

            In April 2021, Banyai described his property to The Associated Press as a safe and environmentally friendly place for people to discharge their firearms. The facility also offers lessons in first aid and “anything to do with the outdoors and firearms.”

            In 2019, the town first issued a violation notice to Banyai for building a number of structures on the property without town zoning approval. In March 2021, the Environmental Court ordered Banyai to end any firearms training at the center and remove unpermitted structures. 

            The Vermont Supreme Court rejected Banyai's appeal in January 2022. 

            Since the case has already been decided by the Vermont Supreme Court, it's unclear if Banyai has any further avenue of appeal. The Associated Press reached out to his attorney for comment on Thursday.

            In response to Slate Ridge, Vermont State Sen. Philip Baruth, a Democrat and Progressive from Burlington, introduced a bill in the Legislature earlier this year to ban paramilitary training centers in the state. After a Thursday hearing on the proposal at the Statehouse in Montpelier, Baruth said he introduced the bill after hearing officials say there was nothing they could do about Slate Ridge because it didn't violate any state laws.

            “That can’t stand,"" Baruth said. 

            In the 29-page decision issued Wednesday, the Environmental Court laid out a three-step, 135-day compliance schedule for Banyai to remove all unpermitted structures on the property as well as the earthen berms built around the two shooting ranges. 

            If he complies, he won't have to pay the fine. If he fails to comply by June 23, the $200-a-day fines will come to about $105,000, which he will have to pay along with being ordered to report to jail. Meanwhile, town officials would be allowed to enter the property and remove any unpermitted structures, charging all costs to Banyai.MONTPELIER, Vt.
