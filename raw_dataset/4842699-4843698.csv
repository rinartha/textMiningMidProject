https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842734,"What to know about Alvin Bragg, Manhattan district attorney","A New York grand jury that voted to indict former President Donald Trump on charges involving payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter has refocused attention on the Manhattan district attorney steering the case. Alvin Bragg's decision to convene the grand jury early this year led to the first criminal charge against a former U.S. president.Here’s what you need to know about Bragg:WHO IS THE MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY?Alvin Bragg became Manhattan's first Black district attorney in 2022, following his election in November 2021.AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY, WHAT IS BRAGG'S JOB?The office prosecutes nearly all criminal cases in Manhattan, staffed by about 500 lawyers. The district attorney also is a key political figure, overseeing cases that often involve defendants with immense wealth, fame and influence.Manhattan district attorney is one of the most high-profile prosecution jobs in the world, dramatized on TV shows like “Law & Order” and “Blue Bloods.” Robert M. Morgenthau, who held the job for 35 years, was the model for the fictional character Adam Schiff on “Law & Order,” one of the series' original leads played by actor Steven Hill.The office has a budget of about $150 million and has used a separate $800 million forfeiture fund bankrolled by Wall Street settlements for grants to criminal justice and community organizations and big initiatives, such as testing backlogged rape kits.ARE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ELECTED?Bragg is one of five elected district attorneys in New York City — one for each of the city’s five boroughs. Bragg won a tough Democratic primary and then the general election to become Manhattan’s district attorney. He took over for retiring District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.Bragg is just the fourth elected district attorney in Manhattan in the last eight decades. Frank Hogan served for 31 years. Robert Morgenthau was in office for 34 years, until he was 90. Vance retired at the end of 2021 after 12 years.WHAT IS BRAGG'S LEGAL BACKGROUND?Bragg's career includes time as a federal prosecutor, an assistant attorney general for the state of New York and a civil rights attorney who represented Eric Garner's mother as she pressured New York City officials for more accountability against the officers and commanders involved in her son's 2014 death by a police chokehold.Bragg's campaign included promises to change the culture of the office and allied him with other progressive prosecutors aiming to eliminate cash bail.Shortly after taking office, he released a public memo promising the district attorney would no longer prosecute some low-level misdemeanor crimes.Bragg, who grew up in Harlem, graduated from Harvard Law School.HOW WAS BRAGG INVOLVED WITH THE TRUMP INDICTMENT?Bragg inherited a yearslong grand jury investigation into hush money paid on Trump's behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign.After taking office, Bragg slowed down his office's move toward an indictment against Trump and said he had concerns about the strength of the case. That sparked a public protest by two prosecutors who were leading the investigation and resigned.But Bragg convened a new grand jury early this year after successfully convicting Trump's family company for tax fraud. He called that result a “strong demarcation line” for proceeding with other parts of the probe.In general, the grand jury process is seen as extremely favorable to prosecutors.Proceedings are closed to the public and there is no judge. Prosecutors call and question witnesses and grand jurors — people drawn from the community — can ask questions. Grand jurors can either agree there is enough evidence to issue an indictment, find there is not enough evidence or tell the prosecutor to file lesser charges.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842735,Itching to start spring garden cleanup? Not so fast!,"When the blare of the year’s first leaf blower awakened me one morning last week, I realized spring cleanup had commenced -- no matter that March could still roar like a lion here in my Long Island, New York, neighborhood.It stands to reason that professional landscapers cannot logistically clear all of their clients' properties at the same time -- the right time -- so they start early. That’s good for them but bad for our gardens.In mine, I forgo the fall cleanup, opting instead to allow leaf litter, ornamental grasses and spent perennials to remain standing to serve as shelter for pollinators and other insects over winter. Those insects are still hibernating, and removing the debris before they resume their life cycles would mean removing them from my garden.That would result in less food for birds and fewer flowers and tomatoes for me.The jury is out among experts on the exact timing, but there is consensus around waiting until temperatures are consistently above 50 degrees, which is when dormant insects “wake up.” Some define “consistently” as a minimum of five days. I typically wait until after seven consecutive 50-degree-plus nights have passed.Even then, it’s advisable to relocate plant matter to a corner of the yard for another week or so before removing it from your property, just in case any sleepyheads hit the snooze button.Like clockwork, premature cleaning will be followed by premature mulching. Applying mulch makes the garden look tidy, but remember that soil and plants are not furniture. They’re part of a living ecosystem. Mulching before the soil has warmed sufficiently will trap in the cold and slow the reawakening of perennial, shrub and tree roots. That inhibits plant growth.And if the soil is wet, early applications can encourage mold, mildew and fungal diseases.Mulch is an important component of a healthy garden. It retains soil moisture, suppresses weeds and helps keep soil temperatures even. But timing is crucial. Wait until it’s safe to plant annuals and warm-season vegetables in your region before applying mulch. For me, that means holding off until the end of May.Likewise, resist the urge to fertilize the lawn until mid to late spring, after it has emerged from dormancy and begins active growth. Doing so earlier is illegal in some municipalities and won’t help the grass anyway. In fact, it can hurt.Lawns that are fertilized in early spring cannot properly make use of those applied nutrients. They may start growing when they should be spending their energy on root development, which is what sustains turfgrasses and helps them survive summer droughts. That premature growth is often discolored and results in yellow spots in the lawn.Excess fertilizer that cannot be used by a dormant or partially dormant lawn threatens the environment and groundwater as it leaches through the soil. And since it doesn’t benefit the lawn, it’s also a waste of money.Cleaning up tulips and daffodils is another exercise in patience. After any spring bulb has bloomed, its leaves continue to produce energy for the following year’s show. Go ahead and remove stems if you’d like, but don’t clear away foliage until it has turned yellow and withered.Finally, something you really can do now: If you’re itching to get your hands dirty, it's a good time to repot houseplants. Move them into the next-size pot — no more than 2 inches wider than their current container — and give them a dose of fertilizer as the season’s longer daylengths stimulate them to resume active growth.—-Jessica Damiano writes regular gardening columns for The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842736,Swiss soccer player agents file challenge to FIFA rules,"GENEVA (AP) — FIFA is facing another legal challenge to its new rules regulating player agents, this time in its home country Switzerland.A group of Swiss agents has asked the federal competition commission to intervene with the FIFA Football Agent Regulations, which are being phased in this year and will cap the fees earned from player salaries and transfers.FIFA worked for years to regulate an industry it argues takes too much money out of soccer, with agents earning $622 million from international transfer deals in 2022.While elite agencies have earned tens of millions of dollars from transfers for players like Erling Haaland and Paul Pogba, the Swiss group challenging FIFA typically works at the other end of the global market.“The average players they are representing are playing in second or third leagues in Switzerland with a relatively small market value,” a lawyer for the Swiss agents, Fabio Babey, told The Associated Press in a recent interview.The FIFA rules, which are set to take full effect in October, cap agent earnings at a maximum 10% of transfer fees when acting for the selling club.Agents would also be limited to taking 3% of a player’s salary when those earnings are more than $200,000 per year, or 5% when the player earns up to $200,000. Those limits would be 6% and 10%, respectively, when the agent acted for both the player and the club signing them.FIFA wants to prohibit player agents representing both the buying and selling clubs in a transfer.Fees would also be paid through FIFA’s Paris-based financial clearing house which aims to bring more transparency — and potential risks to confidentiality, agents argue — to a global transfer market that historically has had murky edges.“It’s an unlawful agreement, it’s an abuse of dominance,” said Babey, suggesting some of the about 60 agents operating in Switzerland would be forced out of business by the cap on fees.The Swiss competition commission acknowledged receiving the filed complaint and said it would decide on its next steps “in the coming weeks.” It can open an investigation, try to work with FIFA on amending the rules or reject the complaint.FIFA declined comment Tuesday on the pending Swiss matter, or other legal challenges to the agent rules.A German agency is pursuing a case against the national soccer federation there, and the Zurich-based Professional Football Agents Association has said it will challenge FIFA at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. Other national cases are expected.FIFA’s chief legal officer, Emilio García, has previously said that “those (agents) who are behaving properly shouldn’t be afraid” of the regulations.FIFA has said more than 4,000 people have applied since January for an agent’s license, which costs $600 and requires applicants to take an exam in April or September.A pass mark of 75% is required for the one-hour, 20-question test that can be taken in English, French or Spanish, FIFA’s head of agents, Luis Villas Boas, said at the soccer body’s annual legal conference this month.The FIFA rules make it mandatory from October for clubs and players to use licensed agents.In the Swiss case, Babey said, the federal commission has been asked for “a super-provisional measure” to pause the obligation to register for the FIFA exam.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842738,Supreme Court rules for deaf student in education case,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday for a deaf student who sued his public school system for providing an inadequate education. The case is significant for other disabled students who allege they were failed by school officials.The case the justices ruled in involves Miguel Luna Perez, who attended public school in Sturgis, Michigan. Perez’s lawyers told the court that for 12 years the school system neglected the boy and lied to his parents about the progress he was making, permanently stunting his ability to communicate.The justices ruled that after Perez and his family settled a complaint against the school system — with officials agreeing to pay for additional schooling and sign language instruction — they could pursue money damages under a different federal law. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a eight-page opinion for the court that the case “holds consequences not just for Mr. Perez but for a great many children with disabilities and their parents.”It remains difficult for Perez, who emigrated to the United States from Mexico at age 9, to make himself understood. Perez’s lawyers say the school system failed him by providing an aide who was not trained to work with deaf students, did not know sign language and in later years left him alone for hours at a time. After over a decade, Perez did not know any formal sign language and communicated through invented signs that anyone unfamiliar with his unique signing did not understand, his lawyers have said.Meanwhile, the school awarded him inflated grades and his parents believed he was on track to earn his high school diploma. Just before graduation, however, his family was told he qualified only for a “certificate of completion.""His family responded by pursuing claims under two laws: the broad Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination against disabled people, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The latter guarantees children with disabilities a free public education that is tailored to their specific needs.Perez’s family and the school district ultimately settled the IDEA claims. The district agreed to pay for extra schooling and sign language instruction for Perez and his family, among other things, and he graduated from the Michigan School for the deaf in 2020. After the settlement, the family went to federal court and, under the ADA, sought monetary damages, which are not available under the IDEA.Lower courts said Perez was barred from pursuing his ADA claims because of language in the IDEA, but the Supreme Court disagreed. Gorsuch wrote: “We clarify that nothing” in the IDEA “bars his way.”Perez’s lawyer Roman Martinez said in an emailed statement: “We are thrilled with today’s decision. The Court’s ruling vindicates the rights of students with disabilities to obtain full relief when they suffer discrimination. Miguel and his family look forward to pursuing their legal claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act.""The superintendent of Sturgis Public Schools, Arthur Ebert, who joined the district after the settlement, said in an email that he was “not in a position to comment on the details or the outcome of the case.” But he said that he believes “that every experience provides us with an opportunity to learn and grow.""“Through this too,” he said, ""we will gain knowledge, insight, and understanding that will help us maximize every student’s true potential.”The Biden administration had also urged the court to side with Perez. The case is Perez v. Sturgis Public Schools, 21-887.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842739,Florida mayor resigns over fund distribution concerns,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — A Florida mayor turned in his resignation during a tense budget meeting and said he made the quick decision due to concerns over the direction his colleagues were taking with city funds.Clearwater's Mayor Frank Hibbard called for a five-minute recess Monday and made the announcement afterward. Before the recess, the council had been discussing how to pay for a $250 million shortfall for about 30 projects, the Tampa Bay Times reported.Hibbard had pushed back against spending $90 million for a new city hall and municipal services complex while his four colleagues said was their top priority for the city of Clearwater, which has a population of about 116,000 people and is 23 miles (37 kilometers) from Tampa on Florida’s Gulf Coast.He called his resignation one of the toughest decisions he’s had to make.“I’m not a quitter, but I’m not the right leader for this council anymore and I’m concerned where the city is going, because this is simple math and we’re not doing very well on the test,"" Hibbard said.Council member Kathleen Beckman’s mouth was agape as Hibbard spoke. She then reconvened the budget workshop and urged her colleagues to carry on despite being “shell-shocked,” the Times reported.After leaving the meeting, Hibbard told the Times he made the decision on the spot.He called his wife, Teresa, who he said asked if he could live with the decision. “I’m not going to have a choice,” he told the newspaper when asked the same question.“This is so out of character for me ... I don’t do things lightly,” Hibbard said. “I don’t want to criticize the council, but it’s an overall vision for where the city is going and being fiscally responsible. We talk about affordability and everything else, but we’re not doing the things that continue to keep a cap on costs.”Hibbard was in the last year of his four-year term, and had already announced he would not seek reelection. He had previously served as mayor from 2004 to 2012, and took office again in March 2020, just as the global pandemic was beginning.After the budget meeting, the city's attorney told the council he wanted to speak with Hibbard to confirm his intentions before they discussed replacing him.By that time, Hibbard had already cleared out his office.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842740,UN: Fresh gang violence in Haiti leaves 187 dead in 11 days,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — New clashes between gangs in Haiti’s capital and beyond have killed at least 187 people in less than two weeks and injured more than 150 others, the U.N. said Tuesday.The fresh wave of violence recorded from Feb. 27 to March 9 in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and in the central region of Artibonite also has displaced hundreds of people and forced farmers to abandon fields as starvation worsens, officials said.“The situation is all the more alarming for children, who are often subjected to all forms of armed violence, including forced recruitment and sexual violence,” the U.N. in Haiti said.The surge of violence in central Haiti has been largely blamed on a gang called “Baz Gran Grif,” which roughly translates to “Big Claw Crew.”In addition, nearly 260 kidnappings have been reported since the start of the year, with people abducted from their homes or public places, officials said.Gangs have grown more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, and already control an estimated 60% of Port-au-Prince. They also have been clashing in the central towns of Petite Riviere de l’Artibonite, Verrettes, Estere and Liancourt.Prime Minister Ariel Henry signaled last week that he is seeking to mobilize Haiti’s military to help an under-resourced and understaffed police department fight the unrelenting gang violence, which has forced an increasing number of schools and businesses to shutter.",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842742,GOP leader passes confidence vote after social media uproar,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Lt. Gov. Randy McNally's Republican colleagues in the Senate have voted 19-7 that he should keep his leadership post in the wake of revelations that he repeatedly commented on posts of nearly nude photos of a young gay model and other LGBTQ personalities.The Senate GOP caucus cast the vote of confidence Monday that the 79-year-old Republican should continue in his dual roles as lieutenant governor and Senate speaker.“I have always been honored, humbled and grateful for the support of my caucus. I remain so today,"" McNally said in a statement Monday. ""We have a lot of important work left to do as we complete the legislative session, including the budget. I look forward to getting to it.”Some conservative media outlets and one House Republican lawmaker had called for McNally to leave the post. However, none of the Republicans in the Senate have publicly said he should step aside.McNally initially stated earlier this month that he “had no intention of stopping” when pressed about why he repeatedly commented on racy social media posts by the 20-year-old. He later apologized, saying it was not his intention to embarrass his friends, family or members of the legislature.However, the 79-year-old legislative leader has since received national attention — including being parodied on Saturday Night Live — with critics accusing McNally of being hypocritical. Particularly, McNally supported legislation restricting where certain drag shows can take place.Last week, McNally said he is “pausing” all social media activity.Some of the posts that sparked the most uproar included commenting on a photo of the man’s backside, where he was wearing only underwear, saying “you can turn a rainy day into rainbow and sunshine.” McNally then posted a comment using only heart and fire emojis. In a separate post, McNally posted a heart emoji on a photo of the man pulling down his underwear.“While I see now that I should have been more careful about how my comments and activity would be perceived, my intent was always engagement and encouragement,” McNally said in a previous statement. “For this reason, I will be pausing my social media activity in order to reflect and receive more guidance on the use of social media.”McNally added while he may have made “some mistakes,” he disagreed that he had a record of being “anti-gay” and pointed to his opposition of a 2020 law that assured continued taxpayer funding of faith-based foster care and adoption agencies even if those organizations exclude LGBTQ families and others based on religious beliefs.Yet McNally then pointed to his support of “traditional marriage” and support of bills that “keep obscenity out of the public sphere.”“There is no contradiction here,” he said.McNally, who is from Oak Ridge, became lieutenant governor in 2017.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842743,'Winnie the Pooh' film pulled from Hong Kong cinemas,"HONG KONG (AP) — Public screenings of a slasher film that features Winnie the Pooh were scrapped abruptly in Hong Kong on Tuesday, sparking discussions over increasing censorship in the city.Film distributor VII Pillars Entertainment announced on Facebook that the release of “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” on Thursday had been canceled with “great regret” in Hong Kong and neighboring Macao.In an email reply to The Associated Press, the distributor said it was notified by cinemas that they could not show the film as scheduled, but it didn't know why. The cinema chains involved did not immediately reply to a request for comment.For many residents, the Winnie the Pooh character is a playful taunt of China's President Xi Jinping and Chinese censors in the past had briefly banned social media searches for the bear in the country. In 2018, the film “Christopher Robin,” also featuring Winnie the Pooh, was reportedly denied a release in China.The film being pulled in Hong Kong has prompted concern on social media over the territory’s shrinking freedoms.The movie was initially set to be shown in about 30 cinemas in Hong Kong, VII Pillars Entertainment wrote last week.The Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration said it had approved the film and arrangements by local cinemas to screen approved films “are the commercial decisions of the cinemas concerned."" It refused to comment on such arrangements.A screening initially scheduled for Tuesday night in one cinema was canceled due to “technical reasons,"" the organizer said on Instagram.Kenny Ng, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s academy of film, refused to speculate on the reason behind the cancellation, but suggested the mechanism of silencing criticism appeared to be resorting to commercial decisions.Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to China's rule in 1997, promising to retain its Western-style freedoms. But China imposed a national security law following massive pro-democracy protests in 2019, silencing or jailing many dissidents.In 2021, the government tightened guidelines and authorized censors to ban films believed to have breached the sweeping law.Ng said the city saw more cases of censorship over the last two years, mostly targeting non-commercial movies, such as independent short films.“When there is a red line, then there are more taboos,” he said.",2023/03/22,,World

Nelson was referring to unmanned aerial vehicles.“The United States will continue to expose foreign procurement networks in any jurisdiction that supports Iran’s military industrial complex,"" he said.American defense officials say Iran is supplying Russia with unmanned drones to use on civilians as the Kremlin presses its invasion of Ukraine, which has entered its second year.Among other things, sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the United States and prevent American firms and companies from doing business with them.Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have worsened after months of antigovernment protests.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842745,NATO to hold Ukraine meeting despite Hungary's objections,"BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that he would call a high-level meeting of the military organization’s main forum for cooperation with Ukraine next month despite objections from Hungary.The NATO-Ukraine Commission hasn't met at ministerial level for several years. The last meeting was held at a lower level in 2019 in Kyiv, with NATO ambassadors joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some of his Cabinet ministers, about three years before Russia's full-scale invasion.Hungary and Ukraine are at loggerheads over a language law adopted in Ukraine in 2017 which the nationalist government in Budapest insists stops members of the Transcarpathian ethnic minority from studying in Hungarian. Hungary has routinely blocked NATO-Ukraine Commission meetings since.“This is an established framework. I have the mandate to convene it,” said Stoltenberg, who chairs NATO’s meetings. “In respect for the issues that Hungary has raised I have not convened that for some time, but now I will continue to convene the meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Commission.”He said the meeting will be held on the sidelines of a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on April 4-5, and added: “I’ve not planned more meetings but of course this will not be a one-off event.” He noted that Zelenskyy has been invited to attend NATO’s summit in Lithuania in July.Stoltenberg also said that Hungary’s minority concerns would be discussed at next month’s meeting.NATO makes its decisions by consensus, and Stoltenberg declined to say why he was insisting on calling the meeting over Hungary’s head. But Hungary has continually pushed back a date to vote on the NATO membership of Finland and Sweden, delaying their entry with little explanation.Stoltenberg said Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, in a meeting earlier Tuesday, had confirmed to him that the parliament in Budapest would vote on Finland’s membership on March 27, but it's unclear when or if it will vote on Sweden’s entry.Szijjártó also declined to say what the problem was, telling reporters that the NATO-Ukraine Commission is being convened “for reasons that are not my duty to disclose.” He said though that Stoltenberg’s decision “in our opinion, hurts the cherished unity of NATO.”Hungary has been widely criticized over its human rights record, including a law adopted two years ago that rights groups consider to be homophobic and transphobic. The European Court of Human Rights has also condemned Budapest’s handling of asylum-seekers. ___Boldizsár Győri contributed to this report from Budapest, Hungary.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842746,Dont'a Hightower retires from NFL after decade with Patriots,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — Dont'a Hightower is making a quiet exit to a memorable career with the New England Patriots.The veteran linebacker, who did not play last season, announced his retirement Tuesday in an essay posted on the Players' Tribune website.It ends a decade-long run in New England that began with the Patriots selecting him 25th overall in the 2012 draft. It included three Super Bowl rings (2014, 2016, 2018) and a pair of Pro Bowl selections (2016, 2019). He also was named a second-team All-Pro in 2016.Hightower called his decision “a happy day.”“People always ask what makes the Patriots culture so different. Easy answer: it was about professionalism, period. You knew that you had to show up every single day — not just physically but more so mentally,” he wrote. ""We had a saying, ‘If you do it right, you do it light.’ Being good was expected. Being great might even get you a thumbs up from (coach) Bill (Belichick). Luckily, I knew a thing or two about that from my time at Alabama under Coach (Nick) Saban.“For nine seasons, I lived that mentality 24/7. Today, I’m totally at peace knowing that I gave this franchise every ounce of sweat I had left.”Hightower appeared in 117 games in his NFL career, amassing 27 sacks and 353 tackles.With his wife expecting their first child, he opted to sit out the 2020 season because of concerns about COVID-19. He returned in 2021, but his production was down. He played in 15 games, logging 64 tackles and 1 1/2 sacks.He became a free agent that summer but didn’t sign a new contract.Hightower likely will be most remembered for tackling Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch on the 1-yard line late in the Super Bowl following the 2014 season. The play preceded Russell Wilson's pass that was intercepted by Malcolm Butler in the end zone to clinch the Patriots' 28-24 victory.“When I saw Seattle line up in that I-form, I knew Beast Mode was getting it, and I knew they’d been gashing us with that strong-side lead all game,” Hightower recalled in his essay. “I knew he was going to walk through a huge hole if I didn’t take a risk. ... I figured we had nothing to lose. So I ripped up under (Russell) Okung and shot my shot. All I saw was Marshawn’s two legs churning, and I just prayed to God that I could clip him up or something. I reached out ... and you already know what happened next.”Two seasons later, he came up big again in the Super Bowl. With the Patriots trailing the Falcons 28-12, his strip-sack of Atlanta's Matt Ryan in the fourth quarter was recovered by Alan Branch. New England used a short field and scored to get within one possession. The Patriots ultimately tied it and capped off a historic comeback win in overtime.“I’ll never get tired of inscribing ‘The Strip Sack’ on anything I sign,” Hightower wrote.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842758,Superbug fungus cases rose dramatically during pandemic,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. cases of a dangerous fungus tripled over just three years, and more than half of states have now reported it, according to a new study.The COVID-19 pandemic likely drove part of the increase, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wrote in the paper published Monday by Annals of Internal Medicine. Hospital workers were strained by coronavirus patients, and that likely shifted their focus away from disinfecting some other kinds of germs, they said.The fungus, Candida auris, is a form of yeast that is usually not harmful to healthy people but can be a deadly risk to fragile hospital and nursing home patients. It spreads easily and can infect wounds, ears and the bloodstream. Some strains are so-called superbugs that are resistant to all three classes of antibiotic drugs used to treat fungal infections.It was first identified in Japan in 2009 and has been seen in more and more countries. The first U.S. case occurred in 2013, but it was not reported until 2016. That year, U.S. health officials reported 53 cases.The new study found cases have continued to shoot up, rising to 476 in 2019, to 756 in 2020, and then to 1,471 in 2021. Doctors have also detected the fungus on the skin of thousands of other patients, making them a transmission risk to others.Many of the first U.S. cases were infections that had been imported from abroad, but now most infections are spread within the U.S., the authors noted.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842760,UN chief's call for ambition on climate gets muted response,"BERLIN (AP) — Senior government officials at a climate meeting in Copenhagen gave a muted response Tuesday to calls from the head of the United Nations for countries to show greater ambition when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres urged rich countries Monday to bring forward their target for achieving net zero emissions as close as possible to 2040, and for emerging economies to aim for a date as close as possible to 2050. This would be a significant shifting of the goal posts: the United States and the European Union are currently aiming for net zero by 2050, while China is targeting 2060 and India has set a deadline of 2070.Guterres' call came in a video message responding to a new report by the U.N.'s top climate science panel which found that the world is still far off track if it wants to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial times, as agreed in the 2015 Paris accord. He did not attend the Copenhagen meeting.Speaking at the end of a two-day meeting in the Danish capital of senior officials from dozens of countries, Egypt's foreign minister said there was no “specific answer to the aspirational goals” set out by Guterres.“These goals will be, I’m sure, addressed within the national context and within the national abilities,” said Sameh Shoukry, who chaired last year's U.N. climate talks in his country.Shoukry said Egypt would have to rely on the transfer of technology “from our friends and partners” to wean itself off fossil fuels and ramp up the use of renewable energy. The country has already benefited from a number of deals and investments to green its economy in recent years.Denmark's climate minister, Dan Jørgensen, said his country recently brought forward its net zero target to 2045, and aims to capture more carbon than it emits by 2050. That puts Denmark far ahead of most advanced economies, though its neighbor Germany is also targeting net zero by 2045 and Finland has said it wants to achieve that goal by 2035.The meeting in Copenhagen is one of several taking place before the U.N. climate talks in the United Arab Emirates at the end of the year.Asked whether that summit could again see negotiations on a global pledge to phase down all fossil fuels, Jørgensen said he had “no doubt” that it will be discussed.“Whether or not we will reach that result in Dubai later this year is of course difficult to say,” he said. “But I think we can say for sure that it will be a part of the conversation.”Other important topics to resolve over the coming months concern how to increase funding for poor nations — including those already suffering the effects of global warming — and taking stock of what's been achieved internationally so far since the 2015 Paris climate accord was sealed.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842761,Lawyers: Dispute over Van Gogh art in Detroit is settled,"DETROIT (AP) — A deal has been reached over control of an 1888 painting by Vincent van Gogh, lawyers said, weeks after the custody fight created public buzz and much tension near the end of a rare U.S. exhibition in Detroit.Brokerarte Capital Partners LLC, which claims to own “The Novel Reader,” told a federal appeals court that it reached a confidential settlement with the unnamed entity who loaned the painting to the Detroit Institute of Arts for an exhibition of Van Gogh's works that ended Jan. 22.Because of the dispute, the museum has been under orders to hold the painting while the court determined who would next get the art.Brokerarte Capital, an art brokerage, said it acquired the painting in 2017 for $3.7 million and gave temporary possession of it to a third party who absconded with it. The company filed a lawsuit on Jan. 10 seeking to seize the painting, and the museum subsequently posted a security guard next to it.The museum was caught in the middle but wasn't accused of wrongdoing. It has not publicly explained how it got the painting on loan, saying only that it came from a collection in Brazil.Lawyers for Brokerarte Capital and its sole proprietor, Gustavo Soter of Brazil, said a deal had been reached with the other party.“Consistent with the confidential settlement, Brokerarte no longer seeks injunctive relief, and therefore, this appeal is moot,” lawyers said in a March 13 filing with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.The museum said it spent more than $100,000 defending itself in the litigation, which began in federal court in Detroit. It argued that a federal law governing the international sharing of art prevents courts from intervening. The U.S. Justice Department took a similar position.The museum still is concerned about the significance of the appeals court issuing an injunction in February. It wants the court to consider declaring the injunction “null and void” so it can't be cited as a precedent in any future international art disputes.___Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwritez",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842762,Nuclear contamination testing planned at St. Louis-area park,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to test for radioactive contamination at a suburban St. Louis park that sits along a notoriously toxic creek, a Corps official said Tuesday.The Corps of Engineers is seeking permission from St. Louis County to test soil and water at Fort Belle Fontaine Park, a popular spot for hikers with high bluffs and panoramic views. The park sits about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from where the Missouri River flows into the Mississippi River.Coldwater Creek runs through the park. The notoriously contaminated creek has been a headache for decades, since radioactive waste got into the waterway in the 1950s. Residents who lived along the creek as children in the 1960s and later have blamed illnesses, including rare cancers, on playing in the creek.“We were never, as kids, supposed to go down there, but of course we did,” said Kim Visintine, a member of the Coldwater Creek Group, which advocates for testing and cleanup.A division of the Corps of Engineers known as the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program, or FUSRAP, is responsible for cleanup of contamination along the creek. Jon Rankins, senior health physicist for FUSRAP, said the effort at the park is part of a plan to test all properties within the Coldwater Creek floodplain.“We don’t anticipate finding contamination due to the elevated topography, and have not found contamination in the immediate vicinity of the park,"" Rankins said in a statement.Still, testing was welcomed by local activist groups. Visintine noted that the park is far removed from the residential areas where children played in the creek.“It’s kind of in the middle of nowhere,” she said.Coldwater Creek was contaminated with radioactive waste generated when Mallinckrodt Chemical processed uranium in the 1940s and 1950s for atomic weapons. The waste was initially stored at Lambert Airport, near the creek, then later trucked to an industrial area that also borders the creek.The site near the airport has largely been cleaned up but remediation of the creek itself won’t be finished until 2038, Corps officials have said. Meanwhile, The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2016 urged people to stay away from Coldwater Creek.Last year, Jana Elementary School in the town of Florissant was closed after testing by a private company found contamination on the kindergarten playground and inside the building. The private study was funded by lawyers whose clients are suing over radioactive contamination in Coldwater Creek, which runs near the school.The results prompted the Corps of Engineers to conduct its own investigation. The agency found no contamination inside the school or in multiple soil samples on the outside, and a third round of testing also found no harmful levels of radioactive material. Still, the school remains closed.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842763,"Fox, Dominion face off over airing of false election claims","WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Fox News and a voting machine company that claims the conservative network defamed it by amplifying baseless allegations of fraud following the 2020 presidential election faced off in a courtroom Tuesday during a key hearing over whether journalists have a responsibility to be cautious with explosive and implausible allegations.Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems argued that Fox recklessly repeated false accusations from supporters of former President Donald Trump that its machines and the software used were responsible for Trump's 2020 election loss. Documents released during the lawsuit have shown that top Fox executives and personalities didn't believe the claims but aired them anyway.“There was a deliberate decision by those responsible for the broadcasts … to let the story be out there,” Dominion attorney Rodney Smolla said, adding that Fox News was desperate to win back viewers infuriated that the network had correctly called Arizona, a key battleground state, on election night for Joe Biden. “What they did to get viewers back was start this new narrative that the election had been stolen and that Dominion was the thief.”But Fox contended it was simply reporting on newsworthy allegations — a sitting president's claim that the election was being stolen from him.“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”The arguments, which are scheduled to continue Wednesday, came during a summary judgment hearing as both sides in the case asked Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis to find in their favor ahead of an April 17 trial date. It's unclear when Davis might issue a ruling.Davis told lawyers for both sides he hasn’t made up his mind.“I need to be educated,” the judge said as the hearing began. “I haven’t pre-decided this.”The hearing followed the filing of a separate lawsuit Monday by Fox News producer Abby Grossberg claiming that the network pressured her to give misleading testimony during her deposition in the Dominion case.A producer on Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight show who previously worked for Maria Bartiromo's show, Grossberg contends that Fox attorneys advised her against hiring a personal attorney for the case and implied that she should not be “too candid” in her depositions.“Ms. Grossberg convinced herself that discretion would be the better part of valor in this instance, and decided she would follow the directions of the attorneys who claimed they represented her best interests in connection with her deposition and kept her truth to herself,” Grossberg’s lawsuit contends.Fox countered with its own lawsuit, trying to bar Grossberg from disclosing confidential discussions with Fox attorneys.“Her allegations in connection with the Dominion case are baseless, and we will vigorously defend Fox against all of her claims,” the network said in a statement about Grossberg's case.Tuesday's hearing was perhaps the most significant court action to date in a lawsuit that already has embarrassed Fox by revealing its personalities' private disdain for former President Donald Trump and illustrating how political pressures can inform its coverage. The case also holds the potential for redefining libel law in the U.S.Dominion, which sells electronic voting hardware and software, contends that some Fox News employees deliberately amplified false claims by Trump allies that Dominion machines had changed votes in the 2020 election and that Fox provided a platform for guests to make false and defamatory statements about the company.Dominion's attorney began Tuesday's arguments by rejecting Fox’s claim that it should not be held liable for reporting what Trump supporters were saying.""If you repeat or publish a defamatory statement from someone else, you adopt it as your own,” Smolla said.He added that Fox’s reputation gave statements being made by Trump allies Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell “gravitas.” Smolla said Fox employees did not engage in neutral reporting, but instead “espoused and endorsed” false statements made by program guests.Dominion attorneys argued that Fox employees allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes to Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chavez, and bribed government officials.They pointed to deposition testimony and internal communications — including fact checks from a Fox “brain room,” indicating that, within days of the election, many Fox employees harbored serious doubts about those claims: ""There’s no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election,"" according to one fact check from Nov. 13, 2020.But Fox's attorney argued that the accuracy of the allegations isn't the main issue.“What matters is whether the press accurately reports the allegations, not whether the underlying allegations are true or false,” said Murphy, adding that the distinction between a factual statement and an opinion is also important.She also contended there's no evidence that Fox Corp. showed any malice — a key legal standard in libel cases — toward Dominion, because there is no evidence that any corporate executives were directly responsible in deciding to air the alleged defamatory statements.However, as Murphy led the judge through a list of Fox broadcasts, it became clear that programs of former Fox host Lou Dobbs, aired shortly after the 2020 election, could be an issue for the network.“There seems to be a Dobbs problem,” Davis said.Murphy countered that Dobbs was “an opinion host"" who cited Dominion's denials, but also acknowledged: “It’s abundantly clear that he believes all of these things.”___Riccardi reported from Denver.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842764,Norfolk Southern supports some new regs after Ohio disaster,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Norfolk Southern's CEO is offering support for some parts of a bipartisan Senate bill to put tougher safety regulations on railroads after last month’s fiery hazardous materials train derailment on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.CEO Alan Shaw is under pressure from senators and federal safety regulators to step up his commitment to safety regulations as he appears before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday. Under aggressive questioning from senators earlier this month in a separate hearing, he committed to voluntary safety upgrades and earnestly apologized for the derailment that upended life in East Palestine, Ohio. But Shaw had stopped short of endorsing proposed safety regulations under the Railway Safety Act of 2023.This time, Shaw says in prepared remarks released Tuesday that Norfolk Southern will “support legislative efforts to enhance the safety of the freight rail industry."" But he does not address several key provisions of the Railway Safety Act, including increased fines for safety violations and designating trains that carry flammable liquids as highly hazardous.Shaw supports provisions in the act for railroads to fund training for emergency crews, a review of regulations for rail care inspections every three years and accelerating the phaseout of older tank car models.Shaw also says there are “areas in which we believe Congress could go further with safety legislation,"" including stricter standards for tank car design and research into technology that would detect problems with rail cars.No one was immediately injured in the Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, but state and local officials decided to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five tanker cars, prompting the evacuation of half of the roughly 5,000 residents. Scenes of billowing smoke above the village, alongside reports from residents that they still suffer from illnesses, have turned high-level attention to railroad safety and how dangerous materials are transported.The Senate Commerce Committee will also hear from the National Transportation Safety Board chair ​​Jennifer Homendy. The NTSB — as well as the Federal Railroad Administration — are investigating the East Palestine derailment and Norfolk Southern's safety practices.In prepared remarks, Homendy says that “rail remains one of the safest means of transportation,” but also points to several safety shortcomings in current regulations, including that local emergency responders are not regularly told what hazardous materials are carried on trains if they don't qualify as a high-hazard flammable train.The train that derailed in East Palestine was not classified as highly hazardous because it fell under the threshold for the number of cars carrying a combustible liquid, such as gasoline, ethanol or acetone.Homendy will push for a broader definition of high-hazard flammable trains, saying it “should include a broad range of hazardous materials"" and “that even one railcar of any hazardous material justifies notifying emergency responders.”Senators will also hear from an organization representing railroads, an East Palestine resident and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, as well as the two Ohio senators pushing the Railway Safety Act — Republican JD Vance and Democrat Sherrod Brown.In the House, Republican Reps. Bill Johnson, whose district includes East Palestine, and Emilia Strong Sykes, an Ohio Democrat, have introduced a separate version of a railroad safety bill.Both senators, as well as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have been outspoken critics of Norfolk Southern. Vance, who holds a seat on the Senate Commerce Committee, circulated a memo to his fellow Republicans on the panel this week to push them to focus the hearing on the new safety regulations, including questioning Shaw on whether he supports increased fines for safety violations.In the memo, Vance suggests that Shaw be asked whether the penalties should be stepped up “when a railroad company poisons an entire community.”Vance also met with Shaw on Tuesday ahead of the hearing and told The Associated Press it was a “productive conversation.” But he added that he wanted to see the company endorse the increased fines, enhanced hazardous material reporting requirements and a mandate that detectors be installed every 10 miles (16 kilometers) to monitor for overheated bearings like the ones that caused the East Palestine derailment.“It's important if these guys really want to show commitment to rail safety, to endorse the legislation,” Vance said. “You don’t have to endorse every single piece of it, but to endorse the broad thrust of what we’re trying to do is important.”",2023/03/22,,World

The national railway company said the line would be out of service for at least a week.The digging means “the rails can subside and then the safety of train traffic can no longer be guaranteed,” ProRail, the company that maintains the Dutch rail network said in a statement.Earlier this month, badgers also burrowed under tracks near the northern village of Molkwerum in Friesland province, knocking a line out of service until next month while workers seek permission to shift the animals.Badgers are protected animals in the Netherlands, so rail operators have to get permission to move them or disturb their habitat before repairs can begin.John Voppen, CEO of ProRail, the company that maintains Dutch railroads, appealed for a speeding up of the procedures.“In the interests of travelers and carriers, more space is needed to be able to take action more quickly,” he said in a statement. “We are of course in urgent consultation with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management about this.”ProRail says that badgers like digging into the steep sides of earthen dikes that carry many Dutch train tracks. That can cause the tracks to subside, endangering trains.“Living together with badgers can be a real puzzle,” the company said on its website.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842766,Snap! Venus fly trap fans ask South Carolina to honor plant,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Conservationists are pushing for the Venus fly trap to be South Carolina's official carnivorous plant, joining other official items such as the state bird (Carolina Wren), state opera (Porgy and Bess) and the state snack (boiled peanuts).In all, South Carolina has about five dozen official state things. There are already five different plants including yellow jasmine, which is the official flower, to the official fruit — the peach — to Indian Grass, which is, unsurprisingly, South Carolina's official grass.But supporters said honoring the Venus fly trap isn't about one extra thing students see on an elementary school worksheet.Instead, it's about protecting and increasing awareness of an interesting species found only in this spot on the globe: the upper part of the South Carolina coast and a small sliver of southeast North Carolina.“In a state as small as ours that is growing every day, we have to protect the things that belong here,” said South Carolina Sen. Thomas McElveen, who lead a subcommittee Tuesday that voted to advance a bill to elevate the status of the carnivorous plant.The Democrat knows all about the allure of the plant with leaves that can trap insects to get a source of nutrition in the nutrient-poor soil where it grows.McElveen said his mom bought him one when he was a kid from the market. He named it ""Audrey II"" after the ravenous and cruel human-eating Venus fly trap in Little Shop of Horrors.In the wild, Venus fly traps are the size of a lima bean and mean no harm to anything other than spiders and flies. They have special hairs that when brushed — twice in succession to reduce the amount of false alarms by dust or rain — snap the leaves shut around the insect.If the prey continues to wiggle and is too big to escape from between the hairs, the plant releases acid that dissolves and digests the insect and provides nutrients.“This is a plant for South Carolina to be proud of. It is globally rare,” Coastal Conservation League biologist Trapper Fowler told senators.Venus fly traps face two big enemies — poachers and development. Poaching is illegal and the best groups of plants have been in heritage areas where they can grow away from thieves and avoid people in South Carolina's fastest growing region. They're also a fragile plant that needs fire more than water — the blazes clear out faster, denser overgrowth that can choke the smaller fly traps.The bill still has to get through the full Senate Family and Veterans Affairs Committee and then approval on the Senate floor before heading to the House.But there's enough time this year for the Venus fly trap to join other official South Carolina things like the official spider (Carolina Wolf Spider), picnic cuisine (barbecue), dance (the Shag) and stone (blue granite).“You’re not just naming this plant and putting it in the back of our legislative manual,” McElveen said. “You may be doing something to raise awareness and conservation.”",2023/03/22,,World

(AP) — Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen says he is recovering from an attack earlier this month outside a Florida hotel.Allen, who was in South Florida to perform a show at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, was attacked while taking a smoke break outside the the Four Seasons hotel on Fort Lauderdale Beach.Police arrested a 19-year-old man, but said they don't have a motive for the attack. They did not identify either the suspect, or Allen, in the police report.But in a social media post, Allen, 59, said he's thankful for all the support he has received from this fans. He said he's also relieved that his wife, Lauren, wasn't with him when the incident occurred, and that they are now “working on recovering in a safe space.”Police said the assailant was hiding behind a pillar outside the hotel while Allen was smoking a cigarette. The man ran at Allen, knocking him to the ground.According to the police report, a woman saw Allen fall and ran to help him, and the man then attacked her.The man then ran to another hotel and started breaking car windows until he was stopped by witnesses and police arrived. He was arrested and charged with two counts of battery, four counts of criminal mischief, and abusing an elderly or disabled adult.Allen lost his left arm in an accident in 1984.In a photo posted on Instagram, Allen was wearing a blue Fort Lauderdale police t-shirt.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842783,Man gets 4 years for attacking police at Jan. 6 Capitol riot,"A Virginia man who assaulted police with a stolen baton and used a flashing strobe light to disorient officers trying to defend the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 was sentenced Tuesday to more than four years in prison.Geoffrey Sills of Mechanicsville, Virginia, was convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, obstruction of Congress and robbery for his role in the violence at the Capitol's Lower West Terrace tunnel, where police were beaten and crushed as as they tried to beat back the angry mob of President Donald Trump supporters.The 31-year-old has already served a year and a half behind bars since his June 2021 arrest.In a separate case on Tuesday, a judge declared a mistrial after jurors failed to reach an agreement on whether a man described as the Oath Keepers “operations leader” for Jan. 6 was guilty of obstruction. Michael Greene was acquitted of all other felony charges on Monday, but convicted of a misdemeanor offense. Greene is the only defendant in three trials involving more than a dozen members and associates of the far-right extremist group to not be convicted of a felony charge.Sills — who arrived at the Capitol with a gas mask and goggles — threw several pole-like objects at police, stole a police baton from an officer and hit at least two officers with it, according to prosecutors. He also pointed a strobe light at a line of officers in the tunnel.Sills posted videos of his actions and others on social media that day before deleting his account, prosecutors say. In one post — showing officers in riot gear — Sills wrote: “Visited the Capitol today.” In another post depicting rioters flooding into the the tunnel, he wrote: “Took a tour.”U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden found Sills guilty in August after a stipulated bench trial — an unusual legal proceeding in which defendants do not admit guilt to charges but agree with the government that certain facts are true.Prosecutors had been seeking nine years behind bars, writing in court papers that Sills has “expressed little remorse and contrition."" Prosecutors argued that his social media posts “were those of a man proud of his actions.”Sills' attorney wrote in court papers that his client didn't come to Washington on Jan. 6 with any intention to commit violence and had a gas mask and tactical gear only “because he feared a terrorist attack.”“He did not arrive that day planning or expecting to wreak violence. There is no evidence that he injured anyone. He went because his President asked him to. Once there, he stepped into a maelstrom not of his making,"" attorney John Kiyonaga wrote. An email seeking comment was sent to Kiyonaga after sentencing.Sills is among roughly 1,000 people who have been charged with federal crimes in the riot that left dozens of police officers injured. More than 300 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers, including more than 100 who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury.More than half the Jan. 6 defendants have pleaded guilty, including more than 130 who have pleaded guilty to felony crimes. Of the 400 who have been sentenced, more than half have gotten terms of imprisonment ranging from seven days to 10 years, according to an Associated Press tally.In the Oath Keepers case, jurors on Monday found four defendants guilty of conspiracy and obstruction: Sandra Parker, of Morrow, Ohio, Laura Steele, of Thomasville, North Carolina, William Isaacs, of Kissimmee, Florida, and Connie Meggs, of Dunnellon, Florida.Sandra Parker’s husband, Bennie Parker, was acquitted Monday of obstruction as well as one conspiracy charge, and Greene was acquitted of two conspiracy charges. The judge instructed jurors to keep deliberating after they said they couldn’t reach a verdict on another conspiracy charge for Bennie Parker and the obstruction charge for Greene.On Tuesday, the jury returned a guilty verdict for Bennie Parker on the other conspiracy charge, but deadlocked on the obstruction charge for Greene.Greene, of Indianapolis, Indiana, said he wasn’t a dues-paying member of the Oath Keepers but worked essentially as a contractor, providing security services. He took the witness stand during the seditious conspiracy trial of Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and told jurors that Rhodes asked him to come to Washington to help with security operations for events around the Capitol before the riot. Greene didn't go inside the Capitol and told jurors he never heard anyone discussing plans to do so.Greene's attorney, William Shipley, said Tuesday that “the government's case was a farce,"" adding that “it made no sense and the jury saw it for what it was.”",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842784,DC braces for 'robust oversight' after criminal code fiasco,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden's signature on a bill nullifying an overhaul of the District of Columbia criminal code ended a public fight between Congress and local lawmakers. But the battles are only just beginning.Already House Republicans are pledging to increase congressional intervention in local D.C. affairs. House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., has pledged that his committee “stands ready to conduct robust oversight of America’s capital city.”D.C. Council members sound like they fully believe those promises.“I’m afraid that we’re going to see more of this for the remainder of this Congress,” D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said earlier this month in advance of a Senate vote to overrule the city government and block the District's new crime laws. “Does this raise a concern that there are going to be other issues? Yes.”The criminal code saga has left District lawmakers bitterly nursing their political wounds, harboring fresh resentments against national Democrats, some of whom supported the criminal code nullification, and bracing to play defense against the activist Republican-controlled House for at least the next two years.And that robust oversight has already begun. Even before Biden signed the crime bill override on Monday, the House Oversight Committee sent letters summoning Mendelson, D.C. Councilmember Charles Allen and D.C. Chief Financial Officer Glen Lee to testify at a March 29 hearing. The topic of that hearing, according to the letter, is the vague “general oversight of the District of Columbia, including crime, safety, and city management.”Other House Republicans have already identified areas of interest to target. Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia has introduced a resolution to block a separate D.C. law — a police accountability measure known as the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act.Most aspects of that law were passed by the D.C. Council on an emergency basis in 2020, amid the protests against police brutality following George Floyd’s killing by police; it was made permanent in December 2022. It bans the use of chokeholds by police officers, makes police disciplinary files more available to the public, weakens the bargaining power of the police union and limits the use of tear gas to disperse protestors.“Now that Congress has effectively used its constitutional authority to strike down the D.C. Council’s dangerous Revised Criminal Code Act, we must now move to swiftly block this anti-police measure to ensure our nation’s capital city is safe for all Americans,” Clyde said in a statement.Under terms of Washington’s Home Rule authority, t he House Committee on Oversight and Accountability essentially vets all new D.C. laws and frequently alters or limits them through budget riders. But the criminal code rewrite is the first law to be completely overturned since 1991.Clyde, a longtime nemesis of D.C. loyalists, has publicly stated that his ultimate goal is to completely end Washington's Home Rule authority. That sentiment, once a long-shot fringe position, has edged closer to being a mainstream Republican talking point. Former President Donald Trump said earlier this month that the “federal government should take over control and management of Washington D.C.”Meanwhile, Oversight Committee member Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has targeted the D.C. Jail for congressional scrutiny. Greene has demanded access to the jail to visit some two dozen detainees from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. She's also seeking a complete overview of the jail's conditions.Other aspects of D.C. legislation remain ripe targets for activist Republicans, such as the District's strict gun control laws and the decision to essentially decriminalize most psychedelics — a move that was approved by D.C. voters in a referendum.This congressional onslaught of oversight was widely predicted when Republicans took back control of the House after last year's midterm elections. But most local politicians and activists hoped they could count on Democratic control of both the Senate and the White House as a shield. Those hopes rapidly melted away in a storm of political dynamics that amounted to a humiliating setback for the D.C. Council and the larger hopes of Washington ever achieving statehood.House Republicans were able to put Biden and Senate Democrats in a political bind over the criminal code revision. Defending D.C.’s right to self-governance would open them to charges of being soft on criminals at a time of rising crime both in the nation’s capital and across the U.S.Republicans highlighted the fact that it reduced maximum penalties for crimes such as carjacking, while D.C. Council members maintained that the new penalties were much higher than the sentencing guidelines in multiple states around the country and far above the vast majority of sentences imposed by judges.In the end, Biden — despite recent tweets supporting D.C. statehood — signaled before the Senate vote that he would not veto the rejection of the criminal code, and 33 Democratic senators voted to overturn it. The moves were regarded by statehood activists as a betrayal that they say exposed the hollowness of national Democratic support for D.C. statehood.As the Senate vote loomed earlier this month, Mendelson tried to avoid a public defeat by withdrawing the criminal code revisions. But the move did not stop the Senate vote or spare Biden a politically charged decision on whether to endorse the congressional action.The House also passed a second bill that would have overturned a D.C. law granting non-citizens the right to vote in local elections. But it was never seriously debated or voted upon by the Senate.For now, the D.C. Council maintains that the city's criminal code is dangerously obsolete and desperately in need of reform. But after seeing the initial law turned into a national political issue, there appears to be little appetite to try again in the short term.Mendelson said that changing the elements that drew criticism would simply lead to other objections from a Republican House that he said is openly looking for a fight.“I don’t plan on installing a hotline to Republican leadership in the House and the Senate and calling them every week and asking them for permission to move forward,” he said.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842785,Swiss suspend bonus payouts to Credit Suisse staffers,"GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland's government said Tuesday that it's ordering Credit Suisse to temporarily suspend bonuses for employees after orchestrating a plan for the No. 2 Swiss bank to be taken over by rival UBS.The Swiss Department of Finance says federal law allows the government to set “remuneration-related measures” in cases involving Switzerland's biggest banks.Late last week and into the weekend, authorities in Switzerland, backed by the central bank and financial regulators, scrambled to cobble together a $3.25 billion sale of Credit Suisse to UBS.An outflow of deposits and years of trouble raised fears that it could fail and trigger an international financial crisis after the collapse of two U.S. banks.The Swiss government says it doesn't plan to block bonus payments from last year that have been granted but are set to be immediately paid because it doesn't want to penalize Credit Suisse employees “who did not cause the crisis.”But authorities in the capital, Bern, said they will prohibit payouts of “deferred” bonuses — even though they have already been granted — with an exception for bonuses that “are already in the process of being paid out.”",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842786,Review: John Wick gets even more stylish in fourth episode,"A trip to Paris should be on everyone’s bucket list, even John Wick. The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre — what better way to refresh your soul, even as you kick everyone else’s bucket?The un-retired assassin does indeed dive into the City of Lights in the inventive and thrilling “John Wick: Chapter 4” a sequel which elevates and expands the franchise. The fourth installment is more stylish, more elegant and more bonkers — kind of like Paris itself.When we last saw Wick, he was half dead in the gutter after being shot and tumbling several stories off the Hotel Continental in New York. He was on the blacklist with a $14 million price on his head. (Inflation has even hit this franchise: The bounty swells to $40 million by the end of part four.)Wick, as always played with monosyllabic and brooding intensity by Keanu Reeves, leaves his customary trail of death, but there’s a shift here. So often the prey in the previous movies, Wick is on the offense in the fourth, taking his demands directly to The High Table, the group of shadowy crime lords that keep order.This time, the Table’s sadistic frontman is a dandy called the Marquis, played with coiled menace by Bill Skarsgård, who spouts things like: “Second chances are the refuge of men who fail.” But he’s a secret coward, so feel free to boo loudly.The nine-fingered Wick wants to end his nightmare, naturally, by killing everyone. His too-cool frenemy, Ian McShane’s Winston, challenges him to think differently: “Have you learned nothing?” he asks the man who, to be honest, he shot in the last movie. “You’ll run out of bullets before they run out of heads.”Returning writer Shay Hatten, along with co-writer Michael Finch, have come up with a possible solution for Wick: Win an old-fashioned duel with the Marquis. Win and be free, lose and be buried.Not so fast, of course. Along the way, Wick must somehow handle the blind martial arts master Caine, played by Donnie Yen, bringing humor and verve to a fighter who is tasked with either slaying his one-time friend or have his daughter killed.There’s also Killa, a jumbo-sized card shark played by martial arts star Scott Adkins, and The Tracker, a very talented bounty hunter played by Shamier Anderson. Don’t forget a swarm of Paris-based amateur bounty-hunters and armored ninjas who seem as plentiful as the city’s baguettes.All the touches you expect from a Wick flick are here — a cool dog, hand-to-hand combat amid glass display cases, candles and Christian iconography, galloping horses, the screech of metal swords and a new way to hurt someone, in this case, a single playing card. We visit Germany, Japan and end in France, even going to a disused subway platform.Returning director Chad Stahelski loves combining neon with gloom and now has the budget to rent out space in the Louvre. Of the 14 action sequences — yes, 14 — a few are truly mind-blowing, like a fight in the middle of the traffic circle around the Arc de Triomphe and a drone capturing a complicated set piece in a building involving what is being called a dragon’s breath shotgun. Repeating that last bit: dragon’s breath shotgun.If there was a bit of a slog through would-be assassins in “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum” — you know, shoot, stab, repeat — there is none here. One sequence on a set of outdoor stairs in Paris is almost riotously funny as knives and guns blast away, while the filmmakers add water and fire to a nightclub rave scene that puts clueless dancers next to axe-throwing murderers.A shout-out to costume designer Paco Delgado, who has outfitted the baddie gunmen in light-colored three-piece suits and combat boots, and the executive baddies in fitted elegance with extravagant cravat-style ties. One of the film’s saddest parts is saying goodbye to Lance Reddick, who played Continental Hotel concierge Charon and died on the eve of the movie’s debut.How does this all end? Actually, on something of a deflating note. Earlier in the film, Wick’s Japan-based friend Shimazu — played awesomely by Hiroyuki Sanada — had asked a question that eternally hangs over this franchise: “Have you given any thought to how this ends?”This chapter ends in death, of course. But that’s also how it lives.“John Wick: Chapter 4,” a Lionsgate release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for “pervasive strong violence and some language.” Running time: 169 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. ___ MPAA definition of R: Restricted.

Seumalo appeared in 81 games in all for Philadelphia and won a Super Bowl with the Eagles following the 2017 season.Seumalo is considered an excellent run blocker, though he has improved in pass protection during his career. He allowed just one sack while playing 1,137 offensive snaps in 2022.While Seumalo can play all three interior line positions, he seems a natural fit at left guard. Kevin Dotson started all 17 games at the position for Pittsburgh in 2022 but seems headed to a reserve role in 2023.Seumalo is the second offensive line signing by the Steelers so far in free agency.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842789,"Jury rules against ex-Haitian mayor, orders $15M in damages","Three men who said they or their families were subjected to political persecution that included a killing, attempted killings and torture in their hometown in Haiti finally got justice after about 15 years on Tuesday when an American jury ruled in their favor and awarded them $15.5 million in damages.David Boniface, Juders Ysemé and Nissage Martyr filed the civil suit against Jean Morose Viliena in in U.S. District Court in Boston in 2017 after the courts in Haiti failed to bring them justice, they said.“I felt very happy to hear the result today, very proud that this is the result I got, and I was confident when I filed the complaint in the U.S. that I would get this result today,” Boniface said through a translator.The suit was filed under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, which allows civil lawsuits to be filed in the U.S. against foreign officials who allegedly committed wrongdoing in their homeland if all legal avenues in their country have been exhausted.The trial cast a spotlight on the wider issue of patronage, violence and intimidation in Haitian politics and the Caribbean nation’s often ineffective judicial system.“I think our hope is that this verdict today will help pull forward accountability efforts in Haiti,” said Dan McLaughlin, an attorney for the Center of Justice and Accountability, which represented the men. But, he said. at the least it shows that people accused of crimes elsewhere can be held accountable in U.S. courts.Viliena, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who now lives in Malden, Massachusetts, denied any wrongdoing. He showed no emotion as the verdict was read after a weeklong trial and about five hours of jury deliberations. He and his attorney, Peter Haley, declined comment as they left the courtroom.Viliena was mayor more than a decade ago of Les Irois, a town of around 22,000 people on Haiti’s westernmost tip, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) from the capital of Port-au-Prince.The plaintiffs said in the suit that they or their relatives were persecuted Viliena and his political allies.Viliena was elected as a candidate for the Haitian Democratic and Reform Movement and was backed by the Committee for Resistance in Grande-Anse, which according to the lawsuit dominates regional politics through patronage, threats and armed violence.The plaintiffs alleged that in 2007 Viliena — a loyalist of former Haitian President Michel Martelly — led a group of men armed with guns, machetes and clubs to Boniface’s home, and in his absence, shot and killed his younger brother, Eclesiaste Boniface.“I feel very happy and feel well today, although that did not bring back my brother to me, the fact that justice was rendered; it’s big,” David Boniface said through the translator.The suit also alleged that Viliena and his men beat and shot Ysemé and Nissage Martyr at a community radio station in 2008. Ysemé was blinded in one eye, while Martyr lost a leg, according to the suit. Nissage Martyr has since died, and his son, Nissandère Martyr, replaced him as a plaintiff.The plaintiffs also alleged that Viliane’s allies burned down dozens of homes occupied by his political opponents in 2009. The jury on Tuesday cleared Viliena of liabilty for the arson.It's not clear if Viliena has the money to pay the damages.“The clients have been clear with us that the driving force behind this case is not money damages,"" McLaughlin said.“The point of the punitive damages is to send a message both to the defendant and to others who may be tempted to act like him that that kind of conduct is unacceptable,” he said.The plaintiffs said their troubles are not over. Viliena still holds power in Haiti and they have been living in hiding away from their homes for years.“Up to today, we feel very scared, very frightened for our families and even the people who helped us stay in hiding this whole time, even their lives are also targeted,"" Ysemé said through a translator.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842790,Chief recommends firing officers in paralyzed prisoner case,"The police chief in New Haven, Connecticut, recommended Tuesday that four officers be fired for mistreating a Black man who became paralyzed from the chest down last year in a police van that braked suddenly.Police Chief Karl Jacobson's recommendations in the case of Richard “Randy” Cox now go to the city's police commissioners, who have the sole authority to fire officers. The commissioners are expected to hold hearings beginning in late April or early May, he said.“The message to the community is that we will be transparent and we will be accountable, and we will hold our officers accountable,"" Jacobson said at a news conference at police headquarters. ""The message to the officers is that this administration does have your back and that mistakes do happen, but we will not treat this community disrespectfully as happened in the Randy Cox situation.”Jacobson also announced that internal affairs investigations found the officers violated conduct rules on integrity, abiding by the law, trustworthiness, courtesy and respect.Ben Crump, an attorney for Cox and his family, said they are encouraged the chief is recommending the officers be fired.“These officers were sworn to protect their community, but they inflicted unnecessary and traumatizing harm to Randy, who will pay the price for the rest of his life,” Crump said in a statement.An attorney for one of the officers said they were being used as scapegoats for the department's inadequate training and policies, and noted Jacobson said over 50 policies are under review to make sure what happened to Cox doesn't happen again.The four officers — Oscar Diaz, Betsy Segui, Jocelyn Lavandier and Luis Rivera — also have been criminally charged on allegations they cruelly mistreated and neglected Cox on June 19, 2022, after he was injured in the back of a police van with no seat belts. He'd been arrest on gun and threatening charges, which were later dropped.A fifth officer, Ronald Pressley, is charged with the same crimes. Jacobson said Pressley retired in January, so he cannot be disciplined.Police have said the van driver, Diaz, was transporting Cox to police headquarters when he braked hard to avoid an accident. Cox, whose hands were handcuffed behind his back, slid head-first into the metal partition between the driver and passenger compartments, breaking his neck and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.“I can’t move. I’m going to die like this. Please, please, please help me,” Cox said minutes after the crash, according to police video.Diaz stopped a few minutes later to check on him, according to police video and officials. Cox was lying motionless on the floor and Diaz called paramedics. However, Diaz told them to meet him at the station instead of waiting for them — a violation of department policy, Jacobson has said.At the station, some of the officers mocked Cox and accused him of being drunk and faking his injuries, according to surveillance and body-worn camera footage. Officers dragged Cox by his feet out of the van and placed him in a holding cell prior to his eventual transfer to a hospital.The five officers have pleaded not guilty to second-degree reckless endangerment and cruelty to persons — misdemeanor charges criticized as too light by Cox’s family and lawyers.The case has drawn outrage from civil rights advocates like the NAACP, along with comparisons to the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. Gray, who was also Black, died in 2015 after he suffered a spinal injury while handcuffed and shackled in a city police van.Gregory Cerritelli, a lawyer for Segui, said the officers are “scapegoats” for the department's “inadequate training and policies.”“The entire process lacks fundamental fairness,” Cerretelli said about the internal affairs investigations.Lavandier's attorney, Dan Ford, said the chief's recommendation to fire her was “premature.”Messages seeking comment were left for the other officers' lawyers.Cox is suing the officers and city for $100 million in federal court for alleged negligence, excessive use of force, failing to provide immediate medical care, assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other claims.In court documents, the officers and the city deny the lawsuit allegations.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842791,Uganda's legislature passes harsh new anti-LGBTQ bill,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Ugandan lawmakers passed a bill prescribing jail terms of up to 10 years for offenses related to same-sex relations, responding to popular sentiment but piling more pressure on the East African country’s LGBTQ community.The bill was passed late Tuesday inside a packed parliamentary chamber, and after a roll call ordered by the House speaker, who had repeatedly warned it was necessary to identify those who might oppose the bill. It was supported by nearly all of the 389 legislators present.“Congratulations,” said Speaker Anita Among. “Whatever we are doing, we are doing it for the people of Uganda.”An earlier version of the bill enacted in 2014 later was nullified by a court on procedural grounds. Human Rights Watch has described the legislation as “a more egregious version” of the 2014 law, which drew widespread international concern and was struck down amid pressure from Uganda’s development partners.The bill now will go to President Yoweri Museveni, who can veto or sign it into law. He suggested in a recent speech that he supports the bill, accusing unnamed Western nations of “trying to impose their practices on other people.”The bill was introduced last month by an opposition lawmaker who said his goal was to punish “promotion, recruitment and funding” related to LGBTQ activities. His bill creates the offense of “aggravated homosexuality,” which applies in cases of sex relations involving those infected with HIV as well as minors and other categories of vulnerable people. It was not immediately clear what the punishment is for that offense following last-minute amendments in a protracted plenary session in the capital, Kampala.The bill also creates the offense of “attempted homosexuality,” punishable with up to 10 years in jail.Same-sex activity is already punishable with life imprisonment under a colonial-era law targeting “carnal knowledge against the order of nature,” partly the basis of a report by dissenters on the parliamentary committee that vetted the bill before Tuesday’s vote.The bill is “ill-conceived” and unconstitutional because it “criminalizes individuals instead of conduct,” said lawmaker Fox Odoi, representing the dissenters.The bill, if signed into law, “would violate multiple fundamental rights, including rights to freedom of expression and association, privacy, equality, and non-discrimination, according to Human Rights Watch.“One of the most extreme features of this new bill is that it criminalizes people simply for being who they are as well as further infringing on the rights to privacy, and freedoms of expression and association that are already compromised in Uganda,” the group’s Oryem Nyeko said in a statement earlier this month. “Ugandan politicians should focus on passing laws that protect vulnerable minorities and affirm fundamental rights and stop targeting LGBT people for political capital.”Anti-gay sentiment in Uganda has grown in recent weeks amid alleged reports of sodomy in boarding schools, including a prestigious one for boys where a parent accused a teacher of abusing her son. Authorities are investigating that case.Uganda’s LGBTQ community in recent years has faced pressure from civilian authorities who wanted a tough new law punishing same-sex activity.The Ugandan agency overseeing the work of NGOs last year stopped the operations of Sexual Minorities Uganda, the most prominent LGBTQ organization in the country, accusing it of failing to register legally. But the group’s leader stated that his organization had been rejected by the registrar of companies as undesirable.The recent decision of the Church of England to bless civil marriages of same-sex couples also has inflamed many, including some who see homosexuality as imported from abroad.“The Church of England has departed from the Anglican faith and are now false teachers,” Ugandan Archbishop Stephen Kaziimba said in a statement last month that described “a crisis at hand.”Homosexuality is criminalized in more than 30 of Africa’s 54 countries.",2023/03/22,,World

The law firm said there was no legal impediment to retaining Berhalter, who remains a candidate, and the USSF put off a coaching decision until after a new sporting director is hired, probably this summer.Gio Reyna is among 24 players in camp ahead of CONCACAF Nations League games at Grenada on Friday and against El Salvador on Monday in Orlando.“The biggest thing is making sure that everybody knows we're here for a reason and what's happened with Gio in the past is in the past and what happened at the World Cup happened at the World Cup and we moved on from that as players,"" the 35-year-old Ream said Tuesday.“I think the biggest thing for us as a leadership and all the guys in camp is to see that he's working hard, training hard, that he's wanting to be here and up to this point, it's been nothing but positive,” Ream said. ""Having conversations with different guys, everybody knows what he can bring to the table, everybody know how talented he is. And to see him come in here with that attitude and the work rate and the desire to be a part of the group and just get back on level terms with everyone without having to overly address it has been a big positive for all the guys to see.""Reyna was not among the four players made available to media by the USSF in Zoom sessions on Monday and Tuesday. The USSF did not respond to an email asking whether Reyna will be made available this week.Reyna made two substitute appearances during the World Cup totaling 52 minutes and Berhalter told a management conference he almost sent a player home because of lack of hustle — remarks Reyna admitted were aimed at him.""I've had individual conversations with him. Those will stay between him and I because I think that's important, to have that kind of line of communication and trust between players, between teammates, between groups,"" Ream said. ""What he's feeling, what he's seeing, what his worries may be will stay between him and I, because I think that's important to allow him to move past everything that's happened. And I think it's important for all of us to be able to move past that and work together as a good team.""Berhalter was hired in December 2018 after the U.S. failed to qualify for that year's World Cup. He said last week he is keeping his job options open.“Bringing him back is a familiarity,” Ream said, citing “the togetherness that he brought to the team after it was very, very much kind of sporadic and fractured when he first came in.”“He put and laid very good foundations for the team,” Ream said. “If they bring him back, obviously we'll continue to work under him and if they don't, we'll continue to work under somebody else. And that's just the nature of what we do as players. That's the nature of the sport. Sometimes there's continuity, and sometimes there's change, and we'll roll with whatever happens.”Ream said Berhalter and the current leadership group had ended a period when there was a lack of unity between Major League Soccer players and those with European clubs.“First coming into the program my first few years in MLS, there definitely was that kind of feeling of not quite the togetherness between the two,” Ream said.___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

(AP) — Tobin Anderson is leaving NCAA Cinderella Fairleigh Dickinson after one fairy-tale season and replacing Rick Pitino at Iona.Iona athletic director Matt Glovaski announced the hiring on Tuesday, a day after Pitino left to take the job at St. John's of the Big East Conference.Anderson led the No. 16 seed Knights to a win over No. 1 Purdue in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament last week, only the second time a No. 16 seed has knocked off a top-seeded team. UMBC beat No. 1 Virginia in 2018.“Iona University represents everything my family and I were looking for in a school, a basketball program and a campus atmosphere,"" Anderson said in a statement. ""Our goal is to build upon the tremendous tradition of Iona basketball and elevate the program to greater heights.”Iona of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference was knocked out of this year's tournament by UConn on Friday.“We have long known him to be a fantastic coach and an even better person,"" Glovaski said. ""Now, with his team’s impressive run in the NCAA Tournament, everyone paying attention to March Madness also knows this. We’re delighted that he will be at the helm of our men’s basketball program.”Anderson led FDU to a 21-16 overall record and 10-6 in Northeast Conference play. The Knights lost to Merrimack in the conference title game but got the NCAA berth because Merrimack was ineligible to compete as a transitioning school from Division II.FDU, one of the shorter teams in the 68-team field, beat Texas Southern in a First Four game and followed that with the upset over Purdue. Florida Atlantic knocked the Knights out of the tournament on Sunday.FDU had a 4-22 record in 2021-22. Anderson was hired after running the program at St. Thomas Aquinas, located less than 25 miles (40 km) from Iona’s campus. In nine seasons, he turned the team into a perennial Top 25 program in Division II after inheriting a team that won just five games prior to his hire.Anderson got his first taste of Division I coaching, serving as an assistant at Siena for two seasons from 2011–2013. Before his time at Siena, Anderson was a head coach at the Division III level at Hamilton College and Clarkson University in upstate New York. He worked as an assistant at Clarkson and Le Moyne College.Anderson graduated from Wesleyan University in 1995.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842795,"Killing of Kurds in northern Syria sparks protests, tensions","JINDERIS, Syria (AP) — Thousands of Kurds took to the streets of the earthquake-ravaged Syrian town of Jinderis on Tuesday to protest the killing of four men as they lit a fire to celebrate the Kurdish new year the night before.The attack on the Kurdish men rekindled tensions between Turkish-backed armed groups controlling the area and Kurdish residents. It fed into a power struggle between rival armed factions that control different parts of northwest Syria.At the request of Kurdish residents, fighters from the armed opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham deployed en masse around Jinderis on Tuesday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, reported that the group had taken over the headquarters of the Ahrar Sharqiya group, a Turkish-backed armed opposition group, in the area.A HTS spokesperson declined to comment on the matter, but there was a heavy presence of the group’s fighters in and around the city as crowds of Kurds attended the funerals of the victims. Meanwhile, Turkish forces deployed on the road linking the town of Atmeh, controlled by HTS, with Jinderis.The assailants who shot the Kurdish men as they were lighting a fire in celebration of the Nowruz holiday allegedly belonged to Jaish al-Sharqiya, a splinter group of Ahrar Sharqiya.The Syrian National Army, an alliance of the various Turkish-backed factions in the area, issued a statement condemning the killing of the Kurdish men in “the strongest possible terms” and promising to bring the perpetrators to justice.Tuesday evening, an official with the Harakat al-Tahrir wa al-Binaa, a faction within the Syrian National Army, announced that the suspects in the killing had been arrested and promised that local authorities will “deal firmly and forcefully with all perpetrators of crimes and violations against innocent people.”Jinderis was controlled by Kurdish fighters until 2018 when it was taken by Turkey-backed opposition fighters who still hold it. The capture of the town displaced many Kurds, while those who remained complain that they are often mistreated and subjected to discrimination.““We call for an end to these violations and an end to the demographic change,” said Zakaria Ali, one of the Kurdish protesters. “All the Syrian people are our brothers, but criminals are not.”In the hours after the shooting, some Kurds from Jinderis traveled in a convoy to the town of Atmeh, about 9 miles (15 kilometers) away, where they called on HTS to seize control of Jinderis from the Turkish-backed militias.While Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. and other Western countries due to its historical ties with al-Qaida, many Kurdish residents of the area said they see it as preferable to the Turkish-backed groups.HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani met with a group of the victims’ families late Monday evening and promised revenge.“The ones who harmed you will be killed, God willing,” Golani told the group.Clashes between Turkey-backed opposition gunmen and Kurdish fighters have left scores of people dead on both sides in Syria.Since 2016, Turkey has launched three major operations inside Syria, targeting Syria’s main Kurdish militia — the People’s Protection Units or YPG — which Turkey considers a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. The PKK has for decades waged an insurgency within Turkey against the government in Ankara.The YPG, however, forms the backbone of U.S.-led forces in the fight against Islamic State militants and has been a top U.S. ally in Syria.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842796,Review: Depeche Mode face down the abyss in 'Memento Mori',"“Memento Mori"" by Depeche Mode (Columbia Records) And then there were only two. Depeche Mode have always been a genre unto itself: a vibe, a sort of feedback loop that is timeless yet nostalgic, dark, edgy, a little too dark sometimes but always so cool. Their 15th studio album titled “Memento Mori” (Latin for ""remember you will die"") feels both like a tribute to founding member and keyboardist Andy Fletcher who died in May 2022 and left them a duo (Dave Gahan and Martin Gore) and a mission statement of their music.The 12 tracks are fully Depeche, fully intoxicating in sound, artistically evocative and sometimes puzzling (like the compelling but strange “Caroline’s Monkey”). The music is staring lovingly into the abyss and asking it to love it back; death is always hovering on the periphery of the sound, a grunge, industrial, rainy sound also filled with a strange kindness.“Soul with Me” is an incredible ballad, while “Before We Drown” is an electro sexy tune, while “My Cosmos Is Mine” has a dramatic tempo to it that works. “Ghost Again” hooks you with its deep fry bass and “People are Good” engages the aural with an unusual vibrato.Depeche Mode might be facing their own mortality but their power as musicians stretches into infinity.___In a music review published March 21, 2023, about Depeche Mode’s new album, The Associated Press erroneously reported the name of the singer on the song “Soul with Me.” The singer was Martin Gore, not Dave Gahan.___https://apnews.com/hub/music-reviews",2023/03/25,,World

Kylian ticks all the boxes to take on this responsibility, given what he does and will continue to do on the field,"" Deschamps told Téléfoot. “And because he's a unifying link between the youngest, the not so young and the oldest players. That's why I made this choice but it's not to the detriment of Antoine, because Antoine will also have an important responsibility.""Griezmann, who turned 32 on Tuesday, has played 117 games for France and the forward is regarded as being very close to Deschamps.The 24-year-old Mbappé will captain France against the Netherlands at Stade de France on Friday when qualifying starts for next year's European Championship. France then plays Ireland in Dublin on Monday.Mbappé scored eight goals at last year's World Cup in Qatar, where he became only the second player to score a hat trick in the final, taking his tally to 36 goals in 66 matches for Les Bleus of which 12 have been scored in World Cups. France lost on penalty kicks to Lionel Messi's Argentina in Qatar following a wild 3-3 draw.This season, Mbappé became French champion Paris Saint-Germain's all-time leading scorer after overtaking Edinson Cavani and has 202 goals for the club in 250 games.Lloris and central defender Raphaël Varane, who won the 2018 World Cup alongside Mbappé, announced their retirements from international play after France lost the 2022 final.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842798,Keselowski finally seeing results from long rebuild at RFK,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — One of the best things to happen to rebranded RFK Racing came exactly one year ago when NASCAR found an illegal part on Brad Keselowski’s car.The illegal modification was found following just the fifth race of Keselowski's first season as part owner of the once-proud organization founded by Jack Roush. The ensuing penalty was crippling and essentially ended Keselowski's championship chances with 31 races remaining in the season.Deep down, Keselowski recognized RFK wasn't good enough for the 2012 Cup champion to continue his run of eight consecutive playoff appearances. The penalty was the wakeup call the entire organization needed to make a massive cultural shift.“We deserved that penalty, and that penalty made us better,” Keselowski told The Associated Press. “It challenged everybody within the company to recognize ‘Hey, we can’t keep doing business the way we we're doing it. We're not getting results and now we've got all this drama to deal with.'“I look back at it now 12 months later and think ‘That was the best thing that happened to us.’ It forced us to to change how we act, forced people to straighten up, forced us to look internally rather than externally at our problems and really fix them. We've changed a lot of the way we do business as a company because of that.”And so a full year later, Keselowski nearly found himself in victory lane Sunday at Atlanta Motor Speedway. He was passed on the final lap by former Team Penske teammate Joey Logano for the win and settled for second — his best finish in 46 races dating back to his final days with Penske in 2021. His last victory was with Penske on April 25, 2021 at Talladega.The progress has been slow but building since Keselowski entered the organization founded by Roush and formerly known as Roush Fenway Racing. Chris Buescher won at Bristol last September to end a 223-race losing streak for the organization, and the speed in the RFK Fords had dramatically improved by the end of the year.But then came the season-opening exhibition race at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in February and, after what Keselowski thought was “an amazing offseason for our organization,” neither he nor Buescher advanced into the main event. Both RFK drivers were relegated to spectators at a NASCAR showcase event.“That was an event where leadership probably got a lift from the rank and file,” Steve Newmark, President of RFK, told AP. “When we got back to the shop, the people were unfazed by it. I was despondent. But the folks here were like, ‘That race is an aberration, it’s unique, and we missed it. But we had so much speed the second half of the season, we have continued to build on that, we have integrated new tools.' So there was still positive vibes across the board, despite the pockets of us who were really upset.”Since missing the Clash, RFK has shown a notable pickup in performance.Keselowski, who led laps in only six races last year, has led laps in all five races so far this season and scored stage points in eight of 10 stages. He heads to Circuit of the Americas in Austin this weekend ranked fifth in the Cup standings.Buescher has led in two races and has run 62.4% of the laps this season inside the top 15 compared to 39.9% last year. He's 13th in the standings and a solid contender to win Sunday on the first road course race of the season.“I'm not ashamed to say that Chris is a better road racer than I am,” Keselowski said. “He absolutely has a shot to win this week.”There have also been fundamental changes inside the physical race shop, where after 12 years of racing for perfectionist Roger Penske, Keselowski wanted immediate change. First it was fresh paint. Some 16 months later, Keselowski says the building has undergone “a complete digital transformation.”“When I walked in for the first time, it looked like a relic to the 1970s. It was dark. It was dingy. You couldn't find a computer. There were coffee pots next to parts,” Keselowski told AP. “I said ‘Oh my gosh, we’re not doing things like this anymore. We have gutted every single area in that building and redone it to reflect both a digital transformation and a cultural transformation.”To illustrate his point, Keselowski on Tuesday texted AP an essay called “The Fourth Industrial Revolution” that explains how technology has grown from the 1st revolution of “mechanization, steam and water power” to the 4th revolution of “cyber physical systems.”RFK has also overhauled its marketing and business development approaches which has led to expanded partnerships with Castrol and King’s Hawaiian, as well as renewals with sponsors Fastenal, Fifth Third Bank and Wyndham Rewards. RFK has this year added new partners Esperion Therapeutics, Solomon Plumbing, Solo Stove, Pala Casino and Elk Grove Village.Keselowski expects at least one of the two RFK Fords to make the playoffs this year, but also believes both he and Buescher will win races and return Roush's organization to a contender. It's why he left the comforts of Penske to take on a larger role with another team — even if it meant there would be a long rebuilding process.“I wouldn't say I ever had regrets, but there was some self-doubt last year and a lot of whining,” Keselowski said. “But I'll tell you what, my wife can keep me humble. Everytime I'd whine about how things were going, she reminded me, ‘You picked this. This is what you wanted.’ And she's right.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842799,"Willis Reed, leader on Knicks' 2 title teams, dies at 80","NEW YORK (AP) — Willis Reed, who dramatically emerged from the locker room minutes before Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals to spark the New York Knicks to their first championship and create one of sports’ most enduring examples of playing through pain, died Tuesday. He was 80.Reed's death was announced by the National Basketball Retired Players Association, which confirmed it through his family. The cause was not released, but Reed had been in poor health recently and was unable to travel to New York when the Knicks honored the 50th anniversary of their 1973 NBA championship team during their game against New Orleans on Feb. 25.The Knicks tweeted a photograph picturing Reed from behind walking onto the floor as his teammates were warming up for the 1970 finale, one of the most memorable moments in NBA and Madison Square Garden history.“As we mourn, we will always strive to uphold the standards he left behind — the unmatched leadership, sacrifice and work ethic that personified him as a champion among champions,” the team said. “His is a legacy that will live forever.”Nicknamed “The Captain,” Reed was the undersized center and emotional leader on the Knicks’ two NBA championship teams, with a soft shooting touch from the outside and a toughness to tussle with the era’s superstar big men on the inside.He was remembered Tuesday perhaps more for the manner he led the Knicks than how superbly he played for them.“Willis Reed was the ultimate team player and consummate leader. My earliest and fondest memories of NBA basketball are of watching Willis, who embodied the winning spirit that defined the New York Knicks’ championship teams in the early 1970s,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. “He played the game with remarkable passion and determination, and his inspiring comeback in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals remains one of the most iconic moments in all of sports.”Reed's accomplishments — seven All-Star selections, two NBA Finals MVP awards among them — would have warranted Hall of Fame induction by themselves. During the 1969-70 season, he became the first player to sweep the MVP awards for the regular season, All-Star Game and NBA Finals.But his spot in history was secured simply by walking onto the floor on the final night of that season.Reed had injured a thigh muscle in Game 5 of the series between the Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers, tumbling to the court in pain. He sat out Game 6 as counterpart Wilt Chamberlain had 45 points and 27 rebounds in a Lakers romp that forced a deciding game at Madison Square Garden.Reed’s status was unknown even to his Knicks teammates as he continued getting treatment until shortly before Game 7. Both teams were warming up when Reed came out of the tunnel, fans rising and roaring when they saw him emerge from the tunnel leading to the locker room.“And here comes Willis and the crowd is going wild,” radio announcer Marv Albert said.The Lakers stopped to watch Reed, who made two quick jump shots in the early minutes of the game, running back down the court after both with a noticeable limp. He wouldn’t score again but the Knicks didn’t need it, with their captain’s return and Walt Frazier’s 36 points and 19 assists energizing them to a 113-99 romp and their first NBA title.Frazier’s performance was one of the finest ever in a deciding game, but it was forever a footnote to Reed’s return. In 2006, to coincide with the NBA’s 60th anniversary, it finished third in voting of the league’s 60 greatest playoff moments, behind Michael Jordan’s championship-winning jumper for his sixth title in 1998 and Magic Johnson ending his rookie season by filling in for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at center in Game 6 of the 1980 finals to lead the Lakers to a championship.Long afterward, a player’s return from injury has sometimes compared to Reed, such as when Boston’s Paul Pierce was carried off the floor with a knee injury in Game 1 of the 2008 NBA Finals against Los Angeles before quickly returning. But Phil Jackson, a teammate of Reed’s and then Lakers coach, dismissed that because of how serious Reed’s injury was.“If I’m not mistaken, I think Willis Reed missed a whole half and three-quarters almost of a game and literally had to have a shot — a horse shot, three or four of them — in his thigh to come back out and play,” Jackson said.Reed wouldn’t be able to recover so quickly from injuries in the coming years. He was limited to just 11 games in 1971-72 but came back strong the next season to spark the Knicks to a second title in what was his last full season.Though his return always made the ‘70 title the more celebrated one, it was the ’72-73 squad, having been fortified by Hall of Famers Earl Monroe and Jerry Lucas, that stood out to Reed.“That, to me, in my mind was the best team,” he said during its 40th anniversary celebration.Reed would play only 19 games in 1973-74 before retiring because of a knee injury after just 10 seasons.That was long enough to collect more than 12,000 points and 8,400 rebounds, both of which still rank in the top three on the Knicks’ career lists.He had a successful post-playing career as a coach and executive, with 76ers coach Doc Rivers recalling playing for Atlanta when Reed was an assistant coach.“He was simply a great person, A man!!! A leader!!! A Winner!!!” Rivers tweeted.Willis Reed was born June 25, 1942, in Hico, Louisiana. He stayed in his home state for his college career, leading Grambling State to the 1961 NAIA championship and a third-place finish in 1963. The school retired his number and named its court after Reed in 2022.A second-round pick in 1964, he quickly proved that standing only 6-foot-9 wouldn’t keep him from becoming one of the league’s top centers. He was voted Rookie of the Year and earned the first of his seven straight All-Star selections.Reed was the anchor as the Knicks became one of the best teams in the NBA, with Hall of Famers such as Frazier, Bill Bradley and Dave DeBusschere.Reed provided them with 18.7 points and 12.9 rebounds for his career, along with plenty of toughness. An ESPN documentary in 2014 on those Knicks showed footage of a 1966 fight in a game against the Lakers in which Reed appeared to throw punches at multiple opponents, with Jackson noting that it appeared Reed “decimated this team.”His No. 19 was the first number retired by the Knicks and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in 1982.Reed went on to coach the Knicks to a playoff berth in 1977-78 but coached them only 14 more games the following season. He also was a head coach at Creighton and the New Jersey Nets, but his greatest success after his playing career came in the front office.He was their senior vice president of basketball operations when they drafted Derrick Coleman and Kenny Anderson, who became All-Stars and led the Nets to the playoffs in the 1990s.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842800,Puzzling highway death part of West Virginia police probe,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A sweeping investigation into misconduct at the West Virginia State Police has brought new scrutiny to the mysterious roadside death of a man who was hit by a trooper’s Taser during a struggle with the officer that the governor labeled “very very concerning” in ordering a major shakeup of the agency.The death of Edmond Exline last month had received scant attention until Gov. Jim Justice cited it Monday as one of several alarming incidents involving State Police troopers. In one instance, a video camera secretly recorded women in their locker room. In another, a trooper allegedly stole an envelope of cash from a gambler at a casino. Justice accepted the resignation of the agency's superintendent and named an interim chief.On Tuesday, a police official provided new details about Exline’s death, including a trooper's use of a Taser on him along Interstate 81 near Martinsburg.A State Police news release cited by news outlets at the time said Exline was walking along the interstate when he got in a “struggle” with troopers, became unresponsive and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.State Police Capt. Eric Burnett in Charles Town confirmed the Taser's use on Exline, 45, of Hagerstown, Maryland, who died at a hospital after the Feb. 12 incident.“He ran into traffic and wouldn’t listen to any commands from the trooper,” Burnett said. “That’s something I probably don’t want to get into right now. I don’t want to get too far into this because we’re still doing a full investigation into it and I don’t want to taint anything.”Exline’s cause of death hasn’t been released. It’s unclear whether he was having a medical or other type of episode, and Burnett said his office has not received the results of an autopsy and blood analysis. Three troopers remain on paid administrative leave as investigations continue, he said.Still unanswered was why Exline was on the interstate, including whether he had been in a vehicle.“I guess the best thing for me to say is I don’t want to cast judgment on this guy,” Burnett said. “The best thing for someone to do once it comes out, and it’s going to come out, is to view the video and people can make their own determination as to how he was acting. I don’t want to speculate on anything.”State Police on Tuesday denied a request by The Associated Press to review the video, citing the ongoing investigation.In announcing the “all-out investigation” of State Police, Justice said he watched the police video of the Exline encounter and that it was “very, very concerning.” Justice said after appointing Jack Chambers, deputy director of the Capitol police, as the interim State Police superintendent in place of Jan Cahill that Exline’s death would be part of the overall review.Troopers from the same Eastern Panhandle county where Exline died were involved in a November 2018 incident that Justice previously said “cast a dark shadow” on law enforcement.A police dashcam video showed an officer kicking and punching a handcuffed teenage boy on the ground and kneeling on his shoulder during a traffic stop. State Police said the teen was involved in a crash with a sheriff’s cruiser before a pursuit ensued, his vehicle crashing again before he was apprehended. Two troopers were fired before one of them won his job back. Two sheriff’s deputies also were fired and later reinstated.The governor said that besides Exline's death, Chambers also will look into allegations that a State Police employee hid a video camera in the women’s locker room at a State Police facility in Kanawha County and that money was stolen by a trooper from a man at a casino in a Charleston suburb.“We need to clean up our own houses when we have a problem,” Justice said. “It’s a bad day. It’s been a bad day ever since people started coming out with allegations. And the more we dug, the worse it stunk.”Justice did not specify when the lockerroom situation occurred but indicated it was several years ago, perhaps before Cahill took over, and that the employee involved has since died.Justice said three troopers eventually found a thumb drive “and from that they found the video.” At least one of the troopers “jerked the thumb drive out, threw it to the floor and started stomping on it,"" destroying the evidence.Justice acknowledged that “maybe we won’t be able to recover much information. Maybe many troopers are long gone. Maybe there’s no way to recover evidence. But we ought to try, because we’re better than this.”In the casino incident, a man was playing a video machine with a trooper close by, Justice said. As the man got up to go to the restroom, an envelope with him fell out of his seat. The trooper picked up the envelope and kept the money inside.The governor said State Police should have immediately begun a investigation, but “we didn’t do that.” The governor did not specify whether the trooper was disciplined.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842801,March Madness allows Vols to showcase SEC's rugged style,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee coach Rick Barnes once took a team to watch a rugby match in Australia and loved what he saw.Despite what Florida Atlantic coach Dusty May says, that sport isn't the Tennessee coach's guide for the rugged style his Volunteers bring to the basketball court.“I think playing good, hard basketball, it’s something nice to look at,” Barnes said Monday when asked about a comment from the coach of Tennessee's opponent Thursday night at New York 's Madison Square Garden in a East Region semifinal.May took a swipe at the brawny Volunteers after ninth-seeded Florida Atlantic knocked off Farleigh Dickinson on Sunday night to advance to the first Sweet 16 in the Conference USA program's history.“We’re going to study Australian rugby rules and get ready for the Vols,” May said when asked about preparing for Tennessee.Well, the fourth-seeded Vols (25-10) do play in the physically punishing Southeastern Conference. They advanced to their ninth Sweet 16 all time by leaving one of college basketball's bluebloods just black and blue and yes, even a little bloodied beating up No. 5 seed Duke 65-52.Duke tied its fewest points ever scored in its lengthy NCAA Tournament resume, and 7-footer Kyle Filipowski was hit by an elbow to his face that left him with a small cut under his eye.This wasn't a case of March badness on the part of the Volunteers. It's simply the difference of being an SEC team where size really does mean more. And all of these Vols are tall, strong with a lot of length that allows them to show off all those muscles.With point guard Zakai Zeigler out with a torn ACL, no Vol available is shorter than 6-foot-1. Guard Santiago Vescovi is the smallest starter at 6-3 and 191 pounds as Tennessee fills the court up to big man Uros Plavsic at 7-1 and 265 pounds.FAU has its own 7-1 post player in Vladislav Goldin from Russia, but he spots Plavsic 25 pounds.Asked Monday if he had gotten a call from Tennessee coach Josh Heupel yet about joining the football team, Plavsic had a quick answer after finishing with more fouls (four) than rebounds (three) or points (zero) against Duke.“Surprisingly not,” Plavsic said. ""I was waiting for one, but maybe he wants to see some more.”Yet Tennessee finished with fewer fouls (11) than Duke (17) for all of the Vols' punishing play. Barnes said it was just teams playing hard.“I’m on the rules committee, and the referees did what they thought was right,"" Barnes said. ""And I thought they officiated the game the way they felt it went. But from my perspective, I didn’t see anything dirty from either team.”Tennessee averages 16.5 fouls per game, putting the Vols in the middle of the SEC where Arkansas, another Sweet 16-bound team, is tied for the league high in averaging 19.3 fouls a game.For the record, FAU (33-3) averages 15.7 fouls a game.Barnes defended his Volunteers for working and playing hard. He wants them running fast up the court and bulling their way through screens to score.On defense, Barnes doesn't want them giving up shots. Defending well also means blocking out for the rebound on missed shots. That literally means physically leaning and pushing an opponent for the best position to grab the ball.Does that translate to playing a burly, bullying style? Barnes sure doesn't want his Vols helping opponents parade to the free throw line.“But we are an older, stronger team, big guys. so you’d have to define physicality in terms of how do we use it ...,” Barnes said. ""We’re going to try to play as hard as we can play. If that’s being physical, I guess we’re going to be physical.”Call it mucking up a beautiful game or dragging an opponent down into the mud. That's exactly where these experienced Vols feel most comfortable.Tennessee allowed an average of 53.5 points through its first two NCAA Tournament games. The Vols lead the nation holding opponents to 26.4% shooting from 3-point range and are third in the country in both scoring defense (57.8 points) and field-goal defense (37.2%) allowed per game.Only five teams have even reached 70 points against Tennessee.“Our physicality and our toughness is something that bring people down to the mud,” Plavsic said. ""And once you get in there, it’s not easy to get out of it. And I really think that we are looking forward and trying to put all those things to bring going down to the mud and see how they can handle it.”___More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842802,Mallorca bans fan who racially insulted Vinícius Júnior,"MADRID (AP) — Spanish club Mallorca handed the fan who racially insulted players Vinícius Júnior and Samu Chukwueze a three-year ban from club membership on Tuesday.The fan, reportedly a 20-year-old Mallorca season ticket holder, is accused of calling Real Madrid forward Vinícius and Villarreal midfielder Chukwueze a monkey in separate Spanish league games this year. Both Vinicius and Chukwueze are Black.Spain’s anti-violence commission has already proposed a fine of 4,000 euros ($4,300) and a 12-month ban from stadiums for the fan, who may also face criminal charges. He was identified by club security officials.“RCD Mallorca is against all xenophobic manifestations and will continue to work actively to eradicate this scourge,” said the club, whose president is American Andy Kohlberg.Vinícius was also insulted after the Mallorca match when he stopped to pose for photos and sign autographs for fans.The Brazilian has been subjected to insults since arriving in Spain five years ago, though little has been done to punish fans.Valladolid recently suspended 12 season ticket holders while investigating their alleged verbal abuse of Vinícius.The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams a few years ago.The Spanish league has filed several complaints to authorities for racist insults or chants against Vinícius, with some of them being shelved by prosecutors.The league has also increased the number of overseers at matches to try to identify perpetrators, especially when Vinícius plays.Authorities have yet to find those responsible for hanging Vinícius’ effigy from a bridge in Madrid before the derby against Atletico Madrid earlier this year.The attacks against Vinícius increased after he began celebrating his goals by dancing.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842803,Georgia senators send gender care restrictions to governor,"ATLANTA (AP) — A bill banning most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies in Georgia for transgender people under 18 is headed to Gov. Brian Kemp's desk after senators gave it final passage on Tuesday.Senators voted 31-21 along party lines with Republicans pushing through Senate Bill 140, despite impassioned pleas from Democrats and LGBTQ advocates against what has become the most fiercely contested bill of Georgia's 2023 legislative sessionIt’s part of a nationwide effort by conservatives to restrict transgender athletes, gender-affirming care and drag shows. Governors in Mississippi, Utah and South Dakota have signed similar bills. Missouri's Senate on Tuesday advanced a pair of bills to prohibit gender transitioning health care treatments for minors and restrict them from competing in sports.Andrew Isenhour, a spokesperson for Kemp, wouldn't say if the Republican governor would sign the bill into law. Opponents said they believe the bill would be an unconstitutional infringement on parents' rights and the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia threatened Tuesday to sue if the bill becomes law. Judges have at least temporarily blocked laws limiting the treatment of transgender youth in Arkansas and Alabama.Doctors could still be able to prescribe medicines to block puberty under the Georgia bill, but Republicans say restrictions on other treatments are needed to prevent children from making decisions they will regret later.“I think we have struck a good balance here,"" said Republican Sen. Ben Watson, a Savannah physician who helped draft the measure. “What we’re doing is preventing minors, who are under 18 years old, from having irreversible changes in their lives.”But opponents say the measure is founded on disinformation and a desire to open a new front in the culture war to please conservative Republican voters, arguing that it attacks vulnerable children and intrudes on private medical decisions.“Broadly speaking this really is about us bullying children to score political points, and that to me is extraordinarily disheartening,"" said Sen. Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat and the Senate's first-ever openly gay member.The Senate had to vote again on the bill after approving it earlier because the House amended it to remove a clause that specifically shielded physicians from criminal and civil liability. That change had been pushed for by conservative groups who want people who later regret their treatment to be able to sue their doctor, although it's unclear how large that group might be.Opponents said the measure would hurt transgender children and require physicians to violate medical standards of care. They also accused Republicans of being hypocrites by abandoning previous advocacy of parents' rights to make choices.“The rule does seem to be that we are for parental rights when parents make decisions we agree with, and when they make decisions we don’t agree with, we outlaw them,"" said Sen. Elena Parent, an Atlanta Democrat.Opponents criticized Republicans for not listening to heavy lobbying in recent weeks from transgender youth and their parents, saying they were further marginalizing a group already prone to taking their own lives at disturbingly high rates.“We will go back to our corners and keep doing the same crap we always do when there is a divisive, partisan culture war issue at issue,” said Sen. Josh McLaurin, an Atlanta Democrat. ""And in the meantime, kids will die. Kids will commit suicide. Kids will feel they’re not being heard, that their basic existence is being invalidated, erased.”Republicans denied that they wished anyone harm, saying they had the best interest of children at heart, and wanted people to be able to obtain counseling.“I look forward to looking people straight in the eye and telling them that I am compassionate to their plea and I understand their passion, but we're doing the right thing by protecting children,” said Sen. Carden Summers, the Cordele Republican who sponsored the bill.___Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy.",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842814,Morant apologizes again after NBA suspension for mistakes,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Memphis star guard Ja Morant says he obviously made a terrible decision and many mistakes.The two-time All-Star apologized again Tuesday.“I’m completely sorry for that,” Morant said after practice, speaking publicly for the first time since concluding his eight-game suspension by the NBA. “So, you know, my job now is, like I said, to be more responsible, more smarter, and don’t cause any of that no more.”The next question is when Morant is back on the floor for the Grizzlies. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said he anticipates Morant playing in the Grizzlies next game — Wednesday night against Houston. Morant said his status is ""still in the air.""“Once I feel like I'm back in rhythm and in good condition to go back out there, I'll be back out there,"" Morant said.The NBA suspended Morant eight games for brandishing a gun in a social media video post at a Denver-area strip club on March 4. The eighth game was Saturday's win over the Golden State Warriors.Morant had been in counseling at a Florida facility while he served his suspension.With an unusual number of reporters surrounding him Tuesday and microphones near his face, the 6-foot-3 guard said he “never had an alcohol problem.” He also plans to abandon social media and let his actions speak for him.Asked if two weeks was enough to clear up his problems, Morant replied it is an “ongoing process.”“I went there to counseling to learn how to manage stress,"" Morant said. ""Cope with stress in a positive way, instead of ways I've tried to deal with it before that caused me to make mistakes.”Morant, who signed a five-year supermax contract with Memphis last summer, said he's focused on growing as a leader as his stardom rises and he continues to garner business deals such as his own Ja1 shoe for Nike.He was on the bench in street clothes Monday night when Memphis beat Dallas 112-108 with the Grizzlies giving him time to condition himself after two weeks away.During his absence, Memphis went 6-3 and returned to the second spot in the Western Conference just 3 1/2 games behind Denver.Forward Dillon Brooks said Morant — seeing how the team has played recently — offered to come off the bench when he returns.Brooks vehemently rejected that suggestion.“I said; ‘Hell, no.’ You’re too good of a player,"" Brooks said of the conversation. “You’re the engine of this team, and I’m going to need you out there getting reps and getting acclimated to who you are as that third quarter, fourth quarter closer.”That's the consensus in the Memphis locker room, including Tyus Jones, who replaced Morant at point guard. They don't see the Grizzlies' leading scorer needing to do anything to win back the trust of his teammates. Morant ranks ninth in the NBA still averaging 27.1 points per game.""We’re looking forward to getting him back on the court, not necessarily putting the past behind us, but learning from the past and continuing to improve moving forward — for him, for this team,"" Jones said.When Morant came to the Grizzlies bench just before the tipoff of Monday's game, the Memphis faithful gave him a standing ovation, a cheer that built as fans recognized him emerging from the tunnel from the locker room. Brooks said that shows what Morant means to the team and the city.“He’s the one who really put this city on the map,” Brooks said. ""We were a low-market team just roaming around the NBA. Now, we’re one of the most talked-about teams in the NBA. We have a pride and a chip on our shoulder every single game.“He doesn’t have to prove nothing to us.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

LOUIS (AP) — A Missouri man dubbed the “Package Killer” for his method of disposing bodies received two life sentences Tuesday after admitting to killing two women in the St. Louis area more than 30 years ago.Gary Muehlberg, 74, has now pleaded guilty to killing three women and faces a hearing next week in the death of a fourth. Remains of all four women were found in 1990 or 1991, packed into various types of containers.Muehlberg was already in prison for killing a man in 1993 when he was charged last year with four counts of fist-degree murder in the women's death. The cases were solved after O'Fallon Detective Jodi Weber found DNA evidence while examining old, unsolved homicides. Muehlberg confessed after prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty.He pleaded guilty Tuesday to murdering Brenda Pruitt and Donna Reitmeyer. The new life sentences will run concurrently with two other life sentences he was previously given.Pruitt was 27 when her family reported her missing on May 9, 1990. Her body was found in October 1991 inside a plastic trash can on the side of a busy road in St. Louis County. Authorities said she had been smothered or strangled.Reitmeyer’s body was found June 11, 1990, inside a trash can on a sidewalk in the city of St. Louis. She was a 40-year-old mother of three daughters.On March 6, Muehlberg admitted to murdering 21-year-old Sandy Little, whose body was found inside a dresser abandoned along a highway in O'Fallon on Feb. 17, 1991.A hearing is scheduled for March 31 in the death of 18-year-old Robyn Mihan. Her body was found between two mattresses secured together with wire along a road near the small rural Missouri town of Silex on March 26, 1990.Court documents say Muehlberg also admitted to killing a fifth woman at his home and disposing of her body in a metal barrel he left near a self-service car wash. Her remains were never found.A motive for the killings has not been disclosed.",2023/03/22,,World

They are also charged in connection with the October 2019 death of Chad Daybell’s late wife, Tammy Daybell.Prosecutors were seeking the death penalty for both defendants, but Vallow Daybell's attorneys said it should be taken off the table in her case because they will not have time to fully review a large amount of evidence that was turned over in recent weeks.During a Tuesday morning hearing, 7th District Judge Steven Boyce agreed. He noted that Vallow Daybell has not waived her right to a speedy trial, so the proceeding could not be rescheduled to give her defense team ample time to review the evidence.The death penalty still applies to Chad Daybell's case, however.Prosecutors say the couple used doomsday-focused religious beliefs to further a plan to kill the kids and Tammy Daybell, and that it was part of a plot to steal social security funds and insurance money.Idaho law enforcement officers started investigating the couple in November 2019 after extended family members reported that the children were missing. During that period, police say the couple lied about the children’s whereabouts. Their bodies were found buried later on Chad Daybell’s property in rural Idaho.The couple married just two weeks after Chad Daybell’s previous wife, Tammy Daybell, died unexpectedly. Tammy Daybell’s death was initially reported as due to natural causes, but investigators had her body exhumed after growing suspicious when Chad Daybell quickly remarried.Vallow Daybell is separately charged with conspiracy to commit murder in Arizona in connection with the July 2019 death of her previous husband, Charles Vallow.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842818,Ukrainian soldiers near finish of Patriot missile training,"FORT SILL, Okla. (AP) — Several large, 12-wheeled military vehicles carrying mobile missile launchers rumbled across the southwest Oklahoma prairie on Tuesday as part of a training exercise at the Fort Sill Army Post.Spilling out of the sand-colored vehicles and quickly setting up the launchers were some of the 65 Ukrainian soldiers who have been training at the installation since January on how to use the defensive missile system to track and shoot down enemy aircraft. U.S. military officials invited journalists from across the country and Europe, including The Associated Press, to watch the soldiers train.The Patriot missile system, which hasn't yet been deployed in Ukraine, is particularly useful for defending population centers and critical infrastructure, said Brig. Gen. Shane Morgan, Fort Sill's commanding general.The soldiers are expected to leave Oklahoma in the next several days for additional training in Europe before they deploy to Ukraine with a Patriot missile battery that typically includes six mobile launchers, a mobile radar, a power generator and an engagement control center.Military officials did not provide an exact timeline for when the missile battery will deploy to Ukraine. But a Pentagon spokesman said it will be quicker than initially planned.“For operation security reasons, I’m not going to get into delivery timelines other than to say we’re confident that we’ll be able to get the Patriots there on an expedited timeline, I’ll just leave it at that,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday.Col. Martin O’Donnell, a U.S. Army spokesman based in Germany, said the newly trained Ukrainian troops will “marry up with other Ukrainian air defenders"" in Europe with donated Patriot equipment from the U.S., Netherlands and Germany before deploying to Ukraine “in the coming weeks.”Although Army officials acknowledge they faced initial challenges overcoming a language barrier, Morgan said the Ukrainian soldiers learned quickly and were handpicked because of their air defense experience.“Our assessment is that the Ukrainian soldiers are impressive and absolutely a quick study due to their extensive air defense knowledge and experience in a combat zone,” Morgan said. “It was easier, though never easy, for them to grasp the Patriot system's operation and maintenance concepts.”The training of the Ukrainian soldiers is part of a larger international effort involving more than 50 countries who are providing security assistance to Ukraine, O'Donnell added.U.S. Army soldiers at Fort Sill who trained the Ukrainians said they were surprised how quickly the visiting soldiers grasped the concepts and learned how to operate the equipment. Many of the soldiers had previous experience using the older Soviet-made S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile system.One trainer, who the AP agreed not to identify by name for security purposes, said he learned how resourceful the Ukrainians were when one of the vehicles developed a coolant leak during the early days of training. Repairs that would normally require submitting a formal request and waiting several days were instead completed in about 20 minutes.“It shows their ability to adapt to a situation,” the trainer said. “In Ukraine, they won't have days. They may just have minutes.”Although the Ukrainian soldiers were confined to the military installation during their 10-week training program, they were afforded the same privileges as other visiting soldiers, including access to shops, recreation and restaurants on the installation. They particularly enjoyed eating tacos from a Taco Bell on the post, one trainer said.“A lot of them have never had tacos before,” he said.But a deadly seriousness underscored the Ukrainians' visit to Fort Sill that was evident when they held a memorial vigil on the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion, another trainer said.“That was the hardest part for me,” he said. “Several of them have lost loved ones in the war.”___This story has been corrected to indicate Ukrainian troops are deploying to Europe, not Germany.___Associated Press reporter Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842819,Doctors question aspects of Missouri transgender care limits,"Missouri’s attorney general has said he will issue an emergency regulation that at least temporarily puts strict limits on transgender medical treatment for youth. The planned rule comes as legislators in that state and many others seek bans or other restrictions on the treatment.Doctors and advocates for the transgender community contend the planned rule contains misleading or incorrect information straight from the playbook of anti-trans activists. Here’s a look at what the rule does and what's behind some of its assertions.WHAT DOES THE MISSOURI EMERGENCY RULE DO?Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s rule will target treatment for gender-questioning children, which typically begins with puberty-blocking drugs to temporarily pause sexual development. They are offered early in puberty, sometimes before the age of 10. Sex hormones — estrogen or testosterone — are offered next, generally in the teen years, allowing transgender boys and girls to physically transition. Some older teens choose to have transgender surgeries.Bailey’s rule had not been formally filed as of Tuesday, but his office issued a press release outlining what he called “guardrails” for the treatments. The rule will require an 18-month waiting period, 15 one-hour therapy sessions and treatment of any mental illnesses before Missouri doctors can provide that kind of care to transgender children, according to the release. It also requires disclosure of information about puberty blocker drugs.ARE DRUGS TO TREAT GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER EXPERIMENTAL?In the press release about the new rule, the attorney general's office says patients must be told that using puberty blocker drugs or hormones to treat gender identity disorder is “experimental” and not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The FDA approved puberty blockers 30 years ago to treat children with precocious puberty — a condition that causes sexual development to begin much earlier than usual. Sex hormones — synthetic forms of estrogen and testosterone — were approved decades ago to treat hormone disorders or as birth control pills.The FDA has not approved the medications specifically to treat gender-questioning youth, but they have been used for many years for that purpose “off label,"" a common and accepted practice for many medical conditions. Doctors who treat trans patients say those decades of use are proof the treatments are not experimental.ARE DRUGS TO TREAT GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER RISKY?The press release says patients must also be told the FDA issued a warning that puberty blockers can lead to blindness and brain swelling.In April 2022, the FDA added a warning to labeling for puberty blockers based on several reports of a condition called pseudotumor cerebri, which can cause pressure and swelling inside the skull.The FDA said the condition was found in six patients aged 5 to 12 years. Five of the girls were using the drugs for early-onset puberty. The sixth was using the drugs for transgender care. Their symptoms — including headaches, optic nerve swelling, blurred vision or vision loss — resolved or were resolving in at least four of the patients, the warning announcement said.The FDA said there were too few cases to estimate how common the condition was in youth using puberty blockers and it did not move to limit their use.Patients also must be told that Sweden’s National Board of Health and Welfare has declared that the risks of puberty blockers and sex hormones for gender-questioning youth “outweigh the possible benefits,” according to Bailey's press release. The Swedish agency did make that declaration last year, saying that the treatment in youth should be reserved for “exceptional cases,” citing what it said was a lack of strong evidence on effectiveness and safety, and concerns about young patients changing their minds about transitioning.HOW COMMON IS DETRANSITIONING?Evidence suggests detransitioning is not as common as opponents of transgender medical treatment for youth contend, though the few studies that exist have weaknesses.The release says that the Endocrine Society, which represents specialists who treat hormone conditions, found that about 85% of young children diagnosed with gender dysphoria grow out of it by their teens. The society does make that statement in its guidelines for transgender treatment and recommends against starting puberty blockers before puberty. But a spokesperson said the society opposes using the guidelines to discourage care.And experts say evidence shows that detransitioning is uncommon in older children who begin treatment after puberty has begun, following recommendations from the society and other medical groups.Bailey's release says treatment should be denied unless doctors ensure at least annually that “social contagion” has not influenced a patient’s gender identity. It says one study “notes that an individual whose friend identifies as transgender is “more than 70 times” as likely to similarly identify as transgender.""That appears to be a reference to a widely criticized 2018 study that suggested transgender identities among teens could be contagious. The study was based on surveys of a selective group of parents who opposed their children’s gender identities, skewing the results.WHAT DO THE MISSOURI GUIDELINES SAY ABOUT COUNSELING?Medical associations recommend psychological counseling for gender-questioning youth before starting any treatment. The Missouri regulation says that should consist of at least 15 hours over at least 18 months, the release says.Critics say that recommendation is prescriptive and arbitrary.“There is no good scientific evidence to determine how long such an evaluation should last,"" said Dr. Jack Drescher, editor of the gender dysphoria chapter in the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic manual.___Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner. ___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842820,Public pension plan losses from bank failures seen as minor,"When two tech-linked U.S. banks failed this month, among the investors who lost millions were public-sector pension funds responsible for ensuring the retirements of teachers, firefighters and other government workers.The pension funds, like others, have reaped the benefits of bull markets and, like many investors, have suffered when investments soured.Last year, many lost value when their investments in Russian assets became nearly worthless after most of the world froze out that nation’s economy following its invasion of Ukraine. Some held stock in cryptocurrency-related businesses that have sputtered amid the downfall of FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.Since the pension funds are diversified investors whose holdings in Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were small portions of their portfolios, experts aren’t overly concerned about losses for relatively small holdings.But the losses show how pensions are exposed to risk as they try to reduce funding gaps.Here’s a look at where the status of public pensions and the risks they take on.WHICH FUNDS TOOK LOSSES WITH INVESTMENTS IN FAILED BANKS?Equable, a privately funded nonprofit that researches public pensions and advocates for their security, has identified more than two dozen public-sector pension funds with direct holdings in Silicon Valley or Signature Bank, or both.In every case, the banks' stocks represented no more than a few dollars out of every $10,000 in assets in the fund.The fund with the largest stake in Silicon Valley Bank was CalPERS, a fund serving public employees in California that is valued at $443 billion. It reported it owned $67 million in SVB stock and $11 million in Signature Bank. Combined, that amounts to .02% of the fund's assets.The Ohio State Teachers' Retirement System, New York State Common Fund and State Teachers' Retirement Fund and Washington State Investment Board were among those that had stock in one or both banks.Trading on both stocks was halted this month. SVB's shares were trading at more than $700 at the start of 2022 and Signature Bank's were around $300.It's likely that many pension systems also owned shares of the banks as part of index-fund investments. It's hard to know for certain because most funds do not make their complete holdings public in real time.WHAT DO THE LOSSES MEAN?They're not helping the pensions, but experts do not see these investment losses as alarming.Pension funds are big investors that seek to spread around their holdings. And while there were some signs of trouble for the banks that failed, they were still considered significant U.S. banks.“It’s a mistake to say that an investment in Silicon Valley Bank stock alone is risky,” said Anthony Randazzo, executive director of Equable.HOW ARE PUBLIC PENSIONS DOING?They've improved in recent years, but most are still short of enough assets to pay for their promised benefits.Most plans were fully funded in 2000. But around that time, many pension plans increased benefits, reduced contributions from the governments — or both. Those decisions amplified the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the funds, with market losses widening their funding gaps. By 2016, the Pew Charitable Trusts found that the state-run funds had only two-thirds of what they needed to cover their obligations.With mostly strong markets, bigger government contributions and benefit changes — including reducing the retirement promises for newly hired workers and requiring employees to contribute more — the funds' conditions have improved. By 2021, after a year of massive market growth, Pew estimated that state pensions were 84% funded, the highest level since before the Great Recession started in 2008.David Draine, who studies public-sector retirement systems at Pew, said the funding gaps are probably now about where they were before the market shockwaves during the coronavirus pandemic.But he said the greater government contributions — including higher than required in states including California and Connecticut — and other changes have increased their likelihood of withstanding future market declines.“It’s a low bar,” Draine said, “but they're better prepared than they were proceeding the Great Recession.”ARE PENSION FUNDS MAKING RISKY INVESTMENTS?Stocks and fixed-asset investments still make up the majority of the holdings of public-sector pension funds tracked by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.But the portion of assets in other — and often more volatile — investments such as real estate and hedge funds has grown over the last two decades. Investment in private equity, for example, nearly quadrupled, going from 2.3% of funds' holdings in 2001 to 8.7% in 2021.“They’re being asked to earn somewhere between 6.5% and 7.5% a year on average,"" Equable Institute's Randazzo said. “And the only way that’s possible is by taking some significant risk.”Randazzo said that if governments want pension funds to play it safer, they can raise their contributions. But the more taxpayer money goes into retirement funds, the less there is for other priorities such as schools, roads and tax cuts.Keith Brainard, the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, notes the stock market downturn in 2001 hit pensions hard because their holdings were mostly stocks.Investing in other assets can help mitigate stock losses, he said.“Some people cynically call it ‘chasing returns,’” Brainard said. “I think ‘diversifying’ is a better description.” ___",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842821,Pitino returns to big stage at St. John's: 'I’ve earned it',"NEW YORK (AP) — The video banner above the entrance to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday read: “Welcome Rick Pitino.”More like welcome back for the new St. John's coach.Back to The Garden, where he once coached the Knicks.Back to the Big East, the conference that launched his stardom and where he won his last NCAA championship.Back to big-time college basketball after a series of scandals made it seem as if that part of his career was over.“So, when I went to Iona, I said that Iona was going to be my last job,” Pitino said at his introductory news conference at MSG. “And the reason I said that is who’s going to hire a 70-year-old ? No matter how much I think I'm Peter Pan, who’s going hire a 70-year-old?”St. John's gave the Hall of Famer a six-year contract to turn back the clock on a program that once stole New York City tabloid headlines away from the Knicks in the 1980s under coach Lou Carnesecca but has been mired in mediocrity for more than two decades.The Red Storm once played most of their biggest home games at The Garden. Pitino said the goal is to have all their Big East games played there going forward.“Lou built a legendary program. Legendary,” Pitino said. “I’m all in with everything that St. John stands for. I’m excited about it. I can’t wait to get started.“And it's going to start with a culture of work.”Pitino, who was born in New York City and grew up on Long Island, has won 832 games in 34 full seasons as a college head coach, including NCAA championships at Kentucky in 1996 and Louisville in 2013.The title at Louisville was vacated for NCAA violations, and another NCAA case related to the FBI's investigation into corruption in college basketball recruiting led to Pitino being fired by Louisville in 2017.The final ruling from the NCAA's outside enforcement arm on the FBI case came down in November and exonerated Pitino.There was also a criminal extortion case in which Pitino was the victim during his time at Louisville that revealed personal indiscretions.“Well, it doesn’t matter what you believe, what you don’t believe,” Pitino said. “The one thing all my players have said, because they all wrote letters for me: I’ve never cheated the game. I never gave a player anything that he didn’t deserve in life.”St. John's president, the Rev. Brian Shanley, said the decision to hire Pitino was his call.“Yeah, sure, there’s some reputational risk because of things that have happened before, but I think Rick is at a point in his life where he’s learned from things that have happened in the past,” Shanley told The Associated Press. “I think he'd be the first one to tell you he’s done things that he regrets. Who doesn’t when you get to be that age? I know I have. I’m a believer in forgiveness and new beginnings as a priest, and I think Rick’s going to do a great job for St. John’s.”Carnesecca, 98 and getting around with the help of a walker these days, sat in the front row of Pitino's news conference.“I think it’s a home run with the bases loaded,” Carnesecca said.Carnesecca was one of the Big East's brightest coaching stars, along with Georgetown's John Thompson and Villanova's Rollie Massimino, when Pitino became Providence head coach in 1985 at the age of 32.Thirty-eight years later, Pitino's Providence ties helped him land at St. John's after three seasons at Iona, a small Catholic school in New Rochelle, just north of New York City.Shanley previously was the president of Providence. He helped turn around a lagging men's basketball program by hiring coach Ed Cooley and investing in facilities upgrades.“If I wasn’t a Providence Friar, he would have never even considered it,” Pitino said.Shanley attempted to lure Pitino away from Louisville and back to Providence years ago, but he didn't know much about the coach personally back then. He said he talked to a lot of people about Pitino this time around.“I’d say my behind-the-scenes wisdom person was Mike Tranghese, the former commissioner of the Big East,” Shanley said. “He got me Ed Cooley last time, and I think we came out pretty well this time, too.”Cooley was hired by Georgetown on Monday.Pitino said he's bringing his entire staff with him from Iona, which announced the hiring of Fairleigh Dickinson coach Tobin Anderson to replace Pitino earlier in the day.Pitino will try to become the first coach to take six different schools to the NCAA Tournament as he gets one more shot on the big stage.“I deserve it,"" he said, ""because I’ve earned it.”___March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842824,"College hoops staffs specialize to meet roster, NIL demands","Kelvin Sampson has been around college basketball long enough to remember when preseason practices started in October following a true offseason, teams remained largely intact for multiple seasons and players weren’t permitted to pursue endorsement deals.It might as well be a different planet now.The way Houston’s coach sees it, the top-tier programs must evolve to better manage recruiting, the transfer portal and roster demands, and athlete compensation deals.“Absolutely, you have to,” the 67-year-old Sampson said as March Madness headed to Sweet 16 weekend. “To (manage) those kinds of things, you’ve got to have specialization on your staff.”That means bolstering support staffs, much like how analysts and quality control staffers have become common across college football. Specialized roles for recruiting, scouting or analytics. Adding special assistants to aid head coaches, general managers to navigate the new era of players profiting from use their name, image and likeness (NIL), even creative-content staffers to pump out videos or social media to promote the program's brand.If anything, staffs are starting to resemble their counterparts in the pros.“I’ve got three – I guess there are four of them now – former (graduate assistants) and managers that work in the front office at the (NBA’s) Phoenix Suns,” Kansas State first-year coach Jerome Tang said before clinching a Sweet 16 appearance. “Those guys told me that the four guys that are on the bench across the country are probably the same. It’s the next level that separates you.”March Madness resumes Thursday, and there are examples of these increasingly specialized staffs on teams still chasing a national title.Six teams — Houston, Xavier, Texas, Arkansas, San Diego State and Florida Atlantic — have an assistant or special assistant to the head coach, often designed as catch-all helpers who shoulder administrative duties while potentially taking on tasks such as breaking down film. Tang and Michigan State’s Tom Izzo each has a chief of staff.Top overall seed Alabama has a director of scouting and analytics. Fellow Southeastern Conference team Tennessee has someone overseeing analytics.Titles vary. The goal doesn’t.“I have people on my staff in charge of something with one of our kids 24 hours a day,” Sampson said. “And it’s all built around relationships. You know, these kids can transfer today and not even have to tell the coach. They can just go to the compliance office. … So in order to combat those kinds of things, it’s more and more important that you’re involved in their daily lives.”Kevin Sutton joined Kansas State’s staff as director of strategies, working with game plans, scouting and film review. He is part of a broader effort to deal with roster management in the portal era, when rosters change dramatically from one year to the next.“It’s the college version of free agency and it’s something that goes on all the time and it continues to grow on a daily basis,” Sutton said. “We have to retain our players. … So having a larger to staff to be able to be involved in the current players’ lives and then have an eye on what’s happening outside of your program in terms of the transfer portal.”Juggling that with the core goal – winning games — isn’t easy, either.For Arkansas coach Eric Musselman, that meant stopping game-prep work last year for recruiting Zooms on the eve of beating No. 1 overall seed Gonzaga to reach a second straight regional final.“I think it was five, maybe four (Zooms), before we played Gonzaga the night before, up until maybe 11:15, 11:30 at night doing Zooms when you are trying to make an Elite Eight, playing in a Sweet 16 game,” he said.Musselman, whose team is fresh off beating 1-seed and reigning national champion Kansas, has a 14-person support staff beyond his three assistants and the goal of being “at the forefront of analytics.” That includes a director of internal operations, director of scouting, recruiting coordinator, assistant director of recruiting and scouting, and seven graduate assistants.Consider it the trickle-down of NBA influence into college ranks.“Players watch the NBA guys, they want to be like them, play like them, be in an offense like them,” said Baylor coach Scott Drew, whose team reached the tournament’s second round. “Then you look at staffs. And as universities try to keep up and provide the best for their student-athletes, then you’re getting into analytics. You’re getting into nutrition. You’re getting into player development.""That has included the very-pro-sounding role of GM, arriving at Duke and DePaul as an NIL resource to players.Daniel G. Marks fills a similar role as the first chief program strategist at Howard, which reached the NCAA tourney for the first time since 1992. He spent nine seasons with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, including the 2020-21 championship season.Marks said he is coming with an open mind to work with coach Kenny Blakeney.“Even when coming up with a title for my job, it's like: What's a title that other people are going to say, ‘Oh, that’s interesting, what does he do?'” he said. ""(Blakeney) wants programs across the country to look at Howard and say ... 'How can we learn that and emulate that?'""Those were all things Duke's Jon Scheyer considered in building his first staff to replace retired Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski. Notably, the 35-year-old added former Elon head coach Mike Schrage as special assistant to provide experience, then hired former Nike and NBA staffer Rachel Baker as general manager.Guard Jeremy Roach said the setup gave players “so many people who can help us out.” And it helped Duke win an Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament title before falling in the NCAA second round.The challenge for Scheyer and his peers? Be ready for whatever comes next.“Communication's really important and just being current,” Scheyer said. “I'm not even talking age. I'm talking current in terms of understanding what these guys are going through, their families.“It's so much more than it used to be. ... We have the staff to do that. We've done an amazing job while still getting a feel for each other. So that's something where we have to be better next year, because it can be all different next year.”___AP Sports Writers Dave Campbell, Stephen Hawkins and Eric Olson contributed to this report.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/22,,World

At least nine people died in Pakistan and two in Afghanistan, officials said WednesdayMore than 200 people were brought to hospitals in the Swat valley and elsewhere in the region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in a state of shock, Bilal Faizi, a spokesman for Pakistan's emergency services told The Associated Press.“These terrified people collapsed, and some of them collapsed because of the shock of the earthquake,” he said. Faizi said most were later discharged from the hospital.Faizi and other officials said nine people were killed when roofs collapsed in various parts of northwestern Pakistan. Dozens of others were injured in the quake, which was centered in Afghanistan and also felt in bordering Tajikistan. The earthquake triggered landslides in some of the mountainous areas, disrupting traffic.The nine people who died in northwest Pakistan included five men, two women and two children.Taimoor Khan, a spokesman for the provincial disaster management authority in the northwest, said at least 19 mudbrick homes collapsed in remote areas. “We are still collecting data about the damages,” he said. On Wednesday.The powerful tremors sent many people fleeing their homes and offices in Pakistan's capital of Islamabad, some reciting verses from the Quran, Islam's holy book. Media reports suggested cracks had appeared in some apartment buildings in the city.In Afghanistan, Sharafat Zaman Amar, Taliban’s appointed spokesman for the public health ministry said, so far at least two people died and around 20 others were injured in the earthquake in Afghanistan.Zaman Amar said “Unfortunately, there could be more casualties as the quake was so powerful, in most parts of the country” all hospitals and health facilities are ready to save lives of people, he added.The scene was repeated in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan.""The quake was so strong and terrifying, we thought houses are collapsing on us, people were all shouting and were shocked,” said Shafiullah Azimi, a Kabul resident.Aziz Ahmad, 45, another Kabul resident, said “In my life this was first time I have experienced such powerful quake, everyone was terrified,” He added he and all his neighbors stayed out of their homes for hours, afraid of aftershocks. “We couldn't dare to get back homes.""The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter of the magnitude 6.5 quake was 40 kilometers (25 miles) south-southeast of Jurm in Afghanistan's mountainous Hindukush region, bordering Pakistan and Tajikistan. The quake struck 188 kilometers (116 miles) deep below the Earth's surface, causing it to felt over a wide area.Physician Rakhshinda Tauseed was at her hospital in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore when the earthquake hit. “I quickly asked patients to go move to a safer place,” she said.Khurram Shahzad, a resident in Pakistan's garrison city of Rawalpindi, said he was having dinner with his family at a restaurant when the walls started swaying.“I quickly thought that it is a big one, and we left the restaurant and came out,” he told The Associated Press by phone. He said he saw hundreds of people standing on the streets.The situation was similar in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on the border with Afghanistan, where people were seen standing outside their homes and offices.Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif in a statement said he asked disaster management officials to remain vigilant to handle any situation.Zabihullah Mujahid, the main spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, tweeted that the Ministry of Public Health had ordered all health centers to be on standby.The region is prone to violent seismic upheavals. A magnitude 7.6 quake in 2005 killed thousands of people in Pakistan and Kashmir.Last year in southeastern Afghanistan, a 6.1 magnitude quake struck a rugged, mountainous region, flattening stone and mud-brick homes. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers put the total death toll from the quake at 1,150, with hundreds more injured, while the U.N. has offered a lower estimate of 770.The latest earthquake hit Pakistan as it struggles to recover from last summer's devastating floods which killed 1,739 people.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842828,Number of monarch butterflies wintering in Mexico drops 22%,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains of central Mexico dropped 22% from the previous year, and the number of trees lost from their favored wintering grounds tripled.Frost and “extreme temperatures” in the United States may have played a role in the butterfly’s decline during the most recent winter season, said Humberto Peña, director of Mexico’s nature reserves.Monarchs east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter in the fir forests of the western state of Michoacan, west of Mexico City. The total area they occupied this past winter dropped to 5.4 acres (2.21 hectares), from 7 acres (2.84 hectares) a year earlier.The annual butterfly count doesn’t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover when they clump together on tree boughs.Gloria Tavera, conservation director of Mexico’s Commission for National Protected Areas, said the area of forest cover appropriate for the butterflies that was lost rose to 145 acres (58.7 hectares), from 46.2 acres (18.8 hectares) last year.Illegal logging has been a major threat to the pine and fir forests where the butterflies gathering in clumps to keep warm. But experts said that this year, more than half the tree loss was due to removal of dead or sick trees affected by fires, storms or pests. Tavera said a lack of rain had plunged trees into hydric stress, making them more vulnerable to diseases, pests and fires.Jorge Rickards, Mexico director of the WWF conservation group, blamed climate change,“The monarch butterfly is an indicator of these changes,” Rickards said.Critics say that in the past, removal of diseased trees has been used as a pretext for felling healthy trees for timber.Tavera said she had no evidence that occurred this year, adding, “I don't think anyone is lying.”Each year the monarchs return to the United States and Canada on an annual migration that is threatened by loss of the milkweed they feed on north of the border and by deforestation in the butterfly reserves in Mexico.Due to a myriad of factors, monarch numbers have dropped in recent years. Experts say drought, severe weather and loss of habitat — especially of the milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs — as well as pesticide and herbicide use and climate change all pose threats to the species’ migration.Illegal logging also continues to plague the reserves, and Peña said there are plans to station National Guard troops in the reserve to prevent it.But open, illegal tree cutting actually dropped 3.4% this year, largely due to the efforts of inhabitants to protect their forests, a change of attitude by many.For example, on Jan. 23, the communal farm community of Crescencio Morales — once the area with the worst illegal logging — fielded its first class of trained and officially approved forest rangers.The 58-strong forest ranger “Community Guard” of Crescencio Morales began life several years ago as a rag-tag band of farmers armed with a motley collection of weapons, before the state government offered to train and equip them.The community’s struggle began in the early 2000s, when residents fought to kick out drug traffickers and illegal loggers and redeem itself in the process.“Back in 1998, the inhabitants of Crescencio Morales decided to set fire to the monarch butterfly colonies, in order to log the land,” recalls Erasmo Álvarez Castillo, the leader of the communal, or ejido, farmers in the village.Residents quickly saw two things: The illegal logging brought with it the incursion of drug cartels and surrounding communities were making money off tourism.So starting around 2000, the farmers began reforesting the mountain slopes. But they still had to expel the drug gangs. It was a long and arduous fight that eventually forced the farmers to take up arms, after calls to police for help in defending the community went unanswered.Things came to a head when the town declared itself an autonomous, self-governing municipality.Faced with armed, rebellious farmers, the government decided to try to professionalize the community force and train it to protect the forests.Now, with the butterflies back, the village can dream of attracting tourists.“The land we have on the mountaintop is very beautiful. It would be good for a tourism site,” Álvarez Castillo said. “The plan is to make trails, put up cabins — a tourist site without destroying the environment.” ___Solís reported from Crescencio Morales, Mexico.",2023/03/22,,World

And for starters, Kuchar feels lucky just to be part of the 64-man field at Austin Country Club.At stake: He needs to win three matches to set the record for most matches won in a tournament that dates to 1999. Kuchar is guaranteed three matches, starting Wednesday, in the group format.Kuchar has reached the Final Four four times, winning the championship in 2013, losing to Kevin Kisner in 2019 and twice losing in the semifinals. His career mark is 34-11-4. Woods, the only three-time winner of Match Play, has a 36-12 mark.“This is an event I love, an event that's been really good to me,” Kuchar said Tuesday as he ducked inside from a steady drizzle. “It's something I had my eye on and had to do some asking around, ‘Hey, how do I look to get in this thing?’ I'm awfully excited it worked out.”Match Play was the most unusual of the World Golf Championships when the series began in 1999, and it was the last of them to go.The WGC at Firestone moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 2019 and then was converted two years later to a FedEx Cup playoff event.The WGC that initially alternated between the U.S. and Europe moved to Doral (and absorbed a regular PGA Tour event), and then headed to Mexico City when a sponsor could not be found for the Donald Trump-owned course, and then was shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic.The HSBC Champions in Shanghai hasn’t been played since 2019 due to the pandemic, and the China Golf Association hasn’t allowed it to resume. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan doesn’t expect that event to continue with the move toward so many elevated events in the new schedule.And now the Dell Match Play is done after this year, a blow for fans who enjoy the most unpredictable nature of 18-hole matches and for Austin, which will be without the highest level of golf.It ends with a 64-man field that had to dip down to No. 77 in the world ranking to fill the field, and another sign of these divisive times in golf.That means 11 players would not be in Austin if not for LIV Golf, including Kuchar.“I guess I'm grateful for LIV for a lot of things,” Kuchar said with a laugh, a reference to the $20 million purse this week, which was part of the PGA Tour's response to the Saudi-funded threat of LIV.Kuchar can break Woods’ record by sweeping his three matches in group play, but that’s never easy — no matter the opponents. Kuchar is the No. 59 seed and faces Viktor Hovland, Chris Kirk and Si Woo Kim — all of whom have won tournaments in the last four months.Kuchar isn't sure why he thrives in match play, though there is one adage about this format that doesn't get a lot of attention.“Good form is the most important thing to success,” he said.Scottie Scheffler has a little of both. The No. 1 player in the world already has two wins this year, the most recent two weeks ago at The Players Championship. Scheffler made his debut in the Match Play in 2021 by reaching the championship match and losing to Billy Horschel, and then he won the Match Play last year over Kisner.Woods is the only player to have won Match Play in consecutive years.“Match play is a little bit different,” Scheffler said. “But I think the guys playing the best golf do what they have to do to win the match and win the tournament and I think it’s a good format. It’s a little funky, but a change of pace.”Scheffler won last year as the No. 5 seed, and only three top seeds in the previous 23 years have won the Match Play — Rory McIlroy in 2015, Dustin Johnson in 2017 and Woods three times (2003, 2004 and 2008). Two players in his group, Tom Kim and Davis Riley, are playing for the first time.Jon Rahm reached the championship match in 2017 in his debut. He is coming off a stomach virus bad enough to knock him out of The Players Championship after one round.The Spaniard would love to see the format return to the PGA Tour schedule at some point.“It's really the only time throughout the year, besides maybe the Ryder Cup, where you’re playing truly against the person in front of you, which is much more relatable to every sport we play in the world,” Rahm said.“It's fun. It’s a lot more aggressive. You see more birdies. You see a lot of things happen.""___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842833,States cranking out even more tax cuts amid cash surpluses,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Just six months after passing what was billed as the largest tax cut in Missouri history, the Republican-led state House voted Tuesday for an even bigger income tax cut that could return over $1 billion annually to individuals, corporations and retirees.The Missouri legislation is the latest in a series of aggressive tax reductions that swept across U.S. states last year and have continued into 2023 — even as some warn that it might be wise for states to hold on to record large surpluses amid economic uncertainty.“Wouldn’t it be a good idea for us to all just pause for a year?” Democratic state Rep. Deb Lavender asked rhetorically before her Republican colleagues endorsed the tax cut on a 109-45 party-line vote.The Missouri legislation still has a ways to go — it needs a second House approval before it can move to the Senate and then to the governor. But legislatures and governors in several states already have given final approval to tax cuts and rebates in the first few months of this year. In some states, those tax breaks have been pushed by Republicans, but in others by Democrats.South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, signed legislation Tuesday that will lower the state’s sales tax for a four-year period, though she had originally wanted the GOP-led Legislature to eliminate the sales tax on groceries.In Montana, Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte last week signed a $1 billion package of bills passed by the GOP-led Legislature that will provide both income and property tax rebates, reduce the top income tax rate and increase income tax credits for lower-income working families.In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a bill passed by the Democratic-led Legislature that provides tax relief to retirees and to lower-income families.And in West Virginia, Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed a measure passed by the GOP-led Legislature that reduces the income tax rate while also enlarging an income tax credit to offset personal property taxes paid on vehicles. The tax cut package is expected to return more than two-thirds of the state's record $1.1 billion surplus to taxpayers, as opposed to spending it on state programs.Nationwide, states' total financial balances reached a record $343 billion at the end of their 2022 fiscal years — up 42% from the previous year, according to a recent report by The Pew Charitable Trusts.Two-thirds of states approved some sort of tax relief last year, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.Those surplus-induced tax breaks were enabled by stronger than expected state tax collections and an influx of federal pandemic aid both directly to states and to businesses and individuals that, in turn, injected more spending into the economy. But those federal payments are winding down, inflation remains persistently high and new challenges in the banking sector have raised questions about the overall economy.“This extraordinary chapter in state finances appears to be coming to an end,” said Justin Theal, an officer with Pew's State Fiscal Policy Project.“Tax cuts or new spending initiatives aren’t inherently bad or uncommon during good budgetary times,"" Theal said. But ""if policymakers aren’t careful, these long-term commitments can place them in a more vulnerable fiscal position when the economy inevitably turns.”In Missouri, some Republican lawmakers argued that more tax cuts ultimately would give residents more money to spend and lead to continued growth in state tax revenues.Last October, Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed legislation cutting the top individual income tax rate from 5.3% to 4.95% effective Jan. 1 and allowing for an eventual reduction to 4.5% if revenues continue to grow. This year's bill doesn't wait to see whether that growth occurs. Instead, it would cut the individual income tax rate to 4.5% beginning in 2024 while also reducing taxes on corporations and Social Security benefits and enabling even more income tax cuts if future revenue targets are met.“This is not reckless. This is a meaningful step,” Republican state Rep. Doug Richey said in response to critics. “This is simply slowing down the rate of growth for tax revenue.”Other states also are following last year's tax breaks with even more this year.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat up for re-election this year, signed a plan passed by the Republican-led Legislature to cut the state's individual income tax rate to 4% effective in 2024. That comes on the heels of a tax overhaul passed last year, which lowered the income tax rate from 5% to 4.5% in January.In 2022, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia suspended the state motor fuel tax for 10 months, and lawmakers approved a $1 billion income tax refund worth $250 to $500 for most tax filers. Earlier this month, Kemp signed an additional $1 billion income tax refund. He also signed a budget bill that includes nearly $1 billion for a property tax break.Tax cut proposals are awaiting action elsewhere.New Mexico's Democratic-led Legislature recently passed a $1.1 billion tax relief package that includes $500 individual rebates, tax credits of up to $600 per child and a gradual reduction in taxes on sales and business services. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has until April 7 to sign or veto bills.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842834,Effort to recall New Orleans' first female mayor fails,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The effort to recall Democratic New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has failed, following an official count of petition signatures released by the Louisiana governor’s office Tuesday.Although the petition sheets contained over 67,000 signatures, most where declared invalid by the registrar. Gov. John Bel Edwards announced that only 27,243 of the signatures were valid — falling about 18,000 short of what was needed to force a referendum. Signatures can be rejected for a multitude of reasons including, if they are dated after the deadline, the title page is mislabeled, there is erroneous information or profanity, if the person is out-of-parish or if the signature is a duplicate.“My administration has always remained focused on addressing the real pressing issues that face our city,” Cantrell said in a statement to WAFB-TV. “Now, with the divisiveness of the failed recall campaign officially behind us, we must heal and recommit ourselves to working collaboratively to continue the progress we’ve made towards reducing crime, increasing public safety, building a more sustainable and resilient city and creating economic and job opportunities that benefit all of our people.""The number of signatures needed to force the recall has been debated in court. Recall organizers sued officials, saying the rolls were inflated with hundreds of dead people and thousands of people who have moved away.Earlier this month, New Orleans Civil District Court Judge Jennifer Medley approved a lawsuit settlement agreement that significantly lowered the number of signatures needed to force a recall election. However, after The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate revealed the judge herself had signed the recall petition, Medley said another judge would decide whether she should be removed from the case.“The recall campaign has been divisive, dishonest, and opaque to say the least. It’s time for New Orleanians to better our city in the way we do best - by coming together,” Maggie Carroll, the longtime campaign manager for Cantrell, said in a written statement Tuesday.Recall efforts against Cantrell, the first woman to serve as New Orleans mayor, began last August, less than a year after she began her second term.She was easily reelected in 2021 but has since faced numerous problems, including violent crime, fitful progress on major street projects and unreliable garbage collection. Questions also have been raised about her travel expenses and her personal use of a city-owned apartment. The City Council recently opened an investigation into the use of public money to send a mailer to city residents earlier this year touting Cantrell’s accomplishments.Cantrell has repeatedly criticized the recall effort as a Republican-led attack on the administration of a Black, Democratic woman.",2023/03/22,,World

The early-morning gunfire prompted officials at Lamar High School to lock the building down for hours, although police said they arrested a student on a capital murder charge stemming from the shooting within minutes.Lisa Herrick, a court-appointed attorney for the boy, said that after questioning, a state judge Tuesday found there was probable cause for the teen's arrest. The judge ordered he remain at a juvenile detention for the next 10 days after which his custody will be re-evaluated, Herrick said.Herrick said prosecutors are yet to formally charge the boy, but that in addition to the capital murder charge Arlington police referred a terroristic threat charge to the district attorney's office. A spokeswoman for the Tarrant County district attorney declined to comment, noting the case is still under investigation.Police have not said what motivated the gunfire that began around 6:55 a.m., but said the suspected shooter fled without ever entering the school building.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842838,Debate on Nebraska gender-affirming care bill gets combative,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Debate that began Tuesday on a Nebraska bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors, which led one lawmaker to stage an epic weekslong filibuster, quickly grew contentious, with supporters and opponents angrily voicing their frustration and admonishing each other for a lack of collegiality.Sen. John Lowe, of Kearney, cited an activist group's claim that gender dysphoria in youth “is just temporary,” while Sen. Brad von Gillern, of Omaha, compared gender-affirming treatment to shock treatments, lobotomies and forced sterilizations of years' past. Bellevue Sen. Carol Blood countered that if lawmakers really cared about medical procedures affecting children, “how come we're not talking about circumcision?”And that was only the first three hours of an eight-hour Senate debate expected to stretch into Thursday.The bill introduced by Republican Sen. Kathleen Kauth, a freshman lawmaker in the officially-nonpartisan state Legislature, would outlaw gender-affirming therapies such as hormone treatments, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery for those 18 and younger.The proposal had already caused tumult in the legislative session, cited as the genesis of a nearly three-week filibuster carried out by Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh over her opposition. Cavanaugh had followed through on her vow in late February to filibuster every bill before the Legislature — even those she supported — declaring she would ""burn the session to the ground over this bill.”She stuck with it until an agreement was reached late last week to push the bill to the front of the debate queue. Instead of trying to eat time to keep the bill from getting to the floor, Cavanaugh decided she wanted a vote to put on the record of which lawmakers would “legislate hate against children.”Lawmakers convened Tuesday to begin that debate with the understanding that the bill didn't have enough votes to break a filibuster. But Kauth introduced an amendment to drop the restriction on hormone treatments, instead banning only gender reassignment surgery for minors. That amendment, she said, does have enough votes to advance.Cavanaugh has said if the bill advances on a vote expected Thursday, she will resume filibustering every bill through the end of the 90-day session in early June.The hard feelings by lawmakers on both sides of the bill emerged almost immediately Tuesday, with Kauth calling Cavanaugh’s filibuster “self-serving and childish."" Kauth said the purpose of her bill is to protect youth from undertaking gender-affirming treatments they might later regret as adults, citing research that says adolescents' brains aren't fully developed.Omaha Sen. Megan Hunt called out that argument as hypocritical, noting that Kauth supports an abortion ban bill introduced this session that would also affect adolescents.“In a couple of weeks, she's going to turn around and vote for a bill that would force 12-year-olds to have a baby,” Hunt said. “She thinks they're mature enough for that.”Cavanaugh called the trans treatment bill “an assault on individuals that members of this body love,” and appealed to Republican members of the body to get back to their core principles of getting government out of people’s lives.“So many of you have talked to me about government overreach time and time again,” she said. “This bill stands in opposition to the tenets that many of you have expressed to me are the foundation of why you are here.”The Nebraska bill, along with another that would ban trans people from using bathrooms and locker rooms or playing on sports teams that don’t align with the gender listed on their birth certificates, are among roughly 150 bills targeting transgender people that have been introduced in state legislatures this year.Bans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted this year in some Republican-led states, including South Dakota, Utah and Mississippi. Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges. Other states legislatures have given final approval to measures similar to the Nebraska bill, with Georgia sending to the governor Tuesday a bill that would ban most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842839,"Spring brings more wind, rain and snow to soaked California","SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) — A strong late-season Pacific storm brought damaging winds and more rain and snow to saturated California on Tuesday as the first full day of spring showed little change from the state's extraordinary winter.The storm focused most of its energy on central and southern parts of the state, bringing threats of heavy runoff and mountain snowfall that forecasters said will be measured in feet. In the north, intense hail was reported in Sacramento, the state capital.Trees and power lines were reported downed in the San Francisco Bay Area. An Amtrak commuter train carrying 55 passengers struck a downed tree and derailed near the East Bay village of Porta Costa. The train remained upright and nobody was injured, Amtrak and fire officials said.In the Bay Area community of Portola Valley, a man driving a sewer truck was killed when a tree fell onto the vehicle, the California Highway Patrol said.In the Monterey Bay region, a severe windstorm located over the ocean blasted Santa Cruz County with wind gusts up to 80 mph (129 kph) at midday. Along the coastline of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, ocean foam blew across the roadways like large snowflakes.Wind gusts reached 76 mph (122 kph) in Santa Cruz mountain communities, including Boulder Creek.Resident Frank Kuhr waited for hours Tuesday afternoon at a downtown supermarket for crews to remove large redwoods that were blocking a highway. “Trees are down everywhere,” Kuhr said. “The wind has been unbelievable. Branches were flying through the air, and folks could hear trees just falling and cracking.”“This one’s a doozy,” Kuhr said.Some 210,000 customers were without electricity throughout the state, mostly in the region south of San Francisco, according to PowerOutage.us.The National Weather Service said the storm is a Pacific low pressure system interacting with California's 12th atmospheric river since late December.California's unexpected siege of wet weather after years of drought also included February blizzards powered by arctic air.The storms have unleashed flooding and loaded mountains with so much snow that roofs have been crushed and crews have struggled to keep highways clear of avalanches.The Mammoth Mountain resort in the eastern Sierra Nevada announced that it will remain open for skiing and snowboarding at least through the end of July.With a season-to-date snowfall of 634 inches (16.1 meters) at the main lodge, it was likely just one storm away from breaking the all-time record of 668 inches (16.9 meters) set in the 2010-2011 season.",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842854,Messi mania in Argentina as soccer star mobbed at restaurant,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — A steakhouse in the trendy Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo was mobbed by hundreds of frenzied soccer fans late Monday night when word spread that Lionel Messi was inside having dinner.People rushed to the exclusive Don Julio restaurant eager to get a glimpse of the man who led Argentina to its third World Cup title. Messi eventually needed a police escort to leave.Fans on the street corner chanted “Messi, Messi” and sang the words to “Muchachos,” which became the unofficial anthem for the Argentina squad that beat France in a thrilling final in Qatar.The scene witnessed in the neighborhood of Argentina’s capital known for its bars and restaurants illustrates how Messi has now become like the late Diego Maradona, who led Argentina to its second World Cup trophy in 1986, and he can no longer walk through Argentina’s streets without being mobbed.It wasn’t always this way.The man who is now cheered wherever he goes once used to suffer the indifference and even apathy from many Argentina fans who blamed him for the country’s failings in previous championships. All that vitriol led the man who is often called the best soccer player in the world to even quit the national team in 2016, although he later backtracked.All of that now seems to be forgotten as Messi fever has decidedly taken over, recalling what happened with Maradona 36 years ago after he raised the World Cup in Mexico. The then-captain also had to deal with fans who chased him wherever he went in the hopes of getting a photograph or an autograph.On Monday night, the multitude was so great that police officers had to arrive at the restaurant to accompany the 35-year-old Messi to his vehicle while keeping fans at bay.Images and video posted on social media showed the furor of the fans who seemed willing to do anything to greet and touch the Paris Saint-Germain player. “Messi I love you” and “Thank you, Leo” were just a few phrases that could be heard as he was escorted out of the restaurant.“Thank you for looking at me captain, I can die in peace,” one user wrote on Twitter accompanied by a video that showed a smiling Messi being escorted as people shouted “I love you!”Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni celebrated the Messi mania that has been unleashed in Buenos Aires and across the country.“What Leo is experiencing is beautiful because he deserves all that love, him and all the players who are here,” Scaloni said at a news conference Tuesday. “Leo also needs to see that people love him and what happens when he comes here. I think it’s beautiful, it will stay with him forever.”Messi arrived in Argentina on Monday to celebrate the World Cup title with a friendly match against Panama on Thursday in Buenos Aires. The 63,000 tickets sold out in a flash.Security officials are not revealing any details about how the team will travel to the stadium out of fear that fans will block roads and ultimately block the passage of the players. There are rumors the players could travel via helicopter.After winning the World Cup title in December, a planned celebratory open-top bus ride throughout the city had to be cut short as millions of fans made it impossible for the bus to advance.The adulation that Messi is receiving comes at a time when his future at PSG remains uncertain and is in sharp contrast to the anger that many fans of the French team feel toward the Argentine player. Shortly before he was cheered in Buenos Aires, the World Cup champion was whistled by PSG fans who blamed him for the team’s 2-0 loss against Rennes.Messi has yet to say what he will do after June 30, when his contract is set to expire.For now though, he'll enjoy the adoration of Argentine fans as the team will play another friendly match against Curaçao on March 28 in Argentina’s central Santiago del Estero province.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842855,US regulators delay decision on nuclear fuel storage license,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — U.S. regulators say they need more time to wrap up a final safety report and make a decision on whether to license a multibillion-dollar complex meant to temporarily store tons of spent fuel from commercial nuclear power plants around the nation.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a new schedule Monday, citing unforeseen staffing constraints. The agency was initially expected to issue a decision by the end of March. It will now be the end of May.The announcement comes just days after New Mexico approved legislation aimed at stopping the project. It’s expected that supporters of the storage facility will take the fight to court, but New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday asked the NRC to suspend its consideration of the license application.New Jersey-based Holtec International already has spent an estimated $80 million in its pursuit of a 40-year license to build and operate the complex in southeastern New Mexico. Company officials said Tuesday that the delay in licensing would have only a minimal impact on the original timeline.“With a project of this complexity, we understand the need for the regulating and licensing authority to have all the time and resources necessary to issue a licensing decision,"" Holtec spokesman Patrick O'Brien said in an email.Holtec, elected officials from southeastern New Mexico and other supporters have been pushing hard to offer what they call a temporary solution to the nation's problem of spent nuclear fuel, which has been piling up at commercial reactors for years.Since the federal government has failed to build a permanent repository, it reimburses utilities to house the fuel in either steel-lined concrete pools of water or in steel and concrete containers known as casks at sites in nearly three dozen states. That cost is expected to stretch into the tens of billions of dollars over the next decade.The legislation signed by Lujan Grisham last week requires that the state provide consent for bringing in such radioactive material. Consent from the Democratic governor would be unlikely, as she has argued that without a permanent repository, New Mexico stands to be the nation's de facto dumping ground.She reiterated her opposition in the letter to NRC Chairman Christopher Hanson.“Thank you for respecting the state of New Mexico's laws and the voices of our citizens, tribes and pueblos who overwhelming(ly) supported this legislation,” she wrote.Similar battles have been waged in Nevada, Utah and Texas over the decades as the U.S. has struggled to find a home for spent fuel and other radioactive waste. The proposed Yucca Mountain project in Nevada was mothballed and a temporary storage site planned on a Native American reservation in Utah was sidelined despite being licensed by the NRC in 2006.That project would have been located on land belonging to the Skull Valley Band of Goshute. Utah's governor at the time — Republican Mike Leavitt — was among those fighting the effort. He and others were successful in getting Congress to amend a defense spending bill, essentially landlocking the site by creating the Cedar Mountain Wilderness and blocking a rail spur that would have delivered casks.But it was only six weeks later that the NRC issued a license for the project.Don Hancock with the nuclear watchdog group Southwest Research and Information Center pointed to the Utah case.“If congressional action doesn’t affect NRC decision making, there’s no reason to think that New Mexico action has an effect,"" he said in an email Tuesday.Elected leaders in Texas also were unsuccessful in keeping a similar project from being licensed by the NRC in 2021. Integrated Storage Partners LLC's initial plans call for storing up to 5,000 metric tons (5,512 tons) of spent fuel and about 230 metric tons (254 tons) of low-level radioactive waste for 40 years. Future phases could boost that capacity to 40,000 metric tons (44,092 tons) of fuel.Holtec officials are disappointed in the New Mexico legislation and argue that their project is safe, would be an economic boon for the region and would not affect ongoing operations in the Permian Basin, which is one of the world's most productive oil and gas plays.“Passing a bill that is pre-empted by federal law and will be adjudicated accordingly in the courts is a counterproductive action that inhibits the state's growth in the area of clean energy,” O'Brien said, adding that local support has solidified the company's belief that the project is still viable.President Joe Biden has received dueling letters from supporters of the project and from Lujan Grisham and others in opposition. The administration has acknowledged the role nuclear power will have to play in reaching its carbon emission goals and earlier this year put up $26 million in grants for communities interested in studying potential interim storage sites.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842856,Oklahoma court OK's abortion to preserve mother's life,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A divided Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a portion of the state’s near total ban on abortion, ruling women have a right to abortion when pregnancy risks their health, not just in a medical emergency.It was a narrow win for abortion rights advocates since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the landmark Roe v. Wade last year. Since then, conservative states including Oklahoma have enforced restrictions on abortion.Oklahoma's top court ruled that a woman has the right under the state Constitution to receive an abortion to preserve her life if her doctor determines that continuing the pregnancy would endanger it due to a condition she has or is likely to develop during the pregnancy. Previously, the right to an abortion could only take place in the case of medical emergency.“Requiring one to wait until there is a medical emergency would further endanger the life of the pregnant woman and does not serve a compelling state interest,” the ruling states.In the 5-4 ruling, the court said the state law uses both the words “preserve” and “save” the mother’s life as an exception to the abortion ban.“The language ‘except to save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency’ is much different from ‘preserve her life,’” according to the ruling.“Absolute certainty,"" by the physician that the mother's life could be endangered, ""is not required, however, mere possibility or speculation is insufficient” to determine that an abortion is needed to preserve the woman’s life, according to the ruling.The court, however, declined to rule on whether the state Constitution grants the right to an abortion for other reasons.The court ruled in the lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood, Tulsa Women's Reproductive Clinic and others challenging the state laws passed after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a nationwide right to abortion for nearly half a century.Since then, a patchwork of laws has meant some patients have had to travel to other states to get abortions when it was outlawed where they lived.“This ruling leaves out too many Oklahomans. Oklahomans shouldn’t have to travel across state lines just to reach an abortion clinic, and it is heartbreaking that many will not be able to do so,” said Dr. Alan Braid, an abortion provider and plaintiff in the case said in a statement.The ruling in Oklahoma is unlikely to mean abortion becomes widely available.In a lawsuit filed earlier this month over Texas’ abortion ban, five women said they were denied abortions even when pregnancy endangered their lives. The suit claims the Texas law is creating confusion among doctors, who are turning away some pregnant women experiencing health complications because they fear repercussions.Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Great Plains called the ruling a small step toward restoring the right to abortion.“The Oklahoma Supreme Court recognized one fundamental truth: patients must be permitted to access critical care to save their lives,” she said. “But the right recognized today is so limited that most people who need abortion will not be able to access it.”___Follow AP’s full coverage of abortion: https://apnews.com/hub/abortion",2023/03/22,,World

The stigma around it is something that needs to go.""Chelsea defender Chilwell is back in the England squad after a hamstring injury ruled him out of last year’s World Cup.Chilwell was part of Three Lions coach Gareth Southgate’s squad for Euro 2020, but was forced to spend some of that tournament in isolation after coming into contact with Scotland midfielder Billy Gilmour, who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. He didn't see any action in that tournament as England reached the final and lost on penalties to Italy.The 26-year-old full-back also missed a large part of last season due to an ACL injury.“Mentally it’s very challenging,” he said ahead of England’s European Championship qualifiers against Italy and Ukraine. “All footballers go through periods of their career where things are mentally challenging and you’ve got to be resilient, be strong and try to come out of the other side stronger.“That’s the way I've tried to look at the injuries I’ve had, missing the World Cup, trying to spin them into positive situations where I can better myself mentally, physically.”Chilwell watched on as a fan as England lost to France in the World Cup quarterfinals.Despite the nation's earliest elimination under Southgate, Chilwell was encouraged by what he saw.“We’ve got to move on and take confidence from the World Cup,” he said. “I think the France game, in a positive way, the boys should look and think they were the better team and should have won. We can take that confidence going forward that we are now facing the big teams in the later rounds of competitions.”___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

(AP) — The former Florida lawmaker who sponsored the controversial law critics call “Don’t Say Gay” pleaded guilty Tuesday to committing $150,000 in COVID-19 relief fraud.Joseph Harding, a 35-year-old Republican, pleaded guilty in Gainesville federal court to wire fraud, money laundering, and making false statements in connection with COVID-19 relief fraud, according to court records. He faces up to 35 years in prison at a hearing scheduled for July 25.Harding resigned from the Florida House in December, a day after federal prosecutors announced his indictment.According to court documents, Harding made false statements to the Small Business Administration while applying for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan for one of his dormant business entities. After obtaining $150,000 in COVID-19 relief funds, prosecutors said Harding conducted three monetary transactions, each involving more than $10,000 in fraudulently obtained funds: a transfer to his joint bank account, a payment to his credit card, and a transfer into a bank account of a third-party business entity.The Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program is designed to provide economic relief to small businesses that are experiencing a temporary loss of revenue.Harding became nationally known last year over his sponsorship of a law that forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, as well as material that is not deemed age appropriate.",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842860,"WBC returns in March 2026, retaining spring training slot","MIAMI (AP) — The World Baseball Classic will return for its sixth edition in March 2026, with organizers concluding spring training remains a better time than after the World Series or in the middle of the major league season.Speaking before Tuesday night's final between the United States and Japan, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said MLB owners and general managers have to be pursuaded to make more star pitchers available to national teams.Since its launch in 2006, the WBC has been played in March, ahead of club opening day in MLB, Japan and South Korea.“We have talked about timing until your head hurts,” Manfred said. “There’s just no perfect time. You can’t really do it after the playoffs because so many players have been down. We have talked about something in the middle of the season. I think on balance, although it’s not perfect, this is probably the right place for it.”Many MLB teams blocked pitchers from participating, wanting them to concentrate on preparing for the season's start.“From a competitive perspective, I think the most important thing is we’re going to need to continue to work, particularly with our clubs, about pitching,” Manfred said. ""Obviously, it’s great the guys we’ve had, but I think that I’d like to see pitching staffs that are of the same quality as our position players.”“Pitching in a high-leverage situation like these are, that actually helps players develop, No. 1,” he added. “No. 2, that we staff the teams in a way that pitchers are used appropriately and the staffs of WBC communicate with the clubs about what’s going on with the individual players and make good judgments.”U.S. manager Mark DeRosa said he told clubs that he would never have a pitcher warm up twice in the bullpen on the same day. One a pitcher warms up, he had to enter the game then or not be used.Two All-Stars players got hurt during the WBC. Mets closer Edwin Díaz injured a knee during a postgame celebration with Puerto Rico last week and had season-ending surgery. Houston second baseman Jose Altuve broke his right thumb when he was hit by a pitch and needs an operation that will keep him sidelined for a period still to be announced.“I think maybe the best testimony to it is how the players, after the unfortunate injury that Díaz had, how the players came out and spoke in support of the tournament,” Manfred said. “It’s an indication that they really, really care about the event.”He said the WBC will continue to take on the insurance of players participating with their national teams.“You can’t play this event without insuring the players,” he said. “It's enough that the teams take the risk that somebody is going to be down, but to then say, oh, by the way, you get to pay for it, I don’t think that's fair.”Manfred is open to returning to Puerto Rico or possibly playing in the Dominican Republic. Every WBC edition has includes games in Japan. Puerto Rico hosted in 2006, ‘09 and 13, Mexico in ’2009 and '17, Taiwan 2013 and this year and South Korea in 2017.Unlike the World Cup in soccer, he doesn't intend for the WBC to become a bigger event than MLB's playoffs and World Series.“I don’t foresee or actually want the tournament to be bigger than our traditional format,” he said. I think the World Series is always going to be the World Series, but I don’t see it as an either/or proposition. This is a different kind of competition. We do it to grow the game and internationalize the game.""___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842865,Trump's potential indictment caps decades of legal scrutiny,"NEW YORK (AP) — For 40 years, former President Donald Trump has navigated countless legal investigations without ever facing criminal charges. That record may soon come to an end.Trump could be indicted by a Manhattan grand jury as soon as this week, potentially charged with falsifying business records connected to hush money payments during his 2016 campaign to women who accused him of sexual encounters.It's one of several investigations that have intensified as Trump mounts his third presidential run. He has denied any allegations of wrongdoing and accuses prosecutors of engaging in a politically motivated “witch hunt” to damage his campaign.An indictment in New York would mark an extraordinary turn in American history, making Trump the first former president to face a criminal charge. And it would carry tremendous weight for Trump himself, threatening his long-established ability to avoid consequences despite entanglement in a dizzying number of cases.Indictment, says biographer Michael D’Antonio, would be a “shocking event, both because of the fact that a former president is being indicted for the first time, but also because one of the slipperiest people at the highest level of business, whose devotion to abusing the system is so well established, is being caught.""“Throughout his life, he has done things for which he could have been investigated and potentially prosecuted and learned from those experiences that he could act with impunity,"" he said.Trump first faced legal scrutiny in the 1970s when the Department of Justice brought a racial discrimination case against his family's real estate business.Trump and his father fiercely fought the suit, which accused them of refusing to rent apartments to Black tenants in predominantly white buildings. Testimony showed that applications filed by prospective Black tenants were marked with a “C"" for “colored.” Trump counter-sued for $100 million, accusing the government of defamation.The case ended with a settlement that opened the way for some Black tenants but did not force the Trumps to explicitly acknowledge they had “failed and neglected” to comply with the Fair Housing Act.Since then, Trump and his businesses have been the subject of thousands of civil lawsuits and numerous investigations. There have been probes into his casino and real estate dealings, allegations of bribery and improper lobbying, fraud allegations against the now-defunct Trump University and charitable Trump Foundation and a probe by the Manhattan district attorney into sales at the Trump SoHo hotel-condominium in Lower Manhattan.Indeed, according Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group abbreviated CREW, as of November 2022, Trump had been accused of committing at least 56 criminal offenses since he launched his campaign in 2015, not including allegations of fraudulent business dealings. But he has never been formally indicted.Trump is a master of delay tactics, “finding ways to endlessly delay in the hopes that the investigation and litigation will go away. And he’s had remarkable success,” says CREW president Noah Bookbinder, a former federal corruption prosecutor.“It makes accountability absolutely essential because we can’t have people in a functioning democracy operating in positions of power with total impunity where they can commit crimes and never have to face any consequences,” he said.Trump's retort to such strong talk: He commits no crimes, so consequences would themselves be unjust.As president, Trump continued to face legal scrutiny. For two years, the Justice Department investigated his 2016 campaign’s ties to Russia. While special counsel Robert Mueller never found direct evidence of collusion, his final report did lay out evidence for obstruction. He noted that, because of a department opinion that bars indicting a sitting president, he couldn’t recommend Trump be criminally charged, even in secret.Since Trump left office, the investigations have circled ever closer.In January, his namesake company was fined $1.6 million for tax crimes, including conspiracy and falsifying business records. The company's longtime executive, Allen Weisselberg, is currently serving jail time as punishment for dodging taxes on job perks.Additional cases are still being pursued. In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been investigating whether Trump and his allies illegally meddled in the 2020 election. The foreperson of a special grand jury, which heard from dozens of witnesses. said last month that the panel had recommended that numerous people be indicted, and hinted Trump could be among them. It is ultimately up to Willis to decide whether to move forward.In Washington, Trump is under scrutiny from special counsel Jack Smith for his handling — allegations say mishandling — of classified documents after leaving office, as well as for his much-publicized efforts to stay in power, despite his 2020 election loss. Justice Department lawyers in the documents probe have said they have amassed evidence of potential crimes involving Trump's retention of national defense information as well as potential efforts to obstruct their work.Some legal experts have questioned the wisdom of having the Manhattan case be the first brought against Trump, when more serious charges could be looming. Trump is expected to be charged with falsifying business records, a misdemeanor unless prosecutors can prove it was done to conceal another crime. And the case dates back years.""Clearly it's not the cleanest criminal case that could be brought of all of them that are existing right now,"" said Michael Weinstein, an attorney and former Justice Department prosecutor, who said Trump would likely use its potential weaknesses to his political advantage.“By this case coming first, it gives him a opening to go on offense and attack, which for him is the only way he knows,"" Weinstein said.Still, he said the possible charges felt like a natural culmination of the “unbelievable array of investigations"" the former president ""has lived through and battled for the last 40 years.”“There's a history and pattern of him saying and doing things without resulting in any consequences,” Weinstein said. “After 40 years, do the criminal chickens come home to roost? He's been fighting a long time, and it could be in the next 12 months he's facing two or three criminal cases that carry serious criminal liability for him.""The New York case involves payments made by Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who served prison time after pleading guilty in 2018 to federal charges, to porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal. Cohen was reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as “legal expenses.”Politically, Trump allies believe the case actually will benefit the former president in the short term by energizing his base in a competitive Republican primary, and would provide another boost later on if it ultimately fails to yield a conviction.“The prosecutor in New York has done more to help Donald Trump get elected,” says Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., echoing other GOP officials, who have also argued the probe will likely help Trump in the short term, even if it could prove damaging in a general election.An indictment wouldn't stop Trump from continuing his campaign. There is no prohibition against running while facing criminal charges — or even following conviction. Indeed, convicted felons have run for president before, including from behind bars.“It boggles the mind to think that we have an ex-president on the eve of being indicted still the frontrunner for the Republican Party in 2024,” says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. “You would have thought (potentially) being arrested would have been a disqualifying factor in presidential politics. But Trump constantly surprises people by his devious and inappropriate behavior that he transcends by turning it into being a victim of a witch hunt.”",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842866,Phillies won't put Harper on 60-day IL; Dbacks lose catcher,"The Philadelphia Phillies are leaving open the possibility for Bryce Harper to return to their lineup much sooner than the All-Star break, but that doesn't necessarily mean a quicker-than-expected return for the slugger from reconstructive right elbow surgery.While Harper will begin the season on the injured list, Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said Tuesday that the two-time National League MVP will not, for now, be placed on the longer 60-day IL that would mean he couldn't be activated before the end of May.“I’m not setting any dates, but I’m just keeping that option open rather than closing an option,"" Dombrowski said from the team's spring training facility in Clearwater, Florida.After Harper had Tommy John surgery in November, the National League champions said they expected him back in the lineup as their designated hitter by the All-Star break in July. The slugger indicated the same when he got to camp last month, adding that they were going to be smart about his recovery and rehab.Dombrowski said the timetable hasn't really changed, and that the Phillies could still use the 60-day IL if they need to open a spot on the 40-man roster and know then Harper wouldn't be back before the end of May.“So it’s really not a great revelation other than to just say the reality is, I’m going to just keep our options open, because who knows what happens,” Dombrowski said.Going into the fifth season of a $330 million, 13-year contract with the Phillies, Harper hasn’t played right field since last April 16. He had a platelet-rich plasma injection on his elbow in May and became a full-time designated hitter to finish the season, helping lead the Phillies to their first World Series appearance since 2009.Dombrowski said Harper, who for now is still hitting soft toss in the batting cages every other day, is feeling great and has no pain.“All I've said, and all I'll continue to say, it’ll be before the All-Star break is our hope,” Dombrowski said. “But I’m also going to keep the option open that we’ll see what happens.”DIAMONDBACKS CATCHER OUTThe Arizona Diamondbacks will go into the season without catcher Carson Kelly, who has a broken bone in his right forearm after getting hit by a pitch in a Cactus League game.Kelly will likely miss several months, though manager Torey Lovullo wasn’t ready to discuss a potential timeline for the catcher’s return when announcing the diagnosis Tuesday.“I always hope for a miracle and that there’s going to be an unbelievable recovery,” Lovullo said a day after Kelly got struck by a pitch from Chicago White Sox right-hander Gregory Santos.Gabriel Moreno, the 23-year-old catcher the Diamondbacks acquired in a trade with Toronto during the offseason, could now become their starter. He made his big league debut last season hitting .319 in 25 games for the Blue Jays.The Diamondbacks also still have Jose Herrera, their backup last season, and P.J. Higgins in their spring training camp.“We’ve got to have our conversation and just watch these guys play. So to me, there is no leg up. Everybody’s neutral,” Lovullo said. “We’re throwing everything back into the pool and we’re going to start to figure out what to do. We’ve got some really good options.”SORE CUETOThe Miami Marlins are being cautious with veteran right-hander Johnny Cueto, who is dealing with arm soreness just over a week before the start of the regular season.First-year manager Skip Schumaker didn’t seem concerned Tuesday when explaining why Cueto didn’t do his scheduled work on a back field the previous day. Cueto had been set to throw about 70 pitches while simulating four or five innings.“This is a time where there’s no reason to push through this general soreness,” Schumaker said. “If he needs another extra day, you give people extra days and that’s the value of spring training. You’re allowed to do that.”Cueto, back in camp with the Marlins after making a start for the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic, is scheduled for a bullpen session Wednesday. If all goes well, he could pitch in a game for the Marlins on Friday.The 37-year-old Cueto is going into his 16th big league season. He pitched last year for the Chicago White Sox before his deal with the Marlins that will pay him $6 million this season and includes a $10.5 million team option for 2024 with a $2.5 million buyout.Cueto allowed 11 runs over 3 2/3 innings in his two spring starts for the Marlins before going to the WBC, where he allowed three runs over two innings in his lone start.NOLA AND SOTOSan Diego Padres manager Bob Melvin said Tuesday that there is “still a chance” catcher Austin Nola, who two days earlier was hit in the face by a pitch while batting, will get in another spring training game and be able to start the regular season with the team.Melvin said Nola has a slight fracture to his nose, but no black eye or excessive swelling. The catcher could resume some mild baseball activity by Wednesday or Thursday.“It’s remarkable to me,” Melvin said. “I’m shocked.”Melvin also reported that Juan Soto got an MRI on his strained left oblique that has bothered him since a “B” game on Sunday.“We’re thinking it’s fairly mild,” Melvin said of Soto.DODGERS OPENERJulio Urías is lined up to start on opening day for the Los Angeles Dodgers and that's OK with teammate Clayton Kershaw.Manager Dave Roberts hasn’t announced his scheduled starter for March 30 at home against Arizona. But Urías will pitch Friday in a Cactus League game against Milwaukee as he returns to Dodgers camp from participating in the World Baseball Classic with Mexico.That would put the left-hander on regular rest for the opener and set Kershaw for the second game of the year.Kershaw, a three-time NL Cy Young Award winner, has made a franchise-record nine opening-day starts for the Dodgers.“I’m excited for Julio to get to do it,” Kershaw said Tuesday. “I’m assuming Julio gets to do it. He deserves it. It is a special thing to get to do it. I think it should be whoever pitched the best the year before and he did that.”The 26-year-old Urías went 17-7 with a 2.16 ERA in 31 starts last season. He was 20-3 with a 2.96 ERA in 2021.Kershaw, who turned 35 on Sunday, is a nine-time All-Star with five ERA titles. But he’s been troubled by injuries in recent years. The left-hander was 12-3 with a 2.28 ERA in 22 starts covering 126 1/3 innings last season.LORENZEN UNCERTAINTYThe Detroit Tigers are unsure if right-hander Michael Lorenzen will pitch in another spring training game, making his availability for the start of the season uncertain.Lorenzen, who joined the Tigers on a $10 million, one-year deal during the offseason, is dealing with a left groin strain. He was scratched from his scheduled start Monday.“Day to day, it’s all we know,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said Tuesday. “We’ll see how he feels the next few days. Can’t make an assessment until that time goes by and he gets his treatment and we see where he’s at.”STEP FOR SOROKAMichael Soroka is set to make his Grapefruit League debut for the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday, though the 25-year-old right-hander won't be ready to be in their rotation at the start of the season.Soroka hasn't pitched in the majors since tearing his right Achilles in August 2020 and having three different surgeries. He then had hamstring tightness at the start of spring training.After being an All-Star as a rookie in 2019, when he was 13-4 with a 2.68 ERA in 29 starts, Soroka tore his right Achilles three starts into the pandemic-impacted 2020 season. He tore that Achilles again the following summer, then was sidelined until throwing in six minor league games last year.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842867,"MLB plans to announce rules tweaks, week before opening day","MIAMI (AP) — Major League Baseball's new pitch clock is going to undergo some timing adjustments before it is turned on for games that count.Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred called the changes “significant” but also described them as “clarifications” based on input from players. The alterations are likely to be announced Wednesday, eight days before opening day.“They’re important in my mind because they’re responsive to things players said to us,” he said before Tuesday night's World Baseball Classic championship game between the United States and Japan.Baseball’s 11-man competition committee, established in the labor agreement last March, adopted the pitch clock and shift limits last September over the opposition of the four players on the panel. MLB set the pitch clock at 15 seconds with no runners and 20 seconds with runners.MLB also is limiting pickoff attempts and requiring two infielders to be on either side of second and all infielders to be within the outer boundary of the infield when the pitcher is on the rubber.Players have talked about the need to accommodate certain plays that delay a pitcher from getting on the mound, such as after backing up first base.“We have another set of issues that we want to see some regular-season games before we make a decision on them,” Manfred said. “I’ve met with six teams' players already. Our feet are not in stone on this, on the one hand, and we are prepared to make adjustments based on input. On the other hand, we want to give it a chance to see exactly how it plays out after a period of adjustment in some regular-season games before we make any really significant alteration.”Further adjustments may be made during the season.“The ones we’re doing right now I regard to be clarifications,” Manfred said. “They were things that the rules contemplated.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842868,Avalanche coach Jared Bednar signs extension through '26-27,"DENVER (AP) — Colorado Avalanche coach Jared Bednar has signed a three-year extension that will keep him in charge of the reigning Stanley Cup champions through the 2026-27 season.The new deal for the winningest head coach in club history kicks in once the current contract runs out after the 2023-24 season.Bednar, 51, is the only person to win championships in the ECHL, AHL and NHL as head coach. He directed the Avalanche to their third Stanley Cup title in team history last season by beating Tampa Bay, the two-time defending champions.This season, the Avalanche have dealt with an array of injuries, which include missing captain Gabriel Landeskog all year after he underwent knee surgery in October. But they're starting to creep closer to being healthy — and working their way up the standings. Colorado is riding a six-game winning streak to remain in a tight race with Dallas and Minnesota for the Central Division crown. The top spot in the Western Conference is in play, too.“Jared has done a tremendous job behind the bench and certainly deserves this extension and to continue as the leader of our team,"" Joe Sakic, the team's president of hockey operations, said in a statement.It wasn't the prettiest of starts for Bednar in his inaugural season for Colorado. In 2016-17, his team amassed only 48 points (22-56-4) to finish last in the league. Since then, it's been full steam ahead for Bednar and the Avalanche. They became the first NHL squad to go from worst to first in a span of four seasons or less since the 1970-71 Bruins, according to research by the team.In addition, Bednar has led the Avalanche to five straight playoff appearances — and is closing in on a sixth — to become the first Avalanche coach to accomplish the feat. His 40 postseason wins are the second-most in team history, trailing only Bob Hartley (49).“His strength as a communicator, his relationship with the players, the way he prepares each and every day is a huge reason our team has been so successful,"" general manager Chris MacFarland said. ""He is an exceptional leader.”Bednar is currently the third-longest tenured coach in the league, behind only Tampa Bay’s Jon Cooper (March 2013) and Pittsburgh’s Mike Sullivan (December 2015).""Being able to lead this team over the last seven years has been a privilege,” said Bednar, whose team faces the Penguins on Wednesday. “I am grateful and excited to have the opportunity to continue building on what we’ve accomplished so far.”Bednar captured a Kelly Cup (ECHL) with the South Carolina Stingrays in 2009, along with a Calder Cup (AHL) with the Lake Erie Monsters in 2016.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842869,"Pence seeks 'common sense' Social Security, Medicare reform","As he mulls a 2024 presidential bid, former Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday called for “common sense and compassionate solutions"" to reform entitlement programs and the nation's debt burden, suggesting changes to Social Security and Medicare programs hurtling toward insolvency, particularly for younger generations, without naming specific recommendations.“What we need now is leadership because, if we act in this moment with the support of this generation, we can introduce common sense reforms that will never touch anyone who is in retirement, or anyone who will retire in the next 25 years,” Pence told an audience of college students at Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. “It’ll just take courage to do it, and that’s where your generation will come in.”What to do with Social Security and Medicare, as the programs close in on projected insolvency dates, has emerged as a dividing line for Republicans seeking to lead their party in the 2024 presidential contest.Forecasters say Social Security won’t be able to pay out its promised benefits in about a dozen years, and Medicare won’t be able to do so in just five years. Economists say both programs will drive the national debt higher in the decades to come, forcing teeth-gritting choices for the next generation of lawmakers.Pence — yet to announce a 2024 presidential bid but saying Tuesday he was “continuing to pray and reflect” on one — has previously suggested tweaks for the programs, telling CNBC in February that cuts to Medicare and Social Security should be “on the table for the long term.”“President Biden won’t even discuss common sense reforms of Social Security and Medicare, and too many leaders in my political party take the same position,” Pence said during remarks at Washington & Lee's quadrennial mock presidential nominating convention known as Mock Con. It predicts the presidential nominee of the party out of power in the White House.“If that frustrates you, good — it should, because it’ll be your generation that’s robbed of your dreams and opportunities,"" he said.Pence's ideas are broadly in line with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, already in the 2024 GOP race, who last week opened the door to potential cuts for younger generations. During a campaign rally in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Haley said that, while she wouldn’t touch the benefits of older people who retired with certain guarantees of a financial future, “the rules have changed” for “anyone new coming in this system.”Other Republicans likely vying for the party's nomination disagree. At the Conservative Political Action Conference this month, former President Donald Trump — officially mounting a third run — took a veiled jab at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, calling out those who have proposed raising the age for Social Security or privatizing Medicare — positions DeSantis has expressed support for in the past but has since abandoned.“We’re not going to mess with Social Security as Republicans,” DeSantis, yet to announce a 2024 run, recently said.Many leading Republicans have recently sought to signal their unwillingness to touch entitlement programs, though the GOP has a long history of threatening to slash the benefits. Democrats have pointed to a plan by Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, introduced last year but later amended, that called for all federal spending legislation to sunset in five years, subject to votes in Congress that could preserve programs.Met with boos from congressional Republicans when he said during his State of the Union address that “some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset,"" President Joe Biden last week took aim at “MAGA” Republicans he said are intent on dialing back Medicare coverage for millions of Americans, promising to “defend and strengthen” the programs.After Biden’s speech, Scott amended the plan to exempt Social Security, Medicare, national security, veterans benefits and other essential services.___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842870,Couple faces murder charges in Crow girl's 2019 death,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A Montana couple faces charges of murder and tampering with evidence in the 2019 disappearance and death of a 6-year-old girl on the Crow Indian Reservation, according to court documents.Mildred Alexis Old Crow was physically assaulted and left in a bathtub to drown before her body was wrapped in plastic and concealed inside a container, Big Horn County Attorney Jeanne Torske said in court documents.The container was taped shut and remained hidden for more than two years while the defendants collected benefits that were meant for the victim, Torske wrote.Roseen Lincoln and Veronica Dust, both 36 years old, could face life in prison if convicted in state district court. They remained in custody Tuesday on $1 million bond each and were scheduled to be arraigned on March 28 before state District Judge Matthew Wald in Hardin.Indigenous women are victimized at astonishing rates, with federal figures showing that they — along with non-Hispanic Black women — have experienced the highest homicide rates.A 2018 Associated Press investigation found nobody knows the precise number of cases of missing and murdered Native Americans nationwide because many go unreported, others aren’t well documented, and no government database specifically tracks them.The suspects in Mildred's death could not be reached for comment and did not have attorneys, court officials said. Lincoln previously was identified in court documents as Roseen Lincoln Old Crow.The defendants were initially arrested in December 2020 as suspects in the girl’s disappearance. They were convicted months later of misdemeanor endangerment and custodial interference, and sentenced in Crow tribal court to 18 months in jail and $2,000 each in fines. The tribal court does not prosecute major crimes.Mildred — a direct descendant of Chief Pretty Eagle, one of the Crow’s last war chiefs — was removed from her birth mother and placed in the care of Lincoln and Dust in 2017, Torske said.Family members described the victim as their “Little Angel” and said she had loved to dance, especially at powwows.In November 2020, Mildred's relatives informed federal investigators that they had not seen the girl since April 2019. Her body was discovered in February 2021 in a trailer near the tiny community of Garryowen, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of the Montana-Wyoming border.An autopsy revealed a head cut on the girl's body and signs that she was habitually abused before her death, Torske said. Violence against the girl occurred generally when the defendants had been drinking, the prosecutor wrote. None of the previous incidents of abuse were reported to authorities, Torske said.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842871,Lawsuit seeks to block abortion pill ban in Wyoming,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Abortion-rights supporters filed an amended lawsuit Tuesday seeking to block Wyoming's new abortion pill ban from taking effect.A group hoping to open what would be the state's second clinic offering abortions filed the amended lawsuit days after Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed what is the nation's first explicit ban on abortion pills. Absent court intervention, that ban would take effect July 1.Abortion-rights supporters already were seeking to block a separate sweeping abortion ban that took effect Sunday in Wyoming without the governor's signature. That law seeks to overcome objections that prompted a judge to suspend a previous ban.The abortion pill ban and the sweeping ban conflict and create confusion about what is and isn’t permissible under the new laws, according to the lawsuit. If they’re allowed to be in effect, “the fundamental rights of Wyoming women and their families will be taken away by the state government and those rights will cease to exist,” the amended lawsuit said.Both of the new Wyoming abortion bans make exceptions to save a pregnant woman’s life and for cases of rape or incest that are reported to police.Until Gordon signed the ban on medication abortions, no state had passed a law specifically prohibiting such pills, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. However, abortion pills already were banned in 13 other states with blanket bans on abortion, and 15 states already had limited access to the pills.Medication abortions also are a target of a separate lawsuit in Texas, where abortion opponents have asked a federal judge to reverse the Food and Drug Administration's 2000 approval of mifepristone. A two-pill combination of mifepristone and another drug is the most common form of abortion in the U.S.Wyoming has only one abortion provider, a women’s health clinic in Jackson that only provides medication abortions but has canceled appointments after the state's broad ban took effect this week. Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens is scheduled to hold a hearing Wednesday to consider whether to block that new ban while the legal challenge over it moves ahead.Wellspring Health Access, which is seeking to block the abortion pill ban and the broader measure, has been planning to open a clinic in Casper that would provide surgical and medication abortions. After an arson attack prevented that clinic from opening as planned last summer, organizers hoped to open it next month.“Wyomingites deserve access to the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including both surgical and medication abortion, and that’s why we are fighting to keep medication abortion legal in Wyoming,” Julie Burkart, president of Wellspring Health Access said in a statement.Also suing are four women, including two gynecologists, and Chelsea's Fund, a Wyoming abortion access advocacy group.Wyoming Attorney General Bridget Hill “will vigorously defend the legality of this law, just as she does with all statutes when their constitutionality is challenged,” Gordon spokesman Michael Pearlman said by email.Until this week, abortion had remained legal in Wyoming despite a ban that followed the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade abortion ruling. In putting that ban on hold in July, Owens ruled that it stood to harm women with pregnancy complications and their doctors.She also found that a 2012 state constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to make one's own health care decisions could allow abortion.The new sweeping ban asserts that abortion is not health care and the amendment therefore doesn't apply to abortion.Since the reversal of the Roe in June, abortion restrictions have been up to states, and the landscape has shifted quickly.Other states where courts have put on hold bans or deep restrictions are Arizona, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, South Carolina and Utah. Idaho courts forced the state to allow abortions during medical emergencies.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842872,Only 1 Black rep gets role in talks on Mississippi policing,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — One Black lawmaker and nine white ones have been chosen to negotiate final versions of bills that could expand the territory of a state-run police department inside Mississippi's majority-Black capital city.Critics say the bills are a way for the Republican-controlled state government to exert control over Jackson, which is 83% Black and is governed by Democrats.The Black lawmaker chosen as a negotiator, Democratic Rep. Earle Banks of Jackson, said Tuesday that his goal is to have a safer city. With just under 150,000 residents, Jackson has had more than 100 homicides for each of the past three years.“I think there is a desire by citizens in the city of Jackson for additional police protection, and Capitol Police may be the answer to that,” Banks told The Associated Press.Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and House Speaker Philip Gunn, both Republicans, on Tuesday finished selecting the senators and representatives to work on the final versions of two bills. The negotiators face a deadline to finish their work by next week.Banks said he is not surprised eight of the negotiators are white Republicans, one is a white independent and one is a Black Democrat because the GOP holds a wide majority in the state House and Senate.“It's the reality of the political world we live in,” Banks said.Since January, the Mississippi House and Senate have passed different versions of two bills that would give the state-run Capitol Police department wider territory to patrol inside Jackson.One of the bills also would create a wider role for judges who are appointed rather than elected — a proposal that critics say would strip away voting rights in a state where many older Black people still remember being denied access to the ballot before the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 became law.Banks — who has voted against both bills so far — told AP that he does not think the final proposals will create permanent new courts with appointed judges, as House Republicans originally sought. He said, though, that he thinks Capitol Police will get a larger patrol area.“I've heard from doctors. I've heard from lawyers. I've heard from retired people,” Banks said. “People want more protection than they have now.”Jackson Police Department covers the entire city, but it is short-staffed. Capitol Police currently patrol near state government buildings in and near downtown. The Senate voted to expand Capitol Police territory to the entire city, but the House voted for an expansion only into relatively affluent shopping and residential areas, including some predominantly white neighborhoods.Banks acknowledged some Jackson residents have raised concerns that Capitol Police are more aggressive than city police.“It's not going to be martial law,” Banks said.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842873,Cam Newton throws at Auburn's pro day,"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — After not playing at all during the 2022 season, Cam Newton got to show what he can still do.Newton threw in front of scouts at a pro day event on Tuesday at Auburn, where he won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship in the 2010 season.The 2015 NFL Most Valuable Player was invited to throw at Auburn by his younger brother, Caylin — a former quarterback at Howard who finished his collegiate career as a wide receiver at Auburn and William & Mary.“This was him showing love to me,” Caylin Newton said of his older brother. “He doesn’t owe anybody anything. He has had an amazing journey, an amazing career in the NFL. He has nothing to prove to anybody. ... He came to show his ability, show he still has it.“I think, for him, this was a selfless act. But it was also to show and prove to everybody he’s not sitting around. He’s still got it. Whatever organization wants to get a winning quarterback, his number’s still open and available.”Cam Newton declined to speak to reporters in Auburn on Tuesday. During the workout, Newton threw more than 30 passes to several NFL hopefuls from Auburn, including wide receiver Shedrick Jackson.“That was fun,” Jackson said. “That was probably my most favorite part, just learning his lingo, seeing his cadence. He’s got good touch on the ball. ... I think he’s still got it.”In perhaps the biggest highlight of the workout, Newton showcased his trademark scrambling ability in the pocket before throwing a 50-yard pass downfield to his younger brother.Newton, who has played 11 seasons as a pro, hasn’t attempted a pass in an NFL game since Dec. 26, 2021. He rejoined the Carolina Panthers midway through the 2021 season and went 0-5 as a starting quarterback.Newton’s last full season in the league came in 2020, when he was a member of the New England Patriots. Newton was a three-time Pro Bowl selection in his first stint with the Panthers, where he won both AP Offensive Rookie of the Year and MVP honors while also leading the team to Super Bowl 50.The No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 draft made headlines Monday evening when he announced on social media that he would throw at Auburn’s pro day.“Tell me how these randoms keep getting jobs?” Newton said in a video posted to Twitter. “Don’t worry about it. I’m gonna show you. I can’t wait to show you.”According to his younger brother, Newton has been working hard to get back into the league after a year away.“What everyone sees on the TV screen, they see his character and they see his confidence,” Caylin Newton said.“They don’t see the grit. They don’t see how many hours he puts in. So the media has what they say about who he is. I know who he is. And anywhere he’s been, they know who he is, too.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842877,OneHypernet extends wholesale FX rates to SMEs,"SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 22 March 2023 - OneHypernet, a money transfer network that connects financial institutions for foreign exchange (FX) payments, has announced that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can now access wholesale FX rates for their money transfers / remittances. In addition, SMEs receive cashback on their transactions. OneHypernet offers price matching via WhatsApp, ensuring that SMEs get the best possible rates.   SMEs are often misled by money transfer pricing  Comparing the cost of money transfers can be tricky because providers present their FX rates and fees differently. Some charge variable fees, some charge fixed fees, and some simply present an FX rate that includes a mark-up.   This makes a like-for-like comparison of FX rates and fees difficult. Instead of comparing fees or FX rates, SMEs should consider the foreign currency amount that needs to be transferred, then compare the final payment in their local currency (net of any fees and cashback).   For example, for a Singapore based SME that is making a payment of MYR 150,000 to Malaysia, the comparison should be made between the final cost in SGD of executing this payment via the different providers.       SMEs save 1-2% on average with OneHypernet     The interbank / mid-market or ""Google"" rate may not be the best rate  Many providers claim to offer transparent pricing by charging a variable fee on top of the interbank rate. However, SMEs should be mindful that this can also be misleading.   For example, if the provider offers a mark-up of 0.50% over the interbank rate, the SME may believe that their ""cost"" is only 0.50%, because interbank rates are mistakenly used as a proxy for the best possible FX rate.   This is not always the case because money transfer rates can often be better than interbank rates, sometimes by as much as 3%. In this example, if the SME had used a platform with a better FX rate, they could have saved 3.5% on their money transfer, or S$1,575 for a typical SME remittance of SGD 45,000.   Save more with OneHypernet  OneHypernet conducted a comparison of the cost of sending MYR 150,000 on 21 Mar 2023 from popular providers in Singapore. The results showed that SMEs using OneHypernet for their remittances can save up to S$745 for this transaction.   Signing up for a OneHypernet account is free and takes less than a minute via Myinfo / Singpass.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842895,Man sentenced to 30 years after police officer shot friend,"WETUMPKA, Ala. (AP) — LaKeith Smith was 15 when a police officer shot and killed his friend when the teens were caught burglarizing homes in Alabama, but it is Smith who will spend decades in prison for his friend's death.A judge on Tuesday sentenced Smith, now 24, to 30 years in prison — a reduction from the more than 50 years he originally received, but a blow to his family and advocates who argued he should not spend decades in prison for a killing he did not commit.The new sentencing hearing was held after a judge ruled Smith’s original lawyer failed to present possible mitigating evidence about his home life and mental health.Circuit Judge Sibley Reynolds handed down the new sentence after a lengthy court hearing. Sibley gave Smith the same punishment he previously handed down — 30 years for the felony murder charge and 25 years for burglary and theft — but this time allowed the sentences to run concurrently, instead of stacked on top of one another.“What he received today was not justice. It was clearly an over-sentence,” defense attorney Leroy Maxwell said after court. He said they will pursue an appeal.Maxwell said the case, which has garnered national attention because of Smith's age and the sentence he received, is the “poster child” for the misuse of felony murder laws that allow someone to be charged for a killing during commission of a felony even if the death was unintentional.The fatal shooting happened on Feb. 23, 2015, when Millbrook police officers responded to a call of a burglary in progress. A Millbrook police officer shot and killed 16-year-old A’Donte Washington when officers surprised the teens, local news outlets reported. A grand jury cleared the officer in the shooting. The surviving four teens were charged with felony murder. Three took a plea deal, and Smith went to trial.The Elmore County courtroom, which sits across the highway from a state prison, erupted in angry shouts after the judge handed down the sentence, attorneys and others said.“He's not a murderer. He doesn't deserve 55 or 30 years,” Smith's mother, Brontina Smith, said after court.Maxwell argued LaKeith Smith was the least culpable of the teens because he was the youngest and there was no evidence he fired a gun.The judge heard testimony about Smith's difficult home life, as well as a request from Washington's father to let Smith go free.“They were kids, just kids. I don’t condone them going to somebody’s house and whatever. Give them time for that. But the murder of my child? No,” Andre Washington said after court.District Attorney CJ Robinson, who was the prosecutor in the case before being elected as district attorney, said the sentence is within the allowed guidelines.“There are no winners here. Never have been (in) this case,"" Robinson said via text after court. He supported the new sentencing hearing for Smith, agreeing that Smith's original trial lawyer did an inadequate job at sentencing.“I do wish I had heard LaKeith stand up and acknowledge that he made a series of choices that resulted in his friends death. Maybe to him he did that, but I’m not sure that message was communicated in court,” Robinson wrote.The case has put a spotlight on the state's felony murder law, a legal doctrine that holds someone liable for murder if they participate in a felony, such as a robbery, that results in someone’s death. Most states have felony murder laws, but rules vary on their use. According to a 2022 report by the Sentencing Project, a group advocating against mass incarceration, 14 states allow people engaged in a felony to be convicted of felony murder for a killing committed by a third party if it can be characterized as a foreseeable result of their action.",2023/03/22,,World

Police announced late Tuesday that the remains of a second victim had been recovered from the rubble and sent to a forensics laboratory for identification.“I also talked with An’s other friends and other relatives. We still cannot totally understand why it takes so long,” Zeng told reporters near the building.Zeng described Wu as a neuroscientist doing post-doctoral work at the University California San Diego who was in Montreal for a conference. He said the 31-year-old decided to extend her stay for a night because she loved the city, adding that the late Montrealer Leonard Cohen was her favorite singer and poet.He said Wu’s parents were coming to Montreal from their home in China, and he hoped that they would be able to get more information than he had been able to.Inspector David Shane told reporters that the unstable structure of the building mades it complicated and potentially dangerous to recover bodies. He said several floors of the building collapsed on each other, leaving devastation.Shane said identifying the bodies would be a “long process,” in part because victims needed to be identified through at least one scientific method, such as dental records or DNA.Jonathan Clark, who lives in New York, came to Montreal to say goodbye to his dear friend Saniya Khan, whom he referred to as his “twin flame.”Clark said Khan was in Montreal for a trip with her childhood friend Dania Zafar. Both women, who are now believed to be missing, “were very young, very bright, beautiful, living life,” he said.Charlie Lacroix, an 18-year-old from the Montreal suburb of Terrebonne, was also identified by her father as one of the missing. Lacroix’s father said his daughter, who had “everything in front of her,” had rented a unit in the building on Airbnb with a friend.Police have said the historic building included units that were rented on the platform Airbnb, which is outlawed by the city in the area. They did not confirm how many of the missing people were tourists.The fire has prompted renewed scrutiny of the short-term rental platform, and Montreal’s mayor has called for Airbnb to stop listing units that don’t have a permit proving they are operating legally.Lacroix’s father, who has said his daughter told 911 operators that she was trapped in a unit with no fire escape or windows, called on the city to ensure Airbnbs and apartments have proper exits.Airbnb has said it is supporting victims and assisting police, but has not answered questions on whether it is willing to crack down on illegal listings.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842897,Muslim authorities say Ramadan fasting to begin Thursday,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Muslim authorities in Saudi Arabia and several other Middle Eastern countries say this year's fasting month of Ramadan will begin Thursday based on the expected sighting of the crescent moon.Clerics across the region said the moon was not visible Tuesday night, meaning it will almost certainly appear the following evening, heralding the start of the monthlong observance.During Ramadan, Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and sexual intercourse from sunrise until sunset. Even a tiny sip of water or a puff of smoke is enough to invalidate the fast. At night, family and friends gather and feast in a festive atmosphere.The fasting is aimed at bringing the faithful closer to God and reminding them of the suffering of the poor. Muslims are expected to strictly observe daily prayers and engage in heightened religious contemplation. They are also urged to refrain from gossip, fighting or cursing during the holy month.Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam and is required for all healthy Muslims.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842903,How Trump will use any indictment to fire up his 2024 campaign,"Donald Trump will try to turn any indictment to his advantage by stoking anger among core supporters over what they see as the weaponization of the justice system, though it may also push more Republicans tired of the drama around him to look for another presidential candidate.A Manhattan grand jury could bring charges as soon as this week against the former Republican president for alleged hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford.While the prosecution of a former president is unprecedented in U.S. history and places Trump in legal peril, it will likely be viewed by his most loyal supporters as politically motivated and only harden their determination to back him in the 2024 Republican primary, party officials, strategists and political analysts told Reuters.""I think this will strengthen the resolve of his supporters,"" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist who represented Trump in many media appearances during the 2020 presidential campaign.But to win the party's nomination, Trump will likely have to broaden his support beyond the 25%-30% of the Republican electorate generally thought to be in his corner no matter what, especially if the field of Republican candidates narrows in the coming months. An indictment could make it difficult for him to broaden his appeal.Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said some Republicans could be swayed by the charges to back Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or another potential candidate without Trump's legal baggage, which has grown considerably since he left the White House in 2021.""It’s not good for Trump, the question is how bad for Trump it is,"" said Sabato. ""There could be multiple indictments ... it begins to add up to a major problem.""Trump's campaign has accused the Manhattan District Attorney's office, as well as prosecutors pursuing separate cases against him in Georgia and at the federal level, of doing the bidding of Democrats out to stop his re-election campaign.People close to Trump said his campaign would seek to frame the indictment as proof that all prosecutions - including his two impeachments in Congress - are unjustified attempts by the ""Deep State"" to undermine him and his supporters.Trump will have more social media outlets to get his message across after YouTube became the latest platform to reinstate him on Friday. Trump was cut off from YouTube, Facebook and Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol. He has now been reinstated on all three, giving him a powerful megaphone to rally his base, as he did effectively during his 2016 White House run.It is unclear how Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination will approach the indictment, although several have already made clear they view any attempt to charge Trump as politically motivated.Sam DeMarco, chair of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania's Allegheny County, said candidates will likely allude to the need for less drama without explicitly calling Trump out.DeSantis got a taste of that on Monday when he criticized what he said was the politicization of the Manhattan DA's office but also took a veiled swipe at his rival. Trump responded aggressively with an innuendo-filled post on his Truth Social platform.'TEFLON DON'DeMarco said Republicans would view the Manhattan indictment as political, given that federal prosecutors reviewed the Daniels case in 2018 and decided not to charge Trump, although it is Justice Department policy not to indict a sitting president.Republicans would take a similar view of any charges arising out of the ongoing investigation in Fulton County, Georgia, into Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden there, said DeMarco, who plans to vote for DeSantis should he run.Trump has defied predictions of his demise numerous times since he launched his bid for the White House in 2015. Sometimes called ""Teflon Don"" for his record of skirting accountability, Trump once bragged that he could gun down someone in the middle of Manhattan and not face consequences.Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite the emergence of the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which he made vulgar comments about women. And in 2018, when he was president, he paid no apparent political price for the Stormy Daniels affair, even as his lawyer went to prison for arranging the payments and pointed the finger at Trump.Trump remains the front-runner in the 2024 Republican field, with the support of 44% of Republicans in a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Monday, ahead of DeSantis' 30% support.",2023/03/22,175,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842912,Qualcomm speeds shift of chip production from China to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. smartphone chip designer Qualcomm is accelerating the movement of its supply out of China in favor of Taiwan, with plans to boost its purchases in the island country to NT$300 million (US$9.83 million) in 2024.In response to the increased geopolitical risks incurred by the U.S.-China chip war, mobile phone chip manufacturer Qualcomm has accelerated the transfer of chip production supply chains out of China. Orders that had previously been entrusted to Chinese wafer foundries or packaging and testing factories are steadily being transferred to firms in Taiwan.Mass production of chips for Qualcomm in Taiwan will start after certifications are completed in the second quarter, and Taiwanese suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC), United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), Chunghwa Precision Test (CHPT), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (ASE Group), Sporton International Inc., and Unimicron will benefit directly, reported Commercial Times.Qualcomm held an opening ceremony for a manufacturing engineering and testing center in Hsinchu on Friday (March 17), demonstrating that Taiwan is a top player in advanced manufacturing processes and semiconductor testing. Qualcomm has plans to accelerate its sourcing in Taiwan to NT$300 billion in 2024.According to industry analysts, the demand for smartphones is weak, but Qualcomm has expanded its production scale in Taiwan. In addition to Qualcomm's success in non-consumer fields such as automotive electronics and industrial automation in recent years, the key reason for moving to Taiwan is that the US-China chip war has prompted Qualcomm to shift production away from China amid heightened geopolitical risks.Based on information released by Qualcomm, its front-end wafer manufacturing partners in Taiwan include TSMC and UMC. The wafer test interface supplier is CHPT, and the back-end packaging and testing manufacturing partners include ASE Group, Siliconware Precision Industries Co. (SPIL), Unimicron, and Sporton. Partners in ultrasonic fingerprint recognition include ASE Holdings, Mirle Automation Corp, General Interface, and Nano Electronics and Micro System Technologies, Inc.The U.S. Department of Commerce released the latest semiconductor restrictions on China in October last year, extending the restrictions on logic integrated circuits to the memory category. In addition to Chinese-funded enterprises, foreign-funded production bases located in China now also need to apply for licenses on a case-by-case basis in order to continue to obtain manufacturing-related equipment.This year, the U.S. teamed up with the Netherlands and Japan to expand the restrictions on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.Under such circumstances, various OEM factories have begun to request the relocation of chip production. End products in the Chinese market can continue to use Chinese-made chips, but non-Chinese markets require the reduction or discontinuation of Chinese-made chips.As far as Qualcomm is concerned, as long as the end market for chips produced by Chinese wafer foundries and packaging and testing factories is outside China, the production supply chain will be transferred to Taiwan and South Korea, and Taiwan will be the most important recipient of these transfer orders, stated the Commercial Times.According to industry insiders, Qualcomm began to adjust the supply chain in response to geopolitical risks in the third quarter of last year and began to divert production away from China in the fourth quarter. Judging from current progress, it is anticipated that orders will be transferred to Taiwan's semiconductor production chain and mass production will begin in the second quarter of this year.Furthermore, Qualcomm's 4nm and 3nm wafer foundry orders are also concentrated in Taiwan, and TSMC is already the recipient of large orders.Qualcomm has sped up the move out of China by transferring orders to Taiwan's chip foundries and assembly/test firms, media reports, noting Qualcomm plans to increase Taiwan sourcing to NT$300 billion by 2024. $TSM $UMC $ASE $QCOM https://t.co/TGB0Mvj2OJ",2023/03/22,5229,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842918,"Ignoring experts, China’s sudden zero-COVID exit cost hundreds of thousands of lives","BEIJING (AP) — When China suddenly scrapped onerous zero-COVID measures in December, the country wasn’t ready for a massive onslaught of cases. Hospitals turned away ambulances, crematoriums burned bodies around the clock, and relatives hauled dead loved ones to warehouses for lack of storage space.Chinese state media claimed the decision to open up was based on “scientific analysis and shrewd calculation,” and “by no means impulsive.” But in reality, China’s ruling Communist Party ignored repeated efforts by top medical experts to kickstart exit plans until it was too late, The Associated Press found.Instead, the reopening came suddenly at the onset of winter, when the virus spreads most easily. Many older people weren’t vaccinated, pharmacies lacked antivirals, and hospitals didn’t have adequate supplies or staff — leading to as many as hundreds of thousands of deaths that could have been avoided, according to academic modeling, more than 20 interviews with current and former Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention employees, experts and government advisers, and internal reports and directives obtained by the AP.“If they had a real plan to exit earlier, so many things could have been avoided,” said Zhang Zuo-Feng, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Many deaths could have been prevented.”For two years, China stood out for its tough but successful controls against the virus, credited with saving millions of lives as other countries struggled with stop-and-start lockdowns. But with the emergence of the highly infectious omicron variant in late 2021, many of China’s top medical experts and officials worried zero-COVID was unsustainable.In late 2021, China’s leaders began discussing how to lift restrictions. As early as March 2022, top medical experts submitted detailed proposals to prepare for a gradual exit to the State Council, China’s cabinet.But discussions were silenced after an outbreak the same month in Shanghai, which prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to lock the city down. Zero-COVID had become a point of national pride, and Beijing’s crackdown on dissent under Xi had made scientists reluctant to speak out against the party line.By the time the Shanghai outbreak was under control, China was months away from the 20th Party Congress, the country’s most important political meeting in a decade, making reopening politically difficult. So the country stuck to mass testing and quarantining millions of people, even as omicron evaded increasingly draconian controls.Unrest began to simmer, with demonstrations, factory riots, and shuttered businesses. The pressure mounted until the authorities suddenly yielded, allowing the virus to sweep the country with no warning — and with deadly consequence.Experts estimate that many hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps millions, may have died in China’s wave of COVID — far higher than the official toll of under 90,000, but still a much lower death rate than in Western countries. However, 200,000 to 300,000 deaths could have been prevented if the country was better vaccinated and stocked with antivirals, according to modeling by the University of Hong Kong and scientist estimates. Some scientists think even more lives could have been saved.“It wasn’t a sound public health decision at all,” said a China CDC official, declining to be named to speak candidly on a sensitive matter. “It’s absolutely bad timing … this was not a prepared opening.”___Toward the end of 2021, many public health experts and leaders began thinking about how to exit from the zero-COVID policy. The less lethal but far more infectious omicron made curbing COVID-19 harder and the risks of its spread lower, and nearby Korea, Japan and Singapore were all loosening controls.That winter, the State Council appointed public health experts to a new committee tasked with reviewing COVID-19 controls, which submitted a report in March 2022, four people with knowledge of it said. The existence of the document is being reported for the first time by the AP.It concluded it was time for China to begin preparations for a possible reopening. It ran over 100 pages long and included detailed proposals to boost China’s stalling vaccination campaign, increase ICU bed capacity, stock up on antivirals, and order patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms to stay at home, one of the people said. It also included a proposal to designate Hainan, a tropical island in the country’s south, as a pilot zone to experiment with relaxing controls.But then things began going awry.A chaotic, deadly outbreak in Hong Kong alarmed Beijing. Then in March, the virus began spreading in Shanghai, China’s cosmopolitan finance hub.Initially, Shanghai took a light approach with targeted lockdowns sealing individual buildings — a pioneering strategy led by doctor Zhang Wenhong, who had been openly calling on the government to prepare to reopen. But soon, officials in neighboring provinces complained they were seeing cases from Shanghai and asked the central leadership to lock the city down, according to three people familiar with the matter.China CDC contact tracing reports obtained by the AP show that a nearby province was detecting dozens of COVID-19 cases by early March, all from Shanghai. Provincial officials argued that they lacked Shanghai’s medical resources and capacity to trace the virus, risking its spread to the entire country before China was ready.At the same time, China’s flagging vaccination rate for older residents and the deaths in Hong Kong spooked authorities, as did reports of long COVID-19 abroad. When Shanghai failed to get control of the virus, the top leadership stepped in. Partial lockdowns in Shanghai were announced in late March. On April 2, then-Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, a top official known widely as the “COVID czar,” traveled there to oversee a total lockdown.“They lost their nerve,” said an expert in regular contact with Chinese health officials.Shanghai was ill-prepared. Residents exploded in anger online, complaining of hunger and spotty supplies. But Beijing made it clear that the lockdown would continue.“Resolutely uphold zero-COVID,” an editorial in the state-run People’s Daily said. “Persistence is victory,” said Xi.___After Shanghai locked down, Chinese public health experts stopped speaking publicly about preparing for an exit. None dared openly challenge a policy supported by Xi. Some experts were blacklisted from Chinese media, one told the AP.“Anybody who wanted to say something that is different from the official narrative was basically just silenced,” the blacklisted expert said.In early April, China’s State Council leaked a letter from the European Chamber of Commerce urging relaxation of zero-COVID controls. Council officials wanted to spark debate but didn’t feel empowered to raise the issue themselves, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.The State Council’s information office did not respond to a fax requesting comment.Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, also hinted at the need to prepare for an exit. At a mid-April internal panel discussion recently made public by the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization think tank, Gao was quoted as saying “omicron is not that dangerous,” that there were public discussions on whether zero-COVID needed to be adjusted, and that they “hope to reach a consensus as soon as possible.”Weeks later, at a private event at the German Embassy in Beijing, Gao agreed with foreign experts urging China to plan a reopening and then strode off the stage, according to three attendees who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Gao did not respond to an email requesting comment.There were also hints that opinions differed high in the party.In private meetings with Western business chambers in May, then-Premier Li Keqiang, who was head of the State Council and the party’s No. 2 official at the time, appeared sympathetic to complaints about how zero-COVID was crushing the economy, according to a participant and another briefed on the meetings. It was a stark contrast with pre-recorded remarks from Xi that listed defeating COVID as the top priority. But under Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, Li was powerless, analysts say.Public health experts split into camps. Those who thought zero-COVID unsustainable — like Gao and Zhang, the Shanghai doctor — fell silent. But Liang Wannian, then head of the central government’s expert working group on COVID-19, kept vocally advocating for zero-COVID as a way to defeat the virus. Though Liang has a doctorate in epidemiology, he is sometimes accused of pushing the party line rather than science-driven policies.“He knows what Xi wants to hear,” said Ray Yip, the founding head of the United States CDC office in China.Liang shot down suggestions for reopening in internal meetings in January and May of 2022, Yip said, making it difficult for others to suggest preparations for an exit. Liang did not respond to an email requesting comment.Health authorities also knew that once China reopened, there would be no going back. Some were spooked by unclear data, long COVID and the chance of deadlier strains, leaving them wracked with uncertainty.“Every day, we were flooded with oceans of unverified data,” said a China CDC official. “Every week we heard about new variants. … Yes, we should find a way out of zero-COVID, but when and how?”Authorities may also have been waiting for the virus to weaken further or for new, more effective, Chinese-developed mRNA vaccines.“They didn’t have a sense of urgency,” said Zhu Hongshen, a postdoctoral fellow studying China’s zero-COVID policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “They thought they could optimize the whole process, they thought they had time.”The Shanghai lockdown stretched from an expected eight days to two months. By the time Shanghai opened back up, it was just months away from China’s pivotal 20th Party Congress, where Xi was expected to be confirmed for a controversial and precedent-breaking third term.Risking an outbreak was off the table. Though scientists from Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan wrote internal petitions urging the government to start preparations, they were told to stay silent until the congress was over.“Everybody waits for the party congress,” said one medical expert, declining to be named to comment on a sensitive topic. “There’s inevitably a degree of everyone being very cautious.”___Officials across China took extraordinary measures to stop omicron from spreading.Tourists were locked into hotels, traders were huddled into indefinite quarantine and many stopped traveling for fear of being stranded far from home. In Inner Mongolia, a state-run ammunition factory forced workers to live in its compound 24 hours a day for weeks on end away from their families, according to Moses Xu, a retired worker.In brutal lockdowns for over three months in China’s far west, residents in Xinjiang starved, while thousands in Tibet marched on the streets, defying orders in a rare protest. Still, officials stuck to their guns, as the government fired those who didn’t keep COVID under control.Yet omicron kept spreading. As the congress approached, authorities began hiding cases and resorting to secret lockdowns and quarantines.Authorities locked down Zhengzhou, a provincial capital home to over 10 million people, with no public announcement, even though they were reporting only a handful of cases. They bused some Beijing residents to distant quarantine centers and asked them not to post online about it, one told the AP. Some village officials deliberately underreported the number of COVID-19 cases to give the sense that the virus was under control.Local governments poured tens of billions of dollars into mass testing and quarantine facilities. From Wuhan to villages in industrial Hebei province, civil servants were pressed into testing or quarantine duty because local governments ran out of money to hire workers.At the Congress in mid-October, top officials differing with Xi were sidelined. Instead, six loyalists followed Xi onstage in a new leadership lineup, signaling his total domination of the party.___With the congress over, some voices in the public health sector finally piped up.In an internal document published Oct. 28, obtained by The Associated Press and reported here for the first time, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at China’s CDC, criticized the Beijing city government for excessive COVID controls, saying it had “no scientific basis.” He called it a “distortion” of the central government’s zero-COVID policy, which risked “intensifying public sentiment and causing social dissatisfaction.”At the same time, he called the virus policies of the central government “absolutely correct.” One former CDC official said Wu felt helpless because he was ordered to advocate for zero-COVID in public, even as he disagreed at times with its excesses in private.Wu did not respond to an email requesting comment. A person acquainted with Wu confirmed he wrote the internal report.Another who spoke up was Zhong Nanshan, a doctor renowned for raising the alarm about the original COVID-19 outbreak Wuhan. He wrote twice to Xi personally, telling him that zero-COVID was not sustainable and urging a gradual reopening, said a person acquainted with Zhong. Business people in finance, trade, and manufacturing concerned about the tanking economy were also lobbying authorities behind the scenes, a government adviser told the AP.Along with the lobbying, pressure to reopen came from outbreaks flaring up across the country. A Nov. 5 internal notice issued by Beijing health authorities and obtained by the AP called the virus situation “severe.”In early November, Sun, China’s top “COVID czar,” summoned experts from sectors including health, travel and the economy to discuss adjusting Beijing’s virus policies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings. Zhong, the prominent doctor, presented data from Hong Kong showing omicron’s low fatality rate after the city’s last outbreak, two said.On Nov. 10, Xi ordered adjustments.“Adhere to scientific and precise prevention and control,” Xi said, according to a state media account, signaling he wanted officials to cut back on extreme measures.The next day, Beijing announced 20 new measures tweaking restrictions, such as reclassifying risk zones and reducing quarantine times. But at the same time, Xi made clear, China was sticking to zero-COVID.“Necessary epidemic prevention measures cannot be relaxed,” Xi said.___The government wanted order. Instead, the measures caused chaos.With conflicting signals from the top, local governments weren’t sure whether to lock down or open up. Policies changed by the day.In Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, officials canceled mass testing and opened the city, only to reinstate harsh measures days later. Xi called city officials, instructing them to have measures that were neither too strict nor too soft, according to a person familiar with the matter.Individual apartments were put under sudden lockdowns that lasted hours or days. The sheer number of tests and cases overwhelmed medical workers. Travel, shopping, and dining ground to a halt, streets emptied, and the wealthy bought one-way plane tickets out of China.In late November, public frustration boiled over. A deadly apartment fire in China’s far west Xinjiang region sparked nationwide protests over locked doors and other virus control measures. Some called on Xi to resign, the most direct challenge to the Communist Party’s power since pro-democracy protests in 1989.Riot police moved in and the protests were swiftly quelled. But behind the scenes, the mood was shifting.References to “zero-COVID” vanished from government statements. State newswire Xinhua said the pandemic was causing “fatigue, anxiety and tension,” and that the cost of controlling it was increasing day by day.Days after the protests, Sun, the COVID czar, held meetings where she told medical experts the state planned to “walk briskly” out of zero-COVID. Some were struck by how quickly the tone had shifted, with one saying the leadership had become “even more radical” than the experts, according to a retired official.On Dec. 1, Xi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel that the protests were driven by youth frustrated with the lockdowns, according to a person briefed on Xi’s remarks.“We listen to our people,” the person recounted Xi telling Michel.The final decision was made suddenly, and with little direct input from public health experts, several told the AP.“None of us expected the 180-degree turn,” a government adviser said.Many in the Chinese government believe the protests accelerated Xi’s decision to scrap virus controls entirely, according to three current and former state employees.“It was the trigger,” said one, not identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.On Dec. 6, Xi instructed officials to change COVID-19 controls, Xinhua reported.The next day, Chinese health authorities announced 10 sweeping measures that effectively scrapped controls, canceling virus test requirements, mandatory centralized quarantine and location-tracking health QR codes. The decision to reopen so suddenly caught the country by surprise.“Even three days’ notice would have been good,” said a former China CDC official. “The way this happened was just unbelievable.”Soon, the sick overran emergency wards and patients sprawled on floors. COVID-19 antivirals sold for thousands of dollars a box on the black market.In just six weeks, about 80% of the country was infected — more than a billion people, the China CDC later estimated. But even as deaths mounted, authorities ordered state media to deflect criticism over China’s sudden reopening, according to a leaked directive obtained by a former state media journalist and posted online.“Make a big propaganda push,” it ordered. “Counter the false claims leveled by the United States and the West that we were ‘forced to open’ and ‘hadn’t prepared.’”___AP reporter Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,1280,World

(AP) — Julio Urías is lined up to pitch for the Los Angeles Dodgers on opening day — and that's just fine with teammate Clayton Kershaw.Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts hasn't announced his scheduled starter for March 30 against Arizona. Roberts, however, told reporters Tuesday that Urías will pitch Friday in a Cactus League game against Milwaukee as he returns to Dodgers camp from participating in the World Baseball Classic with Mexico.That would put the left-hander on regular rest for the opener versus the Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium, with Kershaw on track for the second game of the season.Kershaw, a three-time NL Cy Young Award winner, has made a franchise-record nine opening-day starts for the Dodgers (2011-18, 2021). Walker Buehler started the opener last season in Colorado.“I’m excited for Julio to get to do it,” Kershaw said Tuesday. “I’m assuming Julio gets to do it. He deserves it. It is a special thing to get to do it. I think it should be whoever pitched the best the year before and he did that.”The 26-year-old Urías went 17-7 with a 2.16 ERA in 31 starts last season and finished third in NL Cy Young Award balloting. He was 20-3 with a 2.96 ERA the year before.Kershaw, who turned 35 on Sunday, is a nine-time All-Star with five ERA titles. But he's been slowed at times by injuries in recent years. The left-hander was 12-3 with a 2.28 ERA in 22 starts covering 126 1/3 innings last season.Kershaw pitched five innings Tuesday in a spring training game against the Cleveland Guardians. He allowed two runs on four hits with no walks and two strikeouts.“It was his best of the spring and the last inning was his best inning,” Roberts said.The 2014 NL MVP is 197-87 with a 2.48 ERA in 15 major league seasons.“I wouldn’t have come back if I wasn’t excited about playing. I’m excited about our team. I’m excited about our chance to win,” Kershaw said. “Opening day at Dodger Stadium, you just can’t take that for granted.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842922,Evangelista scores 2 in Predators 7-3 win over Sabres,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Luke Evangelista scored two goals in such quick succession, the Nashville Predators rookie joked it felt like they came on the same shift.Almost.Evangelista’s goals came in a 39-second span as part of a four-goal second-period surge in which the Predators became the latest team to rout the reeling Buffalo Sabres in a 7-3 win on Tuesday night. He also added two assists to become the team’s first rookie to enjoy a four-point game since Dan Hamhuis had a goal and four assists in setting the franchise record in 2004.The timeliness of the 21-year-old’s outburst in just his 11th NHL game was welcomed on an injury depleted Nashville team missing key veterans — Filip Forsberg, Ryan Johansen and Roman Josi — and seeking a response following a 7-0 drubbing at the New York Rangers on Sunday.“Pretty skinny roster, but we’ve got a lot of young guys that have come up and played really well,” said Matt Duchene, who scored twice and added an assist. “It shows a lot of character from our older guys all the way down to the youngest guy on the team.”Tommy Novak, Philip Tomasino and defenseman Ryan McDonagh — in his first game after missing four with an upper body injury — had a goal an assist each. Juuse Saros stopped 28 shots and even picked up an assist in beating the Sabres for the first time in seven career starts (1-5-1).The win allowed Nashville (35-26-8) to keep pace in the race for the Western Conference’s final two wild-card playoff spots. The Predators opened the day in 10th, five points behind eighth-place Winnipeg.While the Predators bounced back, the Sabres had no answers following a 7-0 loss of their own to Boston on Sunday.Buffalo dropped to 1-6-2 in its past nine, and 1-5-1 in its past six home games, a stretch in which the Sabres have been outscored by a combined 37-18 — including a 10-4 loss to Dallas on March 9.“Obviously, there’s a lot of pressure. We can feel that,” Tage Thompson said of the Sabres opening March in playoff contention in a bid to end an 11-year postseason drought. “But we got to learn how to play with that, and that’s something we’re learning to do right now. We’re the same team, we just got to continue to simplify when things get difficult, not complicate the game for ourselves.”Thompson scored his team-leading 43rd goal and first in nine games, and Jeff Skinner and Dylan Cozens also scored for Buffalo.Craig Anderson allowed six goals on 20 shots before being pulled following McDonagh’s goal with 4:08 left in the second period. Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen mopped up allowing no goals on six shots.The game turned early in the second period after Cozens cut Nashville’s lead to 2-1.Evangelista set up Novak for a breakaway goal just 24 seconds later, leading to Nashville scoring four straight in less than 12 minutes.“You’ve got to move on quick,” McDonagh said of putting the loss in New York behind them.“Obviously you’re not going to play perfect every night and we felt it wasn’t a lack of effort or even execution,” he added. “And I think we proved that tonight. Our offensive chances came off good defensive plays.”MILESTONESThompson’s 43 goals are the most by a Buffalo player since Thomas Vanek scored that many in 2006-07. ... Rasmus Dahlin set up Thompson’s goal, becoming Buffalo’s third defenseman to reach the 50-assist plateau, and first since Phil Housley had 60 — a franchise record for blue liners — in 1989-90.UP NEXTPredators: Return home for a two-game series against the Seattle Kraken on Thursday and Saturday.Sabres: Close three-game homestand hosting New Jersey on Friday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

Philadelphia won for just the fifth time in 16 games.Brandon Montour had a goal and an assist, and Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Reinhart also scored for Florida. The Panthers had won three in a row and six of seven before falling to the lowly Flyers.Florida outshot the Flyers 44-24 but remained only one point ahead of idle Pittsburgh for the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference.Philadelphia broke a 2-all tie with three goals in 2:01 late in the second period. Laughton started the scoring barrage. He got in all alone on goalie Alex Lyon after a long pass from defenseman Tony DeAngelo. Then, he patiently stickhandled back and forth from forehand to backhand until Lyon lunged to his right, leaving an opening for Laughton to lift the puck into the net on his backhand with 3:06 to play in the period.Sanheim netted his second of the game 1:11 after Laughton’s goal. Lyon lost his stick and Sanheim scored from close range as the Florida goalie was trying to recover it.Provorov made it 5-2 with 1:05 left before intermission by beating Lyon with a backhand from close range.It was a surprising offensive surge from the Flyers, who entered averaging just 2.61 goals per game and ranked 30th out of 32 NHL teams in that category.The Panthers pulled to 5-3 with 6:11 left on Reinhart’s power-play goal, but it wasn’t enough.

Heck, there’s no reason for them to react,” Kirby said. He described Tsai’s transit as “commonplace” and stressed that the visit is “unofficial and personal in nature.”He noted that the Taiwanese president has already traveled to the U.S. six times before. It is not unusual for Tsai to meet with U.S. officials and congresspeople, as she has done in the past, he added.Tsai is set to embark on her ""Democratic Partnership for Common Prosperity Journey"" on March 29 for 10 days, during which she will visit Belize and Guatemala to shore up diplomatic support. Her delegation will stop in New York City on their way to Central America, while on the way back the group will visit Los Angeles before returning to Taiwan on April 7.It is still unknown if Tsai will meet with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, although the two have agreed to meet in California to avoid escalating cross-strait tensions.McCarthy confirmed on Tuesday (March 8) that he planned to meet Tsai and suggested he may visit Taiwan in the future, per Financial Times. “That has nothing to do with my travel and if I would go to Taiwan or not,” McCarthy said. “China can’t tell me where or when to go.”Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin on Tuesday (March 21) said China resolutely opposes any form of U.S.-Taiwan exchanges, resolutely opposes Taiwan authorities fleeing to the U.S. under any title and for any reason, and resolutely opposes the violation of the one-China principle by the U.S.Wang said Beijing has already lodged solemn representations with the U.S. regarding this matter.",2023/03/22,491,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842962,"Mitchell has big slam, 31 points as Cavs beat Nets 115-109","NEW YORK (AP) — Donovan Mitchell glanced hopefully up at the overhead videoboard, realizing his sensational slam dunk deserved a second look.He wasn't going to get it in Brooklyn.“I was trying to see it but I forgot we’re on the road,” Mitchell said, “so they’re definitely not going to show it.”No problem. It's all over the internet.Mitchell also had five 3-pointers and scored 31 points, and the Cleveland Cavaliers opened a big lead in the third quarter and held on for a 115-109 victory over Nets on Tuesday night.Caris LeVert added 18 points for the Cavaliers in the opener of a two-game series. Cleveland led by only six after a competitive first half, but quickly blew it open in the third en route to its seventh win in nine games.The Cavs opened a 24-point lead and Mitchell's slam over Yuta Watanabe came with the Nets desperately hoping to get back into it early in the fourth.Mitchell eventually saw a replay when he got back to the locker room, but the 2018 All-Star Slam Dunk champion wasn't certain if he agreed with his teammates who felt it was his best ever.“It’s up there,” Mitchell said. “I don’t know if it’s my best one, but it’s definitely up there.”Darius Garland and Evan Mobley each added 17 points, and Jarrett Allen returned from a four-game absence with a right eye injury with 12 points and 14 rebounds.Day'Ron Sharpe had 20 points and 11 rebounds off the bench for the Nets, who lost their fourth straight game. Spencer Dinwiddie had 19 points and 11 assists, and Mikal Bridges scored 18 points.The teams play again Thursday night to complete what could be a postseason preview. The Cavaliers are solidly in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, nearing their first playoff berth since 2018 in LeBron James’ final season in Cleveland, and their first without him on the roster since 1998.The Nets came in just two games behind the New York Knicks for fifth, but now are only a half-game ahead of Miami for seventh, which would mean having to get through the play-in round.Mitchell and Garland converted consecutive three-point plays to give Cleveland eight straight points to start the second half and a 69-55 lead. Mitchell later opened and closed an 11-0 burst with 3-pointers, pushing the lead to 84-60 midway through the third.“Again, it’s along those lines of putting four quarters together, it always seems like there’s one quarter that really punches us in the gut a little bit,” Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said. “So we've got to be able to sustain throughout all those runs.”Watanabe's turnover early in the fourth sent the Cavs on a fast break, and Mitchell punctuated the sequence by pulling the ball back high over his right shoulder and slamming it down over Watanabe, who had rushed back to defend.“It’s a play, but for us we’re looking for something a little bit bigger,” Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said.The Nets got it down to five in the final minute, but had too far to climb against a team that came in allowing the fewest points per game in the NBA.TIP-INSCavaliers: Mitchell returned to the locker room in the first quarter because his stomach was bothering him. ... Garland made one 3-pointer to break a tie with Danny Ferry (543) for ninth place on the Cavaliers' career list. ... Cedi Osman was 4 for 4 behind the arc for 12 points.Nets: Cam Johnson scored 16 points and Nic Claxton had 13. ... The Cavaliers were the last Eastern Conference team to play in Brooklyn this season.REMEMBERING REEDThere was a moment of silence before the game for Hall of Famer Willis Reed, who died Tuesday at 80. After winning two championships as a player with the New York Knicks, Reed both coached and was an executive for the Nets in New Jersey, drafting Derrick Coleman and Kenny Anderson to build a playoff team in the 1990s.HIGH PRAISEVaughn had high praise for a couple Cavs who played for him in Brooklyn, calling Allen “one of the smartest bigs I’ve ever been around” and saying LeVert has “another level to his game and when playoffs comes around, he’ll take it to another level.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

(AP) — Matt Boldy scored on a breakaway with 1.3 seconds left in overtime and Filip Gustavsson made a career-high 47 saves to give the Minnesota Wild a 2-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night.“I knew I got out there within like a minute, so I knew it was kind of towards the end, but not really how much was actually left until I kind of turned away after the goal and heard the horn go off. But it was kind of nice when I knew for sure,” Boldy said. “I had time to make the move that I wanted to make, kind of make a read on the goalie coming in rather than trying to fire one.""Minnesota tied Dallas atop the Central Division with 90 points. New Jersey fell two points behind first-place Carolina in the Metropolitan Division, and the Hurricanes have two games in hand.The game was a chippy, defensive struggle. After two scoreless periods, the Devils were outshooting the Wild 22-19.“It was a tough game,” New Jersey forward Jesper Bratt said. “That’s how it’s going to be this time of year where two teams that are going to the playoffs — this is how it’s going to be. Not a lot of scoring chances, and tight defense all game, and obviously tough until the last second.”Minnesota finally broke through 6:41 into the third when Mason Shaw scored his seventh goal of the season on a wraparound.Timo Meier answered for the Devils five minutes later with his 35th goal of the season on a wraparound of his own.“It was huge,” Bratt said of his teammate’s goal. “This is the time of year, and especially in the playoffs, where guys like that lift — and he’s been playing really well and I think as a group we’re starting to come together a little more with the chemistry and stuff and starting to find each other a little more. And he had a great effort on the goal there and got us back in the game.”New Jersey was unable to convert on a late power play, and the teams went to overtime.It was a back-and-forth five minutes of extra hockey, with both goaltenders making good saves.“He’s looked comfortable to us throughout the whole game,” Wild coach Dean Evason said of Gustavsson. “Just looks like he looks right. He’s calm. He goes about his business.""After Jack Hughes hit the post for the Devils, the puck caromed right to Boldly for a breakaway and he beat the buzzer with his 23rd goal of the season.“I heard the horn right after the goal, which honestly kind of surprised me,” Boldly said. “I wasn’t sure that there was that little bit of time left.”Vitek Vanecek stopped 27 shots for New Jersey.“It was a tight game,” Vanecek said. “It was 0-0, they scored in the third, we scored in the third, then they scored in overtime. ... It’s frustrating, but what are you going to do?”NOTES: The Devils are 10-4 in overtime, while the Wild improved to 4-5.UP NEXTWild: Play at Philadelphia on Thursday night.Devils: Play at Buffalo on Friday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843002,Research Highlights Cyber Security’s Underestimated Role as a Business and Revenue-enabler,"Global study reveals boards still undervalue cyber’s role  
HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 22 March 2023 -  Trend Micro (TYO: 4704; TSE: 4704), a global cybersecurity leader, today released new research* revealing that while global organizations plan to increase cybersecurity budgets in 2023, business leaders hold conflicting views on the function.   To read a full copy of the report,    Risky Rewards, please visit: https://www.trendmicro.com/explore/risk-reward2023/2031-tl-en-rpt#page=1   Jon Clay, VP of threat intelligence at Trend Micro: ""If organizations want to make the most of their security investments, business leaders must reframe their view of cybersecurity – to think more broadly about how it can positively impact the enterprise. This research shows it's clearly a critical component of winning new business and talent. At a time when every dollar/penny counts, it's concerning to see stereotyped views of security persist at the very top.""   Nearly two-thirds (64%) of business decision-maker (BDM) respondents say they plan to increase security investment in 2023.   However, the research also reveals critical gaps in BDMs' understanding of the relationship between cybersecurity and other parts of the organization.   On the one hand, half (51%) claim cybersecurity is a necessary cost but not a revenue contributor, while a similar share (48%) argue that its value is limited to attack/threat prevention. Nearly a fifth (38%) even see security as a barrier rather than a business enabler.   However, on the other hand, 81% worry that a lack of cybersecurity credentials could impact their ability to win new business – with a fifth (19%) admitting it already has. This comes as nearly three-quarters (71%) of BDMs admit they're being asked about security posture in negotiations with prospects and suppliers. And 78% say these requests for information are increasing in frequency.   This apparent contradiction in attitudes is laid bare by another finding. Despite prospects and suppliers clearly prioritizing security in negotiations, only 57% of BDMs perceive there to be a strong or very strong connection between cyber and client acquisition/satisfaction.   Talent acquisition is another area where there are clear gaps in BDMs' understanding of the interconnectivity between cybersecurity and the rest of the business.   Nearly three-quarters (71%) of respondents claim that the ability to work from anywhere has become vital in the battle for talent. Yet only around two-fifths understand the strong connection between cybersecurity and employee retention (42%) and talent attraction (43%).   That's despite respondents recognizing the impact of cyber on the employee experience:        83% say current security policies have affected remote employees' ability to do their jobs (eg. network and information access issues, and slowing the pace of work)         43% say current security policies place restrictions on employees' ability to work from anywhere         54% say current policies restrict what devices/platforms employees can choose to use      * Trend Micro commissioned Sapio Research to poll 2718 business decision-makers in companies with 250+ employees across 26 countries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843023,"Ohtani fans Trout, Japan tops US 3-2 for WBC championship","MIAMI (AP) — Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout had dreamed of this moment, along with millions of fans throughout Japan and the United States: the two biggest stars on the planet, longtime teammates, facing each other at 60 feet, 6 inches, the world title at stake.Of course, the count went full.And then Ohtani got Trout to swing under a slider on the outside corner, sealing Japan's 3-2 win Tuesday night and its first World Baseball Classic title since 2009.“This is the best moment in my life,” Ohtani said through a translator.Ohtani, the two-way star who has captivated fans across two continents, was voted MVP of the WBC after batting .435 with one homer, four doubles, eight RBIs and 10 walks while going 2-0 with a save and a 1.86 ERA on the mound, striking out 11 in 9 2/3 innings.“I think every baseball fan wanted to see that. I’ve been answering questions about it for the last month-and a-half,” said Trout, Ohtani's Los Angeles Angels teammate since 2018.“Did you think it was going to end in any other way?”Watching the eighth and ninth innings unfold, Japan first baseman Kazuma Okamoto was in disbelief.“I thought it was like a Manga,” he said through an interpreter, referring to a Japanese comic book.U.S. manager Mark DeRosa savored the matchup — except for the ending.“I just would have liked to have seen Mike hit a 500-foot homer,” he said.Ohtani had given a pregame pep talk in Japan's clubhouse.“Let’s stop admiring them,"" he said, according to a Los Angeles Times translation of the video posted on the website Samurai Japan. ""If you admire them, you can’t surpass them. We came here to surpass them, to reach the top. For one day, let’s throw away our admiration for them and just think about winning.”Japan then joined the Dominican Republic in 2013 as the only unbeaten champions of baseball’s premier national team tournament. The Samurai Warriors went 7-0 and outscored opponents 56-18, reaching the final for the first time since winning the first two WBCs in 2006 and 2009. No other nation has won the title more than once.Trea Turner put the U.S. ahead in the second against Shota Imanaga (1-0) with his fifth home run of the tournament, tying the WBC record set by South Korea’s Seung Yuop Lee in 2006.Munetaka Murakami tied the score on the first pitch of the bottom half off Merrill Kelly (0-1) driving an up fastball 432 feet into the right-field upper deck, a 115.1 mph bullet. Japan loaded the bases and Lars Nootbaar, the first non-Japanese-born player to appear for the Samurai Warriors, followed with a run-scoring groundout off Aaron Loup for a 2-1 lead.Okamoto boosted the lead in the fourth when he sent a flat slider from Kyle Freeland over the wall in left-center for another solo homer. Kyle Schwarber pulled the Americans within a run when he went deep in the eighth off Yu Darvish.Ohtani was Japan's designated hitter and first went to the bullpen ahead of the sixth inning. He returned to the dugout and beat out an infield single in the seventh before again walking down the left-field line to Japan’s bullpen and warming up for his third mound appearance of the tournament.He walked big league batting champion Jeff McNeil to begin the ninth, then got six-time All-Star Mookie Betts to ground into a double play.That brought up Trout, the U.S. captain, a 10-time All-Star and a three-time MVP.“I saw him take a big deep breath to try and control his emotions,” DeRosa said. “I can’t even imagine being in that moment, the two best players on the planet locking horns as teammates in that spot.”Ohtani started with a slider low, then got Trout to swing through a 100 mph fastball. Another fastball sailed outside and Trout missed a 99.8 mph pitch over the middle. A 101.6 offering, the fastest of Ohtani's 15 pitches, was low and way outside.Ohtani stepped off the mound and blew on his pitching hand. He went back to a offspeed option, a slider.Trout grimaced after his futile swing, his 12th strikeout of a tournament in which he hit .296 with one homer and seven RBIs. Ohtani raised both arms and threw his glove, then his cap, as teammates mobbed him.Ohtani got his second career save, the first since a 2016 playoff game with the Pacific League's Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. He and Trout had hugged behind the batting cage during pregame workouts, then held their nation’s flag while leading their teams toward home plate in single file during the introductions, Trout down the right-field line and Ohtani in left.Several thousand fans had arrived hours early to watch Ohtani take batting practice and applauded when he hit a drive off the video board above the second deck in center.“What he’s doing in the game is what probably 90% of the guys in that clubhouse did in Little League or in youth tournaments, and he’s able to pull it off on the biggest stages,” DeRosa said. “He is a unicorn to the sport. I think other guys will try it, but I don’t think they’re going to do it to his level.”MONEY MATTERSJapan gets $3 million in prize money and the U.S. $1.7 million. Half of each goes to players, the other half to the national baseball federaton.UP NEXTMLB openers are March 30, the same day the season starts in Japan. ___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843024,Arkansas restricts school bathroom use by transgender people,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Tuesday signed a law prohibiting transgender people at public schools from using the restroom that matches their gender identity, the first of several states expected to enact such bans this year amid a flood of bills nationwide targeting the trans community.The bill signed by the Republican governor makes Arkansas the fourth state to place such restrictions at public schools, and it comes as bills in Idaho and Iowa also await their governor's signature. And it might be followed by an even stricter Arkansas bill criminalizing transgender adults using public restrooms that match their gender identity.Arkansas' law, which won't take effect until later this summer, applies to multi-person restrooms and locker rooms at public schools and charter schools serving prekindergarten through 12th grade. The majority-Republican Legislature gave final approval to the bill last week.“The Governor has said she will sign laws that focus on protecting and educating our kids, not indoctrinating them and believes our schools are no place for the radical left’s woke agenda,” Alexa Henning, Sanders' spokesperson, said in a statement. “Arkansas isn’t going to rewrite the rules of biology just to please a handful of far-left advocates.”Similar laws have been enacted in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee, although lawsuits have been filed challenging the Oklahoma and Tennessee restrictions.Proposals to restrict transgender people using the restroom of their choice have seen a resurgence this year, six years after North Carolina repealed its bathroom law in the wake of widespread protests and boycotts. More than two dozen bathroom bills have been filed in 17 states, according to the Human Rights Campaign.“They’re singling out transgender people for no other reason than dislike, disapproval and misunderstanding of who transgender youth are,” said Paul Castillo, senior counsel and students’ rights strategist for Lambda Legal. “And the entire school population suffers as a result of these types of bills, particularly schools and teachers and administrators who are dealing with real problems and need to focus on creating a welcome environment for every student.”The proposals are among a record number of bills filed to restrict the rights of transgender people by limiting or banning gender-affirming care for minors, banning transgender girls from school sports and restricting drag shows. Transgender people have also faced increasingly hostile rhetoric at statehouses.Another bill pending in Arkansas goes even further than the North Carolina law by imposing criminal penalties. That proposal would allow someone to be charged with misdemeanor sexual indecency with a child if they use a public restroom or changing room of the opposite sex when a minor is present.“It’s a flagrant message from them that they refuse to respect (transgender people’s) rights and humanity, to respect Arkansans’ rights and humanity,” said Holly Dickson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas.The new Arkansas law requires schools to provide reasonable accommodations, including single-person restrooms. Superintendents, principals and teachers who violate the prohibition could face fines of at least $1,000 from a state panel, and parents could also file private lawsuits to enforce the measure.“Each child in our schools has a right to privacy and to feel safe and to feel comfortable in the bathroom they need to go to,” Republican Rep. Mary Bentley, the bill's sponsor, told lawmakers earlier this year.But Clayton Crockett, the father of a transgender child, described to lawmakers earlier this year how a similar policy adopted at his daughter's school made her feel further marginalized.“She feels targeted, she feels discriminated against, she feels bullied, she feels singled out,” Crockett said at a House panel hearing on the bill in January.Opponents have also complained the legislation doesn't provide funding for schools that may need to build single-person restrooms to provide reasonable accommodations.At least two federal appeals courts have upheld transgender students’ rights to use the bathroom corresponding with their gender identity. Supporters of the bill, however, have cited a federal appeals court ruling upholding a similar policy at a Florida school district last year.The Arkansas measure won't take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns this year's session, which isn't expected to happen until next month at the earliest.Sanders signed the bill a week after she approved legislation making it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming care to minors. That law, which also doesn't take effect until this summer, is an effort to effectively reinstate a ban on such care for minors that's been blocked by a federal judge.Sanders earlier this month also signed a wide-ranging education bill that prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation before 5th grade. The restriction is similar to a Florida measure that critics have called the “Don't Say Gay” law.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843025,"Hellebuyck stops 29 shots, Jets beat Coyotes 2-1","WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Connor Hellebuyck stopped 29 shots to lead the Winnipeg Jets to a needed 2-1 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on Tuesday night.Nikolaj Ehlers and Adam Lowry scored for the Jets, who won for the second time in five games. Hellebuyck recorded his 31st victory in his 55th start of the season.Hellebuyck made a huge save early in the second that drew loud cheers from the crowd at Canada Life Centre.After Nick Schmaltz’s shot hit the post, the puck was in play out front. Michael Kesselring then sent a backhand shot straight at the net but Hellebuyck, from the side of the crease, reached his stick out along the ice and redirected the puck away.“Just another to add to his highlight reel, I guess,” Jets defenseman Josh Morrissey said. “He’s been incredible for us, certainly all year and for a long time. ... When they really had their push in the second, he made some massive saves and gave us a chance to regroup in the intermission and to come out in the third and play a lot better.”Barrett Hayton scored and Karel Vejmelka had 23 saves as Arizona snapped a four-game win streak and eight-game point streak (6-0-2).“It’s a really good stretch of hockey for us,” Hayton said. “Coming out of the (trade) deadline, we really wanted to focus on our attitude and being able to turn the page quick there. The first game after the deadline we weren’t good at all and we learned from that quick and we went on that stretch. Obviously, our group is really happy with that but we want to keep it rolling.”Ehlers gave the Jets a rare first goal when he stole the puck after a bad Arizona pass attempt, skated in alone on Vejmelka and slapped in his own rebound at 4:17 of the first period.The Jets came in having given up the first goal in five straight games and nine of their previous 10.Lowry made it 2-0 with a short-handed goal on a 2-on-1 with Morgan Barron with 8 1/2 minutes left in the first.“I thought we played good in the first period, we just made mistakes with execution,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said. “We gave up two breakaways and a two-on-one on an execution mistake. So execution, that can happen (on) both sides.”Hayton scored his 15th off a rebound with 8:14 left in the middle period to pull the Coyotes to 2-1. It extended his point streak to eight games (five goals, eight assists).Winnipeg was outshot 18-3 in the second and didn’t have a shot on goal for the final 16:14 of the period.“It’s funny. The second period the bench, it got quiet. They could see what was going on,” Jets coach Rick Bowness said. “The third period, there was a lot of energy on the bench and that took itself out on the ice. We had everyone going. The bench was really energized in the third, they knew what was at stake, they knew we had to find a way to win this game.”The Jets had a pair of power plays close together early in the third, including a four-minute advantage when Arizona’s Liam O’Brien received a double minor for high-sticking Winnipeg forward Vladislav Namestnikov in the face, but they couldn’t extend their lead.Winnipeg ended the third period on the power play and finished 0 for 6. Arizona was 0-for-3.KELLER KEEPS COOKINGCoyotes leading-scorer Clayton Keller extended his point streak to nine games with an assist on Hayton’s goal. He has seven goals and 10 assists during the run, and 76 points in 71 games.Keller also tied Colorado forward Nathan MacKinnon for the second-most points since the NHL all-star break. They both have 35 points during that span. Edmonton's Connor McDavid has the most points (44) since the break.MISSING OFFENSEWinnipeg leading-scorer Kyle Connor hasn’t scored a goal in 11 consecutive games. ...

In Paraguay, a man displaced by a rising river hauls heavy buckets of it to his temporary home. In the Philippines, a girl uses a manual pump to get just enough to wash. In Haiti children fill large jugs of it in dwindling ravines.Water is the lifeblood of every community around the world. But a sustainable, clean supply for drinking, hygiene and farming is not guaranteed for hundreds of millions of people, according to United Nations figures.From droughts stifling once-reliant sources to destructive downpours and floods, what the world does about its water woes is the central question at the U.N.'s three-day water conference that begins Wednesday. Coinciding with the 30th anniversary of World Water Day, it's the first dedicated U.N. conference on water in nearly 50 years.Climate change, pollution and waste have compounded water concerns by squeezing the Earth's resources. Some supplies have dwindled from lack of rain, with dry spells often lasting months if not years in some places. Others have had essential supplies contaminated by chemicals or toxins from human activity.A punishing winter drought in southern Europe left reservoirs so bare that officials are moving fish for their survival. Kenya's dry weather and a lack of infrastructure means many people gather water at local hubs to collect enough. Peru's workers must treat water contaminated by waste from abandoned mines, bacteria and garbage. Washers rely on India's Brahmaputra river for cleaning clothes despite threats from seasonal flooding.Some countries exposed to too much or too little water have already found ways to keep it flowing in the needed amounts. In the Netherlands, where about a third of the country is below sea level, wind pumps prevent regions from being submerged.Delegates attending the conference in New York will agree on an agenda on Friday aimed at advancing toward a goal of having readily available, sustainably managed water and sanitation for everyone across the globe.___Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843027,Philippines seizes large weapons cache from Taiwanese crime ring,"UPDATE: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that one of the suspects, Chen Chien-ning, was still a fugitive in the Philippines at the time of publication. In fact, he was arrested earlier in March and was deported to Taiwan on Thursday (March 22). The article was edited to correct this mistake.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Authorities in the Philippines raided an apartment rented by a Taiwanese national and suspected gang leader, and seized a weapons cache of over 80 firearms in Manila on Monday (March 19).The Philippines’ Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CDIG) issued a search warrant for the condo as part of a crackdown on unlicensed firearms. The Philippine News agency reported that the search warrant identified Zhang Xiaodong, a Taiwanese man who is suspected of managing a criminal operation that deals in illegal drugs and telecom fraud.The operation took place on Monday night in Makati City in Metro Manila at approximately 6:10 p.m. Officers seized a total of 84 weapons, including 65 handguns, 13 rifles, and six sub-machine guns along with various firearm accessories.Zhang and two other Taiwanese suspects are currently fugitives being sought by the CIDG. It is believed they are still in the Philippines.The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Manila reportedly helped local authorities with their investigation.The apartment was identified thanks to the efforts of officers involved in a previous raid on the criminal group on March 1. In that raid, four other Taiwanese members of the gang were arrested, reported Philstar Global.One of the gang members who was arrested earlier this month, Chen Chien-ning, has been on the run from Taiwanese authorities for 23 years. He was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2001 for the crime of kidnapping, but escaped to the Philippines, where he continued to engage in criminal activity, reported TVBS.After negotiations between Taiwan and the Philippines, Chen was deported to Taiwan on Thursday (March 22), where he will likely serve out his previous sentence and face trial for new charges.As for the suspects who are still evading the law, Interior and Local Government Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. called their presence in the Philippines a “serious security threat.” He also indicated that officers were tracking their whereabouts and that he expected them to be apprehended and deported very soon.",2023/03/22,1691,World

LOUIS (AP) — Lucas Raymond’s goal in the fourth round of a shootout gave the Detroit Red Wings a 3-2 win over the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday night.Raymond’s goal was the only one from either team in the tiebreaker. He is 3 for 8 in career shootout attempts.Alex Chiasson and Filip Zadina scored in regulation for the Red Wings, who stopped a three-game losing streak. Magnus Hellberg made 20 saves and denied all four attempts in the shootout.“Obviously, I know I’m a big boy,” the 6-foot-6 Hellberg said. “I try to have good patience and use my size, don’t come out too far, but still have good gap when they come. I know that if I just keep my position, they can’t really go around me because I have long legs and stuff like that. Today it worked and obviously Raymond a great goal there to finish the job.”Robert Bortuzzo and Marco Scandella scored for the Blues, who won their previous three home games against Detroit. Joel Hofer made 28 saves, taking his first loss in his third game since being recalled from Springfield of the AHL last Thursday.St. Louis got first-period goals from two unlikely sources.Bortuzzo gave them the lead at 2:21 of the first period with his second goal of the season and first since New Year’s Eve. Scandella scored midway through the first — his first goal since April 24, 2022.“Just finding the timing now,” said Scandella, who missed the first 56 games this season while recovering from hip surgery. “This is Game 14 for me. I’m starting to get into my groove, starting to feel good. It’s not easy jumping in in the middle of the season. Everyone’s going, systems are in place. Just building every day.”Detroit had an answer for each St. Louis goal.Chiasson got the Red Wings on the board with a power-play goal at the 7:49 mark, burying a perfect feed from David Perron. Zadina’s goal late in the first evened it at 2.“It’s been a tough stretch of late,” Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said. “We’ve talked about having something to play for a little bit, where our morale was, and I give the guys a ton of credit. They played with some urgency tonight.”Raymond was inches away from giving the Red Wings the lead in the final seconds of the second period as his shot trickled between Hofer’s legs, but Hofer was able to recover and pounce on the puck before it could be tapped over the goal line.“I think we just trusted a process,” Hellberg said. “I felt that throughout the game that we were better than them. We kept building and we felt like their goalie made some good saves, but we knew sooner or later he’s going to give up one.”WELCOME BACKPerron made his first appearance in St. Louis since signing with the Red Wings as a free agent before the season. Perron, who has had three separate stints with the Blues, was a first-round draft pick by St. Louis in 2007 and was a part of the 2019 Stanley Cup championship team.Perron received a standing ovation from the crowd after being honored with a video tribute during a break in the first period.“Just a surreal moment that I don’t think I ever thought I would get to this point, but these fans are unbelievable and it means a lot,” Perron said. “Obviously, I had to just kind of try and stay composed for a bit there and barely did it.”NOTES: The Blues carried three goaltenders, with Jordan Binnington returning after a two-game suspension. … Red Wings D Olli Määttä played in his 600th career game. … Blues F Jakub Vrana, acquired in a trade with Detroit on March 3, had his four-game point streak snapped (four goals, one assist).UP NEXTThe teams played the first game of a unique home-and-home set, the only times they face each other this season.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) and Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a joint statement in which Moscow reiterated that it recognizes Taiwan “as an inalienable part of China's territory, opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence’, and firmly supports China's measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
MOFA said that Taiwan and China are not subordinate to one another and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime has never had the right to govern Taiwan for a day, per a MOFA press release. Taiwan is a modern democratic country that actively defends the democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law, the ministry said.
The CCP authoritarian government has been violating human rights for years, arbitrarily expanding its reach, and bullying neighboring countries, MOFA added. “Any statement made by the CCP regime to distort Taiwan's sovereign status will not be able to change the internationally recognized cross-strait status quo.”










The foreign ministry also pointed out that China and Russia’s commitment to safeguard the U.N.-centric international system is “undoubtedly a deception.” Russia “flagrantly violated” the U.N. charter and illegally invaded Ukraine on February 24 last year, while China has been harassing Taiwan and neighboring countries with military aircraft and ships for a long time, it said.
“Today, the two countries talk loudly and call on the international community to abide by the U.N. Charter and avoid humanitarian crises.”
MOFA said that the serious harm to international peace and stability and the rules-based international order inflicted by China and Russia has caused more concern in the international community. “Taiwan is at the front line of defending democracy and the people and government of Taiwan will stand united to defend against China’s civil and military threats against the nation.”
The ministry pledged to also strengthen coordination and cooperation with democratic countries to curb the expansion of authoritarianism, safeguard peace and security across the Taiwan Strait, and maintain freedom and openness in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as global stability and prosperity.

We’ve just got to go take care of business.”Sandro Mamukelashvili scored 20 points for the Spurs, who had previously slipped well out of realistic contention for a postseason berth. Devin Vassell, who scored 29 points in a victory over Atlanta on Sunday, was scratched to rest his previously injured left knee.“It was going to be a very difficult night,” Spurs coach Gregg Popvich said. “We started off pretty well, but as the game went along, Ingram and CJ took over. They did a great job.”“We didn't have our best night, they played well, end of story,” Popovich added.Tre Jones and former Pelican Devonte’ Graham each scored 15 for San Antonio, and Keita Bates-Diop had 12 points.The Pelicans took their first double-digit lead late in the first quarter after Ingram and McCollum combined for 11 points during a 13-2 run that made it 27-16.New Orleans opened the second quarter on a 10-2 run, highlighted by Murphy's alley-oop dunk.Murphy's 3 gave New Orleans a 20-point lead late in the quarter and McCollum closed out the first half with a floater and a 3 to put the Pelicans up 64-39.TIP-INSSpurs: Rookie F Jeremy Sochan missed his second straight game since aggravating a sore right knee in the first quarter of last Friday’s game against Memphis. ...

Ilya Samsonov had 22 saves.“We weren’t getting enough pucks directly to the net, trying to make too many plays,” Marner said. “They won a lot more battles.

They got some high-end players, if you give them time and space, especially coming through the neutral zone, they can take advantage. I thought we did a good job defensively as a group of five staying above guys. Obviously, when we got our chances we did a great job capitalizing.”Sorokin kept the Islanders deficit at one goal with an incredible stick save with 7:22 left in the opening period, swatting Maple Leafs defenseman Erik Gustafsson's shot at a wide-open net out of the air with his stick.Parise tied it 28 seconds into the second with a one-timer off a pass from Mayfield.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843050,New York City braces for Trump indictment after ex-president urges protests,"NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Workers erected barricades around a Manhattan courthouse on Monday as New York City braced for a possible indictment of Donald Trump over an alleged hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 campaign.
It would be the first-ever criminal case against any U.S. president. On Saturday, Trump urged followers on social media to protest what he said was his looming arrest.
In his call for protests, Trump raised concerns for law enforcement that supporters might engage in violence similar to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington.
Fearing a trap, however, several far-right grassroots groups have opted not to heed his call, security analysts said.
A grand jury, which heard further testimony on Monday, could bring charges as soon as this week. Trump, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the White House again in 2024, had predicted he would be arrested on Tuesday.
On Monday the grand jury heard from a witness, lawyer Robert Costello, who said Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen had handled the hush-money payments without Trump's involvement.
""Michael Cohen decided on his own - that's what he told us - on his own, to see if he could take care of this,"" Costello told reporters after testifying to the grand jury at Trump's lawyers' request.
Cohen, who testified twice before the grand jury, has said publicly Trump directed him to make the payments on Trump's behalf.
An indictment could hurt Trump's comeback attempt. Some 44% of Republicans say he should drop out of the presidential race if he is indicted, according to a seven-day Reuters/Ipsos poll that concluded on Monday.
The investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is one of several legal challenges facing Trump. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance violations tied to his arranging payments to Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, and another woman in exchange for their silence about affairs they claimed with Trump.
Trump has denied that any such affairs took place
The Manhattan District Attorney's office had asked that Cohen be available as a rebuttal witness, but he was told on Monday afternoon that his testimony was not needed, according to his lawyer Lanny Davis. Cohen told MSNBC he had not been asked to return on Wednesday.
NO SIGN OF UNREST
New York Mayor Eric Adams told reporters police were monitoring social media and keeping an eye out for ""inappropriate actions"" in the city. The New York Police Department said there were no known credible threats.
If charged, Trump would likely have to travel from his Florida home for fingerprinting and other processing. Law enforcement officials met on Monday to discuss the logistics, several media outlets reported.
Sources have said Bragg's office was presenting evidence to a grand jury about a $130,000 payment made to Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.
Trump's fellow Republicans have widely criticized the probe as politically motivated.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump's rival for the Republican presidential nomination, said on Monday Bragg was imposing a ""political agenda"" that compromised the rule of law, but he also took a veiled swipe at Trump.
""I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair,"" he told reporters.
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives launched an investigation of Bragg's office with a letter seeking communications, documents and testimony related to the probe.
Trump and other Republicans have also said the Manhattan District Attorney's office should focus more on tackling crime.
Asked to comment on the letter, a spokesperson for the DA's office, citing statistics that homicides and shootings were down this year, said:
""We will not be intimidated by attempts to undermine the justice process, nor will we let baseless accusations deter us from fairly applying the law.""
Trump was impeached twice by the House during his presidency, once in 2019 over his conduct regarding Ukraine and again in 2021 over the attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. He was acquitted by the Senate both times.
SEVERAL MORE LEGAL CHALLENGES REMAIN
Bragg won a conviction last December against Trump's business on tax fraud charges.
But legal analysts say the hush-money case may be more difficult. Bragg's office will have to prove that Trump intended to commit a crime, and his lawyers will likely employ a range of counterattacks to try to get the case dismissed, experts say.
Trump, meanwhile, has to contend with other legal challenges, raising the possibility he will have to shuttle between campaign stops and courtrooms before the November 2024 election.
Trump's lawyers on Monday asked a Georgia court to quash a special grand jury report detailing its investigation into his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 statewide election defeat.
The filing in Fulton County Superior Court also seeks to have the county district attorney, Fani Willis, recused from the case, arguing her media appearances and social media posts demonstrated bias against Trump.
Trump is also seeking to delay a civil fraud trial, scheduled for Oct. 2, brought by the New York attorney general that alleges a decade-long scheme to manipulate the value of his assets to win better terms from bankers and insurers.
Trump faces two civil trials involving former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, who claims that Trump defamed her by denying he raped her. A federal judge on Monday denied a request from both sides to combine the two cases into one.NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Workers erected barricades around a Manhattan courthouse on Monday as New York City braced for a possible indictment of Donald Trump over an alleged hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 campaign.It would be the first-ever criminal case against any U.S. president.

(AP) — Jayson Tatum scored 36 points and the Boston Celtics ended a long road trip on a high note by beating the Sacramento Kings 132-109 on Tuesday night.Boston bounced back from blowing a 19-point lead in Utah on Saturday night by knocking off one of the top teams in the Western Conference. It won four of six on the trip.Jaylen Brown added 27 points and Derrick White scored 20 to help the Celtics open up a one-game lead over Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division.“He just did a great job coming out of the gate,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of Tatum. “I thought him and Jaylen did a great job controlling the game with their decision-making.”Domantas Sabonis had 16 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists for the Kings, who lost consecutive games for the first time since Feb. 3-5. De'Aaron Fox scored 18 points.“They kicked our behinds,” coach Mike Brown said. “It started with me. We all got our behinds kicked. There's nothing tricky or hidden behind what I'm saying. They switched everything and turned us over.”Sacramento fell 1 1/2 games behind Memphis in the race for second place in the Western Conference. The Kings are trying to clinch their first playoff berth since 2006 — the longest postseason drought in NBA history.Playing their fifth game in seven nights in their fourth time zone, the Kings offered little defensive resistance for Boston.The Celtics shot 53.3% from the field, turned the ball over only five times and took control of the game during a torrid shooting stretch coming out of halftime.“I was pleased with the mindset,” Mazzulla said. “The most important thing is we managed the turnovers. … We have to maintain a level of perspective. This was a hard road trip.”Boston hit 10 of its first 11 shots from the field in the third quarter, scoring 27 points in less than six minutes to build the lead up to 14 points on a 3-pointer by White.The Kings never really threatened after that.“I feel like we all kind of felt it today,” Sabonis said. “It’s not an excuse. That’s a part of the schedule. Every team goes through it. At the end of the day we just had to fight through it and do a better job in the second half.”The Celtics scored the final nine points of the first half on 3-pointers by Al Horford and Brown, and a three-point play by Tatum to take a 60-54 lead at the break.TIP-INSCeltics: C Robert Williams III (hamstring) returned after missing the past eight games. He had six points and seven rebounds in 21 minutes off the bench. He was also called for a technical foul in the third quarter. ... The Celtics had 22 assists before committing their second turnover of the game midway through the third quarter.Kings: Swingman Kevin Huerter (knee) missed his third straight game but could return to practice on Thursday. ... Keegan Murray's 3-pointer in the first quarter gave him at least one in 33 straight games, tying the NBA rookie record held by Landry Shamet (2018-19) and Rudy Fernandez (2008-09). ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843091,"Syria says Israel attacked Aleppo airport, no casualties","DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — An Israeli airstrike early Wednesday targeted the international airport in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, causing material damage and putting it out of service, Syria's state news agency reported. It was the second attack on the facility this month.SANA quoted an unnamed military official as saying Israeli warplanes fired the missiles toward Aleppo, Syria’s largest city and once commercial center, while flying over the Mediterranean Sea. It did not mention any casualties.Bassem Mansour, head of Syria's civil aviation, told the pro-government Sham FM radio station the strike damaged the airport's runway and put the facility out of service. Repair work has started, he said, adding thet “the airport will resume work within a short period.”The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said that in addition the airport, the airstrike also destroyed a nearby arms depot of Iran-backed militiamen.The airport has been a key channel for the flow of aid into the country after the Feb. 6 earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, killing over 50,000 people, including more than 6,000 in Syria.Earlier this month, an Israeli airstrike put the airport out of service for several days and flights were rerouted to two other airports in war-torn Syria until the damage was fixed.Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of Syria in recent years, including attacks on the Damascus and Aleppo airports, but rarely acknowledges or discusses the operations.Israel has acknowledged, however, that it targets bases of Iran-allied militant groups, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has sent thousands of fighters to support Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces.Along with airports, Israel has also targeted seaports in government-held areas, an apparent attempt to prevent Iranian arms shipments to militant groups backed by Tehran, including Hezbollah.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843092,A quarter of world population lacks safe drinking water: UN,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A report issued on the eve of the first major U.N. conference on water in over 45 years says 26% of the world’s population doesn’t have access to safe drinking water and 46% lacks access to basic sanitation.The U.N. World Water Development Report 2023, released Tuesday, painted a stark picture of the huge gap that needs to be filled to meet U.N. goals to ensure all people have access to clean water and sanitation by 2030.Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report, told a news conference that the estimated cost of meeting the goals is between $600 billion and $1 trillion a year.But equally important, Connor said, is forging partnerships with investors, financiers, governments and climate change communities to ensure that money is invested in ways to sustain the environment and provide potable water to the 2 billion people who don’t have it and sanitation to the 3.6 billion in need.According to the report, water use has been increasing globally by roughly 1% per year over the last 40 years “and is expected to grow at a similar rate through to 2050, driven by a combination of population growth, socio-economic development and changing consumption patterns.”Connor said that actual increase in demand is happening in developing countries and emerging economies where it is driven by industrial growth and especially the rapid increase in the population of cities. It is in these urban areas “that you’re having a real big increase in demand,” he said.With agriculture using 70% of all water globally, Connor said, irrigation for crops has to be more efficient — as it is in some countries that now use drip irrigation, which saves water. “That allows water to be available to cities,” he said.As a result of climate change, the report said, “seasonal water scarcity will increase in regions where it is currently abundant — such as Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America — and worsen in regions where water is already in short supply, such as the Middle East and the Sahara in Africa.”On average, “10% of the global population lives in countries with high or critical water stress” — and up to 3.5 billion people live under conditions of water stress at least one month a year, said the report issued by UNESCO, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.Since 2000, floods in the tropics have quadrupled while floods in the north mid-latitudes have increased 2.5-fold, the report said. Trends in droughts are more difficult to establish, it said, “although an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts and 'heat extremes’ can be expected in most regions as a direct result of climate change.”As for water pollution, Connor said, the biggest source of pollution is untreated wastewater.“Globally, 80% of wastewater is released to the environment without any treatment,” he said, “and in many developing countries it’s pretty much 99%.”These and other issues including protecting aquatic ecosystems, improving management of water resources, increasing water reuse and promoting cooperation across borders on water use will be discussed during the three-day U.N. Water Conference co-chaired by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon opening Wednesday.There are 171 countries, including over 100 ministers, on the speakers list along with more than 20 organizations. The meeting will also include five “interactive dialogues” and dozens of side events.___This version of story corrected to 3.6 billion in need of access to basic sanitation in paragraph 4, not 3.6 million.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843093,"Oregon lawmakers approve $200M for housing, homelessness","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Oregon lawmakers passed a sweeping $200 million housing and homelessness package on Tuesday, displaying a bipartisan will to tackle two of the state's most pressing crises.The vast majority of the funding — about $157 million — is aimed at boosting homelessness and eviction prevention services. The money will go toward increasing shelter capacity, addressing youth homelessness, and funding rapid rehousing efforts and rental assistance programs.“This bill will help us build more housing, get people off our streets and make our communities more safe,” Democratic state Sen. Aaron Woods, who carried one of the two bills in the package, said on the Senate floor.Like much of the U.S. West, Oregon has struggled with a surge in homelessness driven in part by high costs and a lack of affordable housing options. Analysts and agencies estimate Oregon is short 140,000 housing units, and federal data shows its homeless population has increased by 22% since 2020.The crises are affecting both cities and rural regions. About 4,000 of the nearly 18,000 homeless people in the state live in rural areas, according to the latest 2022 federal point-in-time count.The Senate approved the package Tuesday night, with half of the chamber’s Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Tim Knopp, voting in favor. The legislation passed the House last week with support from both parties.Lawmakers pointed to the package’s investments outside cities — nearly $27 million is earmarked specifically for rural areas to combat homelessness — as the fruits of cross-aisle negotiation.“I have rural communities in my district as well that need this housing opportunity for our homeless. Homeless don't just reside in urban communities,"" Republican state Sen. David Brock Smith, who represents a rural southern Oregon district, said on the Senate floor. “I'm going to be a yes vote so that I can be a part of the solution.”The package will also direct $20 million to ramp up factory-produced modular housing, in a bid to meet Gov. Tina Kotek's housing construction target of 36,000 units per year — an 80% increase over current production.Republican state Sen. Daniel Bonham, who voted against the package, said cutting bureaucratic red tape and creating more incentives for housing developers would better address the issue.Some members of the public submitted written testimony opposing the high spending. But most nonprofits and housing groups expressed support, saying it would help communities that are disproportionately impacted by homelessness and the affordable housing shortage.“Promoting stability in the state’s housing laws will increase the wellbeing of communities of color in Oregon,” Jenny Lee, deputy director of the Coalition of Communities of Color, said in written testimony.The package will now head to Kotek's desk for her signature.___Rush is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843094,Flames bounce back with 5-1 victory over Ducks,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Tyler Toffoli had three assists, Calgary scored twice on the power play and the Flames bounced back from a six-goal loss one night earlier with a 5-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday.Toffoli has nine points in the past four games, including six assists.Nick Ritchie, Troy Stecher, Rasmus Andersson, Elias Lindholm and Andrew Mangiapane scored Calgary's goals. Mikael Backlund had a pair of assists and Dan Vladar stopped 19 shots for the Flames, who rebounded from an 8-2 defeat Monday night in Los Angeles.“We just wanted to put that game behind us. And there’s no better way to put it behind you than to just go out there and play right away,” said Mangiapane, who scored on a breakaway with less than five minutes remaining for his 12th of the season. “I think the first period set the tone for us. We wanted to come out strong and hard and just keep building off of that.”The win kept Calgary four points behind Winnipeg for the final wild card in the Western Conference with 10 games remaining after the Jets beat Arizona 2-1.“As a coach it is really simple: I just want to keep every game meaningful,” Flames coach Darryl Sutter said.Frank Vatrano scored Anaheim's lone goal. John Gibson made 38 saves, facing more than 40 shots for the 20th time this season.“We knew that they were going to be a little ornery after their game last night against L.A., and other than a few spurts in the second period, maybe for about six minutes in the second, we couldn’t sustain much. Every time we turned, they were in our face,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said.Calgary has 12 goals with the man advantage over the past month, which is fifth in the NHL.Andersson put Calgary up 3-0 less than three minutes into the third period on a one-timer off Toffoli’s pass. It was Andersson’s 11th goal and his third in the past six games.The Flames grabbed the lead 37 seconds into the game when Ritchie put in the rebound after Gibson made a pad save on Noah Hanifin's shot from the point. Ritchie's 12th of the season marked the sixth time Calgary has scored in the opening minute.Stecher broke a 90-game goal drought at 16:50 of the first with a snap shot from the right faceoff circle to the high side of the far post. Stecher — whose last goal was on Feb. 17, 2022 — has three points (one goal, two assists) since being acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline.Anaheim got on the board five minutes later when Vatrano lifted a wrist shot over Vladar's shoulder on his glove side. Vatrano's 17th marked only the second goal in Anaheim's last 15 power-play opportunities.Lindholm scored his 21st and gave Calgary a 4-1 lead 46 seconds into the third on a one-timer.NOTES: Hanifin extended his point streak to six games with the first assist on Ritchie's goal. He has six points (two goals, four assists) during that span. ... Calgary defenseman Chris Tanev was scratched an hour before the game due to an upper-body injury. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843095,Gwyneth Paltrow ski collision trial brings doctors to stand,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Two doctors on Wednesday described X-rays, brain scans and neurological tests documenting the medical condition of a man suing Gwyneth Paltrow for a 2016 ski collision at an upscale Utah ski resort.“After his accident, he deteriorated abruptly,” Dr. Wendell Gibby said of 76-year-old Terry Sanderson, the man suing Paltrow, in court in Park City.Sanderson's attorneys called on medical experts to try to persuade jurors that the collision left their client with irreparable, life-altering injuries. Sanderson, who is a retired optometrist, has been described in court filings and the initial days of the trial as a man who frequently skis at high-end resorts and travels internationally. Still, his attorneys have worked to frame the celebrity lawsuit as a David-versus-Goliath struggle, with their older but active client injured by the actor-turned-wellness-tycoon's negligence.Gibby, a radiologist, said brain images suggested Sanderson's head trauma was likely caused by a skier crashing into him, supporting Sanderson's claims that he was hit by Paltrow. He said lasting effects on Sanderson's overall health were consistent with the severity of the collision. “The rib fractures certainly corroborate that there was enough force to cause a head injury,"" Gibby added.Dr. Samuel Goldstein, a neuropsychologist, called Sanderson's post-crash trajectory an “acute rapid downturn” — and urged jurors to use their common sense rather than get bogged down in questions about white matter beneath the cortex of the brain.“Were it not for that particular accident, the life he was living in the six months to a year before that ... he would continue to be living,"" Goldstein said of Sanderson.Sanderson claims Paltrow's recklessness left him with physical injuries and brain damage. After a judge threw out his earlier $3.1 million lawsuit and ruled that he wasn't entitled to punitive damages, Sanderson amended his claims and now alleges damages of “more than $300,000.""Paltrow will likely testify Friday, and her children Moses and Apple are also expected to take the stand sometime during the trial, her attorney said.The amount of money sought pales in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit and expert witness-heavy trial. More than a dozen are expected to testify throughout the eight-day trial in Park City — a posh ski town known for welcoming celebrities each year for the Sundance Film Festival.In a counterclaim to Sanderson's amended lawsuit, Paltrow is seeking $1 and attorney fees — a familiar, symbolic action that highlights how reputation, not money, is often what's at stake for celebrities at trial like Paltrow. Taylor Swift similarly countersued a radio host for the same, symbolic amount in 2017.Though the court is not publishing a witness list for the celebrity trial, attorneys said that Sanderson’s daughters would likely be called to the stand next to testify. Attorneys are expected to question them about their father's health, as well as emails exchanged post-crash that mention GoPro camera footage and Paltrow's fame.Both parties blame the other for the collision and claim they were crashed into from behind, relying on a little-known Utah law stipulating that whoever is downhill has the right of way when skiing or snowboarding.Paltrow’s attorneys have pled with Judge Kent Holmberg to grant special restrictions throughout the trial, including limiting photography both in the courtroom and in the public parking lot outside — where a rope cordons off Paltrow's entrance and exit paths.Sanderson left the courtroom Wednesday before experts testified on his health and mental acuity, but on the opening day of the trial, he sat across the courtroom from Paltrow. Both appeared unfazed while hearing arguments that have become familiar over the seven years since they crashed. Paltrow, the founder and CEO of the wellness company Goop, arrived in court on Wednesday drinking a green juice.The trial is expected to hinge on how the 10 jurors — six women and four men — interpret evidence from medical experts, and whether they see Sanderson's injuries as directly related to the accident or normal parts of aging. The jurors are all residents of wealthy Summit County, where the median home last month sold for $1.3 million, according to Redfin.On Wednesday, jurors stretched and yawned through hours of testimony that was dense with medical jargon. After Sanderson's attorneys called experts to the stand to describe Sanderson's health, Paltrow's attorneys delved into the complexities of different kinds of MRIs and neurological tests, casting doubt on the experts' conclusions.In a trial expected to feature a long list of medical experts, Paltrow's attorneys have cautioned the jury not to be biased by feeling sympathy for Sanderson. They opened the trial by calling his story “utter B.S.” — building off earlier claims from court filings and previous depositions where they accused him of suing to exploit the wealth and celebrity of the Oscar-winning star of “Shakespeare in Love.""__Associated Press writer Anna Furman contributed reporting from Los Angeles.",2023/03/23,,World

And Ohtani closed out it, sending the United States home with a strikeout.“It's so difficult to hold our lineup to two runs,"" said Team USA manager Mark DeRosa after Japan beat the U.S. 3-2. ""I wouldn't have thought that going in regardless of who were facing.”Team USA’s roster featured a galaxy of stars — Trout, Mookie Betts of the Dodgers, Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado of the St. Louis Cardinals, and plenty more.But its pitching staff lacked the same marquee names.AL Cy Young winner Justin Verlander and Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw were a couple of many notable major league pitchers who opted out of the tournament. Kershaw, who just turned 35, pulled out of the event in February.“There were some factors that were making it hard for me to play,” Kershaw said then. “I tried to work it out on my own, tried to work it out with MLB, union, the team. Everybody worked hard to try to make it work. Just wasn’t able to.”The American hitters delivered all tournament.Along with his five home runs, Turner had 11 RBIs, second only to Japan's Masataka Yoshida with 13. Betts and Arenado added 10 hits apiece, the most through the tournament.Kyle Schwarber brought the U.S. within one run Tuesday with his second homer of the tournament, a hit off Japan's Yu Darvish that he sent 436 feet to right center.“Position player-wise, this is a no-brainer,” DeRosa said during group play. “They’re going to take playoff ABs (at-bats) from jump … From a pitching standpoint, they had to get going a little bit earlier and had to ramp it up a little bit earlier.""“But I think if this is going to go where it needs to go and can go that, yes, some of the major league clubs are going to have to be willing to be a little bit more, I don’t know the word I’m looking for, but OK mindset-wise with those guys playing.”The timing of the tournament, taking place in the middle of spring training when pitchers are typically ramping up for a 162-game schedule, left many MLB teams and pitchers not wanting to risk injury or fatigue ahead of the long season. That showed in the United States fielding lesser known names throughout the tournament.For the title game, DeRosa went with Arizona Diamondbacks right-hander Merrill Kelly, who was pulled after 1 1-3 innings after he allowed three hits, a run and walked two with a strikeout.“I hated pulling Merrill right there, and I know he wasn't happy about it,” DeRosa said. ""But we were fully loaded in the 'pen and I felt like we had to keep the game close in that situation.”Munetaka Murakami followed up his walk-off, two-run double in Monday’s semifinal win over Mexico by blasting Kelly’s first-pitch 92.4 mph fastball into the upper deck in right field. The play gave Japan a 1-0 lead in the second.In the fourth, Kazuma Okamota homered off reliever Kyle Freeland to make it 3-1.U.S. pitchers had a 4.20 ERA in seven games, allowed eight home runs and a tournament-high 59 hits.Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday that MLB has looked at moving the WBC to a different time, such as after the playoffs or in the middle of the season, among other things, to persuade more owners and general managers to lend their high-priced pitchers to the tournament.""From a competitive perspective, I think the most important thing is we’re going to need to continue to work, particularly with our clubs, about pitching,” Manfred said. “Obviously, it’s great the guys we’ve had, but I think that I’d like to see pitching staffs that are of the same quality as our position players.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843128,George leaves with injury as Clippers lose to Thunder,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Paul George went down hard in the fourth quarter. He may have taken the Los Angeles Clippers' championship hopes with him.George got hurt in Tuesday night's 101-100 loss to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Oklahoma City Thunder.The star guard hit the court after getting fouled by Luguentz Dort with 4:38 remaining. He lay on his back for several minutes before being helped to his feet. Supported by staff on either side, George headed to the locker room, appearing unable to put any weight on his right leg.“I went up for the rebound, kind of hit his leg,” Dort said. “I didn’t do it on purpose, definitely an accident.”There was no immediate update on George after the game. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said he was still being evaluated. George later left the arena on the back of a cart with his right leg extended.George's running mate, Kawhi Leonard, said he hadn't spoken to George afterward.“I didn't see the play,” Leonard. “I just thought he got hit in the face at the time.”George had 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Potentially losing him so close to the end of the regular season could put the Clippers' postseason aspirations in jeopardy.“Next man up,” Leonard said about the possibility of playing without George. “We got a group of guys that still want to win, like to play basketball, so we’ll see what happens.”Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points against his former team. Jalen Williams added 20 points for the Thunder.George had a highlight-reel dunk in the third, rotating 360 degrees before slamming the ball in the hoop as the crowd cheered.Leonard and George stepped up in the second half after shooting a combined 5 of 16 in the first half, but it wasn't enough. Leonard finished with 21 points.“I just didn’t think we played right the whole night offensively,” Lue said. “We played too slow and didn’t share the ball. When we don’t play a good brand of basketball this is the results you get.”The game was tied 91-all when George went down. Leonard scored before the Thunder ran off six points in a row to take a 97-93 lead.Nicolas Batum hit a jumper to pull the Clippers to 101-100. The Clippers lost a coach's challenge of an out-of-bounds call with 30 seconds left. The Thunder inbounded, but missed a shot and Leonard grabbed the rebound.Leonard dribbled down the final seconds when the Clippers didn't have any timeouts left. He was hounded by Thunder defenders and didn't get a shot off.“I'll take ownership of it,” Leonard said. “Definitely should have gotten a shot off.”The teams kept it close throughout the third. Gilgeous-Alexander scored the Thunder's final 10 points and they trailed 81-80 going into the final period.The Clippers blew a 14-point lead to start the game. They opened on an 18-4 run, but the Thunder tied it minutes later.TIP-INSThunder: Improved to 14-21 on the road against the West. ... Won five of six overall.Clippers: Leonard received a technical and Terance Mann got hit with two technicals at 4:24 of the second period. Mann was ejected.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843129,Kansas lawmakers near approval of 'born alive' abortion bill,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — A Kansas proposal based on the claim that providers leave infants to die after they're born during certain types of abortions is nearing legislative approval, as Republicans pursue limited anti-abortion measures following a decisive statewide vote last year protecting abortion rights.The Kansas House voted 88-34 on Wednesday to approve a bill declaring that when there's a live birth during an abortion procedure, medical personnel must take the same steps to preserve the newborn’s life as “a reasonably diligent and conscientious” provider would with other live births. The law would apply to any “complete expulsion or extraction” of a fetus from the mother, including labor and delivery abortions during which a doctor induces labor. The measure is similar to a proposed Montana law that voters there rejected in November and laws in 18 states, including Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Texas.The U.S. Supreme Court declared in June that states can ban abortion, and the Republican-controlled Kansas Legislature has long had strong anti-abortion majorities in both chambers. But a 2019 Kansas Supreme Court decision protected abortion rights and in August 2022, voters rejected a proposed change to the state constitution to overturn that decision and give lawmakers the power to greatly restrict or ban abortion.Supporters of the “born-alive infants protection” bill argued during a House debate Tuesday that the measure would survive a court challenge because it doesn't limit abortion itself. But a few Republicans touched on their moral opposition to abortion as a reason for backing the bill.“If you truly want to hold effective conversations about the indiscriminate and brutal acts of violence in our society today, we must teach others to hold life as precious and sacred,"" state Rep. Rebecca Schmoe, a Republican from northeastern Kansas, said during a debate Tuesday before voting for the bill Wednesday.Abortion providers and abortion rights advocates contend measures like the ones in Kansas and Montana are designed only to give abortion care a false and negative public image. They also argue that current state laws against homicide and child neglect, as well as laws on doctors’ duties, are sufficient to address any real problems.House passage sent the measure to the Senate, where GOP leaders have also signaled that they see it as a priority.“I pray for the day where we would stop killing our own children and ask God for forgiveness and mercy,” said southeastern Kansas Rep. Trevor Jacobs, explaining his “yes” vote along with six other GOP conservatives.Supporters of the bill portrayed it as saving infants born during botched abortions. But it would apply to cases in which doctors induce labor to deliver a fetus that won't survive outside the womb, often because of a severe medical issue, with the expectation that the newborn will die within minutes or even seconds.Like the laws in the 18 other states, the Kansas measure would require the hospitalization of infants born during labor and delivery abortions and impose criminal penalties for doctors who don’t try to save them. In Kansas, failing to attempt to save such a newborn would be a felony, punishable by a year's probation for a first-time offender.“This bill takes away the right of a mother to make her own private medical decisions in the most complicated and heartbreaking of cases,” state Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, a Kansas City-area Democrat, said, explaining her “no” vote Wednesday. “This is a right the overwhelming majority of Kansans voted to protect.”Like most states, Kansas doesn’t collect data on births during induced abortion procedures.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 1% of the more than 600,000 abortions a year occur after the 21st week of pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says almost no fetuses are viable before the 23rd week of pregnancy.Kansas law bans most abortions after the 22nd week of pregnancy, and no abortions after that point have been reported since at least 2016.Zack Gingrich-Gaylord, a spokesperson for Wichita abortion clinic operator Trust Women, said the facility has never seen an abortion result in a live birth in the nearly 10 years the clinic has been open.“This is just this fantasy,” Gingrich-Gaylord said. “It’s simply not true that there’s any kind of danger of this happening.”Not providing this care after abortions was already outlawed under a 2002 U.S. law, but it doesn't contain criminal penalties. The Republican-led U.S. House passed a measure in January to add penalties, but it's not expected to pass the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate.Opponents also said if the legislation passes, doctors would be forced into futile and expensive attempts to prolong dying infants' lives, and those medical interventions would deny parents opportunities to hold dying babies and to say goodbye. The same argument was made ahead of Montana's vote.Such laws also don't tell doctors when they are allowed to stop medical interventions for a dying infant, said Hillary-Anne Crosby, who coordinated the campaign against Montana's proposed law. She said doctors would be forced to choose between medically appropriate care in line with a family's wishes and “safe” actions that avoid legal problems.Supporters of the Kansas bill rejected such arguments.State Rep. Leah Howell, a Wichita-area Republican who voted for the bill, said she had a baby die in the 20th week of pregnancy.“Believe me, when this bill came to my attention, the very first thing I checked for was that this law would allow moms to hold their dying babies in their arms and tell them they loved them and to say goodbye,” she said, her voice wavering.___Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843130,Judge halts Wyoming abortion ban days after it took effect,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Abortion will again be legal in Wyoming — at least for now — after a judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a ban that took effect a few days earlier.Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens’ decision halts the ban amid a challenge in her court to a law that took effect Sunday. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the law despite earlier rulings by Owens that had blocked a previous ban since shortly after it took effect last summer.Owens put the new ban on hold after a hearing Wednesday in which abortion-rights supporters said the law harms pregnant women and their doctors and violates the state constitution. Owens suspended the ban for at least two weeks.The ban prohibits abortion at all stages of pregnancy except in cases of rape or incest that’s reported to police, or to save a woman’s life.An amendment in the Wyoming Constitution says adults have a right to make their own health care decisions, so Republicans enacted a ban that states abortion is not health care.However, Owens said it's up to the courts, not lawmakers, to decide whether that's the case.“The state can not legislate away a constitutional right. It’s not clear whether abortion is health care. The court has to then decide that,” Owens said in an oral decision given at the end of an hourslong hearing.The judge did not weigh in on another new abortion law that’s also being challenged in her court: Wyoming’s first-in-the-nation ban on abortion pills. That law, signed by Republican Gov. Mark Gordon on Friday, is not set to take effect until July 1.Two nonprofits, two doctors and two other women have sued to block Wyoming's broader abortion ban.While the new overall abortion ban says abortion is not health care, the new abortion pill ban suggests otherwise, John Robinson, an attorney for the abortion-rights supporters, argued. That pill ban allows “treatment” for miscarriages and to save a woman’s life, he pointed out.“How can abortion be health care in one statute prohibiting abortion and not the other?” Robinson said. “That’s medical treatment.”Even Gordon, in allowing the overall abortion ban to become law without his signature, expressed concern it didn’t resolve the constitutional question, Robinson noted.Special Assistant Attorney General Jay Jerde, however, told the judge that the Legislature is permitted to “interpret the constitution and that interpretation is entitled to significant deference from the court.” He said it would be “almost absurd” to claim, for example, that the amendment would allow illegal treatments in Wyoming such as medical marijuana.Owens suspended a similar abortion ban in Wyoming in July, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending a nationwide right to abortion and leaving it to states to decide. After Owens' previous order, lawmakers wrote a new law to try to address her concerns.Wyoming has only one abortion provider, a women’s health clinic in Jackson that only provides medication abortions but had been forced to stop after the state’s broad ban took effect this week.In Casper, the nonprofit Wellspring Health Access had been planning to open the state's only full-service clinic to provide surgical and medication abortions. Its opening was delayed by an arson fire in May 2022, and authorities on Wednesday announced a woman was arrested in the case. Lorna Roxanne Green, 22, of Casper, was scheduled to appear in federal court in Cheyenne on Thursday.The nonprofit's president, Julie Burkhart, welcomed Wednesday's court ruling.""Regardless of how anti-choice legislators try to spin it, abortion is health care, and Wyomingites have a constitutional right to that care,"" Burkhart said in a statement.After an arson attack prevented that clinic from opening as planned last summer, organizers hoped to open it next month.Gordon said in a statement he was disappointed by the ruling but looked forward for the next chance for the state to defend the abortion ban in court.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843131,Race issues dog 'wild card' prosecutor in Ronald Greene case,"FARMERVILLE, La. (AP) — In this conservative corner of northern Louisiana, where reverence for law enforcement runs deep and Blue Lives Matter flags often fly alongside the Stars and Stripes, the case of five white officers charged in the deadly 2019 arrest of Black motorist Ronald Greene is seen as anything but a slam dunk.So even with explosive body-camera video showing officers stunning, beating and dragging Greene, the Black district attorney in mostly white Union Parish has decided to bring in a hired gun: an experienced white special prosecutor with a folksy law-and-order bravado and a three-decades-long reputation for winning complicated cases across the state.But Hugo Holland’s background is also marked by accusations of racial bias, including new claims uncovered by The Associated Press, that make him an unlikely advocate for racial justice. In fact, he says the concept has no place in the Greene case or anywhere in the justice system.“Justice is justice,” Holland told the AP. “It doesn’t make any difference what race the offender or the victim is. F——— race has got nothing to do with it.”Holland drew criticism as a local prosecutor for displaying a portrait in his office of Confederate general and early KKK leader Nathan Bedford Forrest. He once sent a fellow lawyer an email joking about chasing down “a Black guy or a Mex-can.” And he wrote the judge in the 2021 Kyle Rittenhouse murder trial to say he would never have charged the teen acquitted of killing two people during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, calling it a “good shoot.”Beyond that, Holland has served as a reserve police officer in Bossier City for 20 years and has been criticized for rarely prosecuting police, deciding in 2018 against charging two white sheriff’s deputies seen on body-camera video kicking a Black suspect in the face.“How can we expect him to fight for us to get justice when he is — and loves — the police?” said Breka Peoples, a Shreveport activist who initially thought it was a joke when she heard Holland had been hired in the Greene case. “He’s part of the problem that we have today.”But state prosecutors are betting that Holland’s long record of convictions can finally bring justice to a high-stakes, politically fraught case that has simmered for nearly four years.Greene’s May 10, 2019, death on a rural roadside near Monroe was initially blamed by the Louisiana State Police on a car crash at the end of a high-speed chase over a traffic violation. After officials from the governor on down refused for more than two years to release the body-camera video, the AP obtained and published the footage showing white troopers converging on Greene before he could get out of his car and repeatedly stunning and punching him as he wails, “I’m your brother! I’m scared! I’m scared!” A trooper can later be seen dragging the heavyset Greene by his ankle shackles and he is left face down for more than nine minutes before he eventually goes limp.Years of investigations culminated in December with four current and former Louisiana State Police troopers and a local sheriff’s deputy indicted on various state counts ranging from negligent homicide to malfeasance and obstruction.From the beginning, Greene's family and others worried whether prosecutors could make the indictment stick in a northern Louisiana parish that’s nearly 70% white and deeply conservative. On the same day the officers were charged, a federal jury in Shreveport deadlocked in a civil rights trial, despite viewing graphic footage of a white police officer kicking and assaulting a Black man in custody.“A case like this can be complicated. We really needed someone with a lot of experience,” John Belton, the first Black district attorney of Union Parish, said of his decision to hire Holland for the Greene case. “Hugo is one of the top prosecutors in the state and has a history of seeking justice — regardless of politics and regardless of race.”In an interview, Holland bristled at the accusations of bias he's faced throughout his career, including that he consistently excluded Black people from juries. If those claims were true, he said, then why would an elected Black district attorney knowingly “hire a closet Klansman?”Holland added that, while he is still reviewing evidence in Greene’s death, he would have preferred to have been brought in before the grand jury issued its indictments.“I’m going to review this case with a completely fresh eye,” Holland said. “If I think the grand jury overreached, I’m going to tell the district attorney. If I think something additional needs to be done, I’m going to tell him that as well.”“These cases are sort of like prosecuting a parent for cruelty for disciplining their child: Where is the line? That line is fuzzy. It’s not black and white,” he said. “It’s very unusual for there to be an unlawful use of force. It’s extremely rare.""Of particular interest to Holland are accusations that some officers were involved in a cover-up of Greene’s death. He likened the situation to the Watergate scandal that doomed Richard Nixon’s presidency. “If I can prove the cover-up,” he said, “those people are in trouble.”Holland’s hiring underscores the lingering uncertainty in the Greene case. The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a sweeping review of the Louisiana State Police but has not said whether it will bring its own charges against officers or higher-ups. Meanwhile, a legislative inquiry formed to determine the extent of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards’ role in the case has been dormant for months as members of the committee sought higher office. Even Belton, the district attorney, is running in this year's race for state attorney general.Greene’s mother, Mona Hardin, who has traveled the country drawing attention to her son’s death, remains skeptical about the prospects of the state case.“I want so much to believe that something or someone greater is waiting to do Ronnie justice, but there are question marks all over the place,” said Hardin, who was a guest at the recent State of the Union Address when her attorneys told her the “wild card” Holland had been hired.“All I hear is that he doesn’t like losing,” she said. “But who is he winning for? Is he doing this for the blue?”Bald and bellicose, the 59-year-old Holland is loved and loathed in Louisiana for his brash rhetoric and near-obsession with capital punishment. After a scandal over obtaining automatic weapons forced him from his job as an assistant district attorney in Shreveport, he began prosecuting high-stakes cases around the state on a freelance basis, driven by a passionate belief in “lex talionis,” the law of retaliation.“It would not faze me in the least to watch a man executed,"" Holland said in a 2017 interview. “I can’t imagine how it’s fair for you to take another human being’s life and yours not be forfeited.”It’s not clear how that mindset will apply to Greene’s violent in-custody death, which a medical expert recently deemed a homicide.In 2018, Holland determined two white Rapides Parish sheriff's deputies had been justified in kicking Deterrian Simmons after violently taking the Black man to the ground. Even two steel-toed “distraction strikes” to the man's face were lawful, he said, in part because they did not fracture Simmons' skull, jaw or orbital socket.“Like almost every other suspect injured by officers in any fashion, Simmons' failure to comply caused this entire incident,"" Holland wrote in a memo obtained by AP. “It is a waste of time to bring the officers before a grand jury.”Speaking of the case this week, Holland said: “F——— comply and you won’t get a bloody lip.”Last year, defense lawyers seeking to show bias in the case of a man sentenced to death turned up an email from Holland in 2017 when he wrote that in observance of Veterans Day he planned to “take my pickup and find a Black guy or a Mex-can.”Holland defended his words as “clearly humor."" But defense attorneys argued the email harkened to the infamous 1998 killing of James Byrd, a Black man dragged from a pickup by white supremacists in Texas.Holland also sent an unsolicited letter of support to Judge Bruce Schroeder, the Wisconsin jurist who drew criticism over his courtroom commentary and unorthodox handling of Rittenhouse’s 2021 murder trial.“Haters gonna hate,” Holland wrote, boasting that he too had aroused “the ire of the liberal media.”“I would not have even bothered to take the Rittenhouse case to the grand jury,” he added. “I would have pronounced it a good shoot and been done with it.”Holland wrote that he had long ago stopped reading news coverage about himself, and that his life had become calmer as a result.“I recommend this course to you and remind you that Antonin Scalia said, ‘a man who has made no enemies is probably not a very good man.’”_____Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.",2023/03/22,,World

Jonathan Quick had 31 saves — including 26 over the final two periods — as the Golden Knights moved two points ahead of Los Angeles for first place in the Pacific Division.“We were ready, for sure,” Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. “And we made some plays and capitalized and we scored goals on the forecheck, we created offence off the rush. We took what was there.”Quick got his 375th regular-season win, breaking a tie with John Vanbiesbrouck for second place in league history for U.S.-born goalies. Ryan Miller leads with 391.“You think about some of the guys that are at the top of that list and being in a category with them, it’s just an honor,” Quick said. “And obviously you think about all the guys that kind of helped me get a bunch of those wins and the work they put in and you are just very appreciative of everything.”J.T.

Hughes fired a point shot that Quick stopped and puck went off Miller's stick to Di Giuseppe, who skated to the right and put it in before the goalie could dive over. It was his fourth of the season.“We kind of fixed up our game plan going into the third and tried to keep things more simple,” Vancouver’s Ethan Bear said. “At the end of the day, simple is what works in this league. … It’s a learning experience. It just shows us what works and what doesn’t.”The Canucks pulled Demko for an extra skater with nearly three minutes left on the game clock, but failed to get the equalizer.Kessel got the Golden Knights on the scoreboard first 3:01 into the game as he took advantage of a Vancouver turnover in the Canucks' zone, skated in and put the puck past a sprawled Demko from the right side for his 13th.Smith made it 2-0 with 7:49 left in the first. Karlsson got the puck after Vancouver turned it over behind its own goal and sent a centering pass from the corner to Smith, who fired a one-timer past Demko for his 24th. Karlsson got his 300th point with Vegas on the play and Smith extended his point streak to nine games (four goals, seven assists).Miller scored on a penalty shot after he was slashed by Vegas' Shea Theodore on a short-handed breakaway at 7:57 of the second. Miller skate up the left side and crossed in front of Quick before putting a backhander past the goalie from the right side.Blueger beat Demko from a sharp angle from the left side to restore Vegas' two-goal lead just past the midpoint of the period.Miller pulled the Canucks back within one with his second of the night and 28th of the season as he got a pass from Quinn on a 4-on-3 power play above the left circle and skated up and fired a shot past Quick with 7:18 remaining in the middle period.Dorofeyev made it 4-2 with 3:41 left in the second as he redirected Alex Pietrangelo's shot up and over Demko's left shoulder from the right doorstep.ROAD WARRIORSVegas improved to 22-7-5 away from home, matching the franchise record for road wins set in 2017-18.THOMPSON RETURNSVegas G Logan Thompson returned to the lineup as Quick’s backup.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843133,Muslims in Indonesia celebrate Ramadan amid soaring prices,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Millions of Muslims in Indonesia are celebrating the holy month of Ramadan that was set to begin Thursday as many grappled with soaring food prices as a result of supply disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.From colorful torchlight street parades to cleaning relatives’ graves and sharing meals with family and friends, every region in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country and the largest archipelago has its own way to mark the start of Ramadan.Religious Affairs Minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas announced on Wednesday evening that Ramadan will begin on Thursday after the sighting of the crescent moon was confirmed by Islamic astronomy observers teams from several regions. Most Indonesians — Muslims comprise nearly 90% of the country’s 277 million people — are expected to follow the government’s official date.Shortly after the announcement, mosques flooded with devotees offering evening prayers known as ""tarawih” on the first eve of Ramadan. In Jakarta’s Istiqlal Grand Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, tens of thousands of worshippers crammed together shoulder-to-shoulder.During Ramadan, Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual intercourse from sunrise until sunset. Even a tiny sip of water or a puff of smoke is enough to invalidate the fast. At night, family and friends gather and feast in a festive atmosphere.The fasting is aimed at bringing the faithful closer to God and reminding them of the suffering of the poor. Muslims are expected to strictly observe daily prayers and engage in heightened religious contemplation. They are also urged to refrain from gossip, fighting or cursing during the holy month.Although Indonesia has more Muslims than any other country in the world, its Ramadan traditions have been influenced by other religions. Nyadran is a Javanese ritual heavily influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism that involves visiting ancestors' graves.Each year, thousands of villagers who live on the slopes of Mount Merapi in Central Java visit cemeteries to welcome Ramadan. People clean and decorate graves and make prayers and offerings. They bring various foods in bamboo containers that they eat together after praying.In other regions on the main island of Java, including in the capital, Jakarta, Muslims also mark the holy month by cleaning their relatives’ graves, scattering flower petals on them and praying for the deceased.After evening prayers, many boys and girls across Jakarta parade through the streets of the densely populated neighborhoods. They carry torches and play Islamic songs accompanied by the beat of the rebana, the Arabic handheld percussion instrument.People in Indonesia’s deeply conservative Aceh province celebrate the beginning of Ramadan with Meugang festivities by slaughtering animals such as oxen or buffalo, as well as smaller animals like chicken and ducks. The meat is then cooked and shared with family, friends and the poor and orphans in a communal feast.Hundreds of residents in Tangerang, a city just outside Jakarta, flock to the Cisadane River to bathe in a tradition that involves washing one’s hair with rice straw shampoo to welcome the fasting month with a symbolic spiritual cleansing.Islam follows a lunar calendar, so Ramadan begins around a week and a half earlier each year. At the end of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate the joyous Eid al-Fitr holiday, when children often receive new clothes and gifts.Indonesia's Trade Ministry has said prices of imported staple foods including wheat, sugar, beef and soybeans have increased sharply this year as a result of rising global commodity prices and supply chain disruptions, particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.But many people say the rise in prices not only impacts imported foods but also local commodities like rice, eggs, chili, palm oil and onions. Gas and electricity prices have also gone up. Many blame the government for this.Some Muslims worry how they will cope financially during Ramadan this year.“Prices are going up every week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843140,Taiwan deserter who swam to China faces interrogations by Chinese units,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The soldier who swam from a small outlying island in Kinmen County to China has been interrogated by three separate Chinese government units, the head of Taiwan’s top intelligence agency said Wednesday (March 22).Chen Chia-hsun (陳嘉壎) missed the March 9 morning roll call on the island of Erdan, less than 5 kilometers from the coast of the Chinese province of Fujian. While speculation initially focused on an accident, it soon became clear that Chen had swum away voluntarily and had been picked out of the water by the Chinese authorities.Responding to questions from lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan on Wednesday, National Security Bureau (NSB) Director-General Tsai Ming-yen (蔡明彥) said that the soldier had been interrogated by three separate Chinese government units in Xiamen, CNA reported. However, he was not willing to divulge the nature of those units as that would compromise the sources of his intelligence.The intelligence chief repeated assertions by other Taiwan government officials that Chen’s rank was low, and he was therefore not at risk of betraying useful confidential information about the frontline island to China.Prosecutors in Kinmen County issued a warrant for Chen’s arrest, with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) applying to have him extradited from China. The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) told legislators the process could take some time, citing the example of two Chinese who were picked up in Kinmen and Taichung in May last year and returned to China in January.Chen reportedly did not want to return to Taiwan, but the decision was in the hands of the Chinese authorities, the MAC said. The soldier was likely to be charged in China with illegal entry, which was covered under judicial cooperation agreements between the two sides, allowing extradition to Taiwan.",2023/03/22,2037,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843141,Spring rains coming to Taiwan Thursday will soak weekend,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A weather front will start to bring rain to northern, northeastern, eastern, and central Taiwan on Thursday (March 23) with precipitation expected to increase across the country starting on Saturday (March 25) and continue through Tuesday (March 28), leading to a significant drop in temperatures.Liao Ching-hsiang (廖經翔), a forecaster with the CWB, said that brief, localized showers would occur on Thursday and Friday (March 24) in northern Taiwan, Yilan County, Hualien County, and parts of central Taiwan. Meanwhile, the Facebook page Taiwan Typhoon BBS predicted that a rain cloud belt would arrive in Taiwan on Saturday, increasing the probability of rain across the country well into the start of next week.Liao was cited by ETtoday as saying that southwesterly winds are blowing today (March 22) and the high temperatures will surpass those seen on Tuesday (March 21), with Tainan, Kaohsiung, Hualien, and Taitung likely to see highs exceeding 36 degrees Celsius. Hualien and Taitung will be prone to foehn winds, while scattered showers are likely in central Taiwan and areas north in the afternoon.According to Liao, a weather front will gradually approach from the north on Thursday and Friday, bringing localized brief showers to northern, northeastern, and eastern parts of the country. Liao predicted that on Thursday other areas would see partly cloudy to sunny skies, but by Friday, central Taiwan will likely see brief showers in the middle of the afternoon.Liao forecast that northeasterly winds would strengthen on Saturday and continue to impact the country until Tuesday. In addition, Liao said that a rain belt in Southern China would move eastward, bringing more moisture.From central Taiwan and areas north, the eastern half of the country, and mountainous areas in the south, localized short-term showers are likely on Saturday. Other areas may see ""spring thunder"" over the weekend, but it will depend on the movement of the rain belt in Southern China, said Liao.As for temperatures this week, Liao said that northern Taiwan will see the temperature range between 22-31 degrees on Thursday, 19 to 27 degrees on Friday, and drop by five or six degrees on Saturday when the mercury will range between 16 to 21 degrees. He predicted that central and southern Taiwan will see temperatures range between 21 and 33 degrees on Thursday, 19 to 31 degrees on Friday, and 18 to 27 degrees on Saturday.In Hualien and Taitung, the mercury will range between 23 and 30 degrees on Thursday, the high temperature will drop slightly to 26 degrees on Friday, and a range of 22 to 23 degrees will be likely on Saturday, said Liao.Taiwan Typhoon BBS pointed out that a weather front will approach on Thursday and Friday when northern and northeastern parts of the country will have more cloud cover and even see occasional light rain. On Saturday, the ""spring rain belt"" will officially arrive, bringing rain across the country, predicted Taiwan Typhoon BBS.This rain belt is expected to increase the odds of rain significantly and will likely bring a pattern of overcast conditions and short-term rain all the way until early next week.Taiwan Typhoon BBS forecast that initially the spring rain will be mainly concentrated in central Taiwan and areas north. However, southern Taiwan could also be affected by the periphery of the weather front.",2023/03/22,2268,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843144,Taipei court rules in favor of professor accused of sexual harassment,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A professor at a university in Taipei was accused of sexual harassment and gender discrimination for improper behavior in class, and was mandated by his employer to receive psychological counseling and attend gender equality education courses.However, the professor, surnamed Yang (楊), rejected the punitive decision of the school through an appeal to the Taipei High Administrative Court. This week, the court ruled in favor of the professor and declared that the university’s punishment was in violation of the law.Yang’s allegedly sexist and insensitive behavior was reported by female students in late 2019. The next year, he was mandated by the university to attend psychological counseling and attend eight hours of gender education courses outside of the university, but he refused to comply.The professor, who teaches courses on photography and image editing, frequently used images of scantily clad women as materials for course instruction, reported UDN. Students claimed that he often discussed pornography and made lewd remarks about female photo models and women’s underwear.The most serious allegations against the professor included a claim that he required female students to wear swimsuits for an end-of-semester photoshoot. Another was that he once made a female student sit on a male student’s lap to take a photograph.In Yang’s lawsuit disputing the allegations, he said the claims were unjustifiably exaggerated and that he never forced students to do anything against their will. He claimed the materials used in his class were meant to explain photographic techniques, and were in no way evidence of gender discrimination or harassment.According to Yang, he never coerced students in regards to clothing or posing for shoots. He only offered suggestions, which were voluntarily accepted.The Taipei High Court agreed with Yang, noting that professors should have the freedom to teach their lectures as they see fit. They found that the school did not take into account the particularities of the case, and since there was no evidence of intentional discrimination, that the university’s punitive actions amounted to a violation of the law.",2023/03/22,2742,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843224,"Osimertinib drugs Market Size, Status, Business Growth And Development Factors By 2031","It seems that Report Ocean has published a market research report on the Osimertinib drugs industry, covering over 150 countries and analyzing more than 1,00000 published and forthcoming reports every year. The report was prepared by subject matter experts, researchers, and market research professionals to ensure that the information is compiled from authentic sources and the forecast is highly accurate. The report utilizes various methodologies and analytical approaches, including S.W.O.T. and P.E.S.T.E.L. analysis, and regression analysis, to forecast market growth. The report also examines the regulations and policies that the industry has implemented. The report discusses the industry’s research technology and potential future advancements in the Osimertinib drugs industry.Global Osimertinib drugs market is expected to reach US$ 11,839.8 million by 2027 at a CAGR of 16.1%, from US$ 4828.6 million in 2021, according to a new report.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:-https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS329Osimertinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown promise in treating multiple types of cancer. The drug has been shown to be safe and effective when used as prescribed, and is already being used to treat small cell lung cancer. In recent years, the demand for Osimertinib drugs has grown rapidly due to the positive clinical results seen in cancer patients. This growth is believed to be due to the drug’s adverse effects being manageable when used as prescribed, its low price point, and the increasing awareness of the drug’s potential benefits. The researchers determined that the high demand for Osimertinib drugs was due in part to its unique properties as a double tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Osimertinib is not only effective against tumors with ALCL, but it also targets other types of cancer such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, Osimertinib does not require radiation or surgery for treatment, making it a preferable option for some patients.Market Dynamics
DriversThere are several reasons why Osimertinib is gaining popularity among patients with NSCLC.
? First, Osimertinib has a relatively low risk of side effects when compared to other treatments available to patients.
? Second, Osimertinib has been shown to be an effective treatment in clinical trials and has shown few if any side effects when used in combination with other treatments such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
? Finally, Osimertinib is also inexpensive relative to other treatments available on the market
Restraints
? Limited efficacy of the drug. Osimertinib has a low efficacy rate, meaning that it only works for a small number of patients. This means that there is a high demand for the drug, but not enough people are able to benefit from it. Many patients are left with few options other than radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
? Lack of awareness about the drug. Patients and doctors are relatively unaware of Osimertinib drugs and their potential benefits. As a result, they are unlikely to pursue this treatment option if they consider it available. Furthermore, often insurers do not usually cover these drugs, which creates an even greater hurdle for patients wishing to access them.Regional AnalysisBy region, global Osimertinib drugs market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa. Wherein, North America is the largest consumer of lung cancer drugs such as Osimertinib. In fact, the region generates around 40% of the global market revenue.

Lung cancer drugs are expensive and require a prescription from a doctor. The American Cancer Society estimates that the cost of lung cancer treatment will be $18.1 billion in 2025.
Asia Pacific is projected to grow at the highest CAGR of more than 20% in the years to come thanks to high cancer population in India and China. In fact, more than 50% lung cancer patients are based in China only. This represents a huge growth potential for Osimertinib drug manufacturers in the region.Segment OverviewBy type, the global Osimertinib market is segment into 40mg and 80 mg. Wherein, the 40mg segment is projected to generate a revenue of $8,500 million by 2027.

Further, the rapid urbanization in developing economies also supports market growth.Prominent market players are actively engaged in mergers and acquisitions which is expected to support the growth of the market over the forecast period. For instance, in July 2020, Autodesk, Inc. announced the acquisition of Pype, a company based in Bengaluru, India. With the acquisition,  Autodesk, Inc. aimed to integrate Pype into its Autodesk construction cloud portfolio.Growth InfluencersRise in Construction Spending
The demand for housing has increased significantly over the years. In developing economies such as India, the growing migration of people from rural parts to cities for better opportunities has surged the demand for housing requirements in the cities, which has thereby led to an increase in construction spending. In addition, in the developed countries such as the U.S., the spending on construction is increasing at a considerable rate over the years. Though there was a downfall noticed in construction spending during the initial stage of the Covid-19 pandemic in countries such as the U.S. and the U.K, there has been a considerable spike in construction spending since the second half of 2020. As per the data by the U.S. Census Bureau, for residential construction spending, the seasonally adjusted annual rate was USD 547 Billion in May 2020, which increased to USD 600 Billion by August 2020, and further has topped to USD 700 Billion monthly since December 2020. Conclusively, the growing construction spending is expected to boost the market growth over the assessment period.Project complexityThe growing number of large and complex construction projects owing to the rising housing demand has led to an increase in the adoption of construction technologies such as construction software by the construction business. Construction software provides benefits such as reducing operational costs, streamlining collaboration, improving bidding and estimation, and streamlining project management. According to the data published by Software Advice 2021 Construction Survey, nearly 53%  of construction companies implemented a new construction management tool in 2020.High Deployment and Maintenance CostConstruction software has large upfront investments coupled with yearly maintenance fees. In addition, cloud-based solutions have monthly subscription fees depending upon the number of users. The high deployment and maintenance cost associated with construction software is anticipated to hamper the growth of the market. Small and medium-scale construction businesses may refrain from adopting construction software owing to the cost associated with it.Cybersecurity and Data Protection RisksThe rising cybersecurity attacks in the construction industry may negatively impact the adoption of construction software. The recent instances of cyber-attacks include a maze ransomware attack on Bird Construction, a Canadian firm in December 2019 and ransomware attack on Bouygues Construction in January 2020. In addition, the concerns related to data production may further hamper the adoption of construction software.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS104Segments OverviewThe global construction software market is bifurcated into component, modules, application, and end-user.By Component• Solution/Platform

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843280,Putin says Chinese proposal could be basis for peace in Ukraine,"March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said after talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Tuesday that Chinese proposals could be used as the basis of a peace settlement in Ukraine, but that the West and Kyiv were not yet ready.
In a joint statement at the end of Xi's state visit to Moscow, the two men cautioned against any steps that might push the Ukraine conflict into an ""uncontrollable phase"", adding pointedly that there could be no winners in a nuclear war.
Putin accused Western powers of fighting ""to the last Ukrainian"", while Xi reiterated China's ""neutral position"" on Ukraine and called for dialogue.
""We believe that many of the provisions of the peace plan put forward by China are consonant with Russian approaches and can be taken as the basis for a peaceful settlement when they are ready for that in the West and in Kyiv. However, so far we see no such readiness from their side,"" Putin said.
China's proposal - a 12-point paper calling for a de-escalation and eventual ceasefire in Ukraine - lacks details on how to end the war.
The United States has been dismissive of the Chinese proposal, given Beijing's refusal to condemn Russia over Ukraine, and says a ceasefire now would lock in Russian territorial gains and give Putin's army more time to regroup.
Ukraine has welcomed China's diplomatic involvement but says Russia must pull out its troops and underlines the importance of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
BURGEONING TIES
The Kremlin talks were intended to cement the ""no limits"" partnership the two leaders announced last February, less than three weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.
They signed a series of documents on a ""strategic cooperation"" after what Putin described as ""successful and constructive"" talks showing China was clearly now Russia's most important economic partner.
""I am convinced that our multi-faceted cooperation will continue to develop for the good of the peoples of our countries,"" Putin said in televised remarks.
Xi's state visit is a major boost to Putin as he squares off against what he sees as a hostile West bent on inflicting a ""strategic defeat"" on Russia.
The Chinese leader visited Moscow days after an international court issued an arrest warrant for Putin over Russia's actions in Ukraine, where Russian forces have made little progress in recent months despite suffering heavy losses.
In their joint statement, Xi and Putin also called on the United States to stop ""undermining global strategic security"" and to cease developing a global missile defence system.
While pledging more regular joint military drills, however, the two leaders said the closer relationship between the two countries was not directed against any third nation and that it did not constitute a ""military-political alliance"".
POWER OF SIBERIA DETAILS UNFINISHED
Putin said that Russia, China and Mongolia had completed ""all agreements"" on finishing Russia's coveted pipeline to ship Russian gas to China, and that Moscow was ready to increase oil exports to Beijing.
But a joint statement after the talks said only that the parties involved in the pipeline - which Putin has called just before Xi's visit as ""the deal of the century"" - ""will make efforts to advance work on the study and approval"" of the pipeline.
The English versions of Xi's two statements issued after the meetings do not mention the pipeline.
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters that there are still details that need to be worked out.
""Instructions were given to companies to work out the details of the project in detail and to sign it as soon as possible,"" Russia's state RIA news agency cited Novak as saying.
""Orders have been given to ensure the agreement’s conditions. We hope that it will be this year.""
The planned Power of Siberia 2 pipeline would deliver 50 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas per year from Russia to China via Mongolia. Moscow put forward the idea many years ago, but it has gained urgency as Russia turns to China to replace Europe as its major gas customer.
Russia's Gazprom already supplies gas to China through an existing Power of Siberia pipeline under a 30-year, $400 billion deal launched at the end of 2019. That pipeline spans some 3,000 km (1,865 miles).
Russia's gas exports to China are still a small fraction of the record 177 bcm it delivered to Europe in 2018-19.
Putin said on Tuesday Russia would deliver at least 98 bcm of gas to China by 2030.March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said after talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Tuesday that Chinese proposals could be used as the basis of a peace settlement in Ukraine, but that the West and Kyiv were not yet ready.In a joint statement at the end of Xi's state visit to Moscow, the two men cautioned against any steps that might push the Ukraine conflict into an ""uncontrollable phase"", adding pointedly that there could be no winners in a nuclear war.Putin accused Western powers of fighting ""to the last Ukrainian"", while Xi reiterated China's ""neutral position"" on Ukraine and called for dialogue.""We believe that many of the provisions of the peace plan put forward by China are consonant with Russian approaches and can be taken as the basis for a peaceful settlement when they are ready for that in the West and in Kyiv.

Moscow put forward the idea many years ago, but it has gained urgency as Russia turns to China to replace Europe as its major gas customer.Russia's Gazprom already supplies gas to China through an existing Power of Siberia pipeline under a 30-year, $400 billion deal launched at the end of 2019. That pipeline spans some 3,000 km (1,865 miles).Russia's gas exports to China are still a small fraction of the record 177 bcm it delivered to Europe in 2018-19.Putin said on Tuesday Russia would deliver at least 98 bcm of gas to China by 2030.",2023/03/22,541,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843281,"Ukraine war: As Russia tightens ties with China, West offers $16 billion lifeline to Kyiv","March 22 (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping was due to depart Moscow on Wednesday after a grandiose display of solidarity with Russian President Vladimir Putin against the West, but without offering direct support for Putin's war in Ukraine.
During his two-day visit Xi barely mentioned the Ukraine conflict and said on Tuesday in final remarks that China had an ""impartial position"".
Responding to the Xi-Putin meeting, the White House said China's position was not impartial and urged Beijing to pressure Russia to withdraw from Ukraine's sovereign territory in order to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two.
As Xi prepared to leave Moscow, air raid sirens blared across the Ukraine capital Kyiv and in Ukraine's north and east, with reports of drone attacks, but no major destruction.
Heralded by the Kremlin as a show of support from its most powerful friend, Xi's visit to Moscow featured carefully staged pomp and ceremony, but the spectacle was also marked by plenty of demonstrative bonhomie between the two autocrats.
Xi and Putin referred to each other as dear friends, promised economic cooperation and described their countries' relations as the best they have ever been.
A joint statement included familiar accusations against the West - that Washington was undermining global stability and NATO barging into the Asia-Pacific region - while also asserting that the close partnership between China and Russia did not constitute a ""military-political alliance.""
On Ukraine, Putin praised Xi for a peace plan he proposed last month, and blamed Kyiv and the West for rejecting. The West sees China's peace plan as a ploy to buy Putin time to regroup his forces and solidify his grip on occupied land.
China's 12-point plan has no specific details on how to end the bloody year-long war, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives and forced millions to flee.
The West has sought to isolate Russia through global sanctions and Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court.
China has not supported any of the moves and the West is concerned it may help arm Russia in its conflict, which Beijing has denied.
As Xi and Putin ended their talks on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund announced preliminary agreement with Kyiv on a four-year loan package of about $15.6 billion to the shattered country.
The money would help shore up Ukraine, which has suffered extensive damage to its infrastructure and economy during Russia's year-long assault.
In remarks after his summit with Xi, Putin condemned British plans to send tank ammunition that contains depleted uranium to Ukraine, and warned of repercussions.
""If all this happens, Russian will have to respond accordingly, given that the West collectively is already beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component,"" Putin said, without elaborating.
A day earlier, Britain's Minister of State for Defence Annabel Goldie had said some of the ammunition for the Challenger 2 battle tanks that Britain is sending to Ukraine includes armour piercing rounds which contain depleted uranium.
Separately, the United States intends to speed up delivery to Ukraine of 31 Abrams battle tanks to the autumn, Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told reporters.
Kyiv had clamoured for tanks as well as other sophisticated Western military hardware as the conflict has slowed to a war of attrition with both sides suffering heavy losses.
The Pentagon said a decision to send a variant of the tank that can run on diesel fuel like most of the Ukrainian fleet made faster delivery possible.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy once again implored Ukraine's allies to provide more military aid including ammunition and to do it without delay.
""One of the questions which always commands the utmost attention is the supply of ammunition, support from our partners. We expect increased supplies of exactly what we need - and we need it right now,"" he said in a video address on Tuesday.
European Union countries on Monday pledged to send 1 million artillery rounds over the next year to Ukraine, which has been burning through them faster than allies can supply them.
QUEUING FOR FOOD, WATER
On the ground, bursts of incoming and outgoing artillery fire could be heard in the town of Chasiv Yar just west of Bakhmut, a small eastern city that has been the focus of intense fighting for months.
The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said the fiercest fighting continued to take place near Bakhmut and Avdiivka to the south.
""Today the number of Russian attacks rose sharply. There were some 120 along the principal parts of the front line, about double the number from the day before,"" Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said on YouTube on Tuesday.
Between apartment blocks in Chasiv Yar, mainly elderly residents queued for water and food delivered by a team from the State Emergency Service.
Oleksii Stepanov said he had been in Bakhmut until five days ago but was evacuated when his house was destroyed by a missile.
""We were in the kitchen and the missile came through the roof. The kitchen was all that was left standing,"" said the 54-year-old.
Moscow has launched a massive winter offensive using hundreds of thousands of freshly called-up reservists and convicts recruited as mercenaries from jail.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843282,"Marcos defends US military presence, which China opposes","MANILA, Philippines (AP) — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Wednesday defended his decision to allow a larger United States military presence in the country as vital to territorial defense despite China's fierce opposition and warning that it would “drag the Philippines into the abyss of geopolitical strife.”The Marcos administration announced in early February that it would allow rotating batches of American forces to indefinitely stay in four more Philippine military camps in addition to five local bases earlier designated under a 2014 defense pact of the longtime treaty allies.Marcos said the four new sites would be announced soon and they include areas in the northern Philippines. That location has infuriated Chinese officials because it would provide U.S. forces a staging ground close to southern China and Taiwan.The Biden administration has been strengthening an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan. America's moves dovetail with Philippine efforts to shore up its territorial defense amid a long-seething dispute mainly with China in the South China Sea.Aside from the northern and southern Philippines, Marcos told a news conference that under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, U.S. forces would also be allowed to stay in western Palawan province, which faces the South China Sea. He underscored the moves were meant to boost the country's coastal defense and added in reply to a question that opposition to the U.S. military presence by some local Filipino officials had been overcome.“We explained to them why it was important that we have that and why it will actually be good for their province,” Marcos said, adding most of those who had objections had come around “to support the idea of an EDCA site in their province.”Governor Manuel Mamba of northern Cagayan province, where American forces may be allowed to stay with their weapons in up to two Philippine military areas, said Marcos has the prerogative to make the decision. But added he remained opposed to allowing the Americans to base in Cagayan, which lies across a sea border from southern China and Taiwan, because that could turn his province into a key target of the Chinese military if an armed conflict involving the U.S. military breaks out over Taiwan.“It is the president's call, not mine,” Mamba told The Associated Press. “But I maintain my stand against any foreign forces stationed in my province. Still, I am against EDCA sites in my province.""Marcos spoke to reporters after delivering a speech at an army anniversary ceremony where he asked troops to prepare to face potential external threats after a half-century battle against communist rebels that he said “is coming to an end.”“The army must always be fully prepared and capable for any contingencies, especially considering you are the country's last line of defense against any external security threat,"" he said.U.S. and Philippine officials have said that American-funded construction of barracks, warehouses and other structures to be used by U.S. forces would generate much-needed local jobs and boost the economy. The U.S. presence would help the Philippines respond to natural disasters, enhance combat-readiness and help deter Chinese aggression in Asia.China, however, has repeatedly accused Washington of taking steps to contain it militarily and of driving a wedge between Beijing and its Asian neighbors like the Philippines.“Creating economic opportunities and jobs through military cooperation is tantamount to quenching thirst with poison and gouging flesh to heal wounds,” the Chinese embassy in Manila said in a recent statement. “Such cooperation will seriously endanger regional peace and stability and drag the Philippines into the abyss of geopolitical strife and damage its economic development at the end of the day.”U.S. forces have intensified and broadened joint training, focusing on combat readiness and disaster response with Filipino troops on the nation’s western coast, which faces the disputed South China Sea, and in its northern Luzon region across the sea from the Taiwan Strait.Next month, the allied forces are to hold their largest combat exercise, called Balikatan — Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder — which will include live-fire drills. One planned maneuver involves U.S. and Philippine forces firing rockets to sink a mock enemy ship in waters facing the South China Sea, the Philippine military said.If the ship-sinking exercise proceeds as planned, it would likely draw an angry reaction from China, which claims the strategic waterway virtually in its entirety and has repeatedly warned Washington to stop meddling in what Beijing says is a purely Asian dispute.___Associated Press journalists Joeal Calupitan and Aaron Favila contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,185,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843283,"Ukraine: Russia hits apartments and dorm, killing civilians","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia stepped up its missile and drone attacks against Ukraine on Wednesday, killing students and other civilians, in a violent follow-up to dueling high-level diplomatic missions aimed at bringing peace after 13 months of war.“Russia is shelling the city with bestial savagery,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote in a Telegram post accompanying video showing what he said was a Russian missile striking a nine-story apartment building on a busy road in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia. “Residential areas where ordinary people and children live are being fired at.”At least one person was killed in the attack shown in the Zaporizhzhia video, apparently recorded by closed circuit TV cameras. Elsewhere, Moscow's forces launched exploding drones before dawn, killing at least eight people in or near a student dormitory near Kyiv.Ukrainian media showed several angles of the missile raining down on an apartment building across the street from a shopping mall in Zaporizhzhia, producing a huge plume of gray and black smoke, with bits of concrete flying into the air as cars whizzed by. Videos showed the violent outcome of the attack: charred apartments, flames and smoke billowing out of several floors of the buildings, and piles of broken concrete and shards of glass on the ground. Two children were among the wounded, said Zaporizhzhia City Council Secretary Anatolii Kurtiev, adding that 25 people needed hospital treatment, with three in critical condition.Zaporizhzhia city is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest which has come under threat during the war and has been shut down for months. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency reported the plant had suffered another loss of a backup external power source. Its six reactors still need power to cool nuclear fuel, and were relying on only a primary source Wednesday, the IAEA said.Russia has denied targeting residential areas even though artillery and rocket strikes hit apartment buildings and civilian infrastructure daily. Russian officials have blamed Ukrainian air defenses for some of the deadliest strikes on apartments, saying the deployment of air defense systems in residential areas puts civilians at risk. Russia sometimes also claims Ukraine is hiding military equipment and personnel in civilian buildings.The war, which Russia started Feb. 24, 2022, has evolved in two main directions: a front line mainly in eastern Ukraine, centered around the city of Bakhmut, and periodic Russian missile and drone strikes nationwide. In addition, periodic — although unconfirmed — Ukrainian sabotage attacks have been launched across the border into Russia. The front-line fighting largely stalemated over the winter, with expectations of major offensives by both sides expected in more favorable spring weather.Earlier Wednesday, a drone attack damaged a high school and two dormitories in the city of Rzhyshchiv, south of the Ukrainian capital, officials said. It wasn’t clear how many people were in the dormitories at the time. The body of a 40-year-old man was among those pulled from the rubble on one floor, according to regional police chief Andrii Nebytov, adding that more than 20 people were hospitalized. Video showed what appeared to be a bloodied sneaker and a green ball on the ground near a damaged building, whose top floor was ripped off at a corner.The attacks occurred as dueling diplomatic missions were winding down. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida left Kyiv after meeting Zelenskyy to support Ukraine. Chinese leader Xi Jinping left Moscow after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Beijing's peace proposal, which the West has rejected as a non-starter. No progress toward peace was reported.U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson noted the violent turn of events.“Just one day after Russia called for peace, Russia is attacking Ukrainian homes as part of its brutal war,"" she said in Washington. ""What Russia is doing is horrific -– and we are committed to continuing to help Ukraine defend itself against this Russian aggression.”The drone barrage and other Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure also drew a scathing response from Zelenskyy.“Over 20 Iranian murderous drones, plus missiles, numerous shelling occasions, and that’s just in one last night of Russian terror,” he tweeted in English. “Every time someone tries to hear the word ‘peace’ in Moscow, another order is given there for such criminal strikes.”Zaporizhzhia’s regional administration said two missiles struck the apartment block, saying Russia’s goal is “to scare the civilian population of the city of thousands.”“It’s hell in Zaporizhzhia,” Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko wrote on Telegram, adding: “There aren’t any military facilities nearby.”Vladimir Rogov, an official with the Moscow-appointed regional administration for the Russian-occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region, claimed, without offering evidence, that a Ukrainian air defense missile launched to intercept a Russian missile had hit the apartment complex.In other attacks, Ukrainian air defenses downed 16 of the 21 drones that Russia launched, the Ukraine General Staff said. Eight were shot down near the capital, according to the city’s military administration. Other drones struck west-central Khmelnytskyi province.Also Wednesday, Zelenskyy made another in a series of battlefield visits, meeting with soldiers and officers in the eastern Donetsk region, stopping by a hospital to see wounded troops and giving state awards to the defenders of Bakhmut, a devastated city that has become a symbol of Ukraine’s dogged resistance under a threat of Russian encirclement and for months has been the scene of the war's bloodiest fighting and longest battle. Zelenskyy's last known visit to the Bakhmut area was in December. On Wednesday, the Ukrainian president also visited Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which his forces recaptured from the Russians last September.In other developments:— The Russian military fended off a drone attack on the main harbor in the Black Sea fleet headquarters city of Sevastopol early Wednesday, the city's Moscow-appointed head, Mikhail Razvozhayev, reported. He said the navy destroyed three aquatic drones, that Russian warships weren’t damaged and that several civilian facilities were damaged when the drones were hit and exploded. The blasts shattered windows in several buildings near the harbor. No injuries were reported. Ukrainian officials didn’t claim responsibility for the attack.—Three people were wounded in a Russian missile attack on a monastery in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Tuesday night. According to Ukrainian Presidential Office head Andrii Yermak, two of four missiles were shot down.— Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council that Putin chairs, responded when asked on his messaging app channel whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased: “No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer.”— Ukraine’s Finance Ministry agreed with the International Monetary Fund on a $15.6 billion loan package aimed at shoring up the country's economy, which the invasion has crippled. Ukrainian officials hope the IMF deal will encourage their allies to provide financial support, too.— U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told a House of Representatives committee in Washington that her agency has implemented more 2,500 Russia-related sanctions and “degraded the Kremlin’s ability to replace more than 9,000 pieces of heavy military equipment that it has lost on the battlefield.”___Elise Morton in London and Andrew Katell in New York contributed.—-Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843284,Kurds remain biggest winners from US-led invasion of Iraq,"IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — Complexes of McMansions, fast food restaurants, real estate offices and half-constructed high-rises line wide highways in Irbil, the seat of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.Many members of the political and business elite live in a suburban gated community dubbed the American Village, where homes sell for as much as $5 million, with lush gardens consuming more than a million liters of water a day in the summer.The visible opulence is a far cry from 20 years ago. Back then, Irbil was a backwater provincial capital without even an airport.That rapidly changed after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein. Analysts say that Iraqi Kurds — and particularly the Kurdish political class — were the biggest beneficiaries in a conflict that had few winners.That’s despite the fact that for ordinary Kurds, the benefits of the new order have been tempered by corruption and power struggles between the two major Kurdish parties and between Irbil and Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.In the wake of the invasion, much of Iraq fell into chaos, as occupying American forces fought an insurgency and as multiple political and sectarian communities vied to fill the power vacuum left in Baghdad. But the Kurds, seen as staunch allies of the Americans, strengthened their political position and courted foreign investments.Irbil quickly grew into an oil-fueled boom town. Two years later, in 2005, the city opened a new commercial airport, constructed with Turkish funds, and followed a few years after that by an expanded international airport.Traditionally, the “Kurdish narrative is one of victimhood and one of grievances,” said Bilal Wahab, a fellow at the Washington Institute think tank. But in Iraq since 2003, “that is not the Kurdish story. The story is one of power and empowerment.”With the Ottoman Empire’s collapse after World War I, the Kurds were promised an independent homeland in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres. But the treaty was never ratified, and “Kurdistan” was carved up. Since then, there have been Kurdish rebellions in Iran, Iraq and Turkey, while in Syria, Kurds have clashed with Turkish-backed forces.In Iraq, the Kurdish region won de facto self-rule in 1991, when the United States imposed a no-fly zone over it in response to Saddam’s brutal repression of Kurdish uprisings.“We had built our own institutions, the parliament, the government,” said Hoshyar Zebari, a top official with the Kurdistan Democratic Party who served as foreign minister in Iraq’s first post-Saddam government. “Also, we had our own civil war. But we overcame that,” he said, referring to fighting between rival Kurdish factions in the mid-1990s.Speaking in an interview at his palatial home in Masif, a former resort town in the mountains above Irbil that is now home to much of the KDP leadership, Zabari added, “The regime change in Baghdad has brought a lot of benefits to this region.”Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid, from the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, also gave a glowing assessment of the post-2003 developments. The Kurds, he said, had aimed for “a democratic Iraq, and at the same time some sort of … self-determination for the Kurdish people.”With the U.S. overthrow of Saddam, he said, “We achieved that ... We became a strong group in Baghdad.”The post-invasion constitution codified the Kurdish region’s semi-independent status, while an informal power-sharing arrangement now stipulates that Iraq’s president is always a Kurd, the prime minister a Shiite and the parliament speaker a Sunni.But even in the Kurdish region, the legacy of the invasion is complicated. The two major Kurdish parties have jockeyed for power, while Irbil and Baghdad have been at odds over territory and the sharing of oil revenues.Meanwhile, Arabs in the Kurdish region and minorities, including the Turkmen and Yazidis, feel sidelined in the new order, as do Kurds without ties to one of the two key parties that serve as gatekeepers to opportunities in the Kurdish region.As the economic boom has stagnated in recent years, due to both domestic issues and global economic trends, an increasing number of Kurdish youths are leaving the country in search of better opportunities. According to the International Labor Organization, 19.2% of men and 38% of women aged 15-24 were unemployed and out of school in Irbil province in 2021.Wahab said Irbil’s post-2003 economic success has also been qualified by widespread waste and patronage in the public sector.“The corruption in the system is really undermining the potential,” he said.In Kirkuk, an oil-rich city inhabited by a mixed population of Kurds, Turkmen and Sunni Arabs where Baghdad and Irbil have vied for control, Kahtan Vendavi, local head of the Iraqi Turkmen Front party, complained that the American forces’ “support was very clear for the Kurdish parties” after the 2003 invasion.Turkmen are the third largest ethnic group in Iraq, with an estimated 3 million people, but hold no high government positions and only a handful of parliamentary seats.In Kirkuk, the Americans “appointed a governor of Kurdish nationality to manage the province. Important departments and security agencies were handed over to Kurdish parties,” Vendavi said.Some Kurdish groups also lost out in the post-2003 order, which consolidated the power of the two major parties.Ali Bapir, head of the Kurdistan Justice Group, a Kurdish Islamist party, said the two ruling parties “treat people who do not belong to (them) as third- and fourth-class citizens.”Bapir has other reasons to resent the U.S. incursion. Although he had fought against the rule of Saddam’s Baath Party, the U.S. forces who arrived in 2003 accused him and his party of ties to extremist groups. Soon after the invasion, the U.S. bombed his party’s compound and then arrested Bapir and imprisoned him for two years.Kurds not involved in the political sphere have other, mainly economic, concerns.Picnicking with her mother and sister and a pair of friends at the sprawling Sami Abdul Rahman Park, built on what was once a military base under Saddam, 40-year-old Tara Chalabi acknowledged that the “security and safety situation is excellent here.”But she ticked off a list of other grievances, including high unemployment, the end of subsidies from the regional government for heating fuel and frequent delays and cuts in the salaries of public employees like her.“Now there is uncertainty if they will pay this month,” she said.Nearby, a group of university students said they are hoping to emigrate.“Working hard, before, was enough for you to succeed in life,” said a 22-year-old who gave only her first name, Gala. “If you studied well and you got good grades … you would have a good opportunity, a good job. But now it’s very different. You must have connections.”In 2021, hundreds of Iraqi Kurds rushed to Belarus in hopes of crossing into Poland or other neighboring EU countries. Belarus at the time was readily handing out tourist visas in an apparent attempt to pressure the European Union by creating a wave of migrants.Those who went, Wahab said, were from the middle class, able to afford plane tickets and smuggler fees.“To me, it’s a sign that it’s not about poverty,” he said. “It’s basically about the younger generation of Kurds who don’t really see a future for themselves in this region anymore.”___Associated Press writer Salar Salim in Irbil, Iraq, contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843285,Asian shares decline after Fed hints rate hikes may end soon,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly lower Thursday after the Federal Reserve raised a key interest rate, while noting the end may be near for its economy-crunching hikes to interest rates.The Fed raised its key overnight rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the same size as its last increase, in its campaign to drive down inflation. That effort has been complicated by turmoil in the banking sector, with investors worried that more banks might fail after Silicon Valley Bank’s recent collapse.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.2% to in morning trading to 27,400.37. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.6% to 6,976.40. South Korea's Kospi was little changed, inching down less than 0.1% to 2,416.57. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.9% to 19,774.42, while the Shanghai Composite gave up less than 0.1% to 3,265.26.""A risk-off tone following the recent Fed meeting has set the stage for the Asian region to follow through with some losses,” Yeap Jun Rong, a market analyst at IG, said in a commentary.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 1.6% for its first drop in three days. It closed at 3,936.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6% to 32,030.11, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 1.6% to 11,669.96.Some of the sharpest drops came again from the banking industry after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she's not considering blanket protection for all depositors at all banks, unless they present a risk to the overall system.The Fed's move was exactly what Wall Street was expecting. The bigger question was where the Fed is heading next. There, the Fed gave a hint it may not hike rates much more as it assesses the fallout from the banking industry's crisis.Instead of repeating its statement that “ongoing increases will be appropriate,” the Fed said Wednesday that it now only sees “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.” Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the shift to ”may"" from “will.”The Fed also released the latest set of projections from its policy makers on where rates are heading in upcoming years. The median forecast had the federal funds rate sitting at 5.1% at the end of this year, up only a smidge from where it currently sits, in a range of 4.75% to 5%.The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for the Fed, tumbled to 3.46% from 4.13% just before the projections were released. It was above 5% earlier this month.Powell said Wednesday the Fed is still focused on getting inflation down to its 2% goal and is not envisioning any rate cuts this year. He also said the Fed could begin raising rates again if high inflation makes that necessary.Economic “indicators are still pretty resilient,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “For markets to still speculate on rate cuts, it’s probably not going to take place this year if the Fed has its way.”The Fed was stuck with a difficult decision as it balanced whether to keep hiking rates or ease off the increases given the pain felt by banks. The second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history have both occurred in the last two weeks.A worry is that too much pressure on the banking system, particularly among the smaller and mid-sized banks at the center of investors’ crosshairs, would mean fewer loans made to businesses across the country. That in turn could mean less hiring and less economic activity, pushing the risk of recession still higher.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell 83 cents to $70.07 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard lost 73 cents to $75.96 a barrel.In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 130.58 Japanese yen from 131.39 yen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843286,"After Greek rail disaster, trains gradually restart","ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Train services in Greece resumed Wednesday for the first time since a deadly rail disaster three weeks ago, and just a day after the embattled conservative prime minister announced an early election for May.The Feb. 28 head-on collision, the deadliest in the country’s history, killed 57 people and left dozens injured, with nine still hospitalized.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose center-right government has been struggling to regain its footing after the crash, said late Tuesday said he would hold the election in May ‒ a month later than initially expected ‒ but didn't give an exact date.Greece must hold an election by July when the government’s term expires.Since the crash, the government's lead in opinion polls has roughly halved to as little as three points over its main left-wing rival.“It was a tragedy that should never have happened. It is inconceivable to think that in Greece in 2023 there could be two trains on the same track, traveling in opposite directions, and that no one realized it,” Mitsotakis said in the interview with private Alpha television where he discussed the election date.“I believe people, while feeling anger and rage, understand that this accident resulted from the sum of mistakes made over many decades. We now have an obligation now to deal with them drastically ... We feel a heavy responsibility.”National and suburban train services restarted only along limited sections of the rail network, with additional train and station staff and compulsory speed reduction points at areas where the potential for a collision is considered higher.The first train of the day was the 4:45 a.m. service from Athens to Inoi, 60 kilometers (37 miles) to the north. The suburban rail service from Athens to its international airport was also restored.Full services will resume on April 11, including railway transportation between Athens and Greece’s second-largest city, Thessaloniki.The deadly collision between a passenger train on the Athens-Thessaloniki route and an oncoming freight carrier highlighted long-standing problems with systems to monitor network safety.At Athens' main train station, housekeeper Eli Tosca said that she was eager to use the trains to get to work 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) north of the capital. ""I don’t feel afraid. I feel ready. I was very upset about what happened. I cried a lot but we have to work,” Tosca said. Carrying a heavy backpack, 20-year-old Dax Edgar from Edmonton in Canada said the train restart would help him complete his trip around Europe. “I didn’t even realize the trains were reopening today. I just kind of decided I was going to move on today,"" Edgar said. ""I’ve been in Athens four-five nights. And I’m happy to hear about the restart, that’s for sure. Because the buses are expensive.”",2023/03/22,,World

To achieve its goal, the U.S. is increasing the integration of high-level personnel exchanges and doubling down on security commitments in the Indo-Pacific region, per CNA.
For Taiwan, the strategic competition between the U.S. and China has led to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) increasing its defense budget and military strength year by year, which poses a major threat to Taiwan’s national security, MND said. It pointed out that in recent years, China has continuously ramped up naval and air operations around Taiwan to establish a so-called ""new normal"" through gray zone tactics.
Partnerships including AUKUS, QUAD, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework have achieved more concrete results, which will provide an opportunity for Taiwan to work with like-minded countries and expand its participation in regional economic, trade, and security cooperation, MND said.










Taiwan should focus on collective security cooperation and avoiding isolation, the defense ministry added.
In the Philippines, the U.S. now has access to nine bases, enabling it to maintain air and sea superiority in the Philippine Sea, control strategic areas in the South China Sea and Western Pacific, monitor the CCP’s military activities, and respond to Chinese provocations, MND said.
In Japan, the defense ministry has strengthened its surveillance capabilities against Chinese military vessels and aircraft in order to fill the gap in the defense of its southwestern islands.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, progress had been achieved by video conferencing and with assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Hsu said.The minister emphasized that the new migrant workers would be scheduled to work in the sectors already open to foreign labor, mostly care and manufacturing. At present, Indonesians are predominantly caregivers but also work in factories, while manufacturing mostly employed people from the Philippines and Vietnam, and construction sector workers from Thailand.Turning to demands from hotels to open up the employment of migrant labor, Hsu said the government still preferred to promote the use of older workers and of women returning to the workforce.",2023/03/22,2092,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843330,"Taiwan to import 60 million eggs in April, May","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As Taiwan continues to grapple with a shortage of eggs, the Council of Agriculture (COA) on Wednesday (March 22) announced the country will import 60 million eggs in April and May to make up for the shortfall.At a press conference outside the Legislative Yuan, COA Minister Chen Chi-chung (陳吉仲) said domestic egg production and sales information would be announced every Wednesday, reported UDN. Chen said that based on the latest data, domestic egg production gradually increased over last week.More than 31.5 million laying hens are now producing eggs every day and numbers are continuing to increase. Chen said weather conditions in central and southern Taiwan are ""very good,"" the southerly wind is blowing, and the temperatures have remained at a ""very good level.""Chen emphasized that with the assistance of local governments, the bird flu outbreak has been brought under control, enabling egg production to gradually recover.According to Chen, by the end of March, more than five million eggs will be imported. He said 30 million eggs would be imported in April and 30 million in May.For every five million eggs imported by air from Australia, the government subsidy is NT$30 million (US$984,000), so importing 30 million eggs could require NT$180 million in subsidies. When asked to comment on the potential for increased subsidies, Chen said they would not be as much because eggs are now being imported from eight countries, including the U.S., Australia, Japan, Brazil, Turkey, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia and some are shipped by sea.Chen said egg prices are determined by a small number of groups and there is a gap between the cost to produce eggs and the actual price. In the past, the daily market demand for eggs was 20 million per day and about 100,000 cartons were enough.He said demand is now 24 million eggs per day, an increase of 20%. But as to whether production capacity has increased, Chen said chicken farms are unwelcome in many communities and many county and city governments have imposed strict regulations on such facilities.Ched said that it is difficult to get the necessary permissions to build a poultry house and therefore they have to convert existing livestock farms instead.The COA head said that in response to concerns over a possible egg shortage last year, the daily inventory was adjusted to 30,000 cartons. In response to the greater challenges this year, Chen said the egg inventory will be increased tenfold to 300,000 cartons.",2023/03/22,1868,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843332,"UK inflation jumps to 10.4%, surprising analysts","LONDON (AP) — U.K. inflation accelerated for the first time in four months in February as high food and energy prices hit consumers battered by the nation’s cost-of-living crisis.The consumer price index jumped to 10.4% in the 12 months through February from 10.1% the previous month, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. The figures surprised analysts who had forecast inflation would slow to 9.9%.The figures increased pressure on the Bank of England to approve an 11th consecutive interest rate increase when it meets on Thursday, regardless of concerns about the economic impact of strains on the global banking system. Many economists now expect the central bank to boost its key bank rate by at least a quarter percentage point.“In recent days, some have suggested that the febrile environment in the banking sector should give central banks pause for thought before raising rates further,” said Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, a business lobby. “Today’s data suggests the opposite — the Bank of England’s job is not yet done.”Bank of England policymakers have struggled to contain the fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine, which drove up the cost of food and energy. Those pressures have in turn fueled broader price increases and demands for higher wages.The inflation report highlights the pressures faced by British consumers who spent the winter with one eye on their thermostats and the other watching the steady rise of prices for staples such as milk, eggs and vegetables as the nation’s cost-of-living crisis triggered the biggest decline in living standards since the 1950s.“February’s surprise increase in inflation will raise more concerns for households whose budgets are already stretched to their limits,” said George Dibb of the Institute for Public Policy Research, a progressive think tank. “With some of the biggest contributions to rising prices coming from essentials like food, drinks and clothing, most households will find that their pay packet doesn’t stretch as far.”Food prices jumped 18% in the 12 months through February, compared with the 16.7% rate recorded the previous month.Even after government subsidies designed to shield consumers from the jump in global energy prices, the average household bill for electricity and natural gas rose 27% last year.Economists expect inflation to slow rapidly later this year as recent declines in wholesale energy prices feed through to consumers and last year’s big price increases drop out of the calculations.The Bank of England forecast inflation will drop to 2.9% by the end of this year.But U.K. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt warned that more work is needed to head off further price increases.“Falling inflation isn’t inevitable, so we need to stick to our plan,” he said.",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843334,Australian jury mulls verdicts in Israeli principal trial,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian jury retired on Wednesday to consider their verdicts following the six-week trial of a former principal of a Melbourne ultra-Orthodox Jewish girls school accused of molesting three sisters.Malka Leifer, 56, has pleaded not guilty in the Victoria state County Court to 27 sexual offenses that were allegedly committed at the Adass Israel School, where she was head of religion and later principal, and at her Melbourne home and at school camps in the rural Victorian towns of Blampied and Rawson between 2003 and 2007.Prosecutor Justin Lewis had asked the 12 jurors to consider that Leifer, a Tel Aviv-born mother of eight, showed sexual interest in the girls when they were teenage students at the school and later when they became student teachers there. He alleged that Leifer engaged in sexual activities with them and took advantage of their vulnerability and ignorance in sexual matters, and her position of authority.The sisters had an isolated upbringing in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community and received no sexual education, the court heard. They were aged around 12, 14 and 16 when Leifer arrived at the school from Israel in 2001.Lewis said the sisters had provided explicit evidence that they did not understand the sexual nature of what Leifer did to them. The abuse allegedly occurred at school camps and during private lessons on Sundays at the school and Leifer’s home.Leifer allegedly abused the eldest sister while they shared a bed at a school camp as the middle sibling pretended to be asleep in the same room. Jurors were told the youngest sibling had walked into a room while Leifer was abusing the oldest sister.“Mrs. Leifer was one of the most respected persons in the community. If Mrs. Leifer was doing something then it must be okay,” the youngest sibling testified about her reaction to what she saw happening to her sister.The middle sister told the jury she had tried to form a relationship with another teacher to ask about what Leifer was doing, but Leifer discouraged her. Leifer “told me it wasn’t healthy for me to have a connection with another teacher, to have more than one mentor,” the middle sister testified.The sisters gave evidence over two weeks behind closed doors, with the public and media excluded according to rules governing sexual assault trials in Victoria.Other witnesses included those the sisters disclosed their allegations to.The middle sister first spoke to social worker Chana Rabinowitz in Israel in early 2008. Rabinowitz said she asked the sister who hurt her and the young woman replied “it was Mrs. Leifer.”Psychologist Vicki Gordon testified that she heard the youngest sister claim abuse by Leifer. Gordon told the court the sister claimed Leifer had explained the abuse was an attempt to overcome a lack of warmth and affection in the girls' family life.Leifer’s lawyer Ian Hill told the jury the sisters had revered Leifer and writings from their school years showed them thanking her for being supportive. Hill said the middle sister’s story had changed several times since the allegations were made in 2008.“Truth and reliability were lost in false accounts,” Hill said. “Perhaps even at times hardened into false imaginations and false memories of false realities.""He criticized the youngest sister for changing the location of alleged incidents from the girls’ hometown of Melbourne to Israel.“It’s the wrong memory combined with the detail that shows you just how dangerous some witnesses can be when recounting a narrative to you,” Hill said.Leifer did not testify.She had initially faced 29 charges. But two indecency charges relating to school play rehearsals were dropped during the trial because the incidents were alleged to have occurred before a relevant law came into effect in 2006.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843335,Sotheby's hopes for record sale of ancient Hebrew Bible,"JERUSALEM (AP) — One of the oldest surviving biblical manuscripts, a nearly complete 1,100-year-old Hebrew Bible, could soon be yours — for a cool $30 million.The Codex Sassoon, a leather-bound, handwritten parchment tome containing almost the entirety of the Hebrew Bible, is set to go on the block at Sotheby’s in New York in May. Its anticipated sale speaks to the still bullish market for art, antiquities and ancient manuscripts even in a worldwide bear economy.Sotheby’s is drumming up interest in hopes of enticing institutions and collectors to bite. It has put the price tag at an eye-watering $30 million to $50 million.On Wednesday, Tel Aviv’s ANU Museum of the Jewish People opened a week-long exhibition of the manuscript, part of a whirlwind worldwide tour of the artifact in the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States before its expected sale, on Wednesday.“There are three ancient Hebrew Bibles from this period,"" said Yosef Ofer, a professor of Bible studies at Israel’s Bar Ilan University: the Codex Sassoon and Aleppo Codex from the 10th century, and the Leningrad Codex, from the early 11th century.Only the Dead Sea Scrolls and a handful of fragmentary early medieval texts are older, and “an entire Hebrew Bible is relatively rare,” he said.Starting a few centuries before the Codex Sassoon’s creation, Jewish scholars known as Masoretes started codifying oral traditions of how to properly spell, pronounce, punctuate and chant the words of Judaism's holiest book. Unlike Torah scrolls, where the Hebrew letters are devoid of vowels and punctuation, these manuscripts contained extensive annotation instructing readers how to recite the words correctly.Precisely where and when the Codex Sassoon was made remains uncertain. Sharon Liberman Mintz, a senior Judaica specialist at Sotheby’s, said that radiocarbon dating of the parchment gave an estimated date of 880 to 960. The codex’s writing style suggests its creator was an unspecified early 10th-century scribe in Egypt or the Levant.“It’s like the emergence of the biblical text as we know it today,” Mintz said. “It’s so foundational not only for Judaism, but also for world culture.”Though it's certainly ancient and rare, scholars say the Codex Sassoon doesn't match the pedigree and quality of its contemporary — the Aleppo Codex.“Any Masoretic scholar in their right mind would take the Aleppo Codex over the Sassoon Codex, without any regret or hesitation,” said Kim Phillips, a Bible expert at the Cambridge University Library. He said the scribal quality was “surprisingly sloppy” compared to its counterpart.The Aleppo Codex, dated to around 930, has been considered the gold standard of the Masoretic Bibles for around 1,000 years. The Codex Sassoon’s margins contain an annotation from a later scholar who says he checked its text against the Aleppo Codex — referring to the manuscript by the Arabic title a-Taj, “the Crown.”“The Aleppo Codex is more precise than the Sassoon Codex, there’s no doubt,” Ofer said. “But because it’s missing (a third of its pages), in those parts that are absent, there is great significance to this manuscript.” The Codex Sassoon's 792 pages make up around 92% of the Hebrew Bible.These venerable manuscripts were protected and treasured by Syrian Jewish communities for centuries until the 20th century. How the Sassoon Codex survived the ages is an epic in its own right.A note on the manuscript attest to its owners in centuries past: A man named Khalaf ben Abraham gave it to Isaac ben Ezekiel al-Attar, who gave it to his sons Ezekiel and Maimon.It later migrated east to the town of Makisin in what's today northeast Syria, where it was dedicated to a synagogue in the 13th century. Sometime in the following decades, the synagogue was destroyed and the codex entrusted to Salama ibn Abi al-Fakhr until the synagogue was rebuilt.It never was rebuilt, but the book survived.Its whereabouts for the next 500 years remain uncertain until it resurfaced in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1929, and was bought by a legendary collector of Jewish manuscripts whose name it still bears.David Solomon Sassoon was a Bombay-born son of an Iraqi Jewish business magnate who filled his London home with a massive collection of Jewish manuscripts.“His capacity was astounding, both in terms of number but also in terms of what he was able to find,” said Raquel Ukeles, head of collections at Israel's National Library.Sassoon roved across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa buying up old books, and by his death in 1942, he had amassed over 1,200 manuscripts.Sassoon’s estate was broken up after he died and the codex was sold by Sotheby’s in Zurich in 1978 to the British Rail Pension Fund, which had started investing in art several years earlier, for around $320,000.The pension fund flipped the Codex Sassoon 11 years later for 10 times its hammer price. Jacqui Safra, a banker and art collector, bought it in 1989 for $3.19 million and is now putting it up for auction.If the target price is realized, the Codex Sassoon could not only eclipse the most expensive Jewish document ever sold — the 2021 sale of the Luzzatto Machzor, a 14th-century prayerbook, for $8.3 million. It also could break the record for the priciest historical document ever sold at public auction. That honor is currently held by a 1787 copy of the U.S. Constitution sold in 2021 for $43 million.Yoel Finkelman, a former curator of Judaica at Israel’s National Library, said that prices for Judaica manuscripts have skyrocketed in recent years, but Sotheby’s proposed range is “a different league.”Few institutions, and only a small handful of ultrawealthy collectors, could afford such a price tag. There is precedent, however, of museums joining forces to buy prized manuscripts or philanthropists donating their purchases to libraries and other bodies.Ukeles said that the National Library managed to purchase seven of Sassoon’s manuscripts when his collection was auctioned off in the 1970s, “but this one got away. And so for us, this is an opportunity to bring this great treasure home.”",2023/03/23,,World

More than 350 Japanese companies already operate in Poland, mainly in the manufacturing industry.Kishida later met later with Polish President Andrzej Duda.Kishida visited Ukraine on Tuesday while Chinese leader President Xi Jinping held talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two visits showing how various countries are lining up behind Moscow or Kyiv.Morawiecki said the Chinese leader's visit to Moscow raised “anxiety” and that diplomatic efforts were underway to “persuade China not to back Russia in its aggressive international policy.""___Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843337,Australia becomes top ODI team with stunning win over India,"CHENNAI. India (AP) — Leg spinner Adam Zampa picked 4-45 as Australia beat India by 21 runs in the series-deciding one-day international on Wednesday to claim the No. 1 spot in the ICC’s ODI rankings.Mitchell Marsh’s 47 runs and Alex Carey’s 38 runs had carried Australia to a par score of 269 runs (49 overs). In reply, India was bowled out for 248 runs (49.1 overs) with Virat Kohli’s half-century going in vain.The visitors won the series 2-1 after dropping the first match. Marsh was named player of the series for scoring 194 runs in three innings.“It is just natural aggression when I am batting. I have thoroughly enjoyed it,"" Marsh said, “I was really glad to come in and perform, as I am coming off an extended break.”After winning the toss and opting to bat, Australia sped off to a good start with Marsh and Travis Head (33) putting on 68 runs off 65 balls.Indian pacers Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj struggled with the new ball, but Hardik Pandya took 3-44 in eight overs to bring India back into the game.First, Pandya had Head caught at square leg and three balls later Steve Smith was caught behind for duck. Australia was down to 85-3 within 3.4 overs when Pandya also trapped Marsh lbw.Wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav picked up 3-56, dismissing both David Warner (23) and Marnus Labuschagne (28) as Australia was reduced to 138-5 in 28.1 overs.Warner, who came in at number four, added 40 runs with Labuschagne for the fourth wicket before the duo fell in the space of four overs.Carey held the lower order together as he stitched a 58-run partnership with Marcus Stoinis (25). While the latter was out caught off Axar Patel (2-57) in the 37th over, Yadav bowled Carey to make it 203-7 in the 39th.Australia’s tail wagged hard enough to add 66 runs for the final three wickets, which proved vital.Sean Abbott scored 26 off 23 balls, with Ashton Agar scoring 17 runs. Mitchell Starc and Zampa added 10 runs each to push Australia to a challenging total.India’s chase began on a positive note with openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill adding 65 runs off 55 balls.But the duo fell within a space of 19 balls to leave India at 77-2. Sharma was caught off Abbott after scoring 30 off 17 balls, while Zampa picked his first of the night, trapping Gill lbw for 37 off 49 balls.Kohli spearheaded the chase thereafter scoring a sedate 54 off 72 balls, including two fours and a six. He added 69 runs for the third wicket with Lockesh Rahul (32), before the latter holed out off Zampa, who has his best figures on Indian soil.India went from 146-3 to 151-4, as Patel (2) was run-out after a mix-up with Kohli, who had reached his 64th ODI half-century off 61 balls.He added 34 runs with Pandya but the turning point came in the 36th over when Kohli was caught at long off.Suryakumar Yadav’s horrendous run continued as he fell for a first-ball duck for the third time in the series. Agar bowled him off to reduce India to 185-6 and swing the match in Australia’s favor.Zampa returned to dismiss Pandya, who scored 40 off 40 balls, and Ravindra Jadeja (18) as India lost its first bilateral home ODI series since 2019.The leg spinner was named player of the match.“I have had some success in India,"" Zampa said. “It is a tough place to come and always a huge challenge to play here. I don’t think I deserve this tonight, kudos to the guys who bowled before me. We had trust in our process and in our game plan.”Australia was also the last team to win an ODI series here, and in this duration, India had won seven consecutive bilateral contests at home.India had won the first ODI by five wickets, and Australia had bounced back with a 10-wicket win.“I don’t think it was too many runs,"" said Sharma, the Indian skipper. “The wicket was challenging in the second innings but we didn’t bat well enough. We failed to put up partnerships today. We will play a World Cup in these conditions in six months’ time and we need to improve.” ____More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843338,"Ukraine, IMF agree on $15.6 billion loan package","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund have agreed on a $15.6 billion loan package aimed at shoring up government finances severely strained by Russia's invasion and leveraging even more support by reassuring allies that Ukraine is pursuing strong economic policies and fighting corruption.Ukraine’s finance ministry said Wednesday that the program will “help to mobilize financing from Ukraine’s international partners, as well as to maintain macrofinancial stability and ensure the path to post-war reconstruction after Ukrainian victory in the war against the aggressor.”The loan program will run for four years, with the first 12 to 18 months focusing on helping Ukraine close its massive budget deficit and easing the pressure to print money to use for spending, the IMF said in a statement Tuesday. Printing money to fund people's pensions, state salaries and basic services can make things worse by fueling inflation and destabilizing the currency.The remainder of the program will focus on supporting Ukraine's bid for European Union membership and post-war reconstruction.The IMF deal is expected to leverage even more money for Ukraine because it provides evidence to potential donor governments, including in the Group of Seven major democracies and the European Union, that Ukraine's government is following sound economic policies.The agreement, which still needs approval from the IMF's executive board, “is expected to help mobilize large-scale concessional financing from Ukraine’s international donors and partners over the duration of the program,” Gavin Gray, the IMF's mission chief for Ukraine, said in a statement.The Washington-based IMF said Ukrainian authorities demonstrated their commitment to healthy economic policy and met all agreed-upon goals during a preliminary consultation. The loan program goes beyond previous IMF practice by lending to a country at war, under new rules that allowed assistance due to circumstances of “exceptionally high uncertainty.”Ukraine massively increased military spending while the economy shrank by around 30% in 2022, hitting tax revenue.The result was a huge budget deficit that has been covered by outside financing from the U.S., the EU and other allies. The aid has helped the country end its excessive reliance on money printed by the central bank and loaned to the government, an emergency step considered necessary early in the war but that could fuel inflation and send the currency plunging if prolonged.Before the war, Ukraine had made progress in reforming its banking system and making government contracts more transparent. But it still ranked 122 out of 180 countries on Transparency International's corruption perceptions index.Its pre-war economy was characterized by political involvement from wealthy individuals known as oligarchs and by slow progress on improving the legal system perceived as too open to political influence.The IMF, however, said that after the preliminary consultations, the government has ""made progress in reforms to strengthen governance, anti-corruption and rule of law, and lay the foundations for post-war growth, although the agenda of reforms in these areas remains significant.”Several senior officials, including deputy ministers and governors of front-line regions, were fired in January after allegations of corruption, some related to military spending, embarassed the government. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected in 2019 on an anti-establishment, anti-corruption platform.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.___A previous version of this story was corrected to show that the the IMF said “exceptionally high uncertainty,” not “extremely high uncertainty.”",2023/03/22,,World

After his sentencing in 2001, he escaped to the Philippines where he continued to engage in criminal activity for the next 20 years, until he was apprehended by the Philippine Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) on March 1.TVBS reported that Manila wanted Chen to be tried in the Philippines for charges related to drug trafficking and gun smuggling. However, after several weeks of negotiations with Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), the decision was made to extradite Chen back to Taiwan.Chen was deported to Taiwan on Thursday (March 22) and arrived in Taipei that afternoon. It is expected he will serve out his previous sentence for kidnapping and that he will face trial for new charges related to his escape and recent activity in the Philippines.Over the last decade, Chen developed a reputation as a prolific arms dealer in Manila, known as the “Iron Tyrant” (鐵霸). He was found to be in possession of five pistols when he was arrested by Philippine police officers, reported TVBS.Chen’s arrest in early March led Philippine authorities to uncover a storehouse of illegal weapons in Metro Manila, which was raided earlier this week.",2023/03/22,4556,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843351,Taiwan KMT to skip party primary to pick presidential candidate,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said on Wednesday (March 22) it will choose its 2024 presidential candidate through a consensus meeting.That means the KMT will bypass its traditional party primary to select its candidate.Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) announced the decision at a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting, saying over the past few months the party has sought opinions from local KMT leaders and legislators regarding the nomination method. Chu believes a consensus pick for the presidency can unite the party and avoid potential controversy that would hamstring the candidate.KMT mayors, county magistrates, and legislators will take part in the process to decide the strongest candidate, Chu added. Chu did not say when the candidate would be picked.Earlier this week, Chu described New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) as the party's ""strongest hen,"" which in Taiwanese political speak refers to a party's strongest candidate.In 2015, the KMT’s Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱), who was not considered the party’s strongest candidate, took part in the party's presidential primary and won, to the surprise of many. Hung was initially nominated as the KMT’s 2016 presidential candidate, but was later replaced amid controversy and as her poll numbers slid.Taiwan's presidential election is set to be held on January 13, 2024. Vice President and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Lai Ching-te (賴清德) signed up for his party's primary last week, while former mayor of Taipei and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) Chair Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) has also announced his intention to run in the election.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843360,How political is Ma Ying-jeou's trip to China?,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — Former president and Kuomintang (KMT) chair Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) is going to China on a 12-day Tomb Sweeping Festival journey, with much speculation surrounding what his purpose is and what, and who he will see.From his itinerary, some of it is indeed personal. He plans to visit his ancestors' graves for tomb sweeping.He also plans to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, the Memorial Hall of the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, the Wuchang Uprising Memorial Hall, the Chongqing War Museum, and the Sihang Warehouse Battle Memorial. As a former leader of the KMT, that itinerary makes perfect sense.For the overtly political part of his journey, he will be joined by his family and bodyguards and he will lead a delegation of students. Doubtless the reason for leading this delegation is to educate the already pan-blue students about the KMT’s past and they are also going to be visiting Chinese universities to meet students there.While that sounds innocuous enough, there are several political messages being sent. As the former president, his trip is going to be closely watched, and everything he does is going to be scrutinized for symbolism.One clear message he is sending is that under his administration, relations with China were better and a big part of that was student exchanges and the arrival of students from China to study in Taiwan.Under the administration of Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), the Chinese side is cut off from sending any new students to Taiwan.Ma likely wants to burnish his legacy with this trip and underscore the KMT messaging. Just prior to his trip, Ma publicly endorsed current KMT Chair Eric Chu’s (朱立倫) “pro-America, friends with Japan, peace with China” agenda and slogan.The KMT believe they are more capable of handling relations with China with a resulting peace. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will only warm to relations in exchange for concessions, and in the end they will never be happy until they have annexed Taiwan.The student delegation is a highly symbolic reminder that under the KMT this was once common and that it would resume if the KMT is voted back into power.Speculation exists that Ma timed this trip to China to draw attention away from President Tsai’s trip to the United States and diplomatic partners in the Americas. The case for this is doubtful and Ma’s explanation of the end of the pandemic and to visit his ancestors’ graves for the Tomb Sweeping Festival sounds more likely, bolstered by the time these trips take to prepare, especially with so many students.The Tsai trip was only fairly recently announced but, that it happened to coincide is still bad news for Tsai.While the current president will be trying to firm up diplomatic support for Taiwan by the U.S., the former president's presence in China sends a very different message about Taiwanese priorities. If Ma meets with any prominent CCP officials, it will look even worse.A lot of speculation exists as to why the KMT is sending Ma to China. It is unlikely the KMT is sending Ma to China, it is more likely Ma simply informed the KMT he was going.Eric Chu is not particularly happy about Ma’s trip, and would rather he did not go. The KMT has been trying to de-politicize the trip to further avoid being “painted red.”Underscoring the KMT's concern about this trip, they sent out a bold graphic with the following:Yes universities, No BeijingYes students, No Xi JinpingYes academic exchanges, No political dialogueYes understanding, No demonizationYes worship ancestors, No compromising dignityThe KMT could not stop the former president from going, so they pivoted to damage control mode instead.“No political dialogue” has been the source of intense speculation as, undoubtedly, some CCP officials would like to meet with him.Will Ma keep the KMT’s promise of no political dialogue?Ma will not be meeting with Xi Jinping (習近平). But it is possible he could meet with Wang Huning (王滬寧), who holds several powerful positions, including as Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It has been widely reported that Xi has tasked Wang with coming up with a new formulation on Taiwan to replace “one country, two systems” and possibly the “1992 consensus,” since both have become widely discredited and are ballot box poison in Taiwan.A Wang-Ma meeting could be concerning because Ma does believe in “unification” and, unlike people in the CCP, he is a very experienced politician. He has a much better sense of what could work with voters in Taiwan. His advice would be valuable to Wang.Hopefully, Ma will keep to the KMT’s pledge of no political dialogue. If he does, then the damage caused by the trip will likely be minimized.",2023/03/22,1147,Opinion

Stewart is currently leading a six-member delegation in Taiwan to meet with high-level government officials and discuss Taiwan-U.K. relations, developments in the region, and economic resilience.
The parliamentarian praised Taiwan for its achievements in democratic development, pointing out that what it achieved over 30 years has been “nothing more than miraculous."" Taiwan represents “huge democratic values” and is “on the frontlines of democracy and authoritarianism,” he said.










Stewart mentioned that the delegation had briefly talked about U.K. technical support in Taiwan’s submarine production endeavor. “The message we are taking back is that we should assist Taiwan in its defense as much as possible.”
The U.K. approved companies to export an unprecedented 167 million pounds (NT$6.25 million) worth of submarine-related equipment and technology during the first nine months of 2021, according to Reuters.
Stewart said he and his peers were happy to see the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier sailing in the Indo-Pacific region but lamented that it did not traverse the Taiwan Strait.
He reiterated that the U.K. Parliament is united on Taiwan, which is to give it “as much support as we can.”
The delegation includes fellow lawmakers Rob Butler, Sarah Atherton, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Afzal Khan, and Marie Rimmer.
The Chinese embassy in London protested the group’s trip, accusing the lawmakers of having “insisted on visiting the Taiwan region of China despite China’s resolute opposition.” This is a “gross interference in China’s internal affairs and a serious wrong signal to Taiwan independence separatist forces,” it added.
The group will depart on March 24.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group Chair Bob Stewart on Wednesday (March 22) called for more U.K. and global support for Taiwan at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press conference.“Taiwan is a crucial country for the West,” Stewart said, adding that he encourages more lawmakers and ministers from the U.S., Canada, and European nations to visit Taiwan. “The more that politicians in Europe and U.S. and Canada understand what is happening here, the better.”Stewart is currently leading a six-member delegation in Taiwan to meet with high-level government officials and discuss Taiwan-U.K. relations, developments in the region, and economic resilience.The parliamentarian praised Taiwan for its achievements in democratic development, pointing out that what it achieved over 30 years has been “nothing more than miraculous.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843362,Tradewind Finance Provides Export Factoring Facility for Tiles Trader in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 22 March 2023 - Tradewind Finance has successfully closed a USD 205,000  export factoring facility for a tiles trader in Hong Kong. The funding has enabled the company to improve working capital and develop a diverse portfolio of global buyers.   Established almost 15 years ago, the company has been focusing on exporting tiles and natural stones from China to Australia and New Zealand. With high-quality products and an all-in-one service, including design and project monitoring during production, the trader not only appealed to suppliers but it also developed qualified buyers across the world.   However, as more buyers requested credit terms, which was different from the original payment term T/T before shipment, the self-financing company found it hard to grow its business. Piled-up account receivables resulted in a significant gap in cash flow, which made it difficult to meet financial obligations for suppliers and caused it to decline orders from new buyers in the USA.   Attracted by the 23-year solid track record in trade finance, the client contacted us to ease intense capital pressure. Tradewind's immediate tailor-made funding solutions enabled the trader to accelerate cash flow and reduce trade risks. With the flexible and scalable facility, the company was able to maintain operations, increase business with existing buyers and accept open account orders from new buyers without the fear of a working capital shortage.   ""The experienced client is a professional in tiles trading. With our timely support, the client received stable access to the working capital they needed to operate efficiently,"" said Dickson Au, Regional CEO – Far East, at Tradewind Hong Kong. ""The client is expected to deliver business growth in the near future and we are honored to grow with our clients.""  Hashtag: #TradewindFinance https://www.linkedin.com/company/tradewindfinance/

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843377,"Taiwan’s TSMC, ASML, Synopsys team up with Nvidia on computational lithography","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Nvidia announced on Tuesday (March 21) that it has partnered with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), ASML, and Synopsys to promote the use of its software library for computational lithography.
Nvidia’s new “cuLitho” software library for computational lithography will allow its partners to speed up the design and manufacturing of next-gen chips, according to Nvidia. Computational lithography is the use of mathematical pre-processing of a photomask file to adjust for aberrations and effects in optical lithography, according to eeNews Europe.
According to Nvidia, the advance will allow for chips with smaller transistors and wires than is now achievable, while also speeding up time to market and increasing energy efficiency of data centers to drive the manufacturing process. The computation underlying the lithographic patterning of advanced ICs can be made 40 times more efficient by running it on GPUs instead of general-purpose CPUs, eeNews Europe cited Nvidia as saying.
“It enables 500 Nvidia DGX H100 systems to achieve the work of 40,000 CPU systems, running all parts of the computational lithography process in parallel, helping to reduce power needs and potential environmental impact,” Nvidia said.










Fabs using cuLitho can produce three to five times more photomasks (templates for a chip’s design) per day, while using nine times less power than current setups, according to Nvidia. Meanwhile, a photomask that used to take two weeks can now be processed overnight, Nvidia added.
“With lithography at the limits of physics, Nvidia’s introduction of cuLitho and collaboration with our partners TSMC, ASML, and Synopsys allows fabs to increase throughput, reduce their carbon footprint and set the foundation for 2nm and beyond,” said Jensen Huang (黃仁勳), CEO and founder of Nvidia.
“This development opens up new possibilities for TSMC to deploy lithography solutions like inverse lithography technology and deep learning more broadly in chip manufacturing, making important contributions to the continuation of semiconductor scaling,” said C.C. Wei (魏哲家), CEO of TSMC.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Nvidia announced on Tuesday (March 21) that it has partnered with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843434,Taiwan vice president one step closer to DPP presidential nomination,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Wednesday (March 22) approved the qualifications of its chairman, Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德), to run for president, with the official nomination scheduled for April 12.As Lai was the only person to register as a candidate, the ruling party will not organize primaries to decide on a candidate, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported.As part of the DPP’s selection process, its Central Executive Committee on Wednesday reviewed whether the registered candidate qualified to be the party’s presidential nominee. The conclusion was positive, paving the way for the committee to name Lai as the DPP’s presidential candidate at its next meeting on April 12.Even though Lai serves as the party chairman, he was not present at the committee meeting to avoid a conflict of interest, according to the RTI report. The session lasted less than 10 minutes, with all members agreeing with the results of the review and with the cancelation of the primaries.The change allowed the primaries to decide on the DPP’s legislative candidates to be scheduled for April 17, one week earlier than initially planned. The elections for president, vice president, and for 113 members of the Legislative Yuan will take place on Jan. 13, 2024.The main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), announced Wednesday it would select its presidential candidate without primaries, but by reaching a consensus within party ranks. The three most likely contenders, according to media reports, were New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜), Foxconn Technology founder Terry Gou (郭台銘), and KMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫).A recent opinion poll saw rising public support for Lai at 36.2%, Hou falling to 24.8%, and a potential third candidate, Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) Chairman Ko Wen-je (柯文哲), stable at 19%.",2023/03/22,714,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843435,Japanese beating Americans in baseball is must-see viewing,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese television stuck to its live coverage from Miami for almost two hours after Japan defeated the United States 3-2 to win the World Baseball Classic.This was must see viewing — over and over and over.Shohei Ohtani striking out Los Angeles Angels teammate Mike Trout on a pitch away to end the game was replayed repeatedly between player interviews, beer-sprayed clubhouse interludes, and the traditional “doage"" — team members tossing the winning manager and players into the air.The country's top circulating newspaper Yomiuri rolled out a special Wednesday afternoon edition for commuters, usually reserved for serious matters of state, late-breaking election news, or as it was last year — the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.“Japan, the World's No. 1,” the headline read in Japanese, with commuters at Shibuya station pushing and shoving to grab the collector's item.The victory and the focus on Ohtani for the past two weeks provided a distraction from economic malaise, missile threats from North Korea, and China's rise across Asia and its implications for Japan.It also gave a boost in Japan to baseball, which has been challenged by soccer as the country's favorite sport. Japan is unlikely in the short-term to win soccer's World Cup, but its baseball is world class. It has won three of the five WBC titles, dating to the first event in 2006.Japan joined the Dominican Republic in 2013 as the only unbeaten champions of baseball’s premier national team tournament.“I was OK with either losing or winning,” said Hiroya Kuroda, a 44-year-old in a crowd of about 400 watching the game in a studio at Tokyo Tower. “But I was very moved by the fact that they showed us a dramatic game on that stage in the United States.”Toshiya Ishii, a 29-year-old fan, broke down crying at the victory.“Thank you Ohtani,"" he said. ”Congratulations Samurai Japan. Thank you.""Reports in Japan say Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, just back from Ukraine and talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is to meet with the Japanese team when it returns to Tokyo.“The semifinal against Mexico and the final against the United States were both very close games, but Samurai Japan fought together as one to clinch the victories,” Kishida said on Twitter. “That encouraged me enormously.”Kishida is a former high school player and a big fan of his hometown team, the Hiroshima Carp.Japan beat the Americans at their own game, and it wasn't the first time.American teachers and missionaries popularized the game in Japan in the 1870s and 1880s, but it was a game in 1896 in Yokohama between Americans and Japanese that Japan won 29-4 that helped baseball take root in the country.“The greatest decision I ever made,” said Lars Nootbaar, the St. Louis Cardinals outfielder who was the first to play for Japan by ancestry. He spoke in a television interview after the game, and then hugged his mother, Kumiko, who was standing alongside.“Nippon daisuki,” Nootbaar said in Japanese. “Arigato.”“I love Japan. Thank you.”Nootbaar, Ohtani, pitcher Yu Darvish, and manager Hideki Kuriyama were among those tossed into the air by celebrating teammates.“That’s the first time I’ve ever been lifted up like that before,"" Nootbaar said. ""I hope I got a picture of it because that’s something that I want to remember forever.”___Video journalist Koji Ueda contributed to this report.Follow Japan-based AP sports writer Stephen Wade on Twitter at http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP___AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843436,North Korea fires cruise missiles as allies stage drills,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea launched cruise missiles toward the sea on Wednesday, South Korea’s military said, three days after the North carried out what it called a simulated nuclear attack on South Korea to protest its military drills with the United States.North Korea has stepped up its weapons testing activities, saying they are in response to the ongoing South Korean-U.S. military training that it sees as an invasion rehearsal. Analysts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un likely intends to enlarge his arsenal to win greater outside concessions, while trying to boost an image of a strong leader amid domestic economic hardships.The 11-day South Korean-U.S. drills are to end on Thursday. But North Korea is expected to continue its weapons tests as the United States reportedly plans to send an aircraft carrier in coming days for another round of joint drills with South Korea.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected “several” cruise missile launches from the North’s eastern coastal town of Hamhung. It said the missiles flew into the waters off the North’s east coast and that South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing further details.The launches are the North’s sixth round of missile tests this month and the fourth since the U.S. and South Korean militaries early last week began large-scale military drills, which include field exercises and computer simulations. The field training is the largest of its kind since 2018.The Joint Chiefs of Staff said the South Korean military will maintain a firm readiness and successfully complete the rest of the drills with the United States.North Korea keeps a huge stockpile of ballistic missile systems whose tests are banned by multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. Eleven rounds of U.N. sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 were approved because of North Korea’s previous ballistic missile and nuclear test explosions.Cruise missile tests by North Korea aren’t prohibited by the U.N. council. But experts say they still pose a serious threat to its neighbors because they are designed to fly at a lower altitude to avoid radar detection. Experts say the main mission of North Korean cruise missiles include striking U.S. aircraft carriers or other big enemy ships in the event of conflict.North Korea has called some of its cruise and ballistic missiles “strategic” weapons, a suggestion that it wants to arm them with nuclear warheads. Foreign experts debate whether the North has overcome the remaining technological hurdles to possess functioning nuclear missiles.North Korea’s state media didn’t immediately confirm Wednesday's launches. But it carried a statement by senior Foreign Ministry official Jo Chol Su, which protested what it called recent U.S. diplomatic attempts at the U.N. Security Council to push with the North’s denuclearization.Cho said North Korea will view any outside bid to force it to surrender its nuclear weapons as “a declaration of war.” He said North Korea will sternly deal with such an attempt in line with its escalatory nuclear doctrine.After more than 70 missile tests last year — the largest number for a year — North Korea has extended its provocative run in weapons demonstrations in 2023, launching around 20 missiles in 10 separate events. The weapons that were tested this year included short-range nuclear-capable ballistic missiles capable of striking South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to attack the mainland U.S.On March 12, the day before the South Korea-U.S. drills began, North Korea test-fired two cruise missiles from a submarine. Last month, North Korea launched what it called four long-range cruise missiles that demonstrated potential to strike targets 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away.On Sunday, Kim supervised a test-firing of a short-range ballistic missile launched from what was possibly a silo dug into the ground. State media called it a simulated nuclear attack on unspecified South Korean targets that was meant to send a “stronger warning” to the United States and South Korea over their drills.The North’s media said a mock nuclear warhead placed on the missile detonated 800 meters (2,600 feet) above water, an altitude that some experts say was aimed at maximizing damage.It was the first time for North Korea to publicize such an altitude for detonating a nuclear weapon though it has previously claimed to have conducted simulated nuclear strikes on its rivals.By disclosing such information, North Korea likely wanted to intimidate South Korea and the United States. After a test last week of the country’s longest-range Hwasong-17 ICBM, Kim told state media that the launch was meant to “strike fear into the enemies.”The North’s testing spree indicates Kim is emboldened by his advancing nuclear arsenal. Last year, North Korea legislated a law that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons.South Korea and the United States have been responding by expanding their joint military exercises.Seoul’s Defense Ministry said earlier Wednesday that South Korea and the U.S. are planning to conduct a live-fire exercise that would be “unprecedented” in scale in June.As part of the ongoing joint drills, South Korean and U.S. troops on Wednesday staged live-fire training at a site near the land border with North Korea. Col. Brandon Anderson, deputy commanding officer of the 2nd Infantry Division, stressed that the drills were defensive in nature.“We are (going to) continue to do it,” he said. “It is what we expect to do in conflict and to be good at it.”___Associated Press video journalist Yong Jun Chang in Pocheon, South Korea, contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843437,AP PHOTOS: Marseille carnival melds resistance with revelry,"MARSEILLE, France (AP) — On a sunny afternoon in the center of Marseille in southern France, traffic was stopped as the sound of drumming and a swarm of rollicking beasts filled the streets.The city's unofficial yet infamous Carnaval de la Plaine had arrived — right on the precipice of a week filled with violent protests and discontent over French President Emmanuel Macron's move to force through an unpopular bill raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.Organized by neighborhood residents, the independent carnival is rooted in the local community’s activism against gentrification and all forms of oppression. Residents of this ancient and diverse Mediterranean city take to the streets in the most wacky and elaborate costumes they can come up with, and exercise free rein to throw flour at anyone not in the know — or brave enough to show up in normal clothes.Most editions in recent memory end with riot police dispersing the feisty crowd with tear gas, making police intervention almost part of the tradition.In this year’s edition, held Sunday, a man wearing a Macron mask and dressed in a suit waltzed through the streets, covered in flour thrown by the raunchy dancing crowd.A group of three dressed up as slices of a pizza, each with a price tag of 49.3 euros — a reference to the constitutional article 49.3, used by Macron’s government to push his pension reform through parliament without a vote after weeks of strikes.Rising inflation and the surveillance state were common themes referenced in the bouncing costumes worn by carnival-goers, as they marched around Jean Jaures Square singing and dancing.At sundown, carnival floats were burned so that the procession could dance rings around the flames, as French riot police took positions on the edge of the party.Like many of the anti-government demonstrations that came earlier in the week, the Carnaval de la Plaine concluded with clashes, as French riot police cleared the square of carnival-goers and firefighters doused the remains of the burning effigies.",2023/03/22,,World

The initial reading was a blood alcohol level of 0.69 milligrams per liter, but crew members could be heard complaining to the pilot that he had not properly exhaled.Officers from the Kaohsiung Harbor Police Department later administered another breathalyzer test on the pilot and the result was a blood alcohol level of 0.19 mg/l, reported TVBS.Some of the damage inflicted on the wharf from the collision. (Kaohsiung Harbor Police photo)In a press release issued on Tuesday (March 21), Director of Port Affairs at the Port of Kaohsiung Kuo Kuang-hui (郭光輝) said the ship's speed exceeded six knots.The VTS signal station controller used VHF radio, calling four times within one minute, to warn the pilot, but there was no response. The ship then crashed into Pier 77, causing damage to terminal facilities, upon which Kuo said they will ""seek compensation.""The Maritime and Port Bureau said the pilot did have alcohol in his system, but he was not ""driving"" the ship but rather ""consulting"" with the captain, reported Liberty Times. Unlike the blood alcohol limit of 0.15 mg/l for drivers of motor vehicles in Taiwan, there is no comparable regulation for maritime pilots because they are not considered ""drivers.""The Maritime and Port Bureau and the Taiwan Transportation Safety Board are conducting a joint investigation. If found guilty of a violation, the pilot's license will be suspended for three months to two years in accordance with Article 38 of the Pilotage Law.On Wednesday (March 22), Transportation Minister Wang Kwo-tsai (王國材) said starting now, maritime pilots must undergo a breathalyzer test before navigating.",2023/03/22,4674,Society

Stark-Watzinger, who is the highest-level German official to visit Taiwan since former Minister of Economy Gunter Rexrodt came in 1997, said other German ministers can decide for themselves whether to visit Taiwan or not, but it won’t be too long before another group comes, per Liberty Times.
Stark-Watzinger and her delegation are wrapping up a two-day trip that saw the signing of the “scientific and technological cooperation arrangement” between Germany and Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Council.
The minister said her trip to Taiwan is in line with Germany's “one China” policy. She explained that Taiwan is a potential technological partner and that her ministry hopes to cooperate with its Taiwan counterpart.










Taiwan and Germany face similar challenges, including issues such as semiconductor supply chains, talent cultivation, and energy, she said. ""It is only natural to work closely with Taiwan, a partner with similar values.""
Kai Gehring, a delegation member, said he believes the German government and most parliamentarians have reached the consensus that Germany should cooperate with partners around the world to promote scientific development, including inter-governmental and inter-parliamentary cooperation.

E-cigarettes are banned entirely, including the manufacture, import, sale, supply, exhibition, advertisement, and use of e-cigarettes.2. Unapproved new tobacco products, such as heated tobacco products, and the components necessary for their use, will have to be submitted to the authorities for health risk assessments, and only when they are sanctioned, can they be manufactured, imported, or sold. Even after the new products are sanctioned, they are forbidden to be sold through vending machines or online shopping platforms where consumers’ ages cannot be proven. In addition, no free tobacco products should be provided at any business premises, and no one should provide tobacco products to people under the age of 20 .3. The smoking age has been raised from 18 to 20.4. The required area containing the health hazard warning on a tobacco product package has been increased from 35% to 50%.5. Tobacco products cannot be laced with additives that are banned or not promulgated by the authorities in the central government.6. The areas where smoking is banned are extended to include college campuses, kindergartens, daycare centers, and family child care homes. Bars and nightclubs are listed as no-smoking facilities but allowed to install smoking rooms equipped with independent air conditioning.7. Penalties for violations are increased. For example, manufacturing or importing e-cigarettes is punishable by a fine up to NT$50 million (US$1.65 million).According to a press release by John Tung Foundation, currently nearly 200 brick-and-mortar e-cigarette shops can be found across Taiwan by searching maps on the internet, and searching the country’s three largest online shopping platforms with names of various e-cigarette brands came up with about 700 sales messages. The foundation urged the government to forcibly enforce the news regulations.For more information related to the new regulations, visit this website .(YouTube, Health Promotion Administration video)",2023/03/22,4789,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843503,Super seniors lead the way into March Madness Sweet 16,"Jerome Tang took his time finding the right players to fit into the program he wanted to build at Kansas State.They meshed just right, taking Tang and the Wildcats to the Sweet 16 in a season that started with them being picked to finish last in the Big 12.Four have been downright super.Anchored by fifth-year seniors Markquis Nowell, Desi Sills, Tykei Greene and Abayomi Iyiola, Kansas State is heading from the Little Apple to the Big Apple to face Michigan State at Madison Square Garden on Thursday.“To have guys who have 100 college games under their belt, there are just certain things that you pick up that it doesn’t matter how talented you are that you can’t gain it except through experience,” Tang said.Super seniors have had a huge impact on the teams that have made it this far in March Madness.Nine of the 16 remaining teams have players in fifth seasons granted by the NCAA due to the pandemic. They bring experience, leadership and presence with them on these deep runs into the bracket.“There is no substitute for experience,” Texas interim coach Rodney Terry said. “They understand what type of urgency you have to play with this time of year. They will help the young guys with that.”Terry has leaned on his “old” players since former coach Chris Beard was fired in December. Texas has six players 22 or older, including super seniors Marcus Carr, Sir’Jabari Rice, Timmy Allen and Christian Bishop.Carr started his college career at Pittsburgh in 2017, had a three-year stint at Minnesota that included a redshirt year and is the Longhorns' leading scorer at 15.8 points per game. Rice, a New Mexico State transfer, chips in 12.8 points and hit seven 3-pointers against Colgate. Allen adds 10.3 points after transferring from Utah two years ago and Bishop has been a valuable role player in two seasons since leaving Creighton.“We’ve been battle tested time and time again,” Allen said.Souley Boum is Xavier's leading scorer at 16.5 points per game, helping the Musketeers reach the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2017 after stints at San Francisco and UTEP.Jordan Miller is Miami's second-leading scorer at 15.1 points and is making his second trip to the Sweet 16 after starting his career at George Mason. Rasir Bolton has given Gonzaga another scoring option, 3-point shooting and clutch shots in two seasons since playing at Penn State and Iowa State.David Singleton has been UCLA's sharpshooter in his five seasons in Westwood, hitting 43% from the 3-point arc. He suffered a sprained ankle against Northwestern in the second round, though the Bruins are hoping he can play Thursday against Gonzaga.Even teams that didn't advance to the Sweet 16 had huge impacts from super seniors.Furman pulled off one of the biggest upsets of March Madness' first weekend, knocking off No. 4 seed Virginia after reaching the Tournament for the first time since 1980. Jalen Slawson and Mike Bothwell were a big part of the Paladins' success, averaging more than 33 combined points after deciding to play together for a fifth season.“They weren’t just scorers. They weren’t just really good basketball players. They became leaders,” Furman coach Bob Richey said. “They learned how to bear the burden of expectation. They learned how to bear the burden of people thinking, hey, is this story going to be written how it’s supposed to be written?”Kansas State still has pen to paper.The Wildcats weren't given much of a chance this season. Tang took a calculated approach to building his roster after 19 seasons as an assistant at Baylor, searching for players who would be the right fit.One was already there.Nowell, a 5-foot-7 guard who plays well above his size, averaged 12.4 points under Bruce Weber last season. He upped it to 17.1 while finishing second nationally with 7.8 assists per game.Sills arrived in Manhattan following stints at Arkansas and Arkansas State. Greene played two seasons at Manhattan — the one in New York — and Stony Brook before heading to Kansas State. Iyiola, a 6-9 forward from Nigeria, played at Stetson, Arkansas and Hofstra.The quartet helped Tang navigate a successful first season.“I feel like we’re trying to set a standard, trying to build a legacy for the younger guys that that’s what you want to play in, the best tournament in the country,"" Sill said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843504,"Under oath, Boris Johnson denies he lied over 'partygate'","LONDON (AP) — Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted “hand on heart” Wednesday that he never lied to lawmakers about rule-breaking government parties during the COVID-19 pandemic, mounting a robust defense at a hearing that could damage or even end his tumultuous political career.The House of Commons standards committee questioned Johnson over misleading statements he made to Parliament about a slew of gatherings in government buildings that breached lockdown rules. If the committee concludes that he deliberately lied, he could face suspension or even lose his seat in the Commons.Johnson came out swinging, telling the committee after taking an oath on a Bible: “Hand on heart ... I did not lie to the House.”“If anybody thinks I was partying during lockdown, they are completely wrong,"" Johnson said during a session that displayed his characteristic qualities: blustering self-confidence, verbosity and — to critics — a loose relationship with facts.Johnson also criticized the committee, which has four Conservative members and three from opposition parties, saying it was acting as “investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury.”The hourslong hearing was a moment of peril for a politician whose career has been a roller coaster of scandals and comebacks.If the House of Commons Committee of Privileges concludes Johnson lied deliberately, it would likely end hopes of a return to power for the 58-year-old politician, who led the Conservative Party to a landslide victory in 2019.He was forced out by his own party in July 2022 after getting mired in scandals over money, ethics and judgment.After reports of the parties emerged in December 2021, Johnson repeatedly assured lawmakers that he and his staff had always followed the rules.That turned out to be wrong, Johnson acknowledged. But he said it was “what I honestly believed at the time.”“I apologize for inadvertently misleading this House, but to say that I did it recklessly or deliberately is completely untrue,” he said.In an interim report this month, the committee said evidence strongly suggested that it would have been ”obvious” to Johnson that gatherings in his No. 10, Downing Street offices in 2020 and 2021 broke COVID-19 lockdown rules.But Johnson said it never occurred to him that the events — which variously included cake, wine, cheese and a “secret Santa” festive gift exchange — broke the restrictions on socializing that his own government had imposed on the country.He said he “honestly believed” the five events he attended, including a send-off for a staffer and his own surprise birthday party, were “lawful work gatherings” intended to boost morale among overworked staff members coping with a deadly pandemic.He said that at the June 19, 2020 birthday celebration, no one sang “Happy Birthday” and the ""Union Jack cake remained in its Tupperware box, unnoticed by me.""Johnson said “trusted advisers” assured him that neither the legally binding rules nor the government's coronavirus guidance had been broken.However, several senior officials denied advising Johnson that the guidance always was followed. Written evidence released by the committee on Wednesday showed that principal private secretary Martin Reynolds said that he had “questioned whether it was realistic to argue that all guidance had been followed at all times.”Police eventually issued 126 fines over the late-night soirees, boozy parties and “wine time Fridays,” including one to Johnson, and the scandal helped hasten the end of his premiership.Revelations about the gatherings sparked anger among Britons who had followed the government's pandemic rules, unable to visit friends and family or even say goodbye to dying relatives in hospitals. Police fined thousands of people across the country for minor breaches of the rules.Johnson said he was later “genuinely shocked” by the government's own rule-breaking that was uncovered by police and by senior civil servant Sue Gray, who led an investigation into partygate.If the committee finds Johnson in contempt, it could recommend punishments ranging from an oral apology to suspension from Parliament, though any sanction would have to be approved by the whole House of Commons.A suspension of 10 days or more would allow his constituents in the suburban London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip to petition for a special election to replace Johnson as a member of Parliament.Rivka Gottlieb of the pressure group COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said the session was “a new low for Boris Johnson.”“It’s clear he lied when he said to our faces that he’d done ‘all he could’ to protect our loved ones, he lied again when he said the rules hadn’t been broken in No. 10, and he’s lying now when he denies that was the case,” Gottlieb said.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843505,Transfer portal provided boost for most March Madness teams,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan State coach Tom Izzo is not a big fan of the transfer portal, lamenting that it gives young athletes an easy out instead of an opportunity to overcome challenges.“I’ll say until the day I die, I do not see anything good for the players in it,” Izzo said Tuesday.The seventh-seeded Spartans, however, would not be in the Sweet 16 for the 15th time under their Hall of Fame coach without former Northeastern guard Tyson Walker and ex-Marquette forward Joey Hauser.The Spartans, of course, are not alone in relying on transfers. Not anymore. They are all over March Madness.Third-seeded Kansas State, which will face the Spartans on Thursday night in New York, has relied heavily on transfers with 12 on its roster under first-year coach Jerome Tang. Former Florida forward Keyontae Johnson and ex-Arkansas-Little Rock guard Markquis Nowell, both of whom earned third-team All-America recognition, are starring for the Wildcats.UCLA and Princeton are bucking the trend because they’re still in the Tournament without a transfer player.Izzo could have dipped back into the portal to bolster this season's team after losing his top three scorers and a solid post player from last year's team. Instead, he chose to stick with the players he had after they chose to stay.“There’s something they believed in here,” Izzo said. “That’s the beauty of sticking together. And if it carries us through the weekend, it’ll be one of the great life lessons learned.""EAST REGIONNo. 4 seed Tennessee vs. No. 9 seed Florida AtlanticLike many transfers, Tyreke Key left a smaller program (Indiana State) for a bigger one and the Volunteers are glad he did. After sophomore point guard Zakai Zeigler tore a knee ligament in the final week of the regular season, Key became even more valuable for the postseason.Vladislav Goldin, meanwhile, went against the grain by leaving a larger school for a mid-major program. The 7-foot-1, shot-blocking Russian bolted from Texas A&M to play for the Owls in search of more playing time. He found what he was looking at FAU, starting in 33 games.SOUTH REGIONNo. 1 seed Alabama vs. No. 5 seed San Diego StateAll-America freshman forward Brandon Miller leads the Crimson Tide on the court, but key roles have been filled by a few transfers, including Mark Sears. The former Ohio University guard trails only Miller in scoring and has provided much-needed, 3-point shooting.Four of San Diego State's top five scorers are transfers, including former California standout Matt Bradley, who is averaging a team-high 13 points per game.No. 6 seed Creighton vs. No. 15 seed PrincetonThe Bluejays have two transfers, two more than the Tigers. Baylor Scheierman starts and Francisco Farabello comes off the bench for Creighton. Scheierman was the Summit League player of the year last year at South Dakota State and Farabello played at TCU for three seasons.MIDWEST REGIONNo. 1 seed Houston vs. No. 5 seed MiamiThe Courgars have recruited and developed most of their best players, but former Arkansas forward Reggie Chaney is in the rotation. The Hurricanes second-, third- and fourth-leading scorers are transfers: Jordan Miller (George Mason), Norchad Omier (Arkansas State) and Nijel Pack (Kansas State).No. 2 seed Texas vs. No. 3 seed XavierThe Longhorns often have four transfers in their starting lineup and leading scorer, Marcus Carr, has left two schools. The former Pittsburgh and Minnesota guard along with ex-New Mexico State guard Sir’Jabari Rice, the team's second-leading scorer, are in their sixth season of college. Carr and Rice took advantage of an extra year of eligibility that the NCAA gave athletes if they were in school when the pandemic started.Souley Boum, who started his career at San Francisco and went on to become a star at New Mexico State, leads the Musketeers with 16.5 points a game and is also in his sixth year of college. Former Iowa forward Jack Nunge, ex-Belmont guard Adam Kunkel and former Indiana forward Adam Kunkel are also among Xavier's top players.WEST REGIONNo. 2 seed UCLA vs. No. 3 seed GonzagaWhile the Bruins have no transfers, the Zags have Rasir Bolton, who ranks fourth on the team in scoring, played at Penn State and for Iowa State before landing at Gonzaga. Malachi Smith went from Wright State to Chattanooga before choosing a lesser role at Gonzaga.No. 4 seed UConn vs. No. 8 seed ArkansasThe Huskies' backcourt is full of transfers. Former East Carolina star Tristen Newton runs the point, averaging 10-plus points and nearly five assists per game. Grad student Joey Calcaterra spent four years at San Diego and Nahiem Alleyne was a three-year starter at Virginia Tech.The Razorbacks are in the Sweet 16 for a third straight year in part because coach Eric Musselman has made good use of the portal. Former Wichita State guard Ricky Council leads Arkansas in scoring and Makhi Mitchell, who played at Maryland and Rhode Island, is one of team's top rebounders and scores seven points a game. ___AP Sports Writer John Zenor, Bernie Wilson, Eric Olson, Tom Canavan, Teresa M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843506,"Portugal back with Martínez as coach, Ronaldo in the squad","It’s a new era for Portugal as it begins European Championship qualifying under a new coach and with Cristiano Ronaldo far away from soccer’s biggest stadiums.Portugal starts its Euro 2024 qualifying campaign at home against Liechtenstein in Group J on Thursday, with Roberto Martínez debuting as coach and Ronaldo still in the squad.“It was all in the balance after the World Cup,” Ronaldo said Wednesday. “I reflected with my family and then we came to the conclusion that it was not time to throw in the towel. I learned a lot from it and I’m very happy to be back. The coach says he wants me in the squad. I feel that I still have a lot to give and I want to keep it going.”It will be Ronaldo’s first appearance with Portugal since leaving Europe for Saudi club Al Nassr after a mostly disappointing stint with Manchester United. He is set to break the all-time record of appearances with a national team after tying Bader Al-Mutawa’s mark of 196 outings for Kuwait during last year's World Cup.“Records are always positive,” Ronaldo said. “They are my motivation. I like to break records and this record is special. I’ll be really proud if it happens, but I want to keep playing even more games, I don't want to stop here.”Martínez is taking over from Fernando Santos, who quit in December after Portugal’s elimination by Morocco in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. Santos left amid the controversy of benching Ronaldo in the knockout stage of the tournament in Qatar.“It’s a new chapter for everyone, for the players, the staff and the country,” Ronaldo said. “We feel good energy. It’s a breath of fresh air. I'm not saying that it's better or worse than before, but sometimes in life changes are positive. There are new ideas, a new mindset. You can notice it. You can feel the change and that is good for everyone.”Santos was in charge of Portugal for eight years, leading the national team to the Euro 2016 title — the country’s first major trophy — and the 2019 Nations League title. He reached an agreement with the federation to leave two years before his contract was to end.Martínez ended his six-year stint with Belgium after the team’s disappointing group-stage elimination at the World Cup. He arrived pledging to respect Ronaldo’s history with the national team and said Ronaldo will be among the team captains.“I am surprised by the level of commitment of the players to the national team,"" Martínez said. “Everyone can play. We are starting a new cycle and we want the best. Ronaldo is part of the best and we need his experience.”In addition to Ronaldo, Martínez will inherit a squad filled with talented players such as Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Jota, Gonçalo Ramos and João Félix. The coach made few changes to the squad, with 40-year-old defender Pepe also returning to play alongside the 38-year-old Ronaldo.“We were briefly introduced to him on the training field,” Félix said about Martínez. “He explained to us some of his ideas, mainly for these two games, which are going to be very similar. He talked about the attacking dynamic, the connections between wingers and strikers.”Félix downplayed Portugal’s chances in the matches against Liechtenstein and at Luxembourg on Sunday.“We always have to be prepared and not take any game lightly,” he said. “We have the recent example of the World Cup, when everyone thought we were going to get past Morocco and we didn’t. It’s always complicated, it’s always the best from each country, and everyone plays each game like it is a final. All games will be difficult, both at home and away. We have to be cautious.”Portugal is unbeaten against Liechtenstein, with six wins and a draw in seven matches.Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa was dropped Wednesday because of a muscle injury and replaced by Celton Biai, who plays for Vitoria Guimaraes.Portugal’s Euro 2024 qualifying group also includes Iceland, Slovakia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The top two nations from each of the 10 groups qualify for the final tournament in Germany.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843507,"China calls Xi's Russia visit one of friendship, peace","BEIJING (AP) — China on Wednesday said President Xi Jinping’s just-concluded visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace,” and again criticized Washington for providing military support to Ukraine.The trip that ended Wednesday signaled no new progress in ending the bloody conflict between Russia and Ukraine while shoring up President Vladimir Putin’s standing amid growing efforts to isolate him and his government internationally.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin reiterated China's claims that it remains neutral in the conflict and said it had “no selfish motives on the Ukraine issue, has not stood idly by ... or taken the opportunity to profit itself.”“What China has done boils down to one word, that is, to promote peace talks,” Wang said at a daily briefing.Wang also accused the U.S. of lacking impartiality and of “fanning the flames” of the conflict by providing defensive weapons to Ukraine to Washington's own benefit.The U.S., NATO and partner nations have openly supported Kyiv since the start of the conflict, and China is widely seen as providing economic backing for Putin’s regime while avoiding being directly involved.“President Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia is a journey of friendship, cooperation and peace, which has aroused positive responses in the international community,” Wang said.China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue,” Wang said, an apparent reference to a 12-point peace proposal put forward by Beijing that calls for a cease-fire and negotiations.The document has already been dismissed by the West, largely because China — which has said it has a “no-limits” relationship with Moscow — is not seen as an impartial broker and the proposal says nothing about a Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory it has occupied by force.Xi's visit was heavily promoted by both China and Russia but was overshadowed by a visit to Kyiv by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, a close U.S. ally and a key Chinese rival in east Asia.The U.S. and others have continued to express concerns that China may provide military equipment to supplement its purchases of Russian energy resources and provision of computer chips to keep the Russian economy afloat.The New York Times on Tuesday said Russia had purchased more than $12 million in drones and drone parts from China in the year since the invasion began, citing official Russian customs data provided from a source it did not identify.The paper said it was difficult to tell whether the drones contain American technologies. It said the shipments included products from DJI, which is among the world's leading makers of commercial drones, as well as smaller companies, and were often channeled through a web of brokers and smaller export firms.In other comments on Ukraine, Wang said Russia and China agreed that the U.N. Charter must be observed and international law be respected. It said they opposed unilateral sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others to economically punish Putin and his financial backers.Wang said nothing about the arrest warrant issued for Putin by the International Criminal Court on charges of alleged involvement in abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.In a joint statement signed in Moscow, Russia and China emphasized the need to “respect legitimate security concerns of all countries” to settle the conflict, echoing Moscow’s argument that it sent in troops to prevent the U.S. and its NATO allies from turning the country into an anti-Russian bulwark.“The two sides pointed out that the solution to the Ukraine crisis must respect the legitimate security concerns of all countries and prevent the formation of bloc confrontation and fanning flames,” Wang said Wednesday in Beijing.“The two sides stressed that responsible dialogue is the best way to resolve the issue steadily,” Wang said.“To this end, the international community should support relevant constructive efforts, and the two sides call for the cessation of all actions that could lead to a tense situation and prolonged war, so as to avoid further deterioration or even loss of control of the crisis,” he said.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843508,Macron wants French pension plan implemented by end of year,"PARIS (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron is stubbornly resisting growing discontent on the streets of France, saying on Wednesday that the pension bill he pushed through without a vote in parliament to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 must be implemented by the end of the year.After his interview broadcast on national television, critics attacked Macron, describing him as “self-satisfied,” “out of touch” and “offensive.”Some suggested that the president is playing with fire amid strikes and daily demonstrations, some leading to clashes with police. Unions have called for nationwide protests on Thursday that are likely to further raise tensions.“He is in absolute denial,"" said Olivier Faure, the head of the Socialist Party. It's as though “there's a well lit fire and he is pouring jerrycans of gas on the flames.”The president's remarks Wednesday were his first since the government finally forced the pension bill through parliament last week, then survived two no-confidence votes in the lower chamber of parliament Monday.France's Constitutional Council will review the bill in the coming weeks, and it can only be turned into law after the body gives its approval.Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne has taken the brunt of the opposition's fury during often nasty parliamentary debates, but Macron said in his interview Wednesday that he “trusts” her to continue leading the government and suggested that he is not planning a government reshuffle.The 45-year-old centrist president, in his second and final term, repeatedly said he was convinced that France's retirement system needed to be modified to keep it financed.""That reform is not a luxury, it is not fun. It's a necessity for the country,"" he said, while conceding that ""we must listen to (its opponents), listen to their anger and respond to it.”As he spoke, dockers in Marseille, garbage workers in Paris striking for a 17th day and energy workers at a Normandy refinery were among those refusing to work and setting up blockades.A partial disruption of fuel shipments due to blocked refineries in Normandy and southern France led to shortages at gas stations, notably in the southeast, while rubbish piled up in Paris despite a police order to provide at least a minimum level of service.In the Brittany city of Rennes, a protest by fishermen angry at rising fuel prices and an EU draft plan to ban weighted nets that sweep the seabed turned into a violent confrontation as groups protesting the retirement reform joined in. Police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse rioters burning garbage and throwing flares. At one point, protesters drove a tractor into the mayhem.As a protest in northern Paris degenerated, riot police surged forward, trying to corral rowdy demonstrators down a side street.Two Associated Press journalists at the scene withdrew to let police pass, but officers used their shields to slam the journalists against the wall, pinning them there despite their clear identification as members of the media.The unusually muscular action comes amid growing tensions between police and radical protesters in recent days, after two months of largely peaceful demonstrations. Some journalists say they are being increasingly targeted, by police as well as by some protesters.Macron made a distinction in his interview between the union-organized protests he views as legitimate and the small, mobile groups setting fire to garbage bags and bins that end in confrontations with police.To make his point, the president evoked rioters storming the U.S. Capitol in 2021 and Brazil’s top government buildings earlier this year, as well as the yellow vest movement against social injustice in France in 2018 which led to violent clashes and vandalism in Paris streets.“When the United States of America lived what they lived at the Capitol, when Brazil lived what it lived, when you have seen extreme violence in Germany, the Netherlands, or sometimes here at home in the past ... we must say that we do respect (peaceful protesters), we do listen, we're trying to move the country forward ... but we cannot accept factious people nor factions,” he said.Unions, opposition politicians and other opponents insist they want the retirement measure withdrawn.Workers blocking a waste management plant in Issy-les-Moulineaux on the southern edge of Paris watched the president's interview with disappointment.“We will carry on the resistance,” Frédéric Probel, local leader of the leftist CGT union, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “It's not that (workers) don’t want to work,"" he said, adding, “So what is the message? We must resist.”Macron acknowledged that a majority of the French are opposed to the reform. “But between opinion polls and the general interest of the country, I'm choosing the general interest ... And if it means bearing unpopularity afterwards, I will bear it.”___Associated Press writers Helena Alves and Nicolas Garriga in Paris, Alex Turnbull in Issy-les-Moulineaux and Jeremias Gonzalez in Rennes contributed to this report.",2023/03/23,,World

Brent futures, which have risen more than 3% this week, were down 55 cents, or 0.73%, at $74.77 a barrel at 0755 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 59 cents, or 0.85%, at $69.08.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed U.S. crude inventories rose by about 3.3 million barrels in the week ended March 17, sources said.
That defied expectations for a drawdown of about 1.6 million barrels from eight analysts polled by Reuters.
Traders and analysts will be looking out for data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday to see whether it confirms signs of weaker crude demand.
""However, key for markets today will be the FOMC meeting amid continued uncertainty over whether the Fed will hold rates or hike by 25bp,"" analysts at ING Bank said in a client note.
Markets are awaiting the outcome of what is widely seen as the most challenging Fed policy decision in recent times.
Following the meeting, Chair Jerome Powell is expected to unveil new economic projections and the central bank's path for interest rate hikes.
Despite market expectations for a 25 basis points rate increase, some top central bank watchers say the Fed could well pause further rate hikes or delay releasing new economic projections due to ructions in the global banking sector.
A pause in rate hikes would help stoke economic activity and in turn boost fuel demand.
Oil prices posted their biggest declines in months last week, after high-profile U.S. bank failures beginning March 10 and a crisis at Europe's Credit Suisse. An emergency rescue of Credit Suisse over the weekend helped revive oil prices.
OPEC+ officials, hedge fund managers and oil market participants have called the recent decline in oil prices speculative and insisted that increasing demand will push prices to higher levels in the coming months.
Analysts have also noted that turmoil in the U.S. banking sector could support these fundamentals in the medium term.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843538,Marcos says new military bases with US to be 'scattered' around the Philippines,"MANILA, March 22 (Reuters) - President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Wednesday that four new military bases under a defense agreement with the U.S. would be located in various parts of the Philippines, including in a province facing the South China Sea.
Last month, Marcos granted the U.S. access to four sites, on top of five existing locations under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which comes amid China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and towards Taiwan.
""There are four extra sites scattered around the Philippines - there are some in the north, there are some around Palawan, there are some further south,"" Marcos told reporters at the sidelines of the Philippine army's founding anniversary.
The EDCA allows U.S. access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but it is not a permanent presence.
The Philippines and the U.S. would announce the locations of the bases soon, Marcos said, adding the sites would boost the country's ability to defend the ""eastern side"" of its largest island, Luzon. Luzon is the closest main Philippine island to self-ruled Taiwan that China claims as its own.
China's foreign ministry on Wednesday reiterated its stance that the U.S. side was increasing tensions by strengthening its military deployments in the region, adding countries should be ""vigilant"" and avoid being used by the U.S..
""We generally believe that defence cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability, and should not be aimed at third parties or harm the interests of third parties,"" spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a regular news briefing.
A former Philippine military chief has publicly said the U.S. had asked for access to bases in Isabela, Zambales and Cagayan, all on the island of Luzon, facing north towards Taiwan, and on Palawan in the southwest, near the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
Some leaders of local governments at the potential EDCA sites have opposed Marcos' decision, worried they would be dragged into a conflict if one arose between the U.S. and China over Taiwan.
But Marcos said his government has discussed with them the importance of the expanded U.S. access and ""why it will actually be good for their provinces"".
Washington has committed $80 million worth of infrastructure investments at the five existing sites - the Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, Basa Air Base in Pampanga, Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu and Lumbia Air Base in Mindanao.
Speaking before Philippine troops, Marcos told them to be vigilant as the external threat to security was becoming more ""complex"" and ""unpredictable"".
""Be vigilant against elements that will undermine our hard earned peace, our hard earned stability, continue to improve relations with your counterparts overseas,"" Marcos said.
Without giving specifics, Marcos said he was aware of an ""emerging threat"" to his country's territory, which he said would require ""adjustments in our strategy"".
""The external security environment is becoming more complex. It is becoming more unpredictable,"" Marcos said.MANILA, March 22 (Reuters) - President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Wednesday that four new military bases under a defense agreement with the U.S. would be located in various parts of the Philippines, including in a province facing the South China Sea.Last month, Marcos granted the U.S. access to four sites, on top of five existing locations under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which comes amid China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and towards Taiwan.""There are four extra sites scattered around the Philippines - there are some in the north, there are some around Palawan, there are some further south,"" Marcos told reporters at the sidelines of the Philippine army's founding anniversary.The EDCA allows U.S. access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but it is not a permanent presence.The Philippines and the U.S. would announce the locations of the bases soon, Marcos said, adding the sites would boost the country's ability to defend the ""eastern side"" of its largest island, Luzon. Luzon is the closest main Philippine island to self-ruled Taiwan that China claims as its own.China's foreign ministry on Wednesday reiterated its stance that the U.S. side was increasing tensions by strengthening its military deployments in the region, adding countries should be ""vigilant"" and avoid being used by the U.S..""We generally believe that defence cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability, and should not be aimed at third parties or harm the interests of third parties,"" spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a regular news briefing.A former Philippine military chief has publicly said the U.S. had asked for access to bases in Isabela, Zambales and Cagayan, all on the island of Luzon, facing north towards Taiwan, and on Palawan in the southwest, near the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.Some leaders of local governments at the potential EDCA sites have opposed Marcos' decision, worried they would be dragged into a conflict if one arose between the U.S. and China over Taiwan.But Marcos said his government has discussed with them the importance of the expanded U.S. access and ""why it will actually be good for their provinces"".Washington has committed $80 million worth of infrastructure investments at the five existing sites - the Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, Basa Air Base in Pampanga, Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu and Lumbia Air Base in Mindanao.Speaking before Philippine troops, Marcos told them to be vigilant as the external threat to security was becoming more ""complex"" and ""unpredictable"".""Be vigilant against elements that will undermine our hard earned peace, our hard earned stability, continue to improve relations with your counterparts overseas,"" Marcos said.Without giving specifics, Marcos said he was aware of an ""emerging threat"" to his country's territory, which he said would require ""adjustments in our strategy"".""The external security environment is becoming more complex.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843562,Edmunds: The hottest electric cars to check out in 2023,"Electric vehicles, or EVs, had their best-selling year in 2022. Their market share surpassed 5% according to Edmunds data, which is nearly double than 2021. In 2023, EV sales should continue to soar. But more importantly for consumers, there will also be a larger selection of models to choose from, including electric sedans, SUVs and luxury models. The experts at Edmunds choose five of the most intriguing new EVs, sorted by price, rolling into dealerships this year.2024 CHEVROLET EQUINOX EV Chevrolet will launch two electric SUVs with familiar names: the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV. Of the two, the smaller Equinox could be the more significant simply by virtue of its price; Chevrolet estimates it will start around $30,000. That undercuts all of its rivals and is not much more than the gas-powered Equinox, which has nothing in common but size.For that low price, the Equinox EV provides an estimated 250 miles of range, which should be suitable for many EV shoppers. Chevy will also offer a larger battery pack that gets about 300 miles and a more robust 290-horsepower powertrain with all-wheel drive. If you enjoy technology, then you’ll be pleased to know that the Equinox EV will offer an optional massive 17.7-inch center touchscreen display. You can also add Super Cruise, General Motors’ hands-free highway driving assist system.Estimated starting price: $30,000 Launch date: fall 20232023 NISSAN ARIYA Many are familiar with the Nissan Leaf, one of the first mass-produced electric vehicles. Now Nissan is adding to its portfolio with the Ariya. It’s a compact electric SUV that’s about the size of the electric Ford Mustang Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4.The Ariya’s lineup will start out with an unremarkable range of 216 miles on a single charge. Fortunately, there’s a larger battery pack that boasts more than 300 miles of range and produces up to 389 horsepower with all-wheel drive. Inside, you’ll be greeted by a stylish interior and many technology features, including dual 12.3-inch screens, a head-up display and Nissan’s ProPilot Assist system, which helps make highway driving easier.Starting price: $44,485 Launch date: on sale now2023 HYUNDAI IONIQ 6 The Ioniq 6 will undoubtedly stand out from everything else on the road when it hits the streets later this year. It’s an electric sedan from Hyundai that sports a futuristic, low-slung design. Unlike most electric vehicles that are SUVs, the Ioniq 6 is one of the few non-luxury electric sedans that will compete with the Tesla Model 3.It’s closely related to the Ioniq 5 SUV, sharing most of its componentry. When released, the Ioniq 6 will offer a 225-horsepower rear-wheel-drive model that has an outstanding estimated driving range of up to 361 miles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843564,"India police seek Sikh leader, arrest separatist supporters","NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian police are searching for a separatist leader who has revived calls for an independent Sikh homeland, stirring fears of violence in northwestern Punjab state where there's a history of bloody insurgency.Police have accused Amritpal Singh, a 30-year-old preacher, and his aides of creating discord in the state, which is haunted by the memories of an armed insurgency in the 1980s for an independent Sikh state called Khalistan. The insurgency had prompted a controversial military operation by the Indian government that killed thousands of people, according to official estimates.Authorities have deployed thousands of paramilitary soldiers to the state and suspended mobile internet services in some areas to prevent unrest, Sukhchain Singh Gill, the inspector general of police for Punjab, said Wednesday. He said police have so far arrested 154 supporters of Singh and seized 10 guns and ammunition.Singh has been on the run since the search for him began on Saturday.Singh, who has said he supports the Khalistan movement, captured national attention in February when hundreds of his supporters stormed a police station in Punjab with swords and guns to demand the release of a jailed aide.Very little is known about Singh, who for years drove a truck in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. He emerged in 2022 in Punjab and began leading marches calling for protecting rights of Sikhs who account for about 1.7% of India’s population.His speeches have become increasingly popular among supporters of the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India. Officials see it and affiliated groups as a national security threat. Even though the movement has waned over the years, it still has some support in Punjab and beyond — including in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom, which are home to a sizable Sikh diaspora.On Sunday, supporters of the movement pulled down the Indian flag at the country’s high commission in London and smashed the building’s window in a show of anger against the move to arrest Singh. India’s foreign ministry denounced the incident and summoned the U.K.’s deputy high commissioner in New Delhi to protest what it called the breach of security at the embassy in London.On Wednesday, police removed temporary security barricades outside the British High Commission in New Delhi, news agency Press Trust of India reported. There was no immediate comment from the police or the government whether it was in retaliation to the incident in London.The supporters of the Khalistan movement also vandalized the Indian Consulate in San Francisco on Monday.Singh claims to draw inspiration from Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh militant leader accused by the Indian government of leading an armed insurgency for Khalistan. Bhindranwale and his supporters were killed in 1984 when the Indian army stormed the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion.Singh also heads Waris Punjab De, or Punjab’s Heirs, an organization that was part of a massive campaign to mobilize farmers against controversial agriculture reforms being pushed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. The legislation triggered a year of protests that began in 2020, as farmers — most of them Sikhs from Punjab state — camped on the outskirts of New Delhi through a harsh winter and devastating coronavirus surge. The protests ended after Modi's government withdrew the legislation in November 2021.Waris Punjab De was founded by Deep Sidhu, an Indian actor who died in 2022 in a traffic accident.",2023/03/23,,World

She became the first mother to compete in rowing for Britain at the Olympics and afterward said: “This really is it.”Now, Glover — a mother of three — wants to return to the water again ahead of next year's Paris Games, saying she still feels the need to be challenged.“I think it’s possible that I could be in Paris at the age of 38 and be better than I ever have been,” Glover said, “and that’s what I want to work with the team to become.”Glover has stayed somewhat involved in rowing, earning a silver medal in the beach sprint event of the world rowing coastal championships.That ignited her motivation to perhaps have another shot at the Olympics — something encouraged by her husband.“I feel like we’re at a prime time for mothers in sport,” Glover said. “All this big picture stuff, all this trying to change the face of women in sport, can be quite daunting and quite big. Then I think of the simplicity of looking up and seeing my kids in the grandstand and I think this is going to be cool whatever the outcome.”Glover hasn't specified which event she will look to compete in.___More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World

The TPLF dominated Ethiopian politics for close to three decades before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018. The Tigray conflict began in late 2020.Most of Ethiopia’s 547 lawmakers voted to remove the TPLF from the terror list, with 61 objections and five abstentions, according to the state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation.The TPLF was added to the list in May 2012.Kindeya Gebrehiwot, a senior TPLF official, told The Associated Press the removal will be a “very good step in moving the peace agreement forward.”Ethiopia accused the TPLF of starting the conflict by attacking an army base in Tigray, while the TPLF accused the federal government of preparing to strike first.The peace agreement signed in November has led to the return of communications, banking and other basic services cut to the Tigray region of more than 5 million people. Ethiopia now faces a post-conflict reconstruction bill of $20 billion.Earlier this week, the United States said it had determined that all sides in the conflict committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843567,ECB's Lagarde: Future rate hikes open amid banking turmoil,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said future interest rate decisions are open after upheaval in the global banking system left the economic outlook “blurrier” than just a few weeks ago.Whether to keep hiking rates would depend on incoming data, above all whether the bank could see signs that painfully high inflation is headed convincingly down, she said during a conference Wednesday at Frankfurt’s Goethe University.“With high uncertainty, it is even more important that the rate path is data dependent,” she said. That means “we are neither committed to raise further nor are we finished with hiking rates.”She said “the recent financial market tensions ” have “added new downside risks and have made the risk assessment blurrier.""The open-ended approach is a shift from the ECB's earlier stance of clearly indicating that more rate hikes were in the offing as it underlined its determination to reduce inflation.But the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S. has sent shudders through financial markets due to fears that other banks may suffer losses as central banks in the U.S., Britain and Europe rapidly increase interest rates to battle inflation.Investor worries about banks were intensified by troubles at Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which was rescued through a takeover by rival UBS. Troubles at Credit Suisse long predated the increases in interest rates, however.The ECB raised rates by a larger-than-usual half-percentage point Thursday after all but promising the move in January. It’s targeting consumer prices that rose 8.5% last month from a year earlier in the 20 countries that use the euro currency.Higher rates cool off inflation by making borrowing more expensive for new purchases or expanding a business, reducing demand for goods. But with the banking turmoil, commercial banks may become more hesitant to risk lending, which could restrict credit more than central banks might have intended.The U.S. Federal Reserve is facing a similar conundrum Wednesday. Before the bank woes, the Fed was expected to raise rates by a quarter- or even half-point.In Europe, Lagarde made clear that she sees “no tradeoff” between fighting inflation and supporting stability in the banking system. She says the ECB has separate tools for each issue: interest rates to combat price spikes and lending support to banks in case of risks.Europe’s economic prospects brightened slightly after making it through the winter without running out of natural gas after Russia cut off most supply to the continent amid the war in Ukraine.The German Council of Economic Experts on Wednesday raised its outlook for the eurozone’s largest economy to 0.2% growth from 0.2% contraction in its previous outlook in November.",2023/03/22,,World

The European Union also would send Slovakia 200 million euros ($213 million) in additional compensation, Nad said.The Slovak government still needs to accept the offer.Nad said his country’s armed forces currently don’t have any combat helicopters and that the deal would “significantly increase the defense capability of Slovakia.”On Friday, the Slovak government approved a plan to give Ukraine its fleet of 13 Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets, becoming the second NATO member country to heed the Ukrainian government’s pleas for warplanes to help defend against Russia’s invasion.Slovakia grounded its MiGs in the summer due to a lack of spare parts and expertise to help maintain them. Fellow NATO members Poland and the Czech Republic stepped in to monitor Slovak air space.Slovakia previously signed a deal to buy 14 U.S. F-16 Block 70/72 fighter jets, but delivery was pushed back two years with the first aircraft to arrive in early 2024.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine-war",2023/03/22,188,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843598,"China and Russia: explaining a long, complicated friendship","TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping just concluded a three-day visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a warm affair in which the two men praised each other and spoke of a profound friendship. It’s a high point in a complicated, centuries-long relationship during which the two countries have been both allies and enemies.Chinese and Russian states have loomed large in each other’s foreign affairs since the 17th century, when two empires created a border with a treaty written in Latin.Neighbors can be good friends, or bitter rivals. Sharing a border of thousands of miles, Beijing and Moscow have been both.“China and Russia relations have always been uneasy,” said Susan Thornton, a former diplomat and a senior fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School.""THE SOVIET UNION’S TODAY IS OUR TOMORROW""The People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949, following a brutal Japanese occupation during World War II and a bloody civil war between the Nationalist and Communist Parties.Russia was part of the Soviet Union, a global superpower, while China was poor, devastated by war and unrecognized by most governments. Communist leader Mao Zedong was junior to Josef Stalin, who led the Soviet Union until his death in 1953.The early People’s Republic depended on the Soviet Union for economic aid and expertise. In 1953, the slogan that appeared in Chinese newspapers was “The Soviet Union’s today is our tomorrow.” The Soviets sent some 11,000 experts in 1954-58 to help China rebuild after its civil war, according to Joseph Torigian, an associate professor at American University’s School of International Service.The two countries also had a formal military alliance, but Moscow decided against giving China the technology for nuclear arms.SINO-SOVIET SPLITBut there were points of friction, especially after the death of Stalin.In 1956, then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev condemned Stalin’s “cult of personality” in an address to Communist Party members later known as the “secret speech.” Mao, who had modeled himself on the former Soviet leader, took it personally.When Mao decided to shell two outlying islands of Taiwan held by the Nationalist Party he had defeated in the Chinese civil war, he did not warn Khrushchev. Khrushchev saw it as a betrayal of the alliance, Torigian said. In 1959, the Soviet Union remained neutral during a border conflict between China and India, which led China to feel that it was not getting enough support from its ally.The relationship soured until the two countries broke off their alliance in 1961 in the Sino-Soviet Split.They quickly became open rivals. Beijing blasted Moscow for “phony communism” and revisionism, or straying from the Marxist path. Soldiers clashed along their borders in China's northeast and the western region of Xinjiang.US-CHINA-RUSSIA TRIANGLEThe Sino-Soviet Split left Beijing isolated, but set the stage for outreach to the United States. In 1972, the revolutionary communist state welcomed President Richard Nixon for a visit that paved the way for global recognition of Mao’s government and for the U.S. and China to enter into a tacit alignment against Moscow.The 1990s led to a rapprochement between China and Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The two countries formally settled their border disputes.In the years since, the world has changed greatly, as have the fortunes of the two countries. China is now the world’s second-largest economy, while Russia’s economy was stagnating long before its invasion of Ukraine last year. Today, it is China facing the U.S. in a strategic competition fueled by intense nationalism on both sides.Once again, Moscow and Beijing are finding common ground. Under Xi Jinping, “repairing the damage and cultivating the relationship has gone much faster than it has ever before,” Thornton, the former diplomat, said.LEADERS SEE EYE TO EYEMeanwhile, the similarities between the two leaders, as well as their personal relationship, has helped ties grow.Both Xi and Vladimir Putin see Western attempts to spread democracy as an attempt to de-legitimize themselves, and they believe that authoritarian regimes are better for confronting the challenges of the modern world. Russia supplies energy and China exports manufactured goods to Russia.And while some analysts and commentators have started saying that China is now the senior partner in the relationship, given the history, it’s not necessarily how that’s viewed in China.Russia’s hold over China is not only historical, but also cultural. Students read translated Russian stories and poems in their literature classes, while many educated Chinese of an older generation learned Russian instead of English.“Many Chinese people, including elites, have not yet realized the historic reversal of China’s comprehensive national strength compared to Russia,” wrote Feng Yujun, a prominent Russia scholar at Shanghai’s Fudan University, in an article published last month that was shared widely. Feng declined to be interviewed.“Although China’s national strength is now ten times that of Russia, the biggest challenge is that many Chinese people are still subservient to Russia ideologically,” he wrote.—AP news researcher Wanqing Chen contributed to this report from Beijing.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843599,Netanyahu seeks to soothe US concerns over settlement repeal,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to back down on Wednesday, saying his government has no intention of returning to four abandoned settlements in the occupied West Bank under a law that was repealed by parliament this week.His statement followed harsh U.S. criticism and an international uproar over Netanyahu's far-right government, the country's most hard-line ever, over the Knesset vote early Tuesday to revoke a 2005 law that dismantled the four settlements.The Biden administration summoned Israel's ambassador in Washington hours after the vote — a rare rebuke between the allies. Jordan's parliament, meanwhile, in a largely symbolic vote, approved the expulsion of Israel's envoy over the conduct of a firebrand minister.Netanyahu said the Knesset vote on Tuesday ended a period that discriminated against and humiliated Jews by not allowing them to live in “northern Samaria,” using the biblical term for the West Bank.“That said,"" he said, ""the government has no intention to build new settlements in these areas.”U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman expressed America's concern to Israeli Ambassador Michael Herzog in Washington over the Knesset's vote. Just days earlier, Israel had pledged not to approve new settlement construction or take unilateral actions. Since the 2005 law, Israeli citizens have been officially banned from returning to the four locations, though the Israeli military has allowed activists to visit and pray there.Critics fear the vote could clear the way for rebuilding the four settlements, abandoned nearly 20 years ago when Israeli forces pulled out of the Gaza Strip, and further set back Palestinian hopes for statehood. Most of the international community considers Israel’s West Bank settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians.Sherman and Herzog discussed ""the importance of all parties refraining from actions or rhetoric that could further inflame tensions leading into the Ramadan, Passover, and Easter holidays,"" the U.S. State Department said.Pressure against Israel's new government mounted further Wednesday as the Jordanian parliament voted to expel Israel's ambassador over Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's speech at a podium adorned with a map of Israel that purportedly included Jordan. The incident over the weekend, the parliament in Amman said, “reflects Israeli arrogance that does not respect international treaties and covenants.”Netanyahu's new hard-line government has prioritized settlement construction and triggered unprecedented mass protests inside the country against its plan to overhaul its legal system. On Wednesday in Tel Aviv, hundreds of older women calling themselves “grandmothers for democracy"" rallied in protest against the legal overhaul. Some marched and others whirled in a circle dance as they chanted, “Democracy for our grandchildren.”The United States, along with allies Egypt and Jordan, are keen to keep the atmosphere calm as large numbers of Jewish and Muslim faithful pour into Jerusalem’s Old City, the emotional heart of the conflict. Two years earlier, tensions during Ramadan led to an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.President Joe Biden expressed his concern to Netanyahu during a phone call earlier this week about the new government's plan to roll back the judiciary’s insulation from the political system. Following the Knesset vote, the State Department said it was “extremely troubled” and urged Israel to refrain from allowing settlers to return to the vacated areas.However, Orit Strock — a Cabinet minister, member of the far-right Religious Zionism party and a West Bank settler — dismissed the U.S. criticism, telling Army Radio that both sides “need to know how to accept these opinions and move forward in friendship.” Strock also gave an interview to the settler station Arutz 7 in which she expressed hope that Israel would one day reconquer the Gaza Strip as well.Opposition leader Yair Lapid suggested on Kan radio Wednesday that the new government has squandered a measure of goodwill with the U.S.It has “managed to destroy one of the greatest strategic assets we’ve ever had,” Lapid said. “I can’t explain to you how powerful it is when you, as prime minister or foreign minister, enter every room in the world and everyone knows that you are there and you got Washington’s backing. We don’t have that anymore.”The Palestinians seek the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an independent state, with east Jerusalem as its capital. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Mideast war. Since then, more than 700,000 Israelis have moved into dozens of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843600,TikTok sends influencers to Washington as its troubles grow,"WASHINGTON (AP) — TikTok is ramping up a public relations campaign to fend off the possibility of a nationwide ban by the Biden administration, and it’s bringing some unconventional advocates to help: online influencers.Dozens of TikTok creators — some with millions of followers on the video-sharing app — came to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to lobby in favor of the platform, one day before lawmakers are slated to grill the company’s chief executive about concerns over user data falling into the hands of the Chinese government.Shou Zi Chew plans to tell Congress on Thursday that TikTok, which was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs, is committed to user safety, data protection and security, and keeping the platform free from Chinese government influence. He will also answer questions from U.S. lawmakers worried about the social media platform's effects on its young user base.At the heart of TikTok’s trouble is a Chinese national intelligence law that would compel Chinese companies to fork over data to the government for whatever purposes it deems to involve national security. There's also concern Beijing might try to push pro-China narratives or misinformation through the platform.At a media event coordinated by TikTok on Wednesday, some content creators acknowledged that concerns about data security are legitimate, but pointed to precautions the company is taking, such as a $1.5 billion plan — dubbed Project Texas — to route all U.S. data to domestic servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle.TikTok has been attempting to sell that proposal to the Biden administration, but skeptics have argued it doesn't go far enough. The administration is reportedly demanding the company's Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a nationwide ban.Janette Ok, a fashion and beauty influencer on TikTok, said in an interview Wednesday that TikTok invited her to the lobbying event a few weeks ago and paid for her trip to Washington. She’s been able to make a full-time career from her videos, earning income from partnerships with brands looking to capture the eyes of her 1.7 million followers. She said her popularity on TikTok has also allowed her to have other opportunities, like TV and commercial acting roles.“I don’t know much about politics, but I know a lot about fashion, and I know a lot about people,” Ok said. “And just to be here and share my story is what TikTok has invited me to do.”Tensions around TikTok have been building on Capitol Hill, reaching a boiling point late last year when a proposal to ban the app off of government phones passed with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Joe Biden. House Republicans are pushing a bill that would give Biden the power to ban the app.Other bills have also been introduced — some bipartisan — including a measure that would circumvent the challenges the administration would face in court if it moved forward with sanctions against the social media company.The effort to target TikTok is part of a larger, tougher approach that Congress has taken in the past several months as China’s relationship with two U.S. adversaries — Russia and Iran — has come into focus. A recent incident with a spy balloon forced even some wary congressional Democrats to join Republicans in opposition, and there is now a strong bipartisan concern in Washington that Beijing would use legal and regulatory power to seize American user data or use the platform to push favorable narratives or misinformation.But the company has also gotten support from at least three progressive lawmakers who say they oppose a ban on the platform. At a news conference Wednesday with the influencers, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., characterized the national security concerns that have been raised as xenophobic hysteria due to TikTok's Chinese origins. He said if Congress wants to have an “honest” conversation about data collection, it should focus on a national privacy law that targets all social media companies - not just TikTok.“Usually when there's an issue of national security concern, they hold a bipartisan Congressional briefing on that particular issue,” Bowman said. “We have not received a bipartisan Congressional briefing on the national security risk of TikTok.”TikTok’s response to the political pressure can be seen all around the nation’s Capitol, with the company putting up ads in area airports and metro stations that include promises of securing users data and privacy and creating a safe platform for its young users. Last year, the company spent more than $5.3 million on dispatching lobbyists to the Hill to make its case, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks lobbying spending.On Thursday, Chew will be sticking to a familiar script as he urges officials against pursuing an all-out ban on TikTok or for the company to be sold off to new owners. TikTok's efforts to ensure the security of its users' data go “above and beyond” what any of its rivals are doing, according to Chew's prepared remarks released ahead of his appearance before the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Chew pushed back against fears that TikTok could become a tool of China's ruling Communist Party because its parent company, ByteDance, was founded in Beijing and also operates from there.“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said.He distanced TikTok from its Chinese roots and denied the “inaccurate” belief that TikTok's corporate structure makes it “beholden to the Chinese government."" ByteDance has evolved into a privately held “global enterprise,” Chew said, with 60% owned by big institutional investors, 20% owned by the Chinese entrepreneurs who founded it and the rest by employees.It's “emphatically untrue” that TikTok sends data on its American users to Beijing, he said.""TikTok has never shared, or received a request to share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government,"" Chew said. “Nor would TikTok honor such a request if one were ever made.”Whether those promises will alleviate concern is another matter. TikTok has come under fire in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific, where a growing number of governments have banned the app from devices used for official business. India, Afghanistan and Indonesia have banned it nationwide.Chew, a 40-year-old Singaporean who was appointed CEO in 2021, said in a TikTok video this week that the congressional hearing comes at a “pivotal moment” for the company, which now has 150 million American users.Chew said TikTok’s data security project is the right answer, not a ban or a sale of the company.“No other social media company, or entertainment platform like TikTok, provides this level of access and transparency,” he said.The company started deleting the historical protected data of U.S. users from non-Oracle servers this month, Chew said. When that process is completed later this year, all U.S. data will be protected by American law and controlled by a U.S.-led security team.“Under this structure, there is no way for the Chinese government to access it or compel access to it,” he said.He said a TikTok ban would hurt the U.S. economy and small American businesses that use the app to sell their products, while reducing competition in an “increasingly concentrated market.” He added that a sale “would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access.”",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843601,"Tear gas, clashes as Lebanon protesters try to storm govt HQ","BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese security forces Wednesday fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters, mainly retired soldiers, who tried to break through the fence leading to the government headquarters in downtown Beirut.The violence came amid widespread anger over the harsh economic conditions in the country, where mismanagement by the ruling class has been rampant for years, preceding the economic meltdown that started in late 2019.The retired soldiers and policemen demanding better pay clashed with riot police and troops. Several people suffered breathing problems from the tear gas. The protesters hurled stones at the officers protecting the government headquarters and repeatedly tried to break through the fence.There was no immediate information about any injuries during the violence. The protest was called for by retired soldiers and depositors who have had limited access to their savings after local banks imposed informal capital controls amid the crisis.The controls restrict cash withdrawals from accounts to avoid folding amid currency shortages. People with dollar accounts can only withdraw small sums in Lebanese pounds, at an exchange rate far lower than that of the black market.Since early Wednesday, riot police and army special forces were deployed around the government headquarters, an Ottoman-era three-story building known as the Grand Serail of Beirut.Nearly two hours after the violence broke out, the protesters dispersed.The Lebanese pound hit a new low on Tuesday, selling for more than 143,000 pounds to the dollar before making some gains. The pound has lost more than 95% of its value over the past three years. The official rate is 15,000 pounds to the dollar.“My monthly salary is $40. How can I survive,” screamed a retired army officer.Most people in Lebanon get paid in Lebanese pounds and have seen the value of their salaries drop over the past years as the pound crashed.With trust in the pound declining, most grocery stores, restaurants and other businesses have opted to start pricing their goods and services in dollars. While this “dollarization” aims to ease inflation and stabilize the economy, it also threatens to push more people into poverty and deepen the crisis.Retired Lebanese soldier Fancois Saliba, 56, told The Associated Press that before the crisis he made the equivalent of $1,000 a month. But now — despite several raises — his monthly income is worth about $50.“I pay more than that for my wife's treatment,” said Saliba, whose wife has multiple sclerosis. “How can we eat, drink and pay our bills?”Lebanon, a small Mediterranean nation of 6 million people, including 1 million Syrian refugees, is in the grips of the worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by a political class that has ruled the country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.The political class has also resisted the implementation of reforms demanded by the international community. Since the economic meltdown began, three-quarters of the population, which includes 1 million Syrian refugees, now lives in poverty and inflation is soaring.Lebanon has also stalled on reforms agreed to with the International Monetary Fund to enable access to $3 billion in a bailout package and unlock funds in development aid to make the economy viable again.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843602,LGBTQ activists in Japan launch engagement group ahead of G7,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese LGBTQ activists and rights groups have launched a civil “engagement group” to make policy proposals ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Japan and announced plans to hold an inaugural Pride 7 summit in Tokyo later this month, seeking to accelerate their efforts to get the Japanese government to adopt an anti-discrimination law.Japan is the only member of the Group of Seven advanced industrialized nations that lacks a law protecting the rights of LGBTQ people.“Other G-7 members are watching if Japan enacts an anti-discrimination law,” said Natsuo Hayashi, co-director of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation, a local civil group.His group, joined by two other organizations, on Wednesday announced the launch of Pride 7, which plans to make policy proposals for G-7 organizers in the hopes of achieving an LGBTQ anti-discrimination law in Japan while also addressing problems in other countries, especially in Asia. P-7 is joined by rights organizations in 10 other countries, including six other G-7 members, as well as Thailand, Vietnam, Botswana and Mexico, and the EU.Gon Matsunaka, another member of the group, said a P-7 summit will be held on March 30 with ambassadors from G-7 nations and representatives of economic organizations and labor unions. Matsunaka said they plan to submit a policy recommendation to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.LGBTQ activists and their supporters have stepped up their efforts to achieve an anti-discrimination law following discriminatory remarks in February by a former Kishida aide, who said he wouldn’t want to live next to LGBTQ people and that citizens would flee Japan if same-sex marriage were allowed.Amid national outrage over the remarks, Kishida's Liberal Democratic Party and other non-partisan lawmakers have begun preparing legislation to promote awareness of LGBTQ rights, but some conservatives have shown resistance.The activists noted that Japan signed the communique adopted at the G-7 Elmau summit hosted in Germany last year that calls for “full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls in all their diversity as well as LGBTIQ+ persons in politics, economics, education and all other spheres of society,"" and must fulfill its commitment.Support for sexual diversity has grown slowly in Japan and legal protections are still lacking for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. They often face discrimination at school, work and at home, causing many to hide their sexual identities.In recent years, more than 200 local municipalities, including Tokyo, have introduced certificates of partnerships for same-sex couples allowing them to rent apartments and sign documents in medical emergencies, and for inheritance. Still, the certificates are not legally binding and same-sex couples are often barred from visiting each other in the hospital and from getting access to other services available to married couples.Recent surveys have shown the majority of Japanese support legalizing same-sex marriage. Rights activists say the conservative government has stonewalled the push for equal rights supported by the general public.Kishida has insisted that allowing same-sex marriage would change Japan’s family values and the society and require a careful decision. He has not clearly expressed his view, and is seen as indecisive amid his considerations about governing the ultra-conservatives in his party who object to a law spelling out anti-discrimination against LGBTQ people.The party quashed an attempt to enact an equality awareness promotion law ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. While momentum is on the rise ahead of the G-7, experts say legalizing an anti-discrimination law for LGBTQ people would have to wait sometime if they miss this chance.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843603,Fury-Usyk fight unlikely as rematch terms scupper deal,"The proposed fight between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk to become the first undisputed world heavyweight champion since 2000 appeared to be off Wednesday, with the boxers seemingly unable to agree to rematch terms.Usyk’s promoter, Alex Krassyuk, told British broadcaster talkSPORT that his fighter broke off negotiations with Fury because his rival was “putting so many obstacles in front of making the deal.”Frank Warren, Fury's British promoter, responded by saying the big stumbling block centered around a dispute over the split of earnings from a rematch.Warren said he hoped negotiations can resume but time was running out for a deal to be reached for what would be one of the biggest fights in a generation.The last heavyweight to be the undisputed world champion was Lennox Lewis in 1999-2000.Usyk, the WBA, WBO and IBF champion, went on social media last week to accept Fury's terms for a proposed April 29 fight in London, notably a 70-30 split of earnings from the bout in favor of Fury, the WBC titleholder.They were given a deadline of April 1 by the WBA to officially agree to a deal, otherwise Usyk would be ordered to undertake a mandatory title defense.“There was a feeling that after Usyk accepted 70-30, Tyson Fury started to think he can put a saddle on his neck and start riding Usyk as much as he can. It is not right,"" Krassyuk said.“Usyk accepted the 70-30 split. He was so loyal and he was so willing to make this fight happen. But this fight is not about Tyson Fury. It is about the WBC belt and (Usyk) expanding his collection.""Warren said the two parties reached an agreement on everything apart from the terms of the rematch clause, even as far as booking hotels and flights and which fighter walks to the ring first inside Wembley Stadium.Fury didn't initially want a rematch to be included in the deal but Warren said he convinced his fighter to change his mind.“We've got to a situation about how is the rematch going to work, how is it going to be split, the money for the winner and the loser. That's what we've been working on,” Warren said.“I think,” he added, “if common sense prevails, we can get an outcome.”Krassyuk has previously said Usyk could instead fight British boxer Daniel Dubois, who holds the WBA regular title and is a mandatory challenger for Usyk.As for Fury, there could now be a renewed attempt to arrange an all-British fight with former two-time world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. Talks over a fight between Fury and Joshua have twice broken down in the past, and Joshua — on the comeback trail after back-to-back losses to Usyk — said he is not prepared to put his own career on hold for it.“I can’t say I will sit and wait around for this geezer,” Joshua said on a media call ahead of his April 1 fight with American boxer Jermaine Franklin. “There are other fighters out there and other great fights I will have.“With or without Fury (on my record), I will not wake up tomorrow and be regretting my whole boxing career.”Joshua said he is happy that the public is seeing how hard it is to negotiate with Fury.“It is good that people can actually see (what) people have got to put up with just to make a fight,"" Joshua said. “Me and Usyk had two successful fights done, you know, so it is just crazy.”___More AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843604,Argentina-born Retegui could start for Italy against England,"MILAN (AP) — When Italy and England kick off their European Championship qualifying campaign against each other on Thursday, some of the spotlight will be on a player from Argentina.Forward Mateo Retegui has been called up for the first time by Italy coach Roberto Mancini, reigniting a debate in the country about selecting foreign-born players for the national team.Retegui was born in Argentina and has spent his entire playing career in the South American country, representing it internationally at Under-19 and Under-20 level. But he has never played for the senior national team and has Italian citizenship through his maternal grandmother.Instead of opting to wait for his chance to play for the World Cup winners, the 23-year-old Retegui has responded to the call of the Azzurri, who didn’t even qualify for last year’s tournament.“We had been following him for some time, he has quality and is a young, bright boy,” Mancini said. “We didn’t think he would say yes, we hope that he can be important.”Retegui plays for Argentine club Tigre, on loan from Boca Juniors, and was the top scorer in the domestic league last season with 19 goals.“He reminds me of when (Gabriel) Batistuta arrived in Italy,” Mancini said.Retegui also tops the current standings, having netted six goals in eight matches.And he could start on Thursday in Naples, at a stadium named after another — much more famous — Argentine: Diego Maradona.Mancini has a lack of options up front with Ciro Immobile and Giacomo Raspadori out injured, while Gianluca Scamacca is not fully fit.“I don’t know why there are so few strikers, we are very limited in attack,” Mancini said. “We have three (Italian) teams in the Champions League quarterfinals, but out of the three teams there are seven, eight Italians at most. This is the reality.”Italy has a long history of including South American players in the national team after they made a name for themselves in Serie A, with the Brazil-born Jorginho a recent example. But Retegui’s inclusion has sparked more debate, in part because he has never played in Italy and in part because Mancini criticized Antonio Conte for using foreign-born players when the Tottenham coach was in charge of Italy.Mancini, who was then at Inter Milan, said at the time that “the Italian national team should be Italian” and that he didn’t think someone who wasn’t born in the country ""deserves to” play for Italy.“If there is a chance to get new players we will take them,” Mancini said on Monday. “Years ago I said that players born in Italy should play in the national team, but there was not that problem here yet and the world has changed.“All the European national teams have players with multiple nationalities, we have boys who have gone through the whole of the youth system with us and then been taken by the senior national team of other nations.”For England, this will be the first match since losing to France in the World Cup quarterfinals, and provides a chance for striker Harry Kane to become England’s all-time record goal scorer. Kane is currently level with Wayne Rooney on 53 goals for his country.England is without Manchester United's Marcus Rashford after the forward pulled out of the squad with what the club described as a “knock” but Southgate has called up Ivan Toney despite the Brentford forward facing a possible suspension for apparently breaching multiple gambling rules.Italy’s last home match was also against England, with the Azzurri winning 1-0 at San Siro in September in the Nations League.Mancini’s team also beat England on penalties in the Euro 2020 final.That triumph was a sort of absolution for Italy after it failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and the Azzurri once again find themselves on the road to redemption after missing out on last year’s tournament in Qatar.“By now Italy-England has become a classic, a bit like Italy-Germany,” Mancini said. “They have been a great national team for some time, full of talented, strong and technical players.“They have more options than us for many reasons, but in Naples we want to put in a good performance, play well and start these qualifiers well. It will be a tough match as all the others have been.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

Women collect water from streams to meet household requirements.Water may dribble out of the taps at home late at night if they are lucky and homes are full of plastic containers and buckets to collect it when it does.Local officials in Ivory Coast blame insufficient electrical power for their pumps in part for the problems here. Transporting and selling water at about 15 cents per 20 liter (5 gallon) container is a profitable business for some.One of the world’s Sustainable Development Goals is for everyone to have safe water and sanitation by 2030.A report launched on the eve of the first major U.N. conference on water in over 45 years says 26% of the world’s population doesn’t have access to safe drinking water and 46% lacks access to basic sanitation.The U.N. World Water Development Report 2023, issued this week, paints a stark picture of the huge gap that needs to be filled to meet U.N. goals to ensure all people have access to clean water and sanitation by 2030.The estimated cost of meeting the goals is between $600 billion and $1 trillion a year, according to Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report.It's necessary for investors, governments and climate change communities to forge partnerships to see that money is invested to sustain the environment and provide potable water to the 2 billion people who don’t have it, said Connor.",2023/03/22,,World

However, the likelihood of an armed incident can not be entirely excluded, Bush added.Taiwan and the U.S. need to be prepared for the possibility of military confrontation, with the common aim of reducing the risk of war in the first place, per CNA. Methods to do that include persuading China that Taiwan is not a red line and building an effective deterrent so Beijing would decide not to attack, Bush said.Bush estimated that in the case of a war, the U.S. would need one month to arrive on the scene, while Taiwan at present does not have enough troops to defend its coast. In this light, he approved of President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) decision to extend compulsory military service to one year, while emphasizing the importance of a well-trained reservist force.The former AIT chairman called on Taiwan’s political parties to work out a joint approach which could include a demand for China to stay neutral during Taiwan elections, a consensus about Taiwanese economic dependence on China, and a rejection of Beijing’s “One Country, Two Systems” formula as a topic for cross-strait talks.",2023/03/22,1528,Politics

(AP) — Two inmates in a Virginia jail used primitively made tools to create a hole in the wall of their cell and escape, only to be found hours later at an IHOP restaurant nearby, a sheriff said.Authorities discovered the two men, ages 37 and 43, missing from their cell in the Newport News jail annex during a routine head count Monday evening, according to a statement from the Newport News Sheriff's Office.A preliminary investigation found the men exploited a weakness in the jail's construction design and used tools made from a toothbrush and a metal object to access rebars between the walls — and then used the rebar to further their escape, the statement said. After escaping their cell, they scaled a containment wall around the jail.Authorities had asked for the public’s help to find the men, and they were taken into custody again early Tuesday at an IHOP in Hampton when other patrons called police.“It reinforces what we always say, ‘See something, say something,’” Sheriff Gabe Morgan said.The sheriff's office said it is investigating to help prevent further escapes.One man, who lives in Hampton, had been in custody on charges including contempt of court and probation violations.Another, a Gloucester resident, was being held on charges including credit card fraud, forgery, grand larceny and probation violation.Charges related to the escape are pending, the sheriff said.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843673,Rare tornado near Los Angeles rips building roofs; 1 injured,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A rare tornado touched down in a Los Angeles suburb, ripping roofs off a line of commercial buildings and sending the debris twisting into the sky and across a city block, injuring one person.The National Weather Service sent teams to assess damage in Montebello and later confirmed that a tornado had touched down around 11:20 a.m. Wednesday.The weather service said that the tornado was an EF1, a measurement on the Enhanced Fujita Scale that indicates it had winds of 86 mph to 110 mph (138 kph to 177 kph). That made it the strongest tornado to hit the Los Angeles metropolitan area since March 1983, the weather service said.“It's definitely not something that's common for the region,” said meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld with the weather service.One person was injured and was taken to a hospital in Montebello, said Alex Gillman, a city spokesman. He didn't know the severity of the injury.Michael Turner could hear the winds get stronger from inside his office at the 33,000-square-foot (3,065-square-meter) warehouse he owns just south of downtown Montebello. When the lights started flickering, he went outside to find his employees gazing up at the ominous sky. He brought everyone inside.“It got very loud. Things were flying all over the place,” Turner said. “The whole factory became a big dustbowl for a minute. Then when the dust settled, the place was just a mess.”Nobody was hurt, but the gas line was severed, fire sprinklers broke, all the skylights shattered and a 5,000-square-foot (465-square-meter) section of roof was “just gone,” Turner said. He said his polyester fiber business, Turner Fiberfill, could be closed for months.“I've been in California since 1965. Never seen anything like this,” Turner said. “Earthquakes — we're used to that.”Debris was spread over more than one city block. Inspectors checked 17 buildings in the area, and 11 of them were red-tagged as uninhabitable, according to the fire department. Several cars were also damaged.The rare and violent weather came amid a strong late-season Pacific storm that brought damaging winds and more rain and snow to saturated California. Two people died Tuesday as the storm raked the San Francisco Bay Area with powerful gusts and downpours. An on-duty San Francisco police sergeant was hospitalized with life threatening injuries after a tree fell on him Tuesday, the department said.The weather service also sent assessment teams to the Santa Barbara County city of Carpinteria, where it confirmed that a tornado hit a mobile home park on Tuesday, with gusts up to 75 mph (120 kph) that damaged about 25 residences.That tornado was measured at a relatively weak EF0, with winds of 65 mph to 80 mph (105 kph to 129 kph).The last time the weather service's Los Angeles office sent out tornado assessment teams was 2016 near Fillmore in Ventura County, where it was determined that a small twister had touched down, Schoenfeld said.A tornado warning based on radar also was issued Tuesday night for the Point Mugu area west of Malibu. The warning was later canceled and the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office tweeted there was no evidence a tornado touched down.The storm was tapering off in California from north to south while pushing inland across the Southwest, the Four Corners region and the central and southern Rockies, the National Weather Service said. On Tuesday, some residents of north-central Arizona were told to prepare to evacuate because of rising water levels in rivers and basins.The wind and rain mayhem from San Francisco Bay south to Monterey Bay on Tuesday was caused by an extraordinary drop in barometric pressure over the eastern Pacific that meteorologists described as “explosive cyclogenesis.”“Wow. Even by the standards of what has turned out to be one of our most extraordinary winter seasons in a very long time, yesterday ... stands out,” the Bay Area weather office wrote.Trees and power lines were blown down. Windows were blown out from two San Francisco high-rises, NBC Bay Area reported. Ferry service was disrupted because conditions were too rough. Three barges got loose and damaged a bridge.An Amtrak commuter train carrying 55 passengers struck a downed tree and derailed near the East Bay village of Porta Costa. The train remained upright and nobody was injured, Amtrak and fire officials said.Five deaths were attributed to the storm. In the Bay Area community of Portola Valley, a man driving a sewer truck was killed when a tree fell onto the vehicle, the California Highway Patrol said. And in the community of Rossmoor, a driver was injured and a passenger died after a large tree fell onto a car, the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District said.In Oakland, a man inside a tent died Tuesday night after a tree fell on it near Lake Merritt.Two people also died at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital on Tuesday while receiving treatment for injuries suffered in separate storm-related incidents, according to city officials.In the Monterey Bay region, Santa Cruz County was blasted with gusts up to 80 mph (129 kph). Along the coastline of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, ocean foam blew across the roadways like large snowflakes.Some 45,000 customers were without electricity early Thursday throughout the state, according to PowerOutage.us.The National Weather Service said Tuesday's storm, which came on the first full day of spring following the state’s extraordinary winter, was a Pacific low pressure system interacting with California's 12th atmospheric river since late December.California's unexpected siege of wet weather after years of drought also included February blizzards powered by arctic air.The storms have unleashed flooding and loaded mountains with so much snow that roofs have been crushed and crews have struggled to keep highways clear of avalanches.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843674,Spain's Vox party fails in government no-confidence motion,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain’s parliament dismissed an attempt by the far-right Vox party to topple the governing leftist coalition on Wednesday, voting overwhelmingly against a no-confidence motion brought against Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez's government.The motion only earned the support of Vox’s 52 lawmakers plus one rogue vote, for a total of 53. The government received 201 votes, while the 91 members of the conservative Popular Party, the chamber’s leading opposition party, abstained.In a move that was slammed by other political parties, Vox leader Santiago Abascal broke with custom and didn’t stand as an alternative prime minister. Instead, Vox chose an independent candidate in a futile attempt to win wider support.Ramón Tamames, 89. a former communist leader who has journeyed across the political spectrum, was the losing candidate. The economist had pledged that his only act as prime minister would have been to immediately call for a national election to coincide with local elections scheduled for May 28.Tamames presented himself and Vox as protectors of the unity of Spain against Catalan separatist parties that Sánchez has relied on to win important votes in parliament.This is the second time that Vox, an upstart party that resists criticizing Spain’s 20th-century dictatorship, blasts feminism and links unauthorized migration with increased violence, has lost a no-confidence vote against the current government after also failing in 2020.Unlike French President Emmanuel Macron, who barely survived two no-confidence votes on Monday during ongoing protests against his raising of the retirement age from 62 to 64, Sánchez was never in danger of being ousted.“We knew that this bizarre attempt would flop,” Sánchez said before the vote in Madrid's Congress. “The only goal of this destructive no-confidence motion was to push Spain back 50 years (into the dictatorship of Francisco Franco).”During the two days that lawmakers needed to debate and vote on the motion, rival opposition parties took turns blasting Vox for wasting their time in what they described as a “circus.”Vox, which has suffered from in-fighting in recent months, hopes to make a strong showing in the local elections and in Spain's general election at the end of the year. If the party surpasses Sánchez's Socialists and the left-wing United We Can, the junior member of government, in the December election, it would try to force the conservative Popular Party into a national coalition.The Popular Party tried to maintain a low profile before and during the no-confidence motion. Party leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo, who is not a member of Congress, did not attend the sessions, and the party's lawmakers abstained from the vote.Its parliamentary spokeswoman, Cuca Gamarra, called the motion by Vox an “inconceivable gift to the government” as it faces its worst internal crisis over a controversial sexual violence law.Sánchez claimed that Spain’s conservatives, who already rule the region of Castile and Leon in a coalition with Vox, would open the door of the nation's government to the far-right come year’s end.“Now, the Popular Party’s leader remains quiet, and with his silence he says it all: that he will need Vox to govern,” Sánchez said. “That is why the Popular Party has chosen this unacceptable abstention.”Gamarra defended the Popular Party, saying it “has no commitments other than to our own political ideals” and that its abstention was out of “respect to Señor Tamames.”",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843675,GameStop leads meme stock rally in pandemic trade comeback,"Meme stocks jumped Wednesday after GameStop, one of the most heavily traded off-brand stocks during the pandemic, posted a surprise profit for the fourth quarter, its first quarterly profit in two years.Rather than a per-share loss of 16 cents as Wall Street had expected, the video game retailer reported a profit of 16 cents per share, or $48.2 million in all.GameStop's revenue fell and much of the profit gain came from aggressive cost cutting, including store closures and layoffs. However, as was the case during the pandemic, fundamentals that typically drive stock movement appear to be being pushed aside.Shares of GameStop Corp., of Grapevine, Texas, surged 51% at the opening bell and it pulled other meme stocks along for the ride. GameStop ended Wednesday up 35% but most of the other meme stocks could not hold on to their early gains and finished the day in the red.During the pandemic, GameStop was a member of a group of beat-down stocks that drew smaller investors in huge numbers. The theory was that if enough small investors got in the game and drove the stock higher, it would force large hedge funds with short positions (bets that the stock would fall), to capitulate and sell those positions at a massive loss.It worked. GameStop’s stock ran from 65 cents in April 2020, near the start of the pandemic, to more than $120 by January 2021. Similar tactics drove the stock of struggling movie chain AMC 15 times higher during the same period, and that dynamic appears to be driving the stocks of GameStop, AMC, and other so-called meme stocks on Wednesday.Citron Research, Melvin Capital and other big hedge funds lost an estimated $5 billion on the other side of the trade in 2021, according to analytics firm S3 Partners last week.Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. jumped during initial trading Wednesday but ended the day down 1.6%. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.’s stock climbed nearly 7% in early trading before ending down 2.5%. Others considered meme stocks, including Palantir, Virgin Galactic and Nokia, also rose in early trading before finishing lower. Carvana, however, finished up more than 6%.GameStop CEO Matthew Furlong said during a post-earnings conference call late Tuesday that inflation, rising interest rates and material macro headwinds forced cost cuts, and those efforts will continue this year.""We’re going to aggressively pursue further cost containment, efficiency, profitability and pragmatic growth in the categories where we can consistently delight our customers, Furlong said.Shares of GameStop are up 29% this year.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843676,Former Arsenal midfielder Mesut Özil retires at 34,"ISTANBUL (AP) — Former Real Madrid and Arsenal midfielder Mesut Özil, who won the World Cup with Germany in 2014, retired from soccer Wednesday at the age of 34.Özil said injuries played a role in his decision.“I've had the privilege to be a professional football player for almost 17 years now and I feel incredibly thankful for the opportunity,” Özil wrote on social media. ""But in recent weeks and months, having also suffered some injuries, it's become more and more clear that it's time to leave the big stage of football.”His immediate retirement brings an early end to his season with Turkish club Istanbul Basaksehir, where he made only seven appearances for the team.Özil won the Spanish league title with Real Madrid in 2012 and the FA Cup four times with Arsenal. His international career ended abruptly in 2018 when he quit the Germany squad citing “racism and disrespect.”That followed anti-Turkish comments from German politicians and abuse from some fans toward Özil, who has Turkish heritage, amid criticism of his decision to pose for a picture with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup.Germany coach Hansi Flick, who was with the squad as assistant to Joachim Löw at the 2014 World Cup, paid tribute to Özil as “one of the best soccer players in the world” at his peak.“I really enjoyed working with him, he had extraordinary skills, his technique and game vision were outstanding,” Flick said in a statement. “All of us with the national team wish him and his family all the best for the time after his career.”Özil started his career in Germany with hometown club Schalke before a good spell at Werder Bremen earned him a spot on the German national team. Standout performances for Germany at the 2010 World Cup were followed by a move to Madrid. He then had an eight-year stint with Arsenal.“Real Madrid C.F. wants to show its appreciation, its admiration and its affection for one of our great players. Good luck, dear Mesut, to you and your family,” the Spanish club said on Twitter.Arsenal posted: “Thanks for the memories - wishing you all the best in your retirement, Mesut.”Özil moved to Turkish club Fenerbahce in 2021 after his relationship with Arsenal broke down. After disagreements with then-manager Unai Emery and later with his successor Mikel Arteta, Özil was left out of the Arsenal squad before his departure. The club also distanced itself from Özil for posting his support for Muslims in the Xinjiang province of China, comments which led to an Arsenal game being pulled from Chinese television.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843677,Police besiege gunman in Thailand who killed at least 3,"BANGKOK (AP) — Police in Thailand said Wednesday they cordoned off a neighborhood in a city southwest of the capital and trapped a gunman inside his house after he shot dead at least three people and wounded several others.Thai television showed images of police taking positions on a quiet street in Phetchaburi, about 170 kilometers (105 miles) southwest of Bangkok, some carrying weapons and others with protective shields.Police confirmed that three people, including a motorcycle delivery driver, had been killed in the incident, which began early Wednesday afternoon. At one point, a body spotted by a police drone in front of the house could not be retrieved because it was in the line of fire.At least two injured people, one a local official who rushed to the site when he was notified of the shooting, were taken to a hospital.Police evacuated children from nearby schools and care centers and surrounded the gunman’s house while waiting for specially trained officers to try to resolve the crisis, as the gunman sporadically fired at them.The police Central Investigation Bureau on its Facebook page identified the suspect as Anuwat Waentong, 29. Thai media reported that he had been due to make a court appearance Wednesday on a drug charge.The suspect's mother was brought to the site to appeal to her son over a bullhorn to give himself up, calling him by what appeared to be his nickname, Ping.“Do you want me to pick you up or your friend? Listen to me, Ping. Ping, can you hear me?"" she pleaded with him. ""Answer or call me. Can you hear me, son? There’s still a chance. Do you want me to go get you or do you want to come down yourself?”The shooting came just a week after a standoff in Bangkok in which a police lieutenant colonel shot a gun into the air as he resisted police efforts to detain him, holding off his fellow officers for 27 hours. The officer, who was said to have suffered from mental stress, died in a hospital after being shot by police who stormed the house where he had been holed up.———This story corrects the suspect's nickname.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843678,World Baseball Classic keeps growing despite injury risks,"MIAMI (AP) — Shohei Ohtani’s strikeout of Mike Trout, Trea Turner’s go-ahead, eighth-inning grand slam against Venezuela, Japan’s walk-off semifinal win and Mexico’s comeback from a four-run deficit against Puerto Rico will be replayed over and over.Edwin Díaz’s season-ending knee injury and Jose Altuve’s broken thumb will be discussed all year, too.This year’s World Baseball Classic left lasting memories, 47 games over two weeks that restored Japan’s supremacy and reinforced Ohtani’s unmatched ability while expanding the sport’s global footprint.While not an international fixation like soccer's World Cup, the event has grown though its five editions since launching in 2006.“This is kind of our Olympics. We don’t get that opportunity to really play wherever the Olympics are at,” Kyle Schwarber said before the Americans lost to Japan 3-2 in Tuesday night’s final, when Ohtani fanned Trout to seal Japan’s first title since 2009 and third overall. Baseball is no longer a permanent Olympic sport, and Samurai Japan beat a U.S. team stocked with minor leaguers for gold when baseball was temporarily restored at the previous Games.Played in Miami, Phoenix, Tokyo and Taiwan, the star-studded WBC will finish with revenue of $90 million to $100 million, Major League Baseball said. Attendance of 1,306,414 was the tournament’s highest, 20% over the 1,086,720 for 40 games in 2017.The championship game on FS1, Fox Deportes and Fox Sports streaming services was the most-watched WBC game ever in the United States, up 69% from the 2017 final with a combined audience of 5.2 million viewers. A peak combined average audience of 6.5 million viewers tuned in for the dramatic ending.This year’s semifinals on FS1 and Fox Deportes averaged 2.4 million viewers, up 96% from the semis in 2017, when the tournament was televised by MLB Network and ESPN Deportes.“One of the things that was really important this time around was Fox stepping up to broadcast the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said. “Nobody’s a bigger fan of the MLB Network than I am, but when you have one of the major broadcasters step up and want the event, that’s a huge deal.”Concerns about player health have followed the tourney since its inception. Many MLB teams blocked pitchers from participating, wanting them to concentrate on preparing for the start of the season. Injuries to Díaz and Altuve reinforced those concerns.But with MLB generating revenue and global interest from the tourney, and players eager to represent their home countries, the injury risks seem unlikely to slow the WBC's growth.“We all care for each other and no one wants to get hurt,” Francisco Lindor, Díaz's teammate on Team Puerto Rico and the New York Mets, told reporters Tuesday. “But we all love our countries and want to represent our countries. ... We have an opportunity to represent our countries and learn from our peers. It’s amazing.”Japan drew three of the four most-watched WBC games ever back home going into the championship game, getting a 48.7 rating for the quarterfinal against Italy, 44.4 for the first-round game against South Korea and a 42.5 for the semifinal vs. Mexico. The figures represent the percentage of television households tuned to a telecast.The team's victory sparked a nationwide celebration back home. The country’s top circulating newspaper, Yomiuri, rolled out a special Wednesday afternoon edition for commuters, usually reserved for serious matters of state, late-breaking election news, or as it was last year — the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “Japan, the World’s No. 1,” the headline read in Japanese.Mexico anticipated its run to the last four will increase attention to the sport in a nation where soccer dominates.""These two weeks are going to attract so many young players in Mexico and also Mexicans that live abroad,” manager Benji Gil said.Following an expansion from 16 nations to 20, Britain, the Czech Republic and Nicaragua reached the tournament for the first time. All failed to advance past the group phase.China and Israel twice had games cut short by the mercy rule, and Britain and Canada one each.Group A was so competitive that all five nations finished 2-2, resulting in Cuba and Italy advancing over the Netherlands, Taiwan and Panama via a mathematical tiebreaker: runs allowed divided by outs.“Obviously, a lot of countries are getting better at the game of baseball,” U.S. manager Mark DeRosa said. “I thought Colombia, man, the arms they were running out there, they weren’t name guys, but everyone was sitting 92 to 95 (mph) and had pretty decent stuff.”Nicaraguan pitcher Duque Hebbert even managed to turn one memorable inning into a pro contract, signing a minor league deal with the Detroit Tigers after striking out All-Stars Juan Soto, Julio Rodríguez and Rafael Devers.MLB and the players’ association have committed to the next WBC in March 2026. Manfred said it is too early to determine whether there will be tweaks to the format.“I think that the combination of nationalism and sport is really, really powerful,” he said, “and if you have an opportunity to participate in an event that combines the two, you have to take it.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843679,Sunak's Brexit deal clears Commons vote despite Tory revolt,"LONDON (AP) — British lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Wednesday in favor of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's deal with the European Union to rewrite the rules on Northern Ireland trade.The House of Commons voted 515-29 to back a key portion of the agreement, which is designed to resolve a thorny trade dispute that vexed U.K.-EU relations and triggered a political crisis in Belfast.But Sunak faced a rebellion by about 20 fellow Conservatives, including his two immediate predecessors. Former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had both said they would vote against the deal.Johnson, who led Britain out of the EU in 2020, said the deal was “not acceptable” because it kept some EU laws in operation in Northern Ireland, restricting the U.K.’s ability to diverge from the bloc's rules and “take advantage of Brexit.”A hard-Brexit group of Conservative Party lawmakers known as the European Research Group also said it opposed the deal.The government easily won the vote with backing from the Labour Party and other opposition groups, along with most Conservative legislators.Sunak’s agreement, known as the Windsor Framework, replaces elements of the Brexit divorce deal negotiated by Johnson, and hailed by him at the time as an “oven-ready” agreement.Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Sunak said the framework was “a good deal for the people, families and businesses of Northern Ireland” and protects the region’s place in the United Kingdom.Johnson’s deal imposed customs checks and other hurdles on goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. in order to maintain an open border between the region and its EU neighbor, the Republic of Ireland. The open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process.Northern Ireland’s British unionist politicians strongly opposed the customs border, saying it undermined Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom. The Democratic Unionist Party walked out of the power-sharing semi-autonomous Belfast government a year ago in protest, leaving Northern Ireland’s 1.9 million people without a functioning administration.The Windsor Framework removes most of the checks and is designed to ease the burden on businesses and to address the unionist concerns. It gives Northern Ireland politicians a mechanism, known as the Stormont Brake, to challenge new EU trade rules that could apply in the region — a key unionist demand.But the Democratic Unionist Party is concerned the mechanism does not go far enough, and some elements of EU law will continue to apply in Northern Ireland.The DUP's eight lawmakers in the House of Commons also opposed the government in Wednesday's vote, which was specifically on the Stormont Brake part of the deal.The U.K. and the EU are set to formally adopt the Windsor agreement at a Friday meeting between British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and EU Brexit negotiator Maroš Šefčovič.___Follow AP's coverage of the U.K. government at https://apnews.com/hub/united-kingdom-government and of Brexit at https://apnews.com/hub/brexit",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843680,Pioneer of gospel music rediscovered in Pittsburgh archives,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Scattered in crates, dirty and difficult to read, the gospel music of composer Charles Henry Pace sat packed away, unorganized — and unrealized — for more than 20 years.Frances Pace Barnes, the pioneering music publisher’s daughter who remembers how he could turn a hum into a song, knew the crates held pieces of her family’s past. But she was not expecting those decaying printing plates and papers to reveal an important part of gospel music history.“I didn’t know it was going to be a legacy,” said Pace Barnes.As it turns out, her father was one of the first African American gospel music composers in the United States, and the owner of one of the country’s first independent, Black gospel music publishing companies.Today, the University of Pittsburgh is restoring his work from the 1920s to the 1950s and cementing his place in the genre’s history. It was the curiosity of music historian Christopher Lynch that set the Charles Henry Pace preservation project into motion.“This is something that we can, as Pittsburghers, all be proud of,” said Lynch with a smile. “Charles Pace was a tremendous figure in music history.”Long after Pace died in 1963, his music store, which was first known as the Old Ship of Zion and later changed to the Charles H. Pace Music Publishers located in Pittsburgh’s Hill District, was sold and his archives went with it. Eventually, the materials made their way to auction, and the university’s library system bought them in 1999.The 14 crates sat for more than two decades before Lynch, who also is the project’s coordinator with the university’s Center for American Music, uncovered the significance of what they held.Lynch, who moved to Pittsburgh in 2017, was inspired to go through them after taking a tour of the Hill District — the city’s first hub of Black culture and art — and learning that a park in the area would be dedicated to Pace’s wife and community activist, Frankie Pace.But his task was large. And in 2021 he began organizing, cleaning and deciphering the 250 printing plates and about 600 photographs that detailed Pace’s legacy.“I quickly realized that ‘Oh, we had something here,’” said Lynch.Although the genre’s roots reach as far back as 19th century spiritual songs, the lineage of modern gospel music heard in Black churches today includes the work of musicians and composers who emerged in the 1920s.Those pioneers include Thomas Dorsey, who is often called the father of gospel music, “giving the impression that he pretty much singlehandedly invented this style,” said Lynch.But after digging into Pace’s early work, he says it was around the same time, or even a few years before Dorsey. This has helped the historians piece together the community of musicians who pushed gospel music forward as it began entering popular culture.During this period, African American gospel music composers didn’t have access to large publishing companies so Pace learned to do it all himself. Lynch says an important part of the archival work is restoring the true history and giving credit where credit is due since many of Pace’s most recorded songs, including, “If I Be Lifted Up,” are rarely credited to him, listed instead as “traditional songs.”Pace got his start in Chicago, creating his first publishing company where he worked on the early music of Dorsey. He also formed the Pace Jubilee Singers, which was one of the first Black groups to record gospel music and perform on the radio. Soon after meeting his wife, the couple relocated on Pittsburgh’s North Side where Pace introduced gospel music in 1936 to Tabernacle Baptist Church as the music director and later opened their store in the Hill District.The couple formed the Pace Choral Union, a gospel choir of 75 singers at its inception and 200 at its peak. They helped establish gospel music across the city, performing at churches and events throughout Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania as well as weekly on the radio.“I really didn’t realize until I was much older how talented my father was,” said Pace Barnes, who grew up working in his store.The storefront, which doubled as an office, sold gospel music and church literature. Artists, unable to write their own music, could come to Pace with an idea. He would arrange it, and then, print and publish the songs.The storefront became a hub for some big name, traveling musicians like Louis Armstrong and W. C. Handy.Pace was one of few people who knew how to fully print sheet music using photo negatives and metal plates mounted onto scrap wood. This was crucial to the expansion of gospel music in the U.S.“To think he was doing this basically in the back of a shop or in his house in the thirties, in the forties…” said Pace’s grandson Frank Barnes in awe.Frankie and Charles were also able to build a wide-ranging geographical distribution network of 301 stores across 29 different states. They also had a consistent list of more than 2510 mail subscribers who ordered from him directly.“He’s one of the early evangelists of gospel music,” said Kimberly Ellis, an American historian and founding executive director of the Historic Hill Institute, who is currently working on an oral history project on Frankie Pace. “It meant that he literally spread the good news, via music, from coast to coast. Which is amazing.”In addition to co-owning the music store and singing in the Pace Gospel Choral Union, Frankie Pace earned a reputation as a strong community activist. She worked with various groups to improve education and housing conditions, and co-founded a committee that advocated for mandatory community input on any future development in the Hill District.Thrilled that Charles Pace will be placed in his proper context, Ellis also hopes that bringing this music to light will help “transform what we know about history.”The work has transformed what Pace’s grandson now knows about his family history. He grew up in Chicago knowing little about his grandfather, who died six years before he was born. Worried about making his mother sad, he often resisted the urge to ask questions about him.“Things can so easily get lost,” he said. “Whether it be artifacts like the plates, or whether it be the stories of the people in their trajectory, like my grandparents.”Barnes and his mother are glad the Pace archives will remain at the university, giving future generations the opportunity to learn about their patriarch. More immediately, the city will honor the legacies of Charles and Frankie Pace on Saturday with a free concert showcasing music composed by Pace and the rededication of Frankie Mae Pace Park.“This is history, and we are part of making history again,” said director and founder of The Heritage Gospel Chorale of Pittsburgh, Herbert V.R.P. Jones, who will be one of the main performers that evening.Francis Pace Barnes, who hasn’t been to Pittsburgh since her mother died in 1989, will be there with her son, listening to her father’s music in the church where he once worked.“I’m looking forward to hearing songs I haven’t heard in 40 years,” she said.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843681,"Summer travel is likely to remain hot, so book early","Travel last summer was, in a word, wild.Pent-up “revenge” travel combined with relaxed restrictions caused a surge in demand. High fuel prices and limited airline capacity drove up costs, with overall travel prices increasing 17% over pre-pandemic levels by June 2022, according to NerdWallet’s Travel Price Index.What about this summer? Will weakening demand lead to lower prices and thinner crowds? It’s not looking likely, according to travel experts.“We aren’t seeing any dip in demand,” says Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper, a travel booking platform. “It seems incredible that the demand could be sustained, but we’re not seeing any weakness right now.”It seems that Americans’ appetite for revenge remains unsated. And that could lead to another wild ride this summer.NO RELIEF FROM HIGH PRICESPrices for flights, car rentals and hotels may have peaked last year, but they haven’t come down much.Overall trip prices remained 15% higher in January 2023 compared with January 2020, before travel plummeted because of the pandemic.It looks like prices could remain high through the summer, though they’re unlikely to hit the enormous year-over-year gains seen last year.“We’re not seeing nearly the pricing increases we saw last year,” says Jamie Lane, vice president of research at AirDNA, a vacation rental data platform. Demand for Airbnb and Vrbo rentals remains high, he says, but increased supply has tempered price growth. “Average daily rates are up 4% year over year for the summer.”Given the huge spikes in travel prices last year, a 4% increase is relatively modest. Airfares, on the other hand, could see a decrease in price this summer compared with last year.“We are expecting domestic airfare to peak around $350 on average,” Berg says. “That’s about 10% lower than last year but 10% higher than 2019 prices.”Car rental prices have also abated from their absurd heights but are still 43% higher than pre-pandemic levels, according to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. And food away from home (i.e., restaurant meals) has seen some of the steadiest inflation, now costing 23% more than before the pandemic.DIFFERENT BOOKING TIMELINESThe pandemic may be waning, but it has significantly changed how we travel.“What we’ve seen consistently is that people are booking a lot more last minute,” Berg says. “For domestic airfare, that’s three to four weeks in advance, where it would have been closer to six to eight weeks in advance before the pandemic.”These short booking windows mean we won’t know how high demand for summer travel gets until, well, the summer. It could also mean that prices on transportation and lodging will rise more than usual in the final weeks before departure. Avoiding this last-minute crunch could be the budget-savvy way to plan this year.Another trend that seems to be continuing this year: more travelers choosing to book trips during the shoulder seasons around the summer, late spring and early fall.Lane says the shoulder season saw above-average demand last year, and so far the trend is continuing this spring.“It would start to show up if we see pacing weaker in shoulder seasons like April and May, and we’re just not seeing that.”ASIA IN THE SPOTLIGHTIt’s not just a matter of when travelers are booking but where. International destinations that were still closed or restricted in 2022 are seeing a boom this year.The number of U.S. passengers leaving for international destinations was up 75% in January 2023 compared with January 2022 and up 8% compared with January 2019, according to data from the International Trade Administration, a U.S. government agency. The biggest shift has been in departures to Asia, which have seen a staggering 380% increase between January 2022 and January 2023. It’s a shift that seems likely to accelerate into the summer, according to experts.“Asia is absolutely one of the hottest regions right now,” Berg says. “The challenge there is that supply, direct flights from the U.S., is not back to pre-pandemic levels.”So while a long-deferred summer trip to Japan might sound enticing, it’s likely to carry a high price tag.BIG QUESTIONS REMAINBeyond adjusting budgets to accommodate travel price changes, travelers might have other money-related concerns looking into the summer. With layoff possibilities looming and government data showing pandemic savings are dwindling and consumers piling on record credit card debt, it seems like a matter of when, not if, travel begins to slow.Will travelers tap the brakes on spending this spring, leading to thinner crowds and lower prices come summer? Or will they continue to seek their revenge travel at all costs, leading to another summer of wild travel pricing?Whatever happens, savvy vacationers might avoid booking at the last minute, especially for popular summer getaway destinations. And skipping Asia, at least until more air routes become available, could help them avoid some of the heftier airfare prices.Also: Remember to pack some snacks — restaurant food is expensive._______________________This article originally appeared on the personal finance website NerdWallet.
