SINGAPORE / TOKYO, JAPAN -  Media OutReach - 16 February 2023 -   Oasys Pte. Ltd. (""Oasys"") today announced that  SoftBank Corp. (""SoftBank""), a Japan-based telecommunications operator, has joined as an official validator of Oasys, a gaming-optimised blockchain designed for gamers and developers alike, with a focus on the future of blockchain gaming.            SoftBank's recognition of Oasys' superior mechanism that serves both users and IP (intellectual property) holders, along with its advanced technological capabilities, has led to their decision to participate in the Oasys blockchain. This partnership extends beyond Softbank's role as validators, as the two companies explore potential collaboration, including the development of blockchain-based services, in the future.   Bandai Namco Research, SEGA, Square Enix, Netmarble, and 17 other companies are among the 21 initial validators for Oasys. Starting with SoftBank, Oasys will invite other companies with a high level of trust and performance on a global scale to participate as validators, further stabilising and strengthening the Oasys network.   In the next batch of validators, four more companies will be joining the network, bringing the total to 25. In the medium-term, Oasys plans to further decentralise the network by enabling public participation through a council and removing the limit on the number of validator slots as long as the necessary requirements are being met.   Keiichi Makizono, Senior Vice President & CIO of SoftBank, said ""We are very excited about the Oasys blockchain's flexible, user-centric architecture, which meets the needs of both users and IP content owners, and look forward to working with Oasys to promote Web3's social implementation and resolve social issues.""   Daiki Moriyama, Director of Oasys, said ""We are honoured that SoftBank shares our vision for Oasys and has chosen us as a business partner for Web3. With SoftBank coming onboard as a validator, Oasys will not only expand the stability and ecosystem of the Oasys chain, but also aim to strengthen business collaboration with Oasys. We look forward to working with SoftBank to develop the blockchain gaming industry by fostering relationships and synergies with its group companies and partners.""   In just over a year since its formation, Oasys has fully launched its mainnet blockchain protocol, with over a dozen playable games available on its blockchain. On 31 January 2023, the company announced plans to  list on the leading Japanese crypto exchange, bitbank.  Hashtag: #Oasys #Blockchain #Gaming

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811711,Grand jury indicts father of July 4 parade shooting suspect,"CHICAGO (AP) — An Illinois grand jury on Wednesday formally indicted the father of a man charged with fatally shooting seven people at a Fourth of July parade in suburban Chicago, the Lake County State's Attorney Office said. 

            The indictment charges Robert Crimo Jr., 58, with seven counts of reckless conduct. Prosecutors have said he helped his son, Robert Crimo III, obtain a gun license years before the shooting in Highland Park, even though the then-19-year-old had threatened violence. 

            Sara Avalos, a spokesperson for the prosecutors office, confirmed the grand jury indictment and said the father will be arraigned Thursday. 











            Robert Crimo Jr. was arrested in December, also on seven felony counts of reckless conduct, one for each person killed. Each count carries a maximum 3-year prison term. The longtime resident and well-known figure in Highland Park was released after his arrest on a $50,000 bond.

            At a brief hearing last month, prosecutors had told Judge George Strickland at a Lake County Courthouse in Waukegan, north of Highland Park, they needed more time to present evidence to the grand jury.

            In a brief statement released by his office later Wednesday, Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart said the grand jury agreed the case against the father should move forward. 

            “Parents who help their kids get weapons of war are morally and legally responsible when those kids hurt others with those weapons,"" Rinehart said. 

            George M. Gomez, the father’s Chicago-area attorney, said Wednesday evening that he couldn't comment because he hadn't yet seen the indictment. But he earlier called the accusations against his client “baseless and unprecedented.”

            Rinehart has previously said the accusations against the father are based on his sponsorship of his son’s application for a gun license in December 2019. Authorities say Robert Crimo III attempted suicide by machete in April 2019 and in September 2019 was accused by a family member of making threats to “kill everyone.”

            “Parents and guardians are in the best position to decide whether their teenagers should have a weapon,” Rinehart said after the father's arrest. “In this case, the system failed when Robert Crimo Jr. sponsored his son. He knew what he knew and he signed the form anyway.”

            Authorities say Illinois State Police reviewed the son’s gun license application and found no reason to deny it because he had no arrests, no criminal record, no serious mental health problems, no orders of protection and no other behavior that would disqualify him.

            Legal experts have said it's rare for an accused shooter's parent or guardian to face charges — in part because it's difficult to prove such charges. 

            In one notable exception, a Michigan prosecutor in 2021 filed involuntary manslaughter charges against the parents of a teen accused of fatally shooting four students at his high school. A trial date was delayed while the state appeals court considers an appeal.

            A grand jury indicted Robert Crimo III in July on 21 first-degree murder counts, 48 counts of attempted murder and 48 counts of aggravated battery, representing the seven people killed and dozens wounded in the attack at the holiday parade in Highland Park. 

            Robert Crimo Jr. has shown up at several of his son's pretrial hearings, nodding in greeting when his son entered the courtroom shackled and flanked by guards. The father is a familiar face around Highland Park, where he was once a mayoral candidate and operated convenience stores.

            But it took more than a year for charges to be filed because the original complaint languished before videos began receiving attention on social media.

            A St. Louis circuit judge on Wednesday put in place a protection order against Judy Kline, 54, who was charged this month with burglary, property damage and unlawful use of a weapon after prosecutors reviewed the videos.

            In one video, the woman was heard saying, “You’re not American. Get off of my property.” Another time she called them “illegals” who didn’t belong in the home. 

            A police probable cause statement indicated the woman appeared on a doorbell video waving a hammer and using profanities before she smashed a basement window and the door of a drying machine on Jan. 5, 2022.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811716,"Saints name Woods, Grantham among 5 new assistants","METAIRIE, La. (AP) — The New Orleans Saints hired Joe Woods as defensive coordinator and Todd Grantham as defensive line coach Wednesday.

            Saints coach Dennis Allen also added secondary coach Marcus Robertson, tight ends coach Clancy Barone and assistant offensive line coach Kevin Carberry. 

            Woods spent the past three seasons as the Cleveland Browns' defensive coordinator and has spent the past 19 years of his career coaching in the NFL, including five as a coordinator.











            In New Orleans, he joins a unit already overseen and called during games by Allen, who is entering his second season as Saints head coach after serving six-plus seasons as defensive coordinator under his predecessor, Sean Payton.

            When Woods was the Oakland Raiders' secondary coach a decade ago, he worked under Allen, the club's head coach at that time. Woods also spent two seasons as defensive coordinator in Denver during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. 

            Grantham has spent much of his 33-year coaching career with major college programs, including at Alabama as an analyst last season, but also has spent 11 seasons in the NFL. 

            During most of the past dozen years, Grantham was a coordinator in the Southeastern Conference with Georgia, Mississippi State and Florida.

            Before that, he worked with several NFL teams, including a stint as Cleveland's defensive coordinator from 2005 to 2007. He also was a defensive line coach with Indianapolis, Houston and Dallas.

            The hiring of Woods and Grantham follow the departures of co-defensive coordinators Ryan Nielsen and Kris Richard. Nielsen, who oversaw the defensive line in New Orleans, was hired as defensive coordinator in Atlanta.

            Richard, who also oversaw the secondary, was fired by New Orleans following a season in which the Saints ranked second in yards allowed passing in the NFL at 184.4 per game — despite top cornerback Marshon Lattimore missing 10 games with an abdominal injury.

            Robertson, a former NFL safety, has spent the past four seasons coaching defensive backs with the Arizona Cardinals. Before that, he spent 11 seasons in similar roles with Tennessee, Detroit, Oakland and Denver, overlapping with Allen on the Raiders' staff for part of the 2014 season. He also coached under Woods in Denver.

            Barone has coached with five NFL teams during the past 17 years, most recently Chicago, where he was tight ends coach in 2020 and 2021. He also worked with the Falcons, Chargers, Broncos and Vikings, coaching Pro Bowl tight ends on each of those clubs — Alge Crumpler, Antonio Gates, Julius Thomas and Kyle Rudolph.

            Barone also spent 17 years as a college assistant, including at Wyoming, Houston and Texas State.

            Carberry was the Los Angeles Rams' offensive line coach the past two seasons. He previously has coached in the NFL with Washington and Dallas and at the college level with Kansas and Stephen F. Austin.

He also coached under Woods in Denver.Barone has coached with five NFL teams during the past 17 years, most recently Chicago, where he was tight ends coach in 2020 and 2021. He also worked with the Falcons, Chargers, Broncos and Vikings, coaching Pro Bowl tight ends on each of those clubs — Alge Crumpler, Antonio Gates, Julius Thomas and Kyle Rudolph.Barone also spent 17 years as a college assistant, including at Wyoming, Houston and Texas State.Carberry was the Los Angeles Rams' offensive line coach the past two seasons.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811717,Mississippi families protest bill to limit transgender care,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Transgender teens, their parents and supporters protested outside the Mississippi Capitol on Wednesday, calling on legislators to kill a measure that would ban gender-affirming health care for people younger than 18.

            House Bill 1125 passed the Republican-led House 78-30 on Jan. 19, with all opposition coming from Democrats. It awaits consideration in the Senate, which is also controlled by Republicans.

            Ray Walker, a transgender boy who turns 17 on Thursday, said the bill is “truly disgusting,” especially since Mississippi has bad rankings on many health care statistics.











            “Instead of focusing on bettering the state, politicians have decided to go after trans kids, to go after a very sensitive demographic,"" Walker told The Associated Press after the protest. “We already have the highest suicide rate. It’s just disgusting that they would kick us while we’re already laying down.""

            Another demonstrator, Clint Faulkner, said he is upset that legislators would try to interfere in decisions that he and his wife, Amanda, make for and with their seven children, including their transgender son, Ace.

            “Mississippi, my home state, this is where we rank: 50th in health care,” Faulkner said. “But it’s way more important you tell me how to parent my trans child? ... Fiftieth in health care, but we’re worried about Ace’s transitioning? Do you not think that for the last 15 years, I have watched this child grow into not a young woman but a young man?”

            Mississippi is one of 27 states considering bills this year to prohibit gender-affirming health care for young people, according to Jensen Matar, executive director of the Mississippi-based Transgender Resources Advocacy Network and Services Program.

            During the Jan. 19 debate in the Mississippi House, Republican Rep. Nick Bain of Corinth said he knows no examples of gender-affirming surgeries being done on people younger than 18 in the state. He also said some young people have received hormone treatments, but he did not know how many. 

            The bill was brought because “there is a presence and a threat” of young people receiving medical procedures for gender transition, Bain said.

            Ashley Moore, who has a transgender teenager, said she is angry about the bill and terrified about what will happen to her family if it becomes law.

            “Why are we trying to take away things from children that help them thrive, that help them be themselves?"" Moore said. ""They are courageous people, and I ask that our politicians be courageous as well and vote no on this bill that will do nothing but cause damage to our children.” 

            The World Professional Association for Transgender Health said last year that hormones may be started at age 14, two years earlier than the group’s previous advice, and some surgeries done at age 15 or 17, a year or so earlier than previous guidance. The group acknowledged potential risks but said it is unethical and harmful to withhold early treatment.

            Walker's mother, Katie Rives, said he refused to wear girls' clothing starting about age 2 and came out as transgender 10 years later. He took puberty blockers and began taking testosterone a year ago, at age 16. 

            Walker, who has legally changed his first name, said he was depressed, had anxiety tics and “didn't like the world” when he was 12 and 13.

            Asked if he is happier now that he is taking male hormones, he smiled and said: “Absolutely.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811718,NCAA asks US appeals court to block pay for student-athletes,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The NCAA asked a federal appeals court on Wednesday to reject a legal effort to make colleges treat Division I athletes like employees and start paying them an hourly wage. 

            Lawyers for the student-athletes said that weekly, they often spend 30 hours or more on their sport and often need money for expenses, even if they are on full scholarship. And they believe the athletes deserve a share in the millions that are spent on coaches, college administrators and facilities — and the billions that networks pay to televise college sports.

            They are not seeking pay equivalent to their market value, but only a modest across-the-board pay rate similar to those earned by work-study students, the lawyers said.











            “This does not open up a circumstance in which there’s a bidding war (for top talent),” lawyer Michael Willemin said. 

            The NCAA urged the court to uphold the tradition of college athletes being unpaid amateurs. Critics of the pay-for-play scheme also fear the cost could lead schools to cut sports that don't generate as much or any revenue while sending more resources to their profitable football and basketball programs. 

            Lawyer Steven B. Katz, arguing for the NCAA, said a finding that athletes are employees ""launches you on the edge of a slippery slope that rapidly takes you to someplace that you don’t want to go.” 

            As an example, he said that the cost to attend some of the private colleges involved in the case exceed $70,000 a year. The value of a full scholarship would far outweigh the $10,000 to $15,000 the athletes might earn if they were paid a modest hourly wage, he argued.

            Katz also said the scholarships could become taxable if the students are deemed employees. And he questioned how teams would function if some students were “paid employees” on scholarship while walk-ons without a scholarship were not.

            At least one person on the panel, U.S. Circuit Judge Theodore McKee, seemed to think at least some student-athletes may be employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act — while acknowledging such a finding would create “so many practical problems."" 

            Would football players at powerhouse schools earn more than swimmers at small schools? What about Division II athletes? 

            ""Maybe that’s where we end up — that the quarterback at the SEC school is an employee and the woman who’s running cross-country track at Alabama, they're not an employee,"" McKee said.

            When Katz raised the potential risk of back taxes being owed, McKee cut him off, saying “the case is complicated enough without us going down that” rabbit hole.

            A lower court judge had declined to dismiss the lawsuit before it went to trial, prompting the NCAA to appeal. The three-judge panel did not indicate when it would rule.

            Willemin, arguing for the students, said the NCAA burdens athletes with rigid rules on gambling, earning outside income and free speech while their school teams further restrict their choices by controlling their class schedule, study halls and at times even their college major. The NCAA could loosen its grip on student-athletes and the case might go away, he suggested.

            “The NCAA has turned the idea of student-athlete on its head, even in non-revenue generating sports,” he said. “These are regulations the NCAA can change. They’ve chosen not to change them.""

            The case is just the latest one to test the NCAA's traditional amateurism model — and comes as the organization already faces complicated issues stemming from the advent of “name, image and likeness deals that can top $1 million for the most popular college athletes. 

            The NCAA also hopes that Congress might weigh in, given a series of setbacks in the courts. They include the unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that lifted the ban on compensation beyond full scholarships, and lets colleges give athletes education-related benefits such as computers and study abroad program fees.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811719,Nationals' Strasburg doesn't report following setback,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Washington Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg did not report with other pitchers to spring training on Wednesday after a recent setback in his comeback from a 2021 operation to correct thoracic outlet syndrome.

            Strasburg, 34, had a nerve-related setback in a recent bullpen session, MLB.com reported. He made only one start in 2022, giving up seven runs in 4 2/3 innings in a loss at Miami on June 9. His history of health problems created an uncertain outlook for his chances to return to the rotation in 2023.

            Strasburg has thrown a total of 31 1/3 innings across just eight starts over the past three seasons. He had carpal tunnel surgery in 2020, then needed an operation to correct thoracic outlet syndrome in 2021.











            In 2019, his last season in which he made more than five starts, Strasburg was 18-6 with a 3.32 ERA in 33 starts. He won two games and was named MVP of the Nationals' World Series win over the Houston Astros.

            Strasburg, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 amateur draft, is 113-62 with a 3.24 ERA and is a three-time All-Star with Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811721,Minnesota justices leave felon voting issue to Legislature,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld state laws that prohibit people with felony convictions from voting until they finish their parole, and put the burden on the Legislature to decide whether voting rights should be restored when people leave prison.

            The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of people with felony convictions who can't vote, had argued that the state's constitution guarantees the right to vote once a person is released from incarceration. But the majority of Supreme Court justices disagreed. 

            “There may be many compelling reasons why society should not permanently prohibit — or perhaps prohibit at all — persons convicted of a felony from voting,” Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Paul Thissen said in the majority opinion. But the state's constitution does not automatically entitle people with felony convictions to vote, Thissen added. 











            Supreme Court Justice Natalie Hudson was the only one to dissent. The state constitution requires the court to scrutinize any statute that “improperly discriminates among the people of this state,"" and the court failed to do so, Hudson said. 

            Lawyers for the ACLU expressed disappointment with the Supreme Court decision and said it’s urgent now for the Senate to pass the bill. 

            David McKinney, a staff attorney for the ACLU, said the decision means that more than 50,000 Minnesotans, who are disproportionately people of color, will remain disenfranchised unless the Senate acts.

            According to the majority opinion, appellants had shown that 1% of white people, 6% of Black people and 9% of Native American people in Minnesota could not vote in 2018 because they had been convicted of a felony but not discharged from their sentence. If the right to vote was restored upon release from incarceration, those percentages would drop to 0.1%, 1.5% and 2%, respectively. 

            Elizer Darris, co-executive director of the Minnesota Freedom Fund, who has been campaigning at the Legislature and canvassing door to door to change the laws, said it was “beyond disheartening” that the Supreme Court acknowledged the racial disparities but took no action to remedy them.

            Darris, who has a conviction for second-degree murder and can’t vote because he’s on parole until 2025, said he won’t give up on democracy and will continue to fight for the legislation.

            Minnesota’s Democratic secretary of state, Steve Simon, said in a statement: “If a person is deemed by a judge or jury to be worthy enough and safe enough to live in our community, then it is entirely reasonable to allow that person to have a say about who governs them. This restoration of voting rights is good for all of us, because we know that when people have a sense of ownership in their community they are far less likely to commit another crime.”

            Efforts to “restore the vote” are moving forward quickly in the Legislature. The House passed its bill with a 71-59 vote two weeks ago. The Senate is awaiting its final vote on a mirroring bill. 

            “We’ve heard from the Supreme Court that this issue requires action from the Legislature, and we are prepared to pass my legislation that would restore voting rights to those community members who are no longer incarcerated,” Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, a Democrat of Minneapolis and the Senate bill's chief author, said in a statement. 

            Lawmakers who oppose these efforts include Republican Sen. Warren Limmer, of Maple Grove, who serves as the lead Republican on the Senate's public safety committee. 

            “Just recently, a felon was sentenced to only six months in prison for raping two minor-aged girls,"" Limmer said in a video posted to Facebook on Tuesday. “Once that individual gets out on probation, he will be able to vote and affect our values in public policy... I personally believe that that’s not long enough to restore a felon's constitutional rights.” 

            
                In 21 states, voting rights are restored when people with felony convictions leave prison, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes Republican-controlled North Dakota, Indiana and Utah.

            Other states, like Minnesota, require probation and parole to be completed for the restoration of voting rights. And in some states, people incarcerated on certain crimes lose their rights indefinitely after release.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811722,Haiti at fore as Caribbean leaders tackle regional issues,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Top officials from Canada, the U.S. and Haiti met Wednesday behind closed doors to talk about the spiraling chaos in Haiti, a topic expected to dominate an annual Caribbean trade bloc meeting that opened in the Bahamas.

            The three-day Caricom meeting began Wednesday night, with host Philip Davis, the Bahamian prime minister, welcoming leaders of the 15-member bloc and others, including Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Brian Nichols, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.

            Also attending are Haiti's foreign affairs minister and the acting minister of justice and public security.











            A day before the meeting, Davis said at a news conference that Caribbean leaders “do not have the resources to deal with the Haiti problem ourselves, and we do need outside help. And we are looking to the north, Canada and the United States, to come to the fold to help.”

            Davis and other Caribbean leaders have complained about a surge in migrants that they say is straining the budgets of small islands struggling with the influx of hundreds of Haitians. The vast majority are fleeing deepening poverty and a spike in violence, with killings, kidnappings and rapes rising as gangs grow more powerful following the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.

            At the meeting's opening, Davis said Haiti needs urgent attention as conditions there deteriorate.

            ""I pray that we can agree on a series of concrete steps to help move towards a solution for the Haitian people and the region as a whole. We have learnt that inaction has its own costs and consequences,” he told the other leaders.

            Trudeau’s entourage said the trip would allow leaders to consider political, security and humanitarian assistance for Haitians and “Haitian-led solutions to the current situation.”

            Emmanuel Dubourg, the only Canadian member of Parliament of Haitian origin, said the Canada's government is “discussing all kinds of options to help people in Haiti.”

            The Caricom meeting comes as Haiti's prime minister continues to seek the deployment of foreign troops, a request made in October that the U.N. Security Council has not acted upon.

            The U.S. and Canada, along with other countries, have sent military equipment and other resources to Haiti’s National Police, but have not pledged troops to the dismay and frustration of some.

            Henry, Haiti's prime minister, tweeted that he and Nichols had “an important work meeting” Wednesday morning, but he did not provide details.

            The Caricom meeting will continue until Friday, with leaders also expected to talk about food security, climate change and other issues affecting the region. 

            Other officials attending the meeting include the U.S. special presidential envoy for the climate, John Kerry.

            “Caribbean governments are looking for action, and it will be important that the United States delivers in what is expected to be a pivotal year for the relationship,” Wazim Mowla, associate director and lead of the Caribbean Initiative at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a recent essay. “With the challenges the region faces, the Caribbean no longer has time to wait on the United States for action — and the United States can’t keep putting it off.”GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Top officials from Canada, the U.S. and Haiti met Wednesday behind closed doors to talk about the spiraling chaos in Haiti, a topic expected to dominate an annual Caribbean trade bloc meeting that opened in the Bahamas.The three-day Caricom meeting began Wednesday night, with host Philip Davis, the Bahamian prime minister, welcoming leaders of the 15-member bloc and others, including Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Brian Nichols, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.Also attending are Haiti's foreign affairs minister and the acting minister of justice and public security.A day before the meeting, Davis said at a news conference that Caribbean leaders “do not have the resources to deal with the Haiti problem ourselves, and we do need outside help. And we are looking to the north, Canada and the United States, to come to the fold to help.”Davis and other Caribbean leaders have complained about a surge in migrants that they say is straining the budgets of small islands struggling with the influx of hundreds of Haitians. The vast majority are fleeing deepening poverty and a spike in violence, with killings, kidnappings and rapes rising as gangs grow more powerful following the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.At the meeting's opening, Davis said Haiti needs urgent attention as conditions there deteriorate.""I pray that we can agree on a series of concrete steps to help move towards a solution for the Haitian people and the region as a whole. We have learnt that inaction has its own costs and consequences,” he told the other leaders.Trudeau’s entourage said the trip would allow leaders to consider political, security and humanitarian assistance for Haitians and “Haitian-led solutions to the current situation.”Emmanuel Dubourg, the only Canadian member of Parliament of Haitian origin, said the Canada's government is “discussing all kinds of options to help people in Haiti.”The Caricom meeting comes as Haiti's prime minister continues to seek the deployment of foreign troops, a request made in October that the U.N. Security Council has not acted upon.The U.S. and Canada, along with other countries, have sent military equipment and other resources to Haiti’s National Police, but have not pledged troops to the dismay and frustration of some.Henry, Haiti's prime minister, tweeted that he and Nichols had “an important work meeting” Wednesday morning, but he did not provide details.The Caricom meeting will continue until Friday, with leaders also expected to talk about food security, climate change and other issues affecting the region.Other officials attending the meeting include the U.S. special presidential envoy for the climate, John Kerry.“Caribbean governments are looking for action, and it will be important that the United States delivers in what is expected to be a pivotal year for the relationship,” Wazim Mowla, associate director and lead of the Caribbean Initiative at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a recent essay. “With the challenges the region faces, the Caribbean no longer has time to wait on the United States for action — and the United States can’t keep putting it off.”",2023/02/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811724,S. Carolina House passes abortion ban; no sign of budging,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — For the second time since the U.S. Supreme Court ended federal abortion protections, the South Carolina House has passed a near-total abortion ban — and shows no sign of budging.

            The lower chamber's Republican supermajority on Wednesday continued its efforts to make South Carolina the 13th state with a ban from conception. By a 83-31 vote largely along party lines, the House advanced a bill including exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal anomaly and the patient’s health and life.

            A long road awaits any abortion restriction before it reaches the governor's desk. Republican lawmakers in the conservative state have failed to agree on when exactly pregnancy can be legally terminated. A special session last year proved a vain attempt to restrict abortion after the two chambers could not reconcile vastly different bills.











            The stalemate persisted Wednesday.

            The move again puts the House proposal at odds with the GOP-controlled Senate's version that passed last week. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey has maintained that the upper chamber lacks the votes for the House's more restrictive bill. Instead, Republican senators have advanced an amended version of the prior ban on abortion after cardiac activity is detected around six weeks. Earlier this year, the South Carolina Supreme Court struck down a similar 2021 law as a violation of the state constitution's right to privacy in a 3-2 ruling.

            House leaders drew a hard line in the sand on Wednesday.

            “There is a legislative process that we go through. And there's conference committees and there's negotiations between parties,"" Speaker Murrell Smith said. ""But at this point the House simply didn't have the votes to pass the ‘heartbeat' bill.""

            Contrary to Senate Republicans’ insistence otherwise, Smith said the House version is the only proposal that could withstand legal scrutiny.

            The opinion of one justice in the abortion decision's three-person majority has served as a lodestar for Republicans seeking to craft an abortion ban that passes constitutional muster. Justice John Few suggested that the right to life might outweigh the right to privacy if the General Assembly determined that human life begins at conception. By passing an abortion ban from conception, Smith expressed confidence that Few's vote would flip.

            For one of the General Assembly’s most vocal abortion opponents, the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has shifted the goal posts. Republican Rep. John McCravy said he designed the state's previous so-called ""fetal heartbeat bill"" to tempt the U.S. Supreme Court into doing exactly what it did last summer: overturning Roe v. Wade. With that roadblock removed, McCravy said lawmakers need to go beyond their previous efforts.

            “We’re in a new position now,” McCravy said. “We’re not drafting a bill to try to tease the United States Supreme Court. We’re drafting a bill for South Carolina.”

            The bill explicitly states that it does not criminalize patients who receive an abortion. But the proposal allows the patient, a minor’s legal guardians, a solicitor or the state’s attorney general to sue others who illegally end a pregnancy. Plaintiffs could receive damages of $10,000 for each violation.

            Under the proposal, a biological father must begin child support payments from the date of conception and cover half of all pregnancy expenses. If the child is conceived through rape or incest, the offender would also fund any resulting mental health counseling.

            The bill also requires physicians who end a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest to report the allegation to the local sheriff within 24 hours of the abortion. 

            Wednesday's debate divided the measure's leading proponent and one of the chamber's most conservative members. McCravy successfully tabled multiple amendments from fellow Republican Rep. Josiah Magnuson that would have removed exceptions for rape and incest. While he personally shared Magnuson's opposition to those exceptions, McCravy said their inclusion was necessary to pass the bill.

            Magnuson put forth another failed amendment allowing someone who intentionally gets an abortion to be charged with a misdemeanor punishable by two years in prison and a $5,000 fine. McCravy said lawmakers should “fall down on the side of mercy and not criminalize women.”

            Republicans also removed the ability for a family court to grant abortion rights to minors without their legal guardians' knowledge.

            They also rejected several Democratic amendments. Rep. Heather Bauer — a first-year member who flipped her Columbia-area seat in a campaign centered on abortion rights — tried to remove what she called an “archaic” 1974 law criminalizing people who attempt self-managed abortions. While the Senate voted to remove the statute last week, the House did not.

            Bauer and Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter also proposed several processes similar to this fall's Kansas referendum, when voters in the conservative state overwhelmingly protected abortion access. House Republicans dismissed the effort as futile because constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote from each chamber — something the GOP-majority General Assembly would never do.

            Theological debate also broke out several times between Christians on both sides of the aisle who all claimed biblical support for their different positions.

            House Democrats criticized their Republican counterparts for pushing laws they said would worsen maternal mortality and teen pregnancy rates and drive OBGYNs away from a state already lacking in all those areas.

            “Year after year, we don't debate bills intended to improve the health outcomes for women and children,” Rep. Spencer Wetmore said at a Tuesday press conference. “Instead, we spend months of every legislative session debating how we can restrict the reproductive rights of women.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811725,Daytona 500 champion Cindric serves on jury for murder trial,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Austin Cindric traded his regular seat in a Ford for one in a jury box when he served during a North Carolina murder trial in December. The reigning Daytona 500 champion and his fellow jurors found the accused guilty.

            “Very guilty,” Cindric said, laughing.

            
                Winning the Daytona 500 comes with residual benefits. The 24-year-old Team Penske driver was just famous enough to get out of serving as the jury foreman.











            “Enough people knew who I was,” Cindric said Wednesday. ""I didn’t want to be the one to deliver the bad news.”

            He had some bad news after his surprise triumph at Daytona. Cindric’s Daytona 500 win in the No. 2 Ford was his only victory of the season for Team Penske. But his road toward serving for a trial started when he received a jury summons in the mail just two weeks after he won Daytona.

            One problem: Cindric’s schedule was sort of booked through November.

            “I got a deferral,” Cindric said. “And then I told them they could send me (a summons), these are the weeks I have off.”

            He even got The Captain involved. Cindric asked team owner Roger Penske’s lawyers to send a letter to the court that explained why the driver could not serve, at least until the offseason. Sure enough, Cindric, the son of the president of Penske’s racing organization, got his jury duty delayed. 

            Cindric eventually committed to his jury duty for almost two weeks in December. With the trial behind him, Cindric can focus on a repeat at Daytona.

            “Some people will always know who Austin Cindric is because he won the Daytona 500, and I’m totally fine with that,” Cindric said at the track where won NASCAR's season opener.

            But even before he takes the wheel Sunday, Cindric is getting plenty of attention for the way he spent his offseason.

            “Listen, I never want to see murder happen,"" three-time Daytona 500 champion Denny Hamlin said, ""but that would be very captivating to me. I love true crime. I’m a true crime junkie. That would have been really interesting.”

            BUSCH'S GUN CHARGE

            Kyle Busch declined to say why he feels the need to carry a handgun, but the Richard Childress Racing driver said he had a valid concealed carry permit long before was he was detained at a Mexican airport.

            Asked why he carries guns, Busch said, “doesn’t matter.”

            Busch was detained at a Mexican airport late last month when a handgun and ammunition were discovered in his luggage, the NASCAR star acknowledged last week, apologizing for the incident and calling it “a mistake.”

            A judge in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, home to beach destinations Cancun and Tulum, gave Busch a conditional sentence this month of 3 1/2 years in prison and ordered him to pay a $1,000 fine for having a gun and ammunition. Busch was allowed to leave Mexico after he paid a bond.

            Busch declined to discuss the incident and stood behind his statement of apology.

            Busch said he had guns even before he and his family were inside the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, when there was a shooting there last August. Busch’s wife, Samantha, detailed the harrowing experience in an Instagram post.

            COMMANDING START

            NASCAR will celebrate the start of its 75th season with nine winners of both the Daytona 500 and a Cup Series championship giving the command for drivers to start their engines at the Daytona 500.

            NASCAR Hall of Famers Richard Petty, Bobby Allison, Bill Elliott, Jeff Gordon and Dale Jarrett will be joined by Kevin Harvick, Jimmie Johnson, Kurt Busch and Joey Logano.

            Petty and Johnson are both seven-time Cup Series champions. Petty also has a record seven Daytona 500 victories and Johnson has a pair of Daytona 500 wins. Allison, Jarrett and Gordon are three-time Daytona 500 champions, Elliott won it twice, and Harvick, Busch and Logano each have one Daytona 500 victory.

            “If a driver has won both a Daytona 500 and a NASCAR Cup Series championship, they have accomplished the two most difficult feats possible in our sport and deserve to be put on a pedestal,” Daytona International Speedway President Frank Kelleher said. “As we start NASCAR’s 75th anniversary season, it’s important to honor these legends. There’s no better time to give fans the chance to celebrate the past than before a sold-out crowd at Daytona International Speedway.”

            EVERY 500 MILES A MEMORY

            Tiffany Haddish will serve as honorary starter for the Daytona 500. The comedian and “Night School” actress was the latest celebrity added to Sunday’s lineup.

            “I can’t wait to feel the power I’ll have with the green flag in hand as I get to tell those drivers when they can start the Daytona 500,” Haddish said.

            Country music star Dierks Bentley will play the pre-race concert and BRELAND will sing the national anthem for the Daytona 500. Since his breakout viral hit, “My Truck,” landed in 2019, BRELAND has quickly immersed himself in Nashville’s songwriting rooms, taking over as the king of country collaborations. He’s even recorded a song with Bentley.

            IT'S A BIG DILL

            Hamlin has a new hobby: pickleball.

            “I’m actually looking to purchase a stake in one of the professional teams,"" Hamlin said. ""It’s really exciting from my standpoint. It’s like tennis, only better for my shoulder. Anything that’s better on my joints is something I appreciate. All of my golfing buddies, we really can’t golf in the winter. It’s great for us to be able to do it indoors, which is a blast.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811726,Flores had 'gut feeling' that Vikings DC job was best fit,"EAGAN, Minn. (AP) — Brian Flores interviewed for at least four jobs this offseason, even one for head coach.

            No matter how big the rebuild might be in Minnesota, his two sons weren't deterred: Vikings defensive coordinator was surely the best fit for their dad.

            “They didn’t care about any of the other opportunities. They’re big Justin Jefferson fans, so when we accepted the position, there was a lot of Griddy-ing going on in my house,” Flores said, referencing Jefferson's signature touchdown groove. ""And I had my own version that nobody wants to see here.”











            Flores can name his tune and his dance — plus, probably, his price — if he finds a way to fix a defense that was one of the easiest in the NFL to move the ball against in 2022. 

            “You get a gut feeling — I think we’ve all kind of had those — that this was the place for me and my family,” said the 41-year-old Flores, who's married with three children.

            His daughter even took her first steps inside U.S. Bank Stadium at a team event the week of the Super Bowl he coached in with New England five seasons ago. 

            One year removed from his messy firing as Miami's head coach and the fallout that led to a still-pending lawsuit, Flores appeared quite comfortable with the current state of his career at an introductory news conference Wednesday at Vikings headquarters next to head coach Kevin O'Connell. Flores was hired on Feb. 6. 

            “I’m where my feet are. I’m very excited to be here. I think any other opportunities that present themselves in the future, we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,” said Flores, who interviewed for Arizona's head coach vacancy and defensive coordinator openings with Atlanta and Cleveland.

            Flores filed a class-action lawsuit last year alleging racial discrimination by the Dolphins and the NFL, a case still tied up in the court system. Flores, who is Black, was joined as plaintiffs by Steve Wilks and Ray Horton. He said Wednesday he couldn't comment specifically about the lawsuit.

            Flores built his resume over 15 seasons and four Super Bowl titles with the Patriots organization, the last eight as a defensive assistant. The Patriots won it all four years ago with Flores as a first-time defensive play-caller, and they jumped from 17th to seventh in the league in opponent passer rating while tying for fifth with 28 takeaways.

            “I want the closest resemblance to my personality as the head coach of this team to be articulated in how we play,"" O'Connell said, ""and I think Brian coming in here will give not only the similar football backgrounds and philosophies, but also just the mindset of being ultra-competitors.”

            Flores spent three years as coach of the Dolphins and was a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach in 2022 for Pittsburgh. He has replaced Ed Donatell, fired by O'Connell after their only season together. 

            O'Connell also formally interviewed Sean Desai, Mike Pettine and Ryan Nielsen for the job of reviving a defense that ranked second-worst in the league in yards allowed and fourth-worst in points allowed. O'Connell clearly wasn't on the same page with Donatell down the stretch about how much the Vikings needed to adjust their rush and coverage strategy.

            “I left out of here feeling like there was a shared vision,"" Flores said. ""He’s aggressive offensively. I’m aggressive defensively. That kind of philosophy was aligned.”

            With safety Harrison Smith, cornerback Patrick Peterson, inside linebacker Eric Kendricks and outside linebackers Danielle Hunter and Za'Darius Smith, the Vikings have a core that's accomplished and savvy but expensive and aged. 

            Those five players have been picked for the Pro Bowl a combined 21 times, but only Hunter (27) is under 30. There's almost no way the entire quintet will remain for 2023, with the possibility that more than one would be cut for salary cap relief. Peterson and the other two starting cornerbacks, Duke Shelley and Chandon Sullivan, will all be free agents next month. 

            Hunter, Kendricks and Smith, in particular, were either not the right fits or slow to transition to the new scheme after Donatell installed a 3-4 base system that was heavier on zone pass coverage and lighter on blitzing than the Vikings were previously in the 4-3 scheme run by head coach Mike Zimmer. Flores prefers a 3-4, but has operated a defense more like Zimmer's than Donatell's, with more man-to-man coverage and frequent extra pass rushers.

            The lack of contribution to the defense from recent drafts has become a glaring problem. From 2017 through 2021, at the direction of general manager Rick Spielman, they drafted a total of five defensive players in any of the first three rounds. Only two are still with the team: cornerback Cameron Dantzler and outside linebacker Patrick Jones.

            Dantzler, a third-rounder in 2020, has been hampered by injuries and finished the season as a backup. Jones, a third-rounder in 2021, played in 26% of the snaps on defense in 2022.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLEAGAN, Minn. (AP) — Brian Flores interviewed for at least four jobs this offseason, even one for head coach.No matter how big the rebuild might be in Minnesota, his two sons weren't deterred: Vikings defensive coordinator was surely the best fit for their dad.“They didn’t care about any of the other opportunities. They’re big Justin Jefferson fans, so when we accepted the position, there was a lot of Griddy-ing going on in my house,” Flores said, referencing Jefferson's signature touchdown groove. ""And I had my own version that nobody wants to see here.”Flores can name his tune and his dance — plus, probably, his price — if he finds a way to fix a defense that was one of the easiest in the NFL to move the ball against in 2022.“You get a gut feeling — I think we’ve all kind of had those — that this was the place for me and my family,” said the 41-year-old Flores, who's married with three children.His daughter even took her first steps inside U.S. Bank Stadium at a team event the week of the Super Bowl he coached in with New England five seasons ago.One year removed from his messy firing as Miami's head coach and the fallout that led to a still-pending lawsuit, Flores appeared quite comfortable with the current state of his career at an introductory news conference Wednesday at Vikings headquarters next to head coach Kevin O'Connell. Flores was hired on Feb. 6.“I’m where my feet are. I’m very excited to be here. I think any other opportunities that present themselves in the future, we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,” said Flores, who interviewed for Arizona's head coach vacancy and defensive coordinator openings with Atlanta and Cleveland.Flores filed a class-action lawsuit last year alleging racial discrimination by the Dolphins and the NFL, a case still tied up in the court system. Flores, who is Black, was joined as plaintiffs by Steve Wilks and Ray Horton. He said Wednesday he couldn't comment specifically about the lawsuit.Flores built his resume over 15 seasons and four Super Bowl titles with the Patriots organization, the last eight as a defensive assistant. The Patriots won it all four years ago with Flores as a first-time defensive play-caller, and they jumped from 17th to seventh in the league in opponent passer rating while tying for fifth with 28 takeaways.“I want the closest resemblance to my personality as the head coach of this team to be articulated in how we play,"" O'Connell said, ""and I think Brian coming in here will give not only the similar football backgrounds and philosophies, but also just the mindset of being ultra-competitors.”Flores spent three years as coach of the Dolphins and was a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach in 2022 for Pittsburgh. He has replaced Ed Donatell, fired by O'Connell after their only season together.O'Connell also formally interviewed Sean Desai, Mike Pettine and Ryan Nielsen for the job of reviving a defense that ranked second-worst in the league in yards allowed and fourth-worst in points allowed. O'Connell clearly wasn't on the same page with Donatell down the stretch about how much the Vikings needed to adjust their rush and coverage strategy.“I left out of here feeling like there was a shared vision,"" Flores said. ""He’s aggressive offensively. I’m aggressive defensively. That kind of philosophy was aligned.”With safety Harrison Smith, cornerback Patrick Peterson, inside linebacker Eric Kendricks and outside linebackers Danielle Hunter and Za'Darius Smith, the Vikings have a core that's accomplished and savvy but expensive and aged.Those five players have been picked for the Pro Bowl a combined 21 times, but only Hunter (27) is under 30. There's almost no way the entire quintet will remain for 2023, with the possibility that more than one would be cut for salary cap relief. Peterson and the other two starting cornerbacks, Duke Shelley and Chandon Sullivan, will all be free agents next month.Hunter, Kendricks and Smith, in particular, were either not the right fits or slow to transition to the new scheme after Donatell installed a 3-4 base system that was heavier on zone pass coverage and lighter on blitzing than the Vikings were previously in the 4-3 scheme run by head coach Mike Zimmer. Flores prefers a 3-4, but has operated a defense more like Zimmer's than Donatell's, with more man-to-man coverage and frequent extra pass rushers.The lack of contribution to the defense from recent drafts has become a glaring problem. From 2017 through 2021, at the direction of general manager Rick Spielman, they drafted a total of five defensive players in any of the first three rounds. Only two are still with the team: cornerback Cameron Dantzler and outside linebacker Patrick Jones.Dantzler, a third-rounder in 2020, has been hampered by injuries and finished the season as a backup. Jones, a third-rounder in 2021, played in 26% of the snaps on defense in 2022.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811728,Texas university bans woman ahead of Vegas stabbing trial,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The University of Texas at Dallas has banned a student from attending classes on campus while she serves house arrest in Texas ahead of trial in a Las Vegas-area stabbing that drew international attention, a campus official said Wednesday.

            Authorities in Nevada have said Nika Nikoubin, 22, attacked her date in a hotel room last year in retaliation for the 2020 death of an Iranian military leader killed in an American drone strike.

            Phil Roth, a university spokesman, confirmed that Nikoubin was admitted for the spring 2023 semester before university officials became aware that she was charged with a crime and is under the jurisdiction of a Nevada court. 











            “Because the safety of our campus and our community is of utmost importance, we have removed her from campus,” Roth said in a statement. It said campus police “will monitor the student’s compliance with the removal order.”

            In Las Vegas, Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said Wednesday she didn’t have authority to make a campus ban part of tight restrictions imposed on Nikoubin while she lives with her parents in Frisco, Texas.

            But the judge did decide that Nikoubin, an aspiring music video performer, can’t book singing and dancing performances at venues away from her home.

            “At this point, we’ll just say no,” Kierny said of performance gigs, adding that Nikoubin can ask officials overseeing her pretrial release to seek prior court approval on a case-by-case basis.

            A campus police detective, Rod Bishop, cited security concerns and Monday's fatal mass shooting at Michigan State University as he asked the judge to issue a court order banning Nikoubin from UT Dallas, where Nikoubin's father is a professor.

            Three university students were killed and five were wounded in East Lansing, Michigan, before a 43-year-old gunman shot himself dead as police confronted him following an hours-long manhunt. Authorities said the man had no known connection to the university and a motive for the shooting was not immediately known.

            “After this week’s shooting,"" Bishop said by teleconference to the Las Vegas courtroom, “along with continued campus violence across the nation, students and parents are even more alarmed about safety issues.”

            Bishop on Monday told Kierny that Texas police only became aware of Nikoubin’s criminal charges in Nevada after a reporter tried to interview her about her internet music video posted under the name Nika Borouj, according to KLAS-TV in Las Vegas.

            Earlier Wednesday, Bishop had said UT Dallas reached an agreement with Nikoubin restricting her to online courses only, and that she will ""not return to the university (campus) while her legal issue is pending.”

            “It is important that our 31,000 students as well as our staff and faculty know that their safety is our priority,” he said.

            Kierny restated Nikoubin's restrictions, including a GPS monitor, an evening curfew and limited travel for specified purposes on a pre-approved schedule, including to school. The judge called it ""a private issue, whether she is allowed on campus.”

            “That would be up to you,” Kierny told Bishop.

            Nikoubin’s father, Tooraj Nikoubin, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the university, declined to comment by email and telephone on Wednesday.

            Nika Nikoubin has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in July on attempted murder and felony battery with a weapon charges following her arrest in the alleged March 2022 attack.

            Authorities said she told officers that she met the unidentified victim on a dating app and then stabbed him inside a Henderson hotel room as the two had sex. The man was blindfolded at the time, officials said. He survived the attack.

            Henderson police said Nikoubin acknowledged using a knife and told investigators it was an act of revenge for the death of Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian military leader killed by an American drone aircraft strike in January 2020.

            “The U.S. killed Soleimani. … So I feel like it’s fair that American blood be spilled,” Nikoubin told an officer, according to bodycam footage taken during the aftermath of the stabbing.

            Nikoubin underwent court-ordered psychological evaluations in Nevada before she was found competent to face criminal charges. She was indicted by a grand jury in December.

            Her defense attorney, Alanna Bondy, told Kierny on Wednesday that Nikoubin has been making the 40-minute trip from home to college in Dallas, and rather than return home, stays at her father's office on Tuesdays and Thursdays between morning classes that end before 10 a.m. and evening classes that begin at 6 p.m.

            Bondy said her client is a permanent U.S. resident. She declined to comment about elements of the case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811729,"U.S. could face debt-ceiling crisis this summer without deal, CBO warns","WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday said the U.S. Treasury Department will exhaust its ability to pay all its bills sometime between July and September, unless the current $31.4 trillion cap on borrowing is raised or suspended.In a report issued alongside its annual budget outlook, the non-partisan CBO cautioned that a historic federal debt default could occur before July if revenue flowing into the Treasury in April - when most Americans typically submit annual income tax filings - lags expectations.The pace of incoming revenue, coupled with the performance of the U.S. economy in coming months, makes it difficult for government officials to predict the exact ""X-date,"" when the Treasury could begin to default on many debt payments without action by Congress.""If the debt limit is not raised or suspended before the extraordinary measures are exhausted, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully,"" the CBO report said. ""As a result, the government would have to delay making payments for some activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.""Separately, the CBO said annual U.S. budget deficits will average $2 trillion between 2024 and 2033, approaching pandemic-era records by the end of the decade - a forecast likely to stoke Republican demands for spending cuts.Meanwhile, CBO estimated an unemployment rate of 4.7% this year, far above the current 3.4%.CBO Director Phillip Swagel attributed the rise to higher interest rates that particularly are hitting the housing industry, coupled with slowing business investment.The sobering analysis reflects the full impact of recent spending legislation, including investments in clean energy and semiconductors and higher military spending, along with higher healthcare, pension and interest costs. It assumes no change in tax and spending laws over the next decade.""Over the long term, our projections suggest that changes in fiscal policy must be made to address the rising costs of interest and mitigate other adverse consequences of high and rising debt,"" Swagel said in a statement.The need to raise the debt ceiling is driven by past spending laws and tax cuts, some enacted under Democratic President Joe Biden's Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, want to withhold a debt limit increase until Democrats agree to deep spending cuts. Democrats in turn say the debt limit should not be ""held hostage"" to Republican tactics over federal spending.After hitting the $31.4 trillion borrowing cap on Jan. 19, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the Treasury can keep up payments on debt, federal benefits and make other outlays at least through June 5 using cash receipts and extraordinary cash management measures.YEAR OF THE DEBT LIMITSo far in 2023, not a day has gone by on Capitol Hill without lawmakers jousting over the debt limit, as Democrats press for a quick, clean increase in Treasury borrowing authority and Republicans insist on first nailing down significant reductions in future government spending.Social Security and Medicare, the government's popular pension plan and its healthcare program for Americans ages 65 and older, are at the center of the debt limit and government funding debate, as both parties also jockey to define the contours of the 2024 presidential and congressional election campaigns.""There has been a Republican drumbeat to cut Social Security and Medicare,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has labored, without much success so far, to smother such talk.""Let me say one more time. There is no agenda on the part of Senate Republicans to revisit Medicare or Social Security. Period,"" he said at a news conference.Most Americans do not closely follow Washington's debt-ceiling saga, but they still worry it could hurt their finances, according to a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll conducted Feb. 6-13.In that poll, 55% of U.S. adults said they have heard little or nothing about the debate, but three-quarters of respondents said Congress must reach a deal because defaulting would add to their families' financial stress, largely through potentially higher borrowing costs.",2023/02/16,125,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811733,"Bird flu spreads to new countries, threatens non-stop 'war' on poultry","CHICAGO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Avian flu has reached new corners of the globe and become endemic for the first time in some wild birds that transmit the virus to poultry, according to veterinarians and disease experts, who warn it is now a year-round problem.Reuters spoke to more than 20 experts and farmers on four continents who said the prevalence of the virus in the wild signals that record outbreaks will not abate soon on poultry farms, ramping up threats to the world's food supply. They warned that farmers must view the disease as a serious risk all year, instead of focusing prevention efforts during spring migration seasons for wild birds.Outbreaks of the virus have continued in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa, undefeated by summer heat or winter cold snaps, since a strain arrived in the United States in early 2022 that was genetically similar to cases in Europe and Asia.Egg prices set records after the disease wiped out tens of millions of hens last year, putting a staple source of cheap protein out of reach to some of the world's poorest at a time the global economy is reeling from high inflation.Wild birds are primarily responsible for spreading the virus, according to experts. Waterfowl like ducks can carry the disease without dying and introduce it to poultry through contaminated feces, saliva and other means.Farmers' best efforts to protect flocks are falling short.In the United States, Rose Acre Farms, the country's second-largest egg producer, lost about 1.5 million hens at a Guthrie County, Iowa, production site last year, even though anyone who entered barns was required to shower first to remove any trace of the virus, Chief Executive Marcus Rust said.A company farm in Weld County, Colorado, was infected twice within about six months, killing more than 3 million chickens, Rust said. He thinks wind blew the virus in from nearby fields where geese defecated.""We got nailed,"" Rust said. ""You just pull your hair out.""The United States, Britain, France and Japan are among countries that have suffered record losses of poultry over the past year, leaving some farmers feeling helpless.""Avian flu is occurring even in a new poultry farm with modern equipment and no windows, so all we could do now is ask God to avoid an outbreak,"" said Shigeo Inaba, who raises chickens for meat in Ibaraki prefecture near Tokyo.Poultry in the Northern Hemisphere were previously considered to be most at risk when wild birds are active during spring migration. Soaring levels of the virus in a broad range of waterfowl and other wild birds mean poultry now face high risks year round, experts said.""It's a new war,"" said Bret Marsh, the state veterinarian in the U.S. state of Indiana. ""It's basically a 12-month vigil.""In a sign the threat is expected to persist, Marsh is seeking funds from Indiana's lawmakers to hire an additional poultry veterinarian and poultry health-specialist. Indiana lost more than 200,000 turkeys and other birds over the past year, while total U.S. deaths top 58 million birds, according to U.S. government data, surpassing the previous 2015 record.The virus is usually deadly to poultry, and entire flocks are culled when even one bird tests positive.Vaccinations are not a simple solution: they may reduce but not eliminate the threat from the virus, making it harder to detect its presence among a flock. Still, Mexico and the EU are among those vaccinating or considering shots.GLOBAL PROBLEMWild birds have spread the disease farther and wider around the world than ever before, likely carrying record amounts of the virus, said Gregorio Torres, the head of the science department at the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health, an intergovernmental group and global authority on animal diseases. The virus changed from previous outbreaks to a form that is probably more transmissible, he told Reuters.""The disease is here to stay at least in the short term,"" Torres said.Torres could not confirm the virus is endemic in wild birds worldwide, though other experts said it is endemic in certain birds in places like the United States.While the virus can infect people, usually those who have contact with infected birds, the World Health Organization says the risk to humans is low.The form of the virus circulating is infecting a broader range of wild birds than previous versions, including those that do not migrate long distances, said David Suarez, acting laboratory director of the U.S. government's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Georgia.Such infections of ""resident"" birds are helping the virus to persist throughout the year when it didn't previously, he said.Black vultures, which inhabit the southern United States and previously avoided infections, are now among the species suffering, said David Stallknecht, director of the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia.The virus has also infected mammals like foxes, bears and seals.""We all have to believe in miracles,"" Stallknecht said, ""but I really can't see a scenario where it's going to disappear.""CROSSING BORDERSHigh virus levels in birds like blue-winged teal, ducks that migrate long distances, helped spread the virus to new parts of South America, Stallknecht said.Countries including Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia in recent months reported cases.Ecuador imposed a three-month animal-health emergency on Nov. 29, two days after its first case was detected, the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock said. So far, more than 1.1 million birds have died, the ministry said.Cases in Bolivia put the disease close to poultry giant Brazil.""Everyone is focused on preventing the flu from reaching our country,"" said Gian Carlos Zacchi, who raises chickens for processor Aurora in Chapecó in Brazil's Santa Catarina state.Some experts suspect climate change may be contributing to the global spread by altering wild birds' habitats and migratory paths.""The wild bird dynamics have shifted, and that's allowed the viruses that live in them to shift as well,"" said Carol Cardona, an avian flu expert and professor at the University of Minnesota.Farmers are trying unusual tactics to protect poultry, with some using machines that make loud noises to scare off wild birds, experts said.In Rhode Island, Eli Berkowitz, an egg producer and chief executive of Little Rhody Foods, sprayed the disinfectant Lysol on goose poop on a walkway of his farm in case it contained the virus. He also limits visitors to the farm, a more traditional precaution.Berkowitz said he is bracing for March and April when migration season will pose an even greater risk to poultry.""You'd better buckle up and hold on for your dear life,"" he said.",2023/02/16,280,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811735,Back to Blue calls for urgent action to tackle ocean acidification,"TOKYO, JAPAN -  Media OutReach - 16 February 2023 -  Back to Blue, an initiative of Economist Impact and The Nippon Foundation, emphasises that time is swiftly running out to avoid the worst impacts of ocean acidification.   At an event entitled ""Ocean Acidification: A Crisis in the making"", hosted by Back to Blue in Tokyo, Japan, on February 2rd, chairman of The Nippon Foundation Yohei Sasakawa, and chairman of The Economist Group Lord Deighton made opening remarks, inviting urgent action to tackle ocean acidification.   Peter Thomson, UN Special Envoy for Oceans, said, ""In light of the biodiversity framework adopted at the end of last year, ocean acidification is an urgent issue. Today's event is very significant. This year, the G7 meeting will be held in Japan, a maritime nation. I hope that Japan will show leadership in this regard."" Panellists included Steve Widdicombe, Scientific Director of Plymouth Marine Laboratory, a world authority on marine ecology, and Japanese fisheries researchers.   Back to Blue released its  Ocean Acidification programme in December 2022. The publication focuses on the need to address ocean acidification and is based on insights and research provided by some of the world's leading ocean scientists. The publication highlights how time is rapidly running out to avoid the worst effects of ocean acidification and the worst impacts of ocean acidification on marine life, livelihoods, and economies.   Ocean acidification occurs when seawater absorbs CO2 generated by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. More than a quarter of the CO2 emitted by humans into the atmosphere has been absorbed by the oceans each year, but CO2 emissions are now increasing so rapidly that the oceans are no longer able to absorb it. As a result, the chemistry of the ocean is changing, acidity is increasing, and the ability of many marine organisms to protect themselves, grow, and reproduce is weakening.   The publication highlights that if we continue on our current high-emissions trajectory, many marine organisms, including molluscs, pteropods (""sea butterflies"") and warm-water corals, will be at very high risk from acidification as early as 2050. The adverse impacts from the decline of such organisms on ocean biodiversity and marine food chains are likely to be severe.   Steve Widdicombe, scientific director of Plymouth Marine Laboratory and coordinator of the Ocean Acidification Research for Sustainability (OARS) program, said, ""Ocean acidification, warming, and deoxygenation are interacting to create the perfect storm of environmental problems.""   The publication also brings to light some of the potential economic impacts of ocean acidification, which are yet to be widely studied. If unaddressed, ocean acidification will put coastal economies and the aquaculture, tourism and other jobs that rely on them at grave risk. Past projections of economic losses from depleted shellfish production alone range from $75m in the United States to over $1bn in Europe. In many parts of the Global South, where fisheries and aquaculture contribute tens of billions to local economies and employ millions, the impacts of acidification on livelihoods will be felt extremely keenly.   Charles Goddard, editorial director at Economist Impact says, ""We have enough knowledge to develop effective means to mitigate and adapt to the effects of acidification. Development of ocean resilience is a challenge that cannot wait. It will be costly, but we believe it must be weighed against the benefits of avoiding future damage.""   Yohei Sasakawa, chairman of The Nippon Foundation says, ""The continuing impact of ocean acidification on seagrass beds, coral reefs, and marine life means that we are treating the ocean, which provides more than half of the oxygen we breathe and is one of our most valuable defenses in the fight against climate change, in an economically and ecologically devastating manner. It is time to make ocean acidification a top priority so that we can more proactively develop a scientific understanding of its impacts and promote necessary response and adaptation measures globally before it is too late.""

About Back to Blue

            "" Back to Blue"" is an initiative of Economist Impact and The Nippon Foundation. The initiative's goal is to focus efforts on evidence-based approaches and solutions to man-made issues that pose major threats to ocean health.   While governments and policymakers have begun efforts towards restoring biodiversity and regenerating ocean health, there remains an ostensible knowledge gap on plastic and chemical pollution.   Recognising the need to stimulate fresh dialogue and solutions to pressing ocean issues, this multi-year initiative brings together both organisations' unique capabilities in ocean research and programme-building to build a powerful platform which will accelerate momentum in improving ocean health. In 2021, the Plastic Management Index published under Back to Blue addressed the issue of marine plastic pollution. In 2022 the focus is on the less visible pollution from chemical contaminants that are damaging ocean life and ecosystems and in the long term, human health.""

In ocean affairs, the Foundation aims to cultivate human resources who will chart a course for the ocean's future and to pass on the ocean's riches to future generations. Other primary areas of activity include support for children, persons with disabilities, disaster relief, and international cooperation, with the ultimate goal of achieving a society where all people support one another.The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.About Back to Blue"" Back to Blue"" is an initiative of Economist Impact and The Nippon Foundation. The initiative's goal is to focus efforts on evidence-based approaches and solutions to man-made issues that pose major threats to ocean health.   While governments and policymakers have begun efforts towards restoring biodiversity and regenerating ocean health, there remains an ostensible knowledge gap on plastic and chemical pollution.   Recognising the need to stimulate fresh dialogue and solutions to pressing ocean issues, this multi-year initiative brings together both organisations' unique capabilities in ocean research and programme-building to build a powerful platform which will accelerate momentum in improving ocean health. In 2021, the Plastic Management Index published under Back to Blue addressed the issue of marine plastic pollution. In 2022 the focus is on the less visible pollution from chemical contaminants that are damaging ocean life and ecosystems and in the long term, human health.""About Economist ImpactEconomist Impact combines the rigour of a think-tank with the creativity of a media brand to engage a globally influential audience.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811744,Manfred: Oakland owner focusing on move to Las Vegas,"PHOENIX (AP) — Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred says Oakland Athletics owner John Fisher has focused on Las Vegas of late as a new home for the franchise.

            Manfred, speaking Wednesday at baseball's Cactus League media day, isn't closing the door on the team remaining in Oakland.

            “I think Mr. Fisher wants to make the best deal to secure the future of the A's, whether it's in Oakland or in Las Vegas,” Manfred said. “They need a new stadium. I think that's kind of beyond debate.”











            The A’s have played at the Coliseum since 1968, and their lease expires after the 2024 season. After withdrawing plans for ballparks in Fremont and San Jose, the team announced in November 2018 it had found a waterfront location for a new ballpark at Howard Terminal, close to the Jack London Square neighborhood.

            But the Howard Terminal proposal has been stalled by money and concerns about affordable housing in the area.

            “I don't think they are in agreement on the affordable housing issue,” Manfred said. “The threshold issue right now I think in Oakland is how to handle the funding for the infrastructure.”

            The A's also have been working with funding issues when it comes to a possible ballpark in Las Vegas.

            Oakland's uncertain future is one reason it had a major league-low payroll of $49 million last year.

            The gap between baseball's big spenders and its small-market clubs prompted Cincinnati Reds President Phil Castellini to reportedly tell a supporters group in January that an increasing amount of clubs were out of contention on opening day.

            “I think that most people who pay attention to our game realize that we do have a disparity issue in the game, both on the revenue side, and consequently on the ability to spend on players,” Manfred said when asked about Castellini's remarks.

            “I think sometimes in markets that produces frustration that leads to what I regard to be unfortunate comments, not helpful.”

            San Diego is considered a small market, but it has one of the majors' biggest payrolls after finalizing a $280 million, 11-year contract with Xander Bogaerts in December. Manfred praised Padres owner Peter Seidler for his investment in his club and said the Padres have gone from a revenue-sharing receiver to a team that pays.

            “The trick for small markets has always been sustainability,” he said. “Hats off to Peter Seidler. He's made a massive financial commitment, personally, to making this all happen. The question becomes how long can you continue to do that, and what happens when you have to go through a rebuild.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811745,Nicaragua strips citizenship from 94 political opponents,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Nicaragua cancelled the citizenship of 94 political opponents Wednesday, including writers Sergio Ramírez and Gioconda Belli. 

            Appeals Court Justice Ernesto Rodríguez Mejía read a statement that declared the 94 people to be “traitors” and said they had lost their Nicaraguan citizenship.

            Mejía said their properties would be confiscated. 











            He said those on the list — among them rights activist Vilma Núñez, former Sandinista rebel commander Luis Carrión and journalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro — were guilty of “spreading false news” and “conspiracy to undermine national integrity.”

            It was not clear what law the declaration was based on. Nicaragua’s congress has not yet fully approved a bill that would allow the government to strip people of their citizenship. 

            Most of those named have fled Nicaragua since President Daniel Ortega began arresting opponents two years ago, and Mejía said they had been declared “fugitives.” There was no mention of what might happen to those named who are still in Nicaragua.

            The move comes days after Ortega packed off 222 imprisoned political leaders, priests, students, activists and other dissidents on a flight to the United States.

            Shortly after, Ortega’s government voted to strip the expelled former prisoners of Nicaraguan citizenship. 

            Analysts, legal experts and human rights groups call it a political ploy. They contend it also violates international law and say it is unprecedented — at least in the Western Hemisphere — in terms of scale and impact.

            Ramirez announced in 2021 that he would live in Spain, after Ortega's government tried to arrest him and banned his latest book. The 79-year-old writer served as vice president during Ortega’s first government from 1985 to 1990. But in the mid-1990s he distanced himself from Ortega, along with other intellectuals and former guerrillas.

            Thousands have fled into exile since Nicaraguan security forces violently put down mass antigovernment protests in 2018. Ortega says the protests were actually an attempted coup with foreign backing, aiming for his overthrow and encouraging foreign nations to apply sanctions on members of his family and government.

            In the run-up to Ortega’s re-election in November 2021, Nicaraguan authorities arrested seven potential opposition presidential candidates to clear the field. The government also has closed hundreds of nongovernmental groups that Ortega accused of taking foreign funding and using it to destabilize his government.

            Peter J. Spiro, an international law professor at Temple University, and others say stripping away citizenship in this context violates a treaty adopted in 1961 by countries in the United Nations, including Nicaragua, which sets clear rules meant to prevent statelessness.

            The treaty states that governments cannot “deprive any person or group of persons of their nationality on racial, ethnic, religious or political grounds.”

            Spiro noted there are some circumstances when governments can terminate citizenship, such as ending nationality for someone who acquires citizenship in another country when the first nation prohibits dual citizenship. But, he said, ending citizenship is not allowed when it is used as a political weapon.

            Spain has offered its citizenship to the 222 exiles, while the U.S. granted the Nicaraguans a two-year temporary protection.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Nicaragua cancelled the citizenship of 94 political opponents Wednesday, including writers Sergio Ramírez and Gioconda Belli.Appeals Court Justice Ernesto Rodríguez Mejía read a statement that declared the 94 people to be “traitors” and said they had lost their Nicaraguan citizenship.Mejía said their properties would be confiscated.He said those on the list — among them rights activist Vilma Núñez, former Sandinista rebel commander Luis Carrión and journalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro — were guilty of “spreading false news” and “conspiracy to undermine national integrity.”It was not clear what law the declaration was based on.

            Chafin gets $5.5 million this year, and the Diamondbacks have a $7.25 million option for 2024 with a $750,000 buyout. Chafin could earn $1 million in performance bonuses for pitching appearances: $250,000 each for 55, 60, 65 and 70. He would get a $250,000 assignment bonus if traded.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811747,"Black Hawk helicopter crashes in Alabama, killing 2 crew","MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A Black Hawk helicopter from the Tennessee National Guard crashed Wednesday in Alabama, killing two crew members, the Tennessee National Guard said.

            “We are deeply saddened by the loss of two Tennessee National Guardsmen, and our prayers are with their families during this heartbreaking tragedy,” Brig. Gen. Warner Ross, Tennessee’s Adjutant General, said in a statement. “We ask Tennesseans to join us in supporting their families during this time of unthinkable grief.”

            According to Ross, two members of the Tennessee National Guard were killed during a flight- training mission. The helicopter crashed around 3 p.m. local time and caught fire.











            The Madison County sheriff’s office said there were no injuries to anyone on the ground when the helicopter crashed.

            “We have no survivors,” sheriff's Investigator Brent Patterson said. “We have a crime scene here. We have it taped off.”

            The UH-60 helicopter, more widely known as a Black Hawk, crashed in the unincorporated community of Harvest along Alabama Highway 53, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said in a statement.

            The highway along which the crash happened passes through commercial areas northwest of Huntsville that are bounded by subdivisions, forests and fields south of the state line with Tennessee. The sheriff’s office said in a statement that the crash was causing heavy traffic delays that are expected to last into Thursday.

            Harvest is just northwest of Huntsville, which is home to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army’s Redstone Arsenal. The once rural area has become increasingly suburban and is about 90 miles south of Nashville.

            “Maria and I are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of two Tennessee National Guard members,” said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Wednesday. “Please join us in lifting their families up in prayer and support during this time of unspeakable grief.”

            A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration referred questions to the military. 

            “Governor Lee, Alabamians will continue to uplift in prayer the families affected by this heartbreaking tragedy,” Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said. “The Guardsmen who lost their lives today will be remembered as heroes. The people of Alabama stand with our neighbors in Tennessee.”

            Local news outlets showed large plumes of black smoke rising from the crash site. Multiple emergency response vehicles were on scene.

            “I’m deeply saddened by the fatal helicopter crash that happened in Madison County today,” U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, who represents Alabama’s 5th District, said in a tweet. “My heart hurts for those who lost their lives in this tragic incident and for their families as they learn of this news.”

            Over the years, a handful of Black Hawk helicopters were in crashes during training exercises.

            In 2022 in Utah, whiteout conditions caused a Black Hawk helicopter pilot during a training exercise to lose sight of where he was trying to land, causing a crash with another helicopter near a Utah ski resort. None of men and women aboard the helicopter or the dozens of skiers nearby at the resort were injured.

            In 2021, three Idaho Army National Guard pilots died when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed near Boise during a training flight.

            And in 2020, two soldiers were killed and three were injured when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed during a training exercise off Southern California’s coast.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811748,UN draft resolution calls for ceasefire in Ukraine and peace,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The European Union on Wednesday circulated the resolution to be voted on by the U.N. General Assembly on the eve of next week’s first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, calling for a cessation of hostilities and a peace that ensures Ukraine’s “sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity.”

            There are no vetoes in the 193-member world body, so the resolution is certain to be adopted at the end of a high-level emergency special session of the assembly Feb. 23. But the big question is how many “yes” votes it will get.

            To mark the anniversary, Ukraine asked the EU to draft the resolution in consultation with U.N. member states, with the aim of gathering strong support from the international community for peace in Ukraine in line with the U.N. Charter, said an EU diplomat who was not authorized to speak publicly. The charter calls for peaceful settlement of disputes and declares that all countries shall refrain “from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”











            The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body dealing with Ukraine because the Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, is paralyzed as a result of Russia’s veto power. 

            While the assembly’s five previous resolutions on Ukraine are not legally binding — as council resolutions are — they are important as a reflection of world opinion.

            The first resolution adopted eight days after Russia invasion last Feb. 24 demanded an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of all Russian troops. It was approved by a vote of 141-5 with 35 abstentions. 

            A second resolution three weeks later blamed Russia for Ukraine’s humanitarian crisis and called for protection of civilians and their homes and infrastructure critical to their survival. It was adopted by a vote of 140-5 with 38 abstentions. 

            An Oct. 12 resolution condemned Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of four Ukrainian regions and demanded its immediate reversal. It got the highest vote of the five resolutions — 143-5 with 35 abstentions. 

            Two other resolutions that suspended Russia from the U.N.’s Geneva-based Human Rights Council and called for Russia to be held accountable for violating international law by invading Ukraine, including paying reparations for damage, deaths and injuries, received fewer “yes” votes — 93 and 94, respectively.

            Ukraine initially thought of having the General Assembly enshrine the 10-point peace plan that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced at the November summit of the Group of 20 major economies, U.N. diplomats said. But this idea was shelved in favor of the broader and less detailed resolution circulated Wednesday. 

            As one example, while the resolution to be voted on emphasizes the need to ensure accountability for the most serious crimes committed in Ukraine through “fair and independent investigations and prosecutions at the national or international level,” it does not include Zelenskyy’s call for a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes.

            The final draft resolution differs slightly from the original draft obtained Friday by The Associated Press.

            It adds a call “for a cessation of hostilities” and refers directly to “the full scale invasion of Ukraine” a year ago, reiterating the need to reach “a comprehensive, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine “as soon as possible” in line with the U.N. Charter. 

            The draft calls on U.N. member states and international organizations “to redouble support for diplomatic efforts” to achieve peace on those terms, and supports efforts by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and unnamed countries.

            The proposed resolution reiterates the General Assembly’s previous demand that Russia “immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces” from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders.

            It also deplores “the dire human rights and humanitarian consequences” of Russia’s aggression, including its repeated attacks on critical infrastructure with devastating consequences for civilians” and expresses “grave concern at the high number of civilian casualties.” It calls for an immediate halt to attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, residences, schools and hospitals.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The European Union on Wednesday circulated the resolution to be voted on by the U.N.

It got the highest vote of the five resolutions — 143-5 with 35 abstentions.Two other resolutions that suspended Russia from the U.N.’s Geneva-based Human Rights Council and called for Russia to be held accountable for violating international law by invading Ukraine, including paying reparations for damage, deaths and injuries, received fewer “yes” votes — 93 and 94, respectively.Ukraine initially thought of having the General Assembly enshrine the 10-point peace plan that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced at the November summit of the Group of 20 major economies, U.N. diplomats said. But this idea was shelved in favor of the broader and less detailed resolution circulated Wednesday.As one example, while the resolution to be voted on emphasizes the need to ensure accountability for the most serious crimes committed in Ukraine through “fair and independent investigations and prosecutions at the national or international level,” it does not include Zelenskyy’s call for a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes.The final draft resolution differs slightly from the original draft obtained Friday by The Associated Press.It adds a call “for a cessation of hostilities” and refers directly to “the full scale invasion of Ukraine” a year ago, reiterating the need to reach “a comprehensive, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine “as soon as possible” in line with the U.N. Charter.The draft calls on U.N. member states and international organizations “to redouble support for diplomatic efforts” to achieve peace on those terms, and supports efforts by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and unnamed countries.The proposed resolution reiterates the General Assembly’s previous demand that Russia “immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces” from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders.It also deplores “the dire human rights and humanitarian consequences” of Russia’s aggression, including its repeated attacks on critical infrastructure with devastating consequences for civilians” and expresses “grave concern at the high number of civilian casualties.” It calls for an immediate halt to attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, residences, schools and hospitals.",2023/02/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811749,"California and Nevada may ban forced prison labor, servitude","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Lawmakers in Nevada and California are advancing legislation to remove “involuntary servitude” from their states' constitutions, a move that follows four states' bans on forced labor that passed in ballot measures last fall.

            The goal of these proposals is to remove exceptions from the states' constitutions that allow forced labor as criminal punishment. The efforts come amid a growing push among some states to scrub outdated, century-old language from their state constitutions. Last fall, voters approved similar ballot measures in Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont.

            About a dozen states are pushing this year to get rid of the involuntary servitude exceptions, according to the Abolish Slavery National Network. Some advocates said this has major legal implications today, particularly in litigation related to prison labor pay and conditions. 











            It’s not uncommon for prisoners in California, Nevada and other states to be paid less than $1 an hour to fight fires, clean prison cells, make license plates or do yardwork at cemeteries.

            Samuel Brown, who was formerly incarcerated with a life sentence, helped author an anti-involuntary servitude amendment in California last year. He said incarcerated people can be forced to do work that is unsafe and puts their health at risk. Even more, he described how terrified he was when he had to disinfect jail cells after someone tested positive for COVID-19.

            Brown said the amendment that is being reintroduced this year is long overdue.

            “We have an opportunity to stamp it out once and for all. We’re not going to stop until we get it done,"" he said.

            The language allowing involuntary servitude that still exists in more than a dozen state constitutions is one of the lasting legacies of chattel slavery in the United States. Colorado became the first state in recent years to revise its constitution in 2018 to ban slavery and involuntary servitude, followed by Utah and Nebraska in 2020.

            Democrats in Congress have yet to pass federal legislation changing the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” If the latest attempt wins approval in Congress, the constitutional amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of U.S. states.

            In California, more than 40 supporters of the measure gathered Wednesday outside the state Capitol, where lawmakers and formerly incarcerated people talked about the impacts of forced labor.

            Assemblywoman Lori D. Wilson, a Democrat representing part of Solano County, is introducing this year's proposed amendment, hoping to have a different outcome than a failed attempt last year to pass similar legislation in the state. The Senate rejected it after Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration warned that if inmates were paid the $15-per-hour minimum wage, it could cost taxpayers $1.5 billion a year. 

            “Slavery is wrong in all its forms, and California, of all states, should be clear in denouncing that in its constitution,” said Wilson, who chairs the California Legislative Black Caucus. It wasn't until 1974 that the state Constitution was amended to read: “Slavery is prohibited. Involuntary servitude is prohibited except to punish crime.”

            If the proposed amendment passes in the California Legislature this year by a two-thirds vote, voters would decide in November 2024 whether to adopt it. Wilson said she hopes conversations she has had with lawmakers about the economic impact of this amendment will help it get passed this year in the Legislature.

            Meanwhile in Nevada, lawmakers voted unanimously Tuesday to move a measure that would change the state Constitution to ban slavery and involuntary servitude, which is prohibited “otherwise than in the punishment for crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.”

            That puts the measure one step closer to appearing on the 2024 ballot in Nevada, after it passed unanimously during the 2021 Legislature session. Ballot measures that go through the legislative process must pass Nevada's Legislature twice before going in front of voters. This would need a majority vote in the state Senate and Assembly to pass again.

            Democratic Assemblyman Howard Watts of Las Vegas, whose great-great-grandfather was born enslaved, is cosponsoring the legislation in the state.

            “I believe that it’s time for us to move forward and make it clear and unequivocal that nobody will ever live through the horror of state-sanctioned slavery, or servitude ever again,” Watts said.

            The ACLU of Nevada is considering litigation related to the pay and working conditions of incarcerated women at prison firefighting camps — and the measure could protect people from “harmful, deadly conditions without being forced to labor for our sake,” said Lilith Baran, the group's policy manager.

            “This is not just a feel-good bill,” Baran said. “This has actual real implications on people’s lives.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811755,Politician calls for review of geological survey in Taiwan after Turkey quake,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The catastrophic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have brought to the fore the importance of geological survey in Taiwan, which is also prone to seismic events.New Power Party (NPP) Chen Jiau-hua (陳椒華) on Tuesday (Feb. 14) questioned the wisdom of combining the country’s Central Geological Survey (CGS) and Bureau of Mines in a cabinet restructuring set out last year, per the Environmental Information Center.This could weaken the role of geological survey, which is essential to disaster prevention, she said in a press conference, adding the new agency appears to be more mining-oriented. A mining official explained that prospecting involves investigation of the geology and the two agencies’ combination makes work more streamlined.Sharing the same concern was Chen Wen-shan (陳文山), a professor at National Taiwan University’s Department of Geosciences. While not opposing the integration of the two institutions, he said geological research must take a more prominent place.According to Chen, mining in Taiwan is already a sunset industry centered on cement and gravel businesses. Geological survey, on the other hand, is vital to the country, in particular the effort to monitor and investigate the risks of quakes and landslides.Other core tasks of a geological survey authority should also include the exploration of sites for nuclear waste and carbon sequestration, as well as green energy development, for better land planning and disaster mitigation, he stressed.Addressing the concerns, Chi Chia-ling (紀佳伶) from the Ministry of Economic Affairs said the role of the CGS will not be diminished, nor will it be downgraded. The restructuring was intended to avoid overlapping of work, she added.",2023/02/16,605,Environment
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811756,Warren Buffett's Berkshire slashes TSMC holdings by 86%,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s holding company Berkshire Hathaway has slashed its holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) by 86.2% only three months after making a US$4.1 billion (US$124 billion) investment in the company.Following the announcement, shares in TSMC fell 6% on Wednesday (Feb. 15), though overall they remain up about 23% for the year. Hathaway’s share dump follows Tiger Global Management, GQG Partners and Capital Group, BlackRock Inc, as well as JPMorgan & Chase all making significant reductions in their TSMC holdings, according to reports.The 2023 export outlook for Taiwan may have contributed to the selloff. Weak U.S. and Chinese demand for Taiwan’s exports, and low consumer confidence are all expected to impact the Taiwan’s economic performance over the remainder of 2023.The move has taken some investors by surprise, as Buffett is famously a “long term” investor, though one Taiwanese economist said the move has been misunderstood. Director of President Capital Management (統一投顧) Li Fang-kuo (黎方國) said that although it is widely believed that Buffett is a long-term investor, more than one third of his holdings will be sold off every quarter or two.Despite TSMC’s own prediction that sales will drop this quarter, it is continuing with construction of multiple fabs in the U.S. and Japan, while it also increased investment to US$40 billion for its Arizona operations in December, with a further US$3.5 billion capital injection approved by the TSMC board on Tuesday (Feb. 14).TSMC is planning to have the first Phoenix facility (4nm) ready for commercial production in 2024, while it has also begun construction of a second 3nm fab which is slated to be finished in 2026.Buffett’s mass withdrawal and the 2023 economic outlook aside, long term growth prospects for TSMC and the global semiconductor industry remain healthy, with some predicting an over 12% increase in the market by 2029. In the medium term, an increase in economic activity in China, a reduction in global inflation levels, and increased consumer confidence in key markets are likely to have a positive impact.",2023/02/16,2026,Business

            El Paso police said hours after the gunfire that two people had been taken into custody, though details of what led the shooting remained unclear.

            Interim police chief Peter Pacillas said that Cielo Vista Mall was still considered a crime scene, and that it would remain locked down until authorities had completed their investigation.











            Pacillas stressed that the danger had passed.

            “There is no more danger. I want to repeat that: There is no more danger to the public,” Pacillas said.

            The shooting happened in a busy shopping area and across a large parking lot from a Walmart where 23 people were killed in a racist attack targeting Hispanic people in 2019. El Paso — with a largely Latino population of about 700,000 people — sits on the U.S. border with Mexico, where residents of both countries cross frequently.

            “Today’s shooting at the Cielo Vista Mall has brought back traumatic memories for many of us. Please know you are not alone,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, whose district includes El Paso, said on Twitter.

            She urged anyone who needed it to reach out to the city's crisis help line.

            The United States has seen dozens of people killed in mass shootings so far in 2023, most recently Monday at Michigan State University, where three students were killed and five more were wounded. In January, 11 people were killed in the Los Angeles-area city of Monterey Park as they welcomed the Lunar New Year at a dance hall popular with older Asian Americans.

            Pacillas said the two people taken into custody after Wednesday's shooting as well as all of the victims were males.

            University Medical Center in El Paso said in a statement that two gunshot victims being treated there were in critical condition.

            The condition of the third victim was not immediately known.

            Police earlier said the shooting was reported in the shopping mall’s food court.

            Authorities set up a reunification center at a nearby high school, where those affected by the shooting could reconnect with loved ones.

            The FBI, which is assisting El Paso police in the investigation, set up a website where the public can share photos or video from the shooting: www.fbi.gov/cielovistamallshooting.

            Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said in a tweet Wednesday night that he had spoken to the mayor of El Paso and offered assistance from the Texas Department of Public and Safety and the Texas Division of Emergency Management.

            In 2022, more than 600 mass shootings occurred in the U.S. in which at least four people were killed or wounded, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811761,Oakland fires police chief for alleged misconduct cover-up,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Oakland Police Department lost its seventh head of police in as many years Wednesday over the alleged cover-up of an officer’s misconduct in a scandal that threatens to extend two decades of federal oversight — the longest of any police department in the country.

            Democratic Mayor Sheng Thao said at a news conference she was firing Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong after a probe concluded the chief and the department failed to properly investigate and discipline a sergeant who was involved in a hit-and-run with his patrol car and, in a separate incident, fired his service weapon inside an elevator at police headquarters.

            Thao, who took office in January, said she wants to be confident the police chief in the city of 400,000 people will be effective “in making improvements that can be recognized by the federal monitor, the federal court and the people of Oakland.”











            “I am no longer confident that Chief Armstrong can do the work needed to achieve the vision so, today I have decided to separate Chief LeRonne Armstrong from the city without cause,” she said.

            Thao placed Armstrong on paid administrative leave last month to review investigations by the department’s federal monitor that found the police chief responsible for gross dereliction of duty.

            The probes by the law firm of Clarence Dyer and Cohen concluded Armstrong failed to investigate and discipline Sgt. Michael Chung after he was involved in a hit-and-run with a parked car in 2021 at his apartment building in San Francisco, according to a report first obtained by KTVU-TV and made public by Oaklandside, a local news site.

            The Oakland Police Department made national news in 2000 after a rookie officer came forward to report abuse of power by a group of officers known as the Oakland “Riders.” The four officers were charged with making false arrests, planting evidence, using excessive force, falsifying police reports and assaulting people in west Oakland, a predominantly Black area. Three of the officers were acquitted after two separate juries deadlocked on most of the charges. The fourth officer is a fugitive and is believed to have fled the country.

            The case resulted in the department coming under federal oversight in 2003 and being required to enact 52 reform measures and report its progress to an outside monitor and a federal judge.

            Armstrong, a native of Oakland, was appointed in 2021 with promises of enacting all the reforms within a year.

            He said he was deeply disappointed in Thao's decision and that once all the facts are evaluated, it will be clear he committed no misconduct and his terminations was “wrong, unjustified, and unfair.”

            “After the relevant facts are fully evaluated by weighing evidence instead of pulling soundbites from strategically leaked, inaccurate reports, it will be clear I was a loyal and effective reformer of the Oakland Police Department,” he said in a statement.

            In its report, the law firm said a police captain in the department’s Internal Affairs Division downplayed the hit-and-run incident and coached the investigating officer to draft a report that allowed Chung to escape discipline.

            The following year, Chung fired his service weapon inside an elevator at police headquarters, got rid of evidence and did not inform his supervisors until a week later. He has been on paid administrative leave since then.

            “Sgt. Chung escaped serious disciple and was left to commit even more egregious conduct — discharging his firearm in an elevator — which he also failed to report and tried to cover up,” the investigators said.

            The law firm report concluded Armstrong failed to hold his subordinate officers accountable.

            Federal Judge William Orrick last year put the agency on a one-year probationary period that was set to end by June and finally free it from federal oversight, saying the department had achieved “substantial compliance.” But last month, he made public a portion of the law firm reports, prompting the mayor to place Armstrong on paid leave.

            “The report … demonstrates that the significant cultural problems within the department remain unaddressed,” he said during a virtual hearing in January.

            Orrick ordered the city to present a plan by April 4 on how it plans to come into compliance.

            Armstrong, the 13th person to head the embattled police department in 20 years, received the backing of some of the city’s Black leaders, including John Burris, one of two attorneys who in 2000 filed the lawsuit against the police department on behalf of 119 plaintiffs.

            Burris said he was disappointed that Thao based her decision on what he considers to be ""not very strong evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Armstrong.”

            Burris, who has been meeting on a regular basis with the police department and federal monitor for the last 20 years, said the police department has made great strides and positive changes on how it deals with the community, which largely supported Armstrong.

            “We don’t have the beating that we used to have. We don’t have people being stopped because of their race at the same level we had before. We don’t have the shooting and the use of deadly force that we had before. We don’t have the mistreatment of the mentally impaired in the same way we did,” Burris said.

            “But this is a (police) culture question and the disappointing part is it hasn't changed,” he added.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Oakland Police Department lost its seventh head of police in as many years Wednesday over the alleged cover-up of an officer’s misconduct in a scandal that threatens to extend two decades of federal oversight — the longest of any police department in the country.Democratic Mayor Sheng Thao said at a news conference she was firing Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong after a probe concluded the chief and the department failed to properly investigate and discipline a sergeant who was involved in a hit-and-run with his patrol car and, in a separate incident, fired his service weapon inside an elevator at police headquarters.Thao, who took office in January, said she wants to be confident the police chief in the city of 400,000 people will be effective “in making improvements that can be recognized by the federal monitor, the federal court and the people of Oakland.”“I am no longer confident that Chief Armstrong can do the work needed to achieve the vision so, today I have decided to separate Chief LeRonne Armstrong from the city without cause,” she said.Thao placed Armstrong on paid administrative leave last month to review investigations by the department’s federal monitor that found the police chief responsible for gross dereliction of duty.The probes by the law firm of Clarence Dyer and Cohen concluded Armstrong failed to investigate and discipline Sgt.

Chung escaped serious disciple and was left to commit even more egregious conduct — discharging his firearm in an elevator — which he also failed to report and tried to cover up,” the investigators said.The law firm report concluded Armstrong failed to hold his subordinate officers accountable.Federal Judge William Orrick last year put the agency on a one-year probationary period that was set to end by June and finally free it from federal oversight, saying the department had achieved “substantial compliance.” But last month, he made public a portion of the law firm reports, prompting the mayor to place Armstrong on paid leave.“The report … demonstrates that the significant cultural problems within the department remain unaddressed,” he said during a virtual hearing in January.Orrick ordered the city to present a plan by April 4 on how it plans to come into compliance.Armstrong, the 13th person to head the embattled police department in 20 years, received the backing of some of the city’s Black leaders, including John Burris, one of two attorneys who in 2000 filed the lawsuit against the police department on behalf of 119 plaintiffs.Burris said he was disappointed that Thao based her decision on what he considers to be ""not very strong evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Armstrong.”Burris, who has been meeting on a regular basis with the police department and federal monitor for the last 20 years, said the police department has made great strides and positive changes on how it deals with the community, which largely supported Armstrong.“We don’t have the beating that we used to have. We don’t have people being stopped because of their race at the same level we had before. We don’t have the shooting and the use of deadly force that we had before. We don’t have the mistreatment of the mentally impaired in the same way we did,” Burris said.“But this is a (police) culture question and the disappointing part is it hasn't changed,” he added.",2023/02/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811762,England dominates opening day of test series in New Zealand,"MOUNT MAUNGANUI, New Zealand (AP) — Dramatic lightning flashes around Bay Oval echoed lightning innings by Ben Duckett and Harry Brook which allowed England to declare at 325-9 with time to spare Thursday on the first day of the first, day-night cricket test against New Zealand.

            While thick black thunderclouds sometimes glowered over the ground, no rain fell England while was driven along at more than 5.5 runs per over by the propulsive innings of Duckett, who made 84 from 68 balls in the first session, and Brook, who posted 89 from 80 balls.

            The declaration after only 58.2 overs and with 85 minutes left in the day gave the bowlers time to fortify England’s position and they did so with the wickets of Tom Latham, Kane Williamson (6) and Henry Nicholls (4). Devon Conway (19) held on to stumps when New Zealand was 37-3.











            James Anderson took 2-10 from seven overs in an outstanding spell in the late evening which drove home England's advantage. 

            If England’s new approach under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum still needed validation after nine wins in their last 10 tests it received it in the manner England approached the first day after losing the toss and being sent in.

            Far from being daunted on a pitch which showed signs of green and against a pink ball which swung at first, Duckett and England went on the offensive and New Zealand, after a fleeting early success, had to battle to stay in the match.

            Duckett had his fifth half century in eight tests from 36 balls and before the first hour was up. He put on 99 runs for England’s second wicket in only 90 minutes with Ollie Pope and was out 15 minutes before the first break at which England already was 134-2.

            “Personally I pride myself on hundreds,” Duckett said. ""I was very disappointed when I got out, I had a chance to get a big score but I would have taken 80 at the start of the day.

            “I didn't go out there with any intention to score quickly and it just happened.” 

            New Zealand had two fast bowlers on debut — Blair Tickner and Scott Kuggeleijn — and both struggled under Duckett’s early assault which included 14 fours. Tickner, who had given up four boundaries in one over to the belligerent batting of the opener, had the small consolation of capturing his wicket with a short ball which Duckett mistimed to cover.

            New Zealand’s hopes rose a little when they dismissed Pope and Joe Root in the space of four balls and suddenly England was 154-4. Pope fell to a conventional catch at second slip but Root was perhaps a little too aggressive and caught at mid-wicket to give Kuggeleijn his first test wicket.

            Then Brooks took over and sped towards what might have been his fourth century in five tests. He needed only 43 balls for a half century which included 10 fours and left the New Zealand attack dazed and bereft of ideas.

            While Duckett played a broad variety of shots, most of Brooks’ runs came on the off side in a wide arc between third man and mid-off. He only began to be limited in his scoring when Neil Wagner, who had shared the new ball with Tim Southee for the first time, abandoned orthodoxy and tested him with a barrage of short-pitched balls, one of which took him on the helmet.

            His flow was broken and soon after he dragged a short ball from Wagner onto his stumps after an innings of only 81 balls which included 15 fours and a six. The England tail went all out in pursuit of quick runs and after Brook, three wickets were lost for 27 runs amid an array or reckless shots.

            Wagner was the best of the New Zealand bowlers with 4-82 from 16.2 overs.

            England’s bowlers charged in as the floodlights kept at bay the darkness of gathering clouds and the New Zealand top order foundered.

            Ollie Robinson struck with only his third ball to remove Latham, who edged the ball from his thigh pad to Pope at short leg, but Zac Crawley at second slip dropped Conway off James Anderson.

            Anderson then had Williamson lbw with an appeal first rejected by umpire Aleem Dar but upheld on review. Crawley caught Henry Nicholls off Anderson to leave New Zealand only hanging on at the end.

            It's the last game for the Mavericks before the All-Star break.

            Mavericks coach Jason Kidd didn't elaborate pregame what happened with Irving, only saying that, “It happens. Could have been from a fall in that game the other night.” Kidd thought Irving would participate in the All-Star Game this weekend in Salt Lake City.











            The Mavericks acquired Irving as part of a trade with Brooklyn on Feb. 6. Irving averaged 28.3 points in his first four games with the Mavericks.

            He and Luka Doncic have taken the floor twice together since the trade and have dropped both games. 

            In addition to Irving, the Mavericks were without forward Davis Bertans (calf), guard Tim Hardaway Jr. (hamstring) and forward/center Maxi Kleber (hamstring) against Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets.

            Denver guard Jamal Murray was ruled by coach Michael Malone out due to inflammation in his right knee.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811788,AP source: FBI searched U. of Delaware in Biden docs probe,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI searched the University of Delaware in recent weeks for classified documents as part of its investigation into the potential mishandling of sensitive government records by President Joe Biden.

            The search, first reported by CNN, was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The person would not say whether anything was found.

            A Justice Department special counsel is investigating how classified documents from Biden's time as vice president and senator came to wind up in his home and former office — and whether any mishandling involved criminal intent or was unintentional. Biden's personal lawyers disclosed in January that a small batch of documents with classified markings had been found weeks earlier in his former Washington office, and they have since allowed FBI searches of multiple properties.











            The university is Biden's alma mater. In 2011, Biden donated his records from his 36 years serving in the U.S. Senate to the school. The documents arrived June 6, 2012, according to the university, which released photos of the numbered boxes being unloaded at the university alongside blue and gold balloons. 

            Under the terms of Biden’s gift, the records are to remain sealed until two years after he retires from public life.

            Biden’s Senate records would not be covered by the presidential records act, though prohibitions on mishandling classified information would still apply.

            The White House referred questions to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. The University of Delaware also referred questions to the Justice Department.

            The university is the fourth known entity to be searched by the FBI following inspections of his former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, where records with classified markings were initially found in a locked closet by Biden's personal lawyers in November, and more recently of his Delaware homes in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach. 

            Those searches were all done voluntarily and with the consent of Biden's legal team.

            The FBI took six items that contained documents with classified markings during its January search of the Wilmington home, Biden's personal lawyer has said. Agents did not find classified documents at the Rehoboth Beach property but did take some handwritten notes and other materials relating to Biden’s time as vice president for review.

            The Justice Department is separately investigating the retention by former President Donald Trump of roughly 300 documents marked as classified at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. The FBI served a search warrant at the home last August after months of resistance by Trump and his representatives to returning the documents to the government.

            
                The FBI also searched the Indiana home of former Vice President Mike Pence last week after his lawyers came forward to say they had found a small number of documents with classified markings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811789,UN votes unanimously to extend sanctions on Yemen's Houthis,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to extend the arms embargo on Yemen’s Houthi rebels and an asset freeze and travel ban on Houthi leaders and top officials until Nov. 15.

            The British-drafted resolution also extends the mandate of the U.N. panel of experts monitoring the sanctions until Dec. 15.

            In February 2022, the Security Council expanded an arms embargo on Houthi leaders to include all Houthis, saying they have threatened the peace, security and stability of the war-torn country.











            After Wednesday's vote, the council met behind closed doors to hear briefings by Hans Grundberg, the U.N. special envoy for Yemen, and Joyce Msuya, the assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs.

            Yemen, the Arab world’s most impoverished country with a population of 26 million, plunged into civil war in 2014 after the Iranian-backed Houthis took over the capital of Sanaa. The internationally recognized government fled and sought support from neighboring Gulf countries.

            In March 2015, a Saudi-led military coalition began what turned into a devastating war to restore the government that has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced 2 million and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. The war has deteriorated largely into a stalemate.

            A U.N.-backed truce took effect last April and raised hopes for a longer pause in fighting, but it ended Oct. 2 after just six months.

            Grundberg told the council in January that despite the end of the truce, “the overall military situation in Yemen has remained stable.” He said he was encouraged by intensified regional and international diplomatic activity to end the country’s eight-year conflict, and he reportedly followed up on those efforts during Wednesday’s closed council meeting.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N.

            Florida’s leading scorer, Colin Castleton, broke his right hand with 15:05 left in the second half and likely will miss the rest of the season. Castleton had been averaging 24.8 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.0 blocks over his last four games.

            Castleton's teammates responded by shooting 59% from the field, including 10 of 17 from 3-point range. Will Richard put Florida ahead by double digits for good with 11:54 left at the start of an 8-0 run for a 62-46 lead.











            Richard and Kowacie Reeves each had 13 points for Florida (14-12, 7-6 SEC). Reeves scored in double figures for the second straight game after a four-game stretch with 13 combined points. Jones had been struggling with his shot, going scoreless in his last two games and averaging just three points on 5-of-20 shooting over his last four games. 

            Florida made its final nine shots of the first half and led 39-29 at the break after shooting 67%, including 5 of 8 from 3-point range. Mississippi made just one of its last nine shots before halftime.

            Matthew Murrell scored 15 points and Jaemyn Brakefield added 14 for Mississippi (10-16, 2-11).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811791,"Users Turn to Diverse Pool of Apps as Post-Pandemic Work Styles Emerge, Okta Study Finds","Security software and cloud platforms clock fast growth in Asia-Pacific as hybrid work becomes mainstream 

SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 16 February 2023 - Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ: OKTA), one of the leading independent Identity providers, today announced the findings of its ninth annual  Businesses at Work report, which reveals that business users have been turning to a wide range of apps as post-pandemic travel and workstyles evolved in the past year. In APAC specifically, the apps clocking the fastest growth by unique users are security apps, electronic signature apps and cloud platforms.   The yearly report offers a holistic look into how organizations and people work today, showcasing the applications and services that modern workforces use to be productive.   ""As economies opened up in the past year, businesses and their users turned to a wide range of apps to get work done, from travel apps to book business trips to security tools to shore up cyber defenses,"" said Ben Goodman, Okta's Senior Vice President and General Manager for Asia Pacific. ""This is a reflection of the new work environments that have emerged, along with the needs of a hybrid work arrangement that is here to stay.""   Most popular app categories   All statistics mentioned henceforth are taken from Okta's Businesses at Work 2023 report.       Travel apps were among the hottest categories globally in 2022, as business trips resumed with the lifting of pandemic restrictions in many destinations. According to the report, these apps enjoyed a 43% year-on-year (YoY) growth by number of customers and 197% growth by unique users across all industries.         At the same time,      business supplies — a category that was not in the top 10 in last year's report — showed tremendous YoY growth worldwide, with a 35% increase in customers and a 77% increase in unique users.     Design software continues to rise as it became the third fastest-growing category worldwide this year with 31% YoY growth by number of customers, after chart-topping 39% YoY growth last year globally. In Asia-Pacific, design software is big as well, with Australia seeing a 27% bounce in YoY customer growth.     Asia-Pacific is driving significant growth in security as well. In the region, the use of security tools increased 85% YoY by unique users, while the use of electronic signature tools and developer tools by unique users increased 61% and 55% YoY, respectively. Cloud platforms grew among unique users by 50% YoY, while use of analytics tools increased among unique users by 47% YoY.      The hottest apps:         In APAC,      Microsoft 365 is the most popular app by number of users.      Amazon Web Services ranks second, and      Google Workspace comes in third.         The APAC region is heavily focused on      security and developer tools this year. Jamf Pro, Netskope, LastPass, and ZScaler battled for supremacy in the security category: Jamf Pro posted 57% YoY customer growth and 118% YoY growth in unique users.         Globally this year, the fastest growing apps feature a diverse cast, providing expertise in security, communication, corporate travel, HR, cloud-app development, and collaboration.         Top among the      fastest growing apps globally is Kandji, an Apple mobile device management tool, which posted 172% YoY growth by number of customers. Kandji, an Okta Ventures portfolio company, enables IT administrators to automate repetitive tasks and introduce new features to the device management space.      Growth in multi-cloud usage   Transformation efforts that accelerated during the pandemic have helped businesses get the boost they need for more efficient hybrid workforce support, more reliable security, and more seamless global collaboration.   In this regard, the growth in multi-cloud adoption that has been clear since 2017 shows no sign of slowing down, and the favorite pairing of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) continues to grow.         While      AWS remains dominant as both a single-cloud platform and as part of many organizations' multi-cloud strategies, there is also exciting growth from other providers on the horizon.     Google Cloud Platform is growing at an impressive clip, with a 40% YoY increase in number of customers and 60% increase in unique users.     Microsoft Azure grew its worldwide customer base by 10% YoY and its unique users by 16% YoY.      Apps for our lives   The line between work and personal life is blurrier than ever, so are apps that offer combined corporate and personal usage.     Digital payment gateway Paypal and newcomers Venmo and Stripe are finding strong footing in top finance and banking apps.         For      health and wellness, FitBit is tops by number of customers globally. Interestingly, the two fastest growing apps in this category by number of customers — LiveWell (up 32% YoY by number of customers) and Modern Health (up 30% YoY by number of customers) — focus on mental health.         In the world of      social media, LinkedIn holds the top spot, while TeamSnap is the fastest growing by number of customers.      Security at work   Remote and hybrid workforces are here to stay, so protecting network access from the home office and places such as a coffee shop is a top priority for many companies. Businesses are stepping up higher-assurance factors in their MFA deployments as they move away from perimeter defenses that are no longer adequate for dynamic, cloud-driven environments.         Okta's study has found that      low-assurance security questions globally are experiencing the slowest growth across the board (3% YoY by number of customers), while      high-assurance security keys/biometrics (including WebAuthentication) are growing more quickly -- 46% YoY growth by number of customers, and a chart-topping 211% by unique users.         Okta customers are approaching      Zero Trust strategically, with solutions that target user, device, and network perspectives.               In the          network context, we're seeing a 147% increase in the use of risk-based policies over the past two years.                 From a          user context, we're seeing 60% growth in the number of customers implementing WebAuthn, a new global standard for password-free web authentication.                 And on the          device front, we're seeing a 21% increase in the number of customers deploying device-trust configurations.            ""The Businesses at Work report delivers unique insights into the ways businesses have used apps to adapt to the new workstyle dynamics in the post-pandemic era,"" said Goodman. ""In this new normal, it will be crucial to ensure these apps are resilient, so they can be accessed reliably and securely to drive business goals over the long term.""   The Businesses at Work 2023 report is based on anonymized data from Okta's more than 17,000 global customers and the Okta Integration Network, which includes over 7,000 integrations with cloud, mobile, web apps, and IT infrastructure providers. It tells a complex story of the growing and changing world of app usage. The study included key Asia Pacific markets like Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, China, India, ANZ, South Korea, Philippines, Malaysia and several other countries in Southeast Asia and IndoChina.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811808,Mexico claims largest synthetic drug lab bust to date,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican soldiers seized more than a half million fentanyl pills in a raid on what the army's announcement Wednesday called the largest synthetic drug lab found to date. 

            The army said the outdoor lab was discovered in Culiacan, the capital of the northern state of Sinaloa. Sinaloa is home to the drug cartel of the same name. 

            Soldiers raided the lab Tuesday and found almost 630,000 pills that appear to contain the synthetic opioid fentanyl. They also reported seizing 282 pounds (128 kilograms) of powdered fentanyl and about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) of suspected methamphetamines.











            “This is the highest-capacity synthetic drug production lab on record during this administration,” the army said in a statement. 

            Mexican drug cartels produce the opioid from precursor chemicals shipped from China, and then press it into pills counterfeited to look like Xanax, Percocet or Oxycodone. People often take the pills without knowing they contain fentanyl and can suffer deadly overdoses.

            The bust came on the same day that the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on the the huge number of U.S. fentanyl overdoses that occur annually, currently around 70,000.

            The committee's chair, Sen. Bob Menendez , a Democrat from New Jersey, called on Mexico to do more.

            “This means asking Mexico to do more to disrupt the criminal organizations from producing and trafficking fentanyl, although a politicized judiciary and incidents of Mexican security forces colluding with drug cartels will make that difficult,” he said.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican soldiers seized more than a half million fentanyl pills in a raid on what the army's announcement Wednesday called the largest synthetic drug lab found to date.The army said the outdoor lab was discovered in Culiacan, the capital of the northern state of Sinaloa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811809,Colorado considers allowing local rent control amid crisis,"DENVER (AP) — In a vast hall at Colorado's Capitol building on Wednesday, Mary Bashor’s voice quavered as she described the terror she felt of possibly being pushed from her home of 28 years due to rent increases.

            “My greatest fear is that I will have to leave my home I love, which is filled with memories of my deceased daughter and family. That would kill me,” Bashor said through Zoom during a committee meeting on a bill addressing rent control. 

            After Colorado's housing prices ratcheted up to crisis levels, Democratic lawmakers are considering a drastic measure: repealing the state's 1981 ban on rent control and allowing local towns and counties to pass their own caps on rents. 











            If approved, Colorado would join a group of states, including California and New York, that have some level of statewide or local rent control. While the bill would not install statewide rent control, the goal is to give communities the power to dampen rent increases after the state’s median home price rose by 40% — nearing $600,000 — since the beginning of 2020, according to the rental platform Zillow.

            Even though Democrats hold majorities in both state chambers in Colorado, the legislation faces an uphill battle. 

            Critics argue that rent control dissuades developers from building more units, strangling housing supply and driving up rent in adjacent neighborhoods.

            “We understand why these policies look attractive,” said Ted Leighty, CEO of the Colorado Association of Home Builders, in the committee hearing. “But this policy is a false idol. We need more supply. Period.”

            Even Colorado's Democratic governor, Jared Polis, has opposed similar measures in the past and could veto the bill if it gets passed in both the House and Senate.

            “Governor Polis is skeptical that rent control will create more housing stock, and locations with these policies often have the unintended consequences of higher rent,” his spokesperson Katherine Jones said in a statement. 

            The legislation could be amended or watered down to appease the governor as it works its way through the legislature.

            The bill is one of several housing affordability measures the state’s Democratic-controlled Legislature is considering this year, including opening up state-owned land for affordable housing developments.

            “Almost every issue we debate here in the Legislature comes back to housing because it’s the most basic of human needs,” said Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Democrat and one of the bill's sponsors, during the committee hearing on her rent control bill.

            In the Senate, the bill only has one sponsor and might find a cooler welcome than in the House. 

            “I don’t think anyone thinks this policy is the only solution; I think it’s a way to provide relief,” said Democratic Senate President Steve Fenberg, adding, “I think it’ll be a good discussion.” 

            Construction worker Jimmy Velasco, who lives in Fort Collins, a city north of Denver, testified at the hearing that 60% of his salary went toward keeping a roof over his wife's and three kids' heads. 

            As their rent rose with lease renewals, his wife started cleaning to bring in an extra paycheck — money that ended up going to pay childcare while both parents worked during the day.

            After turning to foodbanks and local churches for support, Velasco and his family decided to move. 

            “We had to think if we wanted to eat or have a place to live,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811811,"Clark, Czinano lead No. 7 Iowa over Wisconsin, 91-61","IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Caitlin Clark scored 24 points and Monika Czinano had 19 as No. 7 Iowa defeated Wisconsin 91-61 on Wednesday night.

            McKenna Warnock added 16 points for the Hawkeyes (21-5, 13-2 Big Ten), who beat the Badgers (8-19, 3-12) for the 27th consecutive time. Iowa, which is in second place in the Big Ten, won for the 10th time in 11 games and moved within one game of conference leader Indiana.

            The Hawkeyes, who lost to Indiana 87-78 on Feb. 9 to fall out of the conference lead, have been dominant since. They beat Rutgers 111-57 on Sunday.











            Now they play their next two games on the road — at Nebraska on Saturday and at No. 8 Maryland on Tuesday — before hosting Indiana in the regular-season finale on Feb. 26.

            “We're not really worried about that right now,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said of the upcoming schedule. “We control our own destiny right now. We're worried about the Cornhuskers now, and then the game after that.”

            The Hawkeyes, who lead the nation in scoring at 88.5 points per game, shot 64.3% from the field, taking advantage of the Badgers shadowing Clark on the perimeter. Iowa had 48 points in the paint, and the Hawkeyes had 27 assists against 14 turnovers.

            “They started doubling the post,” Bluder said. “I thought we did some really good things adjusting to that and really take advantage of the double-teams. And that's what you have to do when somebody does something like that.”

            “Our rotations weren't quick enough,” Wisconsin coach Marisa Moseley said. “You have to pick your poison when you're facing a really good team.”

            Clark was 9 of 12 from the field, including 4 of 7 on 3-pointers. She had eight assists and five rebounds while playing just 29 minutes as the Hawkeyes went deep into their bench in the fourth quarter.

            “She had eight assists and three turnovers,” Bluder said. “That's really good basketball.”

            Clark, a junior, became the first Big Ten women's player to reach the top 10 all-time in the conference in scoring and assists.

            “It's probably something I wouldn't have known,” Clark said. “I think when I'm able to score, get assists and get rebounds, I put my team in a good position to win.”

            Czinano, who was the nation’s leader in field-goal percentage the last two seasons and ranks third this season, was 8 of 11 from the field. She added six rebounds.

            Iowa had a 14-0 run in the first quarter to erase an early Wisconsin lead. The Hawkeyes led 48-28 at halftime, and their biggest lead was 86-53 in the fourth quarter.

            “Once they were able to settle in and get into their transition game, that's the name of the game for them,” Moseley said. “Caitlin is just masterful with her court vision, and you can't give them momentum like we did. And I think that's where they broke it open in the first quarter on us.""

            Julie Pospisilova led Wisconsin with 16 points. Maty Wilke had 10.

            BIG PICTURE

            Wisconsin: The Badgers have their youngest roster in 16 seasons, and it's showed this season. “It's a huge, huge learning process,” Moseley said. “These types of games are ones they remember, and there are lessons they have to go through.”

            Iowa: The Hawkeyes kept pace with Indiana, which hosts Michigan on Thursday. Iowa topped the 90-point mark for the fourth time in its last five games and used its reserves for most of the fourth quarter. “As somebody who's on the court, it's nice to watch them from their seat on the bench,” Clark said. “It brings a lot of joy as a teammate.”

Iowa, which is in second place in the Big Ten, won for the 10th time in 11 games and moved within one game of conference leader Indiana.The Hawkeyes, who lost to Indiana 87-78 on Feb. 9 to fall out of the conference lead, have been dominant since. They beat Rutgers 111-57 on Sunday.Now they play their next two games on the road — at Nebraska on Saturday and at No. 8 Maryland on Tuesday — before hosting Indiana in the regular-season finale on Feb. 26.“We're not really worried about that right now,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said of the upcoming schedule. “We control our own destiny right now. We're worried about the Cornhuskers now, and then the game after that.”The Hawkeyes, who lead the nation in scoring at 88.5 points per game, shot 64.3% from the field, taking advantage of the Badgers shadowing Clark on the perimeter. Iowa had 48 points in the paint, and the Hawkeyes had 27 assists against 14 turnovers.“They started doubling the post,” Bluder said. “I thought we did some really good things adjusting to that and really take advantage of the double-teams. And that's what you have to do when somebody does something like that.”“Our rotations weren't quick enough,” Wisconsin coach Marisa Moseley said. “You have to pick your poison when you're facing a really good team.”Clark was 9 of 12 from the field, including 4 of 7 on 3-pointers. She had eight assists and five rebounds while playing just 29 minutes as the Hawkeyes went deep into their bench in the fourth quarter.“She had eight assists and three turnovers,” Bluder said. “That's really good basketball.”Clark, a junior, became the first Big Ten women's player to reach the top 10 all-time in the conference in scoring and assists.“It's probably something I wouldn't have known,” Clark said. “I think when I'm able to score, get assists and get rebounds, I put my team in a good position to win.”Czinano, who was the nation’s leader in field-goal percentage the last two seasons and ranks third this season, was 8 of 11 from the field. She added six rebounds.Iowa had a 14-0 run in the first quarter to erase an early Wisconsin lead. The Hawkeyes led 48-28 at halftime, and their biggest lead was 86-53 in the fourth quarter.“Once they were able to settle in and get into their transition game, that's the name of the game for them,” Moseley said. “Caitlin is just masterful with her court vision, and you can't give them momentum like we did. And I think that's where they broke it open in the first quarter on us.""Julie Pospisilova led Wisconsin with 16 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811830,3 Taiwan Coast Guard members arrested in bribery case,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Four people, including three members of the Coast Guard, have been arrested in the fishing port of Keelung in connection with a smuggling case that saw Coast Guard officers allegedly receiving bribes to allow illegal exports of fish to China.According to the Liberty Times, three of the arrested were members of the Keelung Coast Guard’s Badouzi Fishing Port Security Checkpoint, and the other, surnamed Huang (黃), allegedly paid the bribes and led the smuggling efforts.The 25-year-old Coast Guard Lieutenant Captain Chen Fuxiang (陳富翔) received the bribes, allowing fishing boats to illegally leave the port for NT$200,000 (USS$6,620) per trip. The lieutenant captain then distributed the bribes to other members of his unit, two sergeants named Tang (湯) and Chen (陳).Lieutenant Chen had recently been transferred to Keelung from Tainan, and formed a three-person team with Tang and Chen who were responsible for the inspection of fishing boats entering and exiting Keelung’s Badouzi fishing port.According to reports, Chen asked publicly if there were any boats in need of help with smuggling, alerting the Judicial Team of the Coast Guard’s Second Shore Patrol, who launched a joint investigation.According to the investigation, Chen and his unit took bribes from at least two boats and helped them to cover up their smuggling activities. The investigation also led to the arrest of Huang, who was found with NT$800,000 in cash when arrested, though he denied any connection to smuggling.According to reports, Huang has been operating out of Badouzi port for some time. He would allegedly smuggle the illegal goods to the middle of the Taiwan Strait where they would be sold to Chinese boats.In recent years, China has banned the import of many Taiwan seafood products including Taiwanese grouper, beltfish, and others, providing opportunities for smugglers.",2023/02/16,1764,Society

Top Chinese official Wang Yi is set to attend the conference.Tensions have risen between the US and China after Washington said it had shot down a Chinese balloon it claimed was used for espionage earlier this month. Blinken canceled a visit to Beijing over the dispute.After Munich, Blinken will travel to Turkey, where he will visit the Incirlik Air Base to look at relief and recovery operations for victims of last week's earthquake. He will then go onward to Ankara for expected talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other officials.Washington is seeking to unblock Ankara's objections to Finland and Sweden joining NATO, as the military alliance requires a unanimous vote to take on new members. Another issue of contention is Turkey's intention to purchase advanced US fighter jets, which has been opposed by some US lawmakers on human rights grounds.Blinken will end his trip in Athens, where he will discuss tensions between Greece and Turkey, defense cooperation and energy security in the eastern Mediterranean.sdi/rt (dpa, AP)",2023/02/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811832,Are Ukraine and its allies running out of ammunition?,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had sounded the alarm ahead of this week's meeting of defense ministers, saying that the Ukrainian army was consuming significantly more ammunition than could be produced in the West.""The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production. This puts our defense industries under strain,"" he said, adding that  the alliance needed ""to ramp up production.""Frank Sauer, a security expert at Universität der Bundeswehr München (University of the Bundeswehr in Munich), told DW that he also thought the shortage of ammunition was the ""fundamental problem"" at the moment — much more than the much-debated air defense systems and tanks.Increasing production capacity is of the utmost importance, agreed Nico Lange, a military expert from the Munich Security Conference and former chief of staff at the German Defense Ministry.""From my point of view, [the ammunition shortage] is more important than any symbolic discussion,"" he told DW, explaining that this was related to Russia's military strategy. Russia's attack tactic — ""frontal attacks on the front line in many sections — can only be successful if Ukraine runs out of ammunition,"" he argued, adding that this should be avoided at all costs with Western support.Ukrainian commanders are being forced to make ""very tough decisions"" on the use of ammunition said DW correspondent Nick Connolly. ""I've met commanders of howitzers, of artillery pieces, who've told me that they don't know how long they can keep doing their job, if they will be forced to withdraw and move away from positions and wait for more artillery,"" Connolly said in Kyiv. ""This is a very real problem.""But even if more ammunition were ordered today, it would take time for it to arrive as the wait for large-caliber ammunition is currently 28 months. ""Orders placed today will only be delivered two and a half years later,"" NATO chief Stoltenberg has said, given that stockpiles are being depleted.Sauer argued that Germany and the West should have reacted much earlier. ""Figures probably started circulating towards the end of summer, there was talk of five- to six-digit figures for artillery ammunition per month,"" he said. That was when Germany should have switched gears and realized it was time to take urgent action, Sauer said, adding that he was not sure why those in charge had not reacted at the time. He said that production had started rather late in the US too.According to German news outlet tagesschau.de, the US has delivered or promised to deliver more than one million artillery shells. They ran into supply issues, so they probably had to fall back on ammunition depots in Israel and South Korea. According to experts, that shows that neither the US nor Europe are prepared for conventional wars.German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has also said that there was ""only"" talk of tanks and that the issue of ammunition is only now gaining momentum: ""This is important and necessary and hopefully not too late because it's about air defense and providing replacement supplies of ammunition and missiles for the Ukrainian army's air defense systems.""Pistorius has urged the German defense industry ""to ramp up all capacities to the maximum as quickly as possible."" A deal with defense contractor Rheinmetall to resume production of ammunition for German-made Gepard (or cheetah) anti-aircraft tanks was an important first step, he said. ""The contracts for the production of Gepard ammunition have been signed,"" the minister confirmed.He said that Germany had decided to take that step so it would not be dependent on Switzerland.Referring to its neutral status, the Swiss government has so far refused to allow a supply of Swiss-produced ammunition for the Gepard tanks supplied by Germany.According to the German Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the new contract with Rheinmetall is for 300,000 rounds, to be delivered to Ukraine from July.Ukraine and its allies are ""scrambling around the world  — looking as far afield as Pakistan and South Korea for artillery munitions,"" DW correspondent Connolly said. ""We've had reports of Pakistani-made Soviet-caliber munitions heading this way, [and] of US troops being asked to send munitions that they had stockpiled in South Korea to Europe for Ukraine.""Despite the German defense minister's pleas, Hans Christoph Atzpodien, the head of the German security and defense industry association BDSV said in an interview with German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk that companies needed binding orders and more commitment. If politicians were to order ammunition, weapons and equipment quickly, the German defense industry could get going properly, he suggested.He said that orders had been relatively slow last year because of budget allocation issues, adding that nobody could expect ""unlimited upfront work.""""At some point,"" he said, ""there has to be an assurance that these are really the products the customer wants. We urgently need these orders, we need to be able to plan, we need reliability. The more long-term our capacity utilization is, the better we can plan.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811842,Hield helps Pacers rally from 24 down to beat Bulls 117-113,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Buddy Hield made six 3-pointers in the second half and finished with 27 points, helping the Indiana Pacers rally from a 24-point deficit after the first quarter and defeat the Chicago Bulls 117-113 on Wednesday night.

            Hield broke Reggie Miller's single-season franchise record for 3-pointers on his final 3 — his 230th — with 22 games remaining.

            “It's the new NBA. You shoot 3s and I shoot 3s at a high level,” said Hield, the NBA leader. “Passing a legend like Reggie in Indiana is a testament to hard work and my teammates finding me in the right spots.""











            Tyrese Haliburton banked in a 9-foot shot for a 113-112 lead in the final minute, Myles Turner sank two free throws and Hield closed it out with a pair of foul shots with 7.1 seconds remaining as the Pacers snapped a five-game skid.

            “The pattern in a lot of NBA games is you get hit in the face and then you fight back,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “Fighting back is a tough way to consistently win in this league.”

            The Pacers, down 39-15 after the first quarter, have trailed by double digits in the opening quarter of 24 games.

            “We don't want to be coming back all the time,” Hield said. “It's annoying.”

            Aaron Nesmith scored 21 points for Indiana, which had lost 16 of 18. Turner added 17, Haliburton 16 and Bennedict Mathurin 14.

            “We were dangerously close in the first quarter to being booed by the greatest fans in the NBA,” Carlisle said. “We responded.”

            The Bulls' Zach LaVine scored 35 points, including 12 in the opening quarter. 

            “This has happened a lot to us,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “We compete pretty hard, but what happens is the game gets ratcheted up — physically, mentally, emotionally. You've got to be able to come down on both ends of the floor and be incredibly detailed and focused. You have to execute.”

            James White had 25 and Nikola Vucevic added 19 — but with just seven rebounds as his league-best streak of double-doubles ended at nine games as the Bulls dropped their fifth straight.

            “The game is not won in the first five minutes,” Donovan said. “You've got to play your way through.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811846,"Ball has triple-double, Hornets hand Spurs 14th loss in row","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — LaMelo Ball had 28 points, 10 assists and a season-high 12 rebounds and the Charlotte Hornets beat San Antonio 120-110 on Wednesday night to send the Spurs into the NBA All-Star break with a franchise-record 14-game losing streak.

            The 21-year-old Ball became the second-youngest player in NBA history to reach 1,000 points, 1,000 rebounds and 1,000 assists in his career.

            “He is an ultra-talented player for sure,"" Hornets swingman Gordon Hayward said. “Great vision for sure and he's all over the court. (With rebounding) he has an special ability to be in the right place at the right time. ... He's obviously a great player already and I think he will continue to grow into an even better one.”











            When told about the accomplishment Ball immediately correctly guessed that LeBron James was the only player younger than him to reach that pinnacle.

            “I don't like to trip to up with that stuff,"" Ball said of being on the same list as James. “I just go out and try to get win after win.”

            For Ball, it was his third triple-double of the season and franchise-leading ninth overall.

            The Hornets got another solid contribution from P.J. Washington, who had 22 points and 10 rebounds, and rookie Mark Williams added 12 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots as Charlotte won its second straight game.

            The Hornets had 12 blocks in all, including five by backup center Nick Richards.

            For years the Panthers have sought a rim protector — and now it appears they have two young and capable shot blockers in 7-footers Williams and Richards.

            “What they both do is make exceptional plays because of their size and athleticism,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. “What they need to do now on top of that is less mistakes and not giving possessions away. If they do that we will be in good shape and they will be too.""

            Malaki Branham had 23 points and Keldon Johnson added 21 points for the Spurs, who have not won on the road since beating Houston on Dec. 19. Doug McDermott added 17 points on five 3s.

            The Hornets led 60-57 at halftime behind Ball, who nearly had a triple-double before the break with 10 points, nine rebounds and eight assists while seeing extra minutes with backcourt mate Terry Rozier out with knee soreness.

            Charlotte looked like it might pull away in the fourth quarter, but McDermott led the Spurs back with back-to-back 3-pointers and short jumper to cut the lead to one.

            But newly acquired guard Svi Mykhailiuk, playing in his first game with the Hornets, sparked a Charlotte run by burying a jumper from the corner to help push the lead back to six with five minutes remaining. 

            Ball's fifth 3-pointer of the game with two minutes remaining pushed the lead back to nine and Washington's offensive rebound and resounding dunk with 59 seconds left sealed the win.

            “At some point, you have to take pride in what you’re doing execution wise and competitively,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""That starts with defense and we really sucked. That’s on me when I think we’re starting to improve on it, and we go back two steps, so that’s something I’m going to have to think about, figure out how I’m going to be able to motivate them better.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811847,Major renovation planned for Athens' archaeological museum,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s Culture Ministry announced plans Wednesday for a major renovation of the National Archaeological Museum, expanding exhibition space at the Athens site that houses what is considered the most important collection of Greek antiquities in the world. 

            The project, expected to last four years, will be led by the British architect Sir David Chipperfield, whose major works include restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin and the design of the East Building at the Saint Louis Art Museum. 

            Chipperfield said new construction covering 20,000 square meters (215,000 square feet) was planned around the existing 19th century neoclassical building and would include new above- and below-ground exhibition areas, garden space and a new front entrance. 











            “Our architectural approach has been to create a plinth growing out of the existing building, therefore fundamentally connected to the 19th century building. But at the same time that develops into a powerful piece of architecture,” Chipperfield said during an event at the Athens museum late Wednesday.

            “The challenge, of course, is to get those two things in balance.” 

            The National Archaeological Museum, Greece’s largest, has more than 11,000 exhibits spanning millennia. Its treasures include the 3,500-year-old gold funerary mask known as the Mask of Agamemnon and the Antikythera Mechanism, a device used to track the sun, moon and planets. 

            But most visitors to Athens favor the more centrally located Acropolis Museum, designed by the Swiss architect Bernard Tschumi and opened in 2009. It’s where Greece hopes to house the Parthenon sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, that are currently in the British Museum in London. 

            The Acropolis Museum attracts some 2 million people per year, roughly four times the number that travel across the city to visit the National Archaeological Museum.

            That’s something Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis hopes will change with the renovation. 

            “More display space will be created for the great exhibits from one of the most important collections in the world. Today we display less than 10% of what we have in our warehouses,” Mitsotakis said at Wednesday's event.

            “It has always troubled me that just over 500,000 visitors come to the museum every year when it hosts such an incredible wealth of world cultural heritage,"" he said. 

            Chipperfield will work on the Athens project with the Greek architect Alexandros Tombazis, Wirtz International Landscape Architects of Belgium and German architect and structural engineer Werner Sobek.ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s Culture Ministry announced plans Wednesday for a major renovation of the National Archaeological Museum, expanding exhibition space at the Athens site that houses what is considered the most important collection of Greek antiquities in the world.The project, expected to last four years, will be led by the British architect Sir David Chipperfield, whose major works include restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin and the design of the East Building at the Saint Louis Art Museum.Chipperfield said new construction covering 20,000 square meters (215,000 square feet) was planned around the existing 19th century neoclassical building and would include new above- and below-ground exhibition areas, garden space and a new front entrance.“Our architectural approach has been to create a plinth growing out of the existing building, therefore fundamentally connected to the 19th century building.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811851,California's Rep. Lee files to seek Feinstein's Senate seat,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee filed federal paperwork Wednesday to enter the race for the California seat held by long-serving Sen. Dianne Feinstein, potentially adding another Democrat and a nationally recognized Black woman to a growing field that already includes two other House members.

            Though Lee has not made a formal announcement, her entry into the contest is widely expected. She filed paperwork creating a Senate fundraising committee one day after Feinstein — at 89 the oldest member of Congress — announced she would step down after her term ends next year.

            Lee ""is filing preparatory paperwork and her announcement will come before the end of the month,"" spokeswoman Katie Merrill said.











            Lee would join Democratic U.S. Reps. Katie Porter and Adam Schiff in the contest, who earlier announced their candidacies for the seat that Feinstein has held for three decades.

            Lee, 76, is perhaps best known for being the only member of Congress to vote against the authorization for the use of military force after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

            She is the highest-ranking Black woman appointed to the House Democratic leadership, serving as co-chair of the Policy and Steering Committee. 

            She has long been on outspoken defender of abortion rights. In 2021, she was one of several members of Congress who shared personal testimony about their own abortions during a congressional hearing.

Barbara Lee filed federal paperwork Wednesday to enter the race for the California seat held by long-serving Sen. Dianne Feinstein, potentially adding another Democrat and a nationally recognized Black woman to a growing field that already includes two other House members.Though Lee has not made a formal announcement, her entry into the contest is widely expected. She filed paperwork creating a Senate fundraising committee one day after Feinstein — at 89 the oldest member of Congress — announced she would step down after her term ends next year.Lee ""is filing preparatory paperwork and her announcement will come before the end of the month,"" spokeswoman Katie Merrill said.Lee would join Democratic U.S. Reps. Katie Porter and Adam Schiff in the contest, who earlier announced their candidacies for the seat that Feinstein has held for three decades.Lee, 76, is perhaps best known for being the only member of Congress to vote against the authorization for the use of military force after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.She is the highest-ranking Black woman appointed to the House Democratic leadership, serving as co-chair of the Policy and Steering Committee.She has long been on outspoken defender of abortion rights.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811853,No. 11 Marquette rallies late to edge No. 16 Xavier 69-68,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Marquette moved a step closer to earning its first conference title in a decade by turning a weakness into a strength.

            Rebounding.

            
                Olivier-Maxence Prosper converted a putback with 1.6 seconds left and No. 11 Marquette edged No. 16 Xavier 69-68 on Wednesday night to extend its slim Big East lead. 











            After Kam Jones missed his driving layup attempt, Prosper used his right hand to tip in the offensive rebound and put the Golden Eagles back in front.

            “I knew if he missed it, that was my rebound,” Prosper said. “I just went as hard as I could. It bounced right. I just went up there and just put it back in. That's just an effort play.”

            Marquette (21-6, 13-3), picked to finish ninth by the league’s coaches in the preseason poll, moved 1 1/2 games ahead of Xavier (19-7, 11-4), No. 24 Providence and No. 18 Creighton. 

            The Golden Eagles haven't claimed a conference championship since earning a share of the Big East crown in 2013, also the last year they won an NCAA Tournament game.

            Marquette surged into conference title contention despite entering Wednesday with a minus-3.4 rebound margin that ranked 311th out of all Division I teams. In an 80-76 loss at Xavier on Jan. 15, Marquette was outrebounded 45-32.

            The Golden Eagles turned that around Wednesday.

            “We knew that as long as we were the team that was going to put the most effort out there and just go after it, we were going to get the majority of them,” Prosper said. “It's about being quicker to the ball. Coach (Shaka Smart) preaches that all the time: Be quicker to the ball.”

            Marquette outrebounded Xavier 36-32 and outscored the Musketeers 15-7 in second-chance points. The Golden Eagles had 15 offensive rebounds, including 11 in the second half.

            No rebound was bigger than Prosper's putback in the final seconds. His basket produced the 15th and final lead change of the second half after Jack Nunge's layup put Xavier ahead 68-67 with 8.3 seconds remaining.

            “I thought that last play was the storyline of the entire second half,” Xavier coach Sean Miller said. “We could not get a defensive rebound.”

            Xavier’s Jerome Hunter threw a long inbounds pass to Nunge, whose deep 3-point try caromed off the backboard as the buzzer sounded.

            Marquette got 17 points and a career-high six steals from Stevie Mitchell. Tyler Kolek scored 15 and Oso Ighodaro added 14. Prosper had seven points, all in the last five minutes.

            Souley Boum fought through a sprained ankle to score 24 points for the Musketeers.

            Xavier shot 70% in the second half but couldn't hang onto its 28-24 halftime lead because of its inability to take care of the ball and prevent Marquette's second-chance opportunities. In the second half, Xavier committed 11 turnovers and attempted 16 fewer shots than Marquette.

            The Musketeers led 66-63 and had the ball in the final minute before Boum lost it and Mitchell got a steal, leading to Prosper's layup with 29.1 seconds remaining. Xavier committed a backcourt turnover on its ensuing possession, as Boum's pass went off Colby Jones’ body before going out of bounds.

            “We just had some inexplicable things happen at the end to us, just turnovers that, as much as I’d like to give our opponent credit for forcing the turnover, I think they were about as surprised as we were,” Miller said. “We just kind of gave it to them a couple of times at the end.”

            Ighodaro got fouled and hit two free throws with 22.4 seconds left to put Marquette ahead. Nunge's layup off a nice pass from Colby Jones put Xavier back in front before Prosper's clutch tip-in.

            BIG PICTURE

            Xavier: The Musketeers have lost two straight games by a combined three points. They showed plenty of fortitude by coming as close as they did at far less than full strength. Xavier was playing a fourth straight game without leading rebounder Zach Freemantle due to an injured left foot. Boum was dealing with his injured ankle. The Musketeers also were missing reserve guards Desmond Claude and Kam Craft, who could be out a few weeks with a knee injury.

            Marquette: The Golden Eagles won despite shooting 5 of 22 from 3-point range and getting just five points from Kam Jones, who was averaging a team-high 15.2 points per game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811854,"Franklin, Clark help No. 7 UVA outlast ACC-worst Louisville","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Armaan Franklin and Kihei Clark each scored 14 points and No. 7 Virginia endured a stern challenge from struggling Louisville and its own poor free-throw shooting to win its third straight game, 61-58 on Wednesday night.

            The Cavaliers (20-4, 12-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) led 58-50 with 3:47 remaining but didn't make a basket after Clark found Jayden Gardner for a layup with 3:06 left that made it 60-52. Virginia also missed five free throws in the final six minutes to give the ACC-worst Cardinals (3-23, 1-14) a chance. JJ Traynor's jumper with 31 seconds left got Louisville within three, and Clark missed the front end of a 1-and-1.

            But the Cardinals bled valuable time off the clock during their final possession while trying to get free for an open 3-pointer, and Kamari Lands' off-balance 3 barely hit the rim with 3 seconds left. Ben Vander Plas got the rebound and Virginia escaped with its sixth consecutive win over the Cardinals while moving into a first-place tie with Pittsburgh in the ACC.











            “Always nice to get a win, especially on the road,"" Vander Plas said. “It’s always hard to win on the road. So, that was our No. 1 goal and we accomplished that. Obviously we’ve got some things to polish up, both offensively and defensively.”

            El Ellis had 21 points for Louisville, which has lost four straight since its lone ACC victory. The Cardinals were coming off another close game against one of the league's best teams, a 93-85 loss at Miami.

            This one could have turned out differently if Louisville had executed better in the final seconds.

            “I understand the emotions of the game, ‘We’ve got to get a 3. We have to get a 3,’” first-year coach Kenny Payne said. “That’s not what we really needed. We could have taken a quick 2.

            “Now you’re only down one, you foul, you give yourself another chance. But I’m happy with the guys, they fought hard.”

            Clark shot 5 of 11 overall and made three baskets during a critical stretch after after Louisville tied the game at 44. The fifth-year guard scored eight points during an 11-1 run that included Vander Plas' 3 for a 55-45 cushion that Virginia ended up needing to offset those missed free throws.

            Clark earned his 71st victory at Virginia to surpass Duke's Shane Battier as the ACC's winningest player in regular season and tournament games. He credited the team's resolve through the ragged finish.

            “I think it just shows the type of guys we have,"" said Clark, who tied London Perrantes as Virginia's career leader in games started at 132. “We were able to dig down deep and get out with a win.”

            Gardner and Vander Plas each scored 10 points for Virginia, which shot 57% after halftime and 44% overall.

            The Cardinals and Cavaliers began by shooting a combined 10 for 31, but Ellis found comfort on the perimeter as Louisville led by as many as nine points.

            Virginia trailed 26-17 with 5:18 left in the first half before outscoring Louisville 20-4 over the next 20 minutes. Despite taking a 10-point lead late in the game, the Cavaliers had to hang on in the final seconds.

            The teams will meet again on March 4 in Charlottesville, Virginia.

            BIG PICTURE

            Virginia: The Cavaliers began the game shooting poorly but settled down to find a rhythm just before the break. They finished 9 of 16 from the free-throw line, including 5 of 10 after halftime. Outscoring Louisville 30-20 in the paint was important in a tougher-than-expected game.

            Louisville: The normally error-prone Cardinals committed just four turnovers in the first half, but a couple came during a late drought. That made a difference against a precise Cavs squad that didn't turn the ball over until two minutes into the second half. Louisville ultimately had 10 giveaways that Virginia converted into 13 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811855,"Behind Ducharme, No. 6 UConn rallies past Creighton 62-60","STORRS, Conn. (AP) — Caroline Ducharme's return after missing 13 games with a concussion came at just the right time for the UConn Huskies. 

            The sophomore guard scored all 10 of her points in the fourth quarter, including the winning free throws with just under 5 seconds left, and No. 6 Connecticut came from behind to beat Creighton 62-60 on Wednesday night.

            Ducharme, playing for the first time this calendar year, was 0 for 6 from the floor before her late scoring surge helped UConn (23-4, 15-1 Big East) overcome an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit. 











            “And it wasn't an easy 10,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “But they're the kind of points we're used to seeing Caroline get in those moments. So, she's back just in time. It's a great Valentine's Day gift.”

            Lou Lopez Senechal scored 17 points to lead the Huskies, Aaliyah Edwards had 12 and Dorka Juhasz added 10 points. 

            Morgan Maly had 15 points for Creighton (18-7, 12-5), which lost for the first time in seven games. Rachael Saunders and Lauren Jensen each had 13.

            Creighton trailed by two points at the half, but opened the second half with 3-pointers from Maly and Saunders — part of a 19-1 run that stretched back into the first half. 

            The Bluejays held UConn without a point for the first five minutes of the third quarter, turning a 30-21 deficit into a 40-31 lead. They led 48-39 after three quarters. 

            Saunders' 3-pointer in the fourth quarter made it 50-39 before the Huskies began chipping away.

            A three-point play by Ducharme drew the fifth foul on Saunders and cut UConn's deficit to 57-54. 

            Edwards made a layup to make it 57-56, and Lopez Senechal’s layup gave the Huskies a 58-57 lead. But Morgan Maly responded with a 3-pointer to put Creighton back up with 1:07 left in the game.

            Lopez Senechal responded with a jumper to tie it at 60, then drew an offensive foul on Maly off the ball with 16 seconds remaining.

            Ducharme drove into the lane with 4.8 seconds left, drawing a foul on Carly Bachelor and calmly hit the two foul shots to give UConn the winning points.

            “Just being out on the floor was a big step for me and just being able to handle everything that goes with being in the game — the lights, the noise all of that and still being able to play basketball,” Ducharme said. “So, then I think once I was able to settle in and adjust to that, I think going through the game, I think we all knew that we all needed to step up and hit shots. 

            ""So I think that was all that was really on my mind is that we needed some offense.”

            Edwards fouled Lauren Jensen on a drive with 0.7 seconds left. But the junior guard missed both foul shots, the second intentionally, and Edwards grabbed the rebound to secure the win.

            “It sucks to lose the way we lost tonight, but it also should give us confidence if we see these guys in 2 1/2 weeks,” Creighton coach Jim Flanery said. “We’d have a great chance and this is a kinda team that we are going to see in the NCAA Tournament. So from that standpoint, we’ve given ourselves a great look at what it’s going to take to be successful and tonight we were one basket short.” 

            UConn won the first meeting this season in December, 72-47, in Omaha. 

            BIG PICTURE

            Creighton: The Bluejays fell to 11-3 on the road, matching the most road wins in Flanery's 21 seasons at the school. ... The Bluejays hit 12 of 33 3-point attempts after shooting just 3 of 28 in the loss in December. 

            UConn: The Huskies had nine players available for the first time since Dec. 21... G Azzi Fudd, who had been the Huskies leading scorer, has missed 17 games this season after twice injuring her right knee. Auriemma said he still has no timeline for her return.

(AP) — Caroline Ducharme's return after missing 13 games with a concussion came at just the right time for the UConn Huskies.The sophomore guard scored all 10 of her points in the fourth quarter, including the winning free throws with just under 5 seconds left, and No. 6 Connecticut came from behind to beat Creighton 62-60 on Wednesday night.Ducharme, playing for the first time this calendar year, was 0 for 6 from the floor before her late scoring surge helped UConn (23-4, 15-1 Big East) overcome an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit.“And it wasn't an easy 10,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “But they're the kind of points we're used to seeing Caroline get in those moments. So, she's back just in time. It's a great Valentine's Day gift.”Lou Lopez Senechal scored 17 points to lead the Huskies, Aaliyah Edwards had 12 and Dorka Juhasz added 10 points.Morgan Maly had 15 points for Creighton (18-7, 12-5), which lost for the first time in seven games. Rachael Saunders and Lauren Jensen each had 13.Creighton trailed by two points at the half, but opened the second half with 3-pointers from Maly and Saunders — part of a 19-1 run that stretched back into the first half.The Bluejays held UConn without a point for the first five minutes of the third quarter, turning a 30-21 deficit into a 40-31 lead. They led 48-39 after three quarters.Saunders' 3-pointer in the fourth quarter made it 50-39 before the Huskies began chipping away.A three-point play by Ducharme drew the fifth foul on Saunders and cut UConn's deficit to 57-54.Edwards made a layup to make it 57-56, and Lopez Senechal’s layup gave the Huskies a 58-57 lead. But Morgan Maly responded with a 3-pointer to put Creighton back up with 1:07 left in the game.Lopez Senechal responded with a jumper to tie it at 60, then drew an offensive foul on Maly off the ball with 16 seconds remaining.Ducharme drove into the lane with 4.8 seconds left, drawing a foul on Carly Bachelor and calmly hit the two foul shots to give UConn the winning points.“Just being out on the floor was a big step for me and just being able to handle everything that goes with being in the game — the lights, the noise all of that and still being able to play basketball,” Ducharme said. “So, then I think once I was able to settle in and adjust to that, I think going through the game, I think we all knew that we all needed to step up and hit shots.""So I think that was all that was really on my mind is that we needed some offense.”Edwards fouled Lauren Jensen on a drive with 0.7 seconds left. But the junior guard missed both foul shots, the second intentionally, and Edwards grabbed the rebound to secure the win.“It sucks to lose the way we lost tonight, but it also should give us confidence if we see these guys in 2 1/2 weeks,” Creighton coach Jim Flanery said. “We’d have a great chance and this is a kinda team that we are going to see in the NCAA Tournament. So from that standpoint, we’ve given ourselves a great look at what it’s going to take to be successful and tonight we were one basket short.”UConn won the first meeting this season in December, 72-47, in Omaha.BIG PICTURECreighton: The Bluejays fell to 11-3 on the road, matching the most road wins in Flanery's 21 seasons at the school. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811873,"Bowman, Larson give Hendrick sweep of front row at Daytona","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Alex Bowman admired yet another Daytona 500 pole trophy that he won from mastering the superspeedway over one fast lap ahead of NASCAR's marquee race.

            The Hendrick Motorsports driver still wants to add to his Daytona collection. There's a championship trophy missing.

            “It may not be the big one,” Bowman said. “But it's not a bad one to have.”











            Bowman and Kyle Larson turned Daytona 500 qualifying into another Hendrick Motorsports romp.

            Bowman posted the top speed in his No. 48 Chevrolet at Daytona International Speedway and won his third career pole for the race. He'll be joined by Larson in the No. 5 Chevrolet on the front row for NASCAR's season opener.

            The Hendrick dominance is a recurring theme at Daytona.

            “They’ve got something figured out, for sure,” Larson said. “There’s obviously tricks they’ve learned along the way that still apply to these cars.”

            Bowman, who missed five races late last season because of a concussion, is on the Daytona 500 front row for the the sixth straight time, and the organization has produced a pole winner in eight of the last nine years.

            “There's a ton of effort that goes into trying to qualify well here,” Bowman said.

            Jimmie Johnson made a triumphant return to NASCAR on Wednesday night and qualified for the Daytona 500, a tremendous start for the the seven-time champion as he heads into his first Cup race since 2020.

            The 47-year-old Johnson returned from a two-year dalliance in IndyCar for an ownership stake in Legacy Motor Club — and he quickly added to his own, joining the 40-driver field Wednesday night in his No. 84 Chevrolet.

            Yes, a reverse of the No. 48 he ran when he won two Daytona 500s.

            “I think I really have a shot to win,” Johnson said before he qualified. “If I survive and get through the first two stages, there’s really a shot that I have to win this race.”

            Johnson will be joined Sunday by another 40-something part-timer in former X Games thrill-seeker Travis Pastrana. Pastrana said racing in the Daytona 500 was one of his last motorsports goals and this was his last, best shot to get there. He landed a ride for Daytona in the No. 67 Toyota as a third entry for the NASCAR team owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin.

            With 36 drivers already locked into the 40-car field based on NASCAR’s charter system, Johnson and Pastrana were among six others competing for the final four starting spots at Daytona International Speedway.

            Johnson and Pastrana embraced on pit row after they locked themselves into the race. They can rest easy for a night.

            So can Bowman, who has yet to parlay the top spot into a Daytona 500 win, and Larson. Bowman, who received a new contract and a new crew chief in Blake Harris entering this season, turned a top speed of 181.686 mph and Larson hit 181.057. Both drive Chevrolets for team owner Rick Hendrick.

            “Now it's time to finish,” Bowman said. “Make it to the end.”

            The final two open spots and the starting order will be settled in Thursday night’s duel qualifying races. Conor Daly, Austin Hill, Chandler Smith and Zane Smith will vie for the two open spots. 

            Smith was the first car out for qualifying and promptly stalled before he took a second shot at his lap. Smith’s meager speed at least was better than Daly, who suffered oil line problems in his Chevrolet and did not take a qualifying run.

            Because NASCAR did not have practice at the superspeedway before Wednesday, teams did not have any time to hit the track and work out kinks in their cars.

            It felt like old times for Johnson.

            The former Hendrick Motorsports star had seemingly walked away from NASCAR after the 2020 season but he never scored a podium finish over 29 starts in two IndyCar seasons. So it was back to NASCAR, only this time with a say in how to run the operation. He bought into the ownership group of what was Petty GMS Racing and quickly rebranded it to Legacy M.C.

            Pastrana was a bigger long shot to make Daytona. He has won championships in supercross, motocross, freestyle motocross, rally racing and, most recently, offshore powerboat racing. He made a brief run at NASCAR a decade ago and raced a full Xfinity Series schedule in 2013 for Roush Fenway Racing. 

            “I got chewed up and spit out by these guys really fast,” Pastrana said. “At the end of the day, it's because they're the best drivers, I believe, in the entire world.”

            Pastrana drove the No. 67 Toyota like a seasoned veteran and will join 23XI drivers Bubba Wallace and Tyler Reddick in the field.

            “It's interesting, a lot of the guys that follow NASCAR, just the fans, they know me as a TV personality or a stunt man,” Pastrana said. “Really, in my heart I've been a racer.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811877,"Brunson scores 28, Randle 25, Knicks rout Hawks 122-101","ATLANTA (AP) — Jalen Brunson is on quite a streak.

            The New York Knicks are confident it's no fluke.

            
                Brunson scored 28 points, Julius Randle added 25 and the Knicks cruised into their All-Star break with their third straight victory, blowing out the Atlanta Hawks 122-101 Wednesday night. 











            New York moved six games above .500 (33-27) and is brimming with confidence about its prospects for the remainder of the regular season. 

            “There's still 22 games left,” said RJ Barrett, who chipped in 17 points and was among six Knicks in double figures. “We've got to stay the course.”

            The course looks promising the way Brunson is playing.

            In his first season with the Knicks after signing a $104 million deal in free agency, he is averaging 31.5 points over his last 10 games and 23.9 for the season.

            Hard to believe he was just a second-round pick by Dallas coming off a stellar college career at Villanova, where he won a pair of national titles.

            “He's good and he knows he's good,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “I don't think anyone is surprised by what he's doing.”

            But Brunson is hardly content. When told what his coach had said, the 26-year-old guard quickly pointed out he had five turnovers.

            “Whenever I step on the court, I try to be the best player I can be,” he said. “There's always ways I can improve, no matter what's going on, whether I'm playing good or bad.""

            New York settled this one right from the start. The Knicks never trailed, building a 24-point lead in the first half and leading by double digits for the final 42 minutes of the game.

            The only sign of life from the Hawks came late in the third quarter, when they crept within 11.

            But Obi Toppin and Josh Hart connected on back-to-back 3s from the same corner early in the fourth to push the lead back to 19.

            That was it for the Hawks, who lost their second in a row to dip below .500 (29-30) in what has been a hugely disappointing season just two years after they reached the Eastern Conference final. 

            Trae Young was held to 19 points on 4-of-14 shooting, making just one of six outside the 3-point stripe. De'Andre Hunter led the Hawks with 20 points.

            “We definitely need a break,” Young said. “I've got faith in my team. I've got trust that we can make a special run.”

            
                Randle grabbed 11 rebounds for the Knicks, who finished with a 55-40 edge on the boards.

            Thibodeau fretted before the game about his team letting up heading into the All-Star hiatus. 

            “You don't want to go on break before the break,” he said.

            Instead, it was the Hawks who sleepwalked through the contest, falling behind by double digits before the game was 5 minutes old.

            New York stretched the margin to 34-14 late in the first period, and the Hawks never got closer than 14 the rest of the opening half.

            The Knicks led by as many as 24 points and were up 66-44 at the break. Randle had 14 points over the first two quarters, while Brunson and Barrett chipped in with 12 apiece.

            Shredding Atlanta's defense, the Knicks knocked down 51% of their shots in the opening half, including 9 of 26 from beyond the 3-point stripe. The Hawks, on the other hand, connected on just 1 of 15 from long range before halftime.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811890,Tatum's 38 points help Celtics roll past Pistons 127-109,"BOSTON (AP) — The Celtics got back their offensive and defensive spark plugs. Together, they gave Boston the jolt it needed to head into the All-Star break on track to accomplish all its goals this season.

            Jayson Tatum scored 38 points, including 24 in the third quarter, and the Celtics rolled to a 127-109 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. 

            Malcolm Brogdon had 25 points off the bench, and Al Horford added 11 points and seven rebounds for Boston. Derrick White finished with 11 points and six assists.











            Reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart contributed nine points, seven rebounds, six assists and six steals in his first game back after missing nine with a sprained right ankle. 

            “We missed a lot,"" Celtics interim coach Joe Mazzulla said of Smart's absence. ""We missed his joy. He brought a level of joy into the game."" 

            The Eastern Conference-leading Celtics (42-17) enter the break with five wins in their last six games. They have a one-game lead over second-place Milwaukee, which has won 11 straight and plays its final game before All-Star Weekend on Thursday at Chicago. 

            Tatum said he likes the way Boston is trending as it rests before trying to complete a run back to the NBA Finals in the second half.

            “All things considered, everything that we've went through this season as a team with coaching changes and guys getting injured, missing games and being in and out of the lineup. ... Overall, it's been a hell of a start,"" Tatum said.

            Detroit trimmed a 19-point deficit to five late in the third quarter. But Tatum scored 24 points in the period to give the Celtics an eight-point cushion entering the fourth. Boston then got its lead back up to 19 with 4:29 to play.

            Bojan Bogdanovic led the Pistons with 28 points and five rebounds. Isaiah Stewart added 14 points. Detroit has lost five of six. 

            The Celtics’ lead in the East was cut to a half-game after they lost in overtime Tuesday at Milwaukee while playing without Tatum (illness), Jaylen Brown (facial fracture), Smart and Horford (right knee swelling).

            Wiseman checked in for the first time at the 3:29 mark of the first quarter, playing alongside Killian Hayes, Alec Burks, Isaiah Livers and Bogdanovic. 

            Wiseman finished with 11 points and five rebounds in 24 minutes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811893,"Mikal Bridges scores career-high 45, Nets beat Heat 116-105","NEW YORK (AP) — In his third game since arriving in the Kevin Durant trade, Mikal Bridges had an electrifying scoring stretch to rival even the superstar he replaced.

            Bridges scored a career-high 45 points, including 15 in a row for Brooklyn to break open a game that had been close for 3 1/2 quarters, and the Nets beat the Miami Heat 116-105 on Wednesday night in the final game for both teams before the All-Star break.

            “I just had it going and my teammates found me every time,” Bridges said. 











            The Nets led only 90-89 before Bridges went to work with an array of drives, 3-pointers and jumpers over the next three minutes. That pushed the lead to nine and when another Nets player finally scored, it was a 3-pointer by fellow former Phoenix player Cam Johnson that pushed it to 108-96.

            Bridges scored 17 points in the final quarter to blow by his previous career best of 34 points. He was 17 of 24 from the field, 4 of 6 on 3s and 7 of 7 at the line, and also had eight rebounds and five assists.

            “I think overall just his spirit and energy and juice, even at our walkthrough today, like he had the mindset it seemed like he wasn’t going to let us lose,” Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said. 

            Bridges was the runner-up for Defensive Player of the Year last season whose offensive game is growing. He said after the blockbuster trade last week that he understood why the Suns would trade him for Durant, and still does after averaging 25 points since while earning the nickname “Brooklyn Bridges.” 

            “You traded a future Hall of Famer that averaged damn near 30 for his career, so I’m just trying to continue to get better and get to a point where I can score a little more,” Bridges said. 

            Cam Thomas added 19 points and Johnson had 18 for the Nets, who won for the first time since the two former Suns joined them in the lineup.

            Bam Adebayo had 24 points, 13 rebounds and six assists for the Heat. Max Strus scored 18 points. 

            The Heat fell behind New York into seventh place in the Eastern Conference, out of guaranteed playoff position, and will hope missing regulars Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry and Victor Oladipo get healthy during the break. 

            “We've got 23 to go to get to where we need to get to,” Heat star Jimmy Butler said. “It’s all about being healthy, which is what going into this break is going to do for us, come out swinging for the fences in the right way.” 

            Bridges scored on a jumper with 0.2 seconds left to give the Nets an 83-80 lead after three quarters in which neither team led by more than six points. 

            Duncan Robinson had six points in his first game since Jan. 4 surgery to repair a finger ligament. 

            TIP-INS

            Heat: Lowry missed his sixth straight game with left knee soreness. Oladipo has missed seven in a row with a sprained right ankle. ... Miami began a four-game road trip around the break. The Heat don't play at home again until March 1. 

            Nets: Ben Simmons was booed when he checked in four minutes into the game. He finished with two points, four rebounds and four assists in 20 minutes. ... Seth Curry was scoreless in 10 minutes after missing five games with a left adductor strain. ... Brooklyn plays nine of its first 11 games after the All-Star break on the road. 

            HURTING HERRO

            Herro missed his second straight game with a bruised left knee but is still scheduled to fly to Salt Lake City and compete in the 3-point contest at All-Star weekend. 

            “You’re not burning any calories in that and you’re certainly not colliding or jumping or doing anything,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “He is making progress. He definitely is not ready to be able to play in an NBA game tonight and then we’ll just see how he feels the next two days with his treatment, whether he’ll be able to do that. I know that he really wants to.”

Several U.S. states have begun considering imposing restrictions on accessing Chinese software due to national security concerns.Among them is South Dakota, whose governor, Kristi Noem, shared her views on China and what her state has been doing to curb Chinese infiltration at a forum hosted by American First Policy Institute (AFPI) on Wednesday (Feb. 15). The state issued an executive order that came into effect in late 2022, including banning state employees from using TikTok on government devices and from doing business with Chinese-state affiliated entities, in addition to five countries also deemed not friendly to the U.S.Speaking on Chinese influence, Noem, who ran a family ranch before dedicating herself to politics, claimed that China is trying to control the food supply in the U.S. by building up or acquiring American chemical and fertilizer companies, along with buying some farmland in the U.S. in the years from 2010 to 2020. Noem said that was a national security risk.In a dialogue with AFPI Chair of the China Policy Initiative Steve Yates, she said the public is concerned about China flexing its muscles, its ongoing manipulation of currencies, and intellectual property infringements.Yates said Americans are aware of the challenges from trade to human rights issues and want to know how their governments can respond to the challenges. He lauded South Dakota's efforts to address the challenges and serves as a role model for other states yet to act. Despite the challenges, however, Yates hoped for a continued conversation as an alternative to confrontations when engaging with China.",2023/02/16,832,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811925,Nylander leads Maple Leafs to 5-2 win over Blackhawks,"TORONTO (AP) — William Nylander had a goal and two assists, Ilya Samsonov stopped 27 shots and the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Chicago Blackhawks 5-2 on Wednesday night.

            Auston Matthews, John Tavares and Rasmus Sandin each added a goal and an assist, and Conor Timmins also scored for the Maple Leafs, who won for the fifth time in eight games.

            “I didn’t think the game had much life to it. Not what you come to expect in terms of what it’s like to play in the NHL,"" Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. “We’re happy to get through it with two points.” 











            Sam Lafferty and Philipp Kurashev each had a goal and an assist for Chicago. Petr Mrazek finished with 37 saves. The Blackhawks have lost three straight and are 2-5-1 in their last eight.

            “Our guys fought to the end,” Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. “There was no give-up.”

            Leapfrogged by Tampa Bay for second in the Atlantic Division since last playing Saturday night in a4-3 loss to last-place Columbus, the Maple Leafs opened the scoring after just 9 seconds into the game when Nylander moved in on a breakaway and slid home his 30th goal of the season.

            “It was Matty’s idea to draw that play up,” Nylander said of Matthews. “Usually it’s not open … luckily (Blackhawks defenseman Jake McCabe) blew a tire there and gave me the space.”

            The Swede, who has five points in two games, also nearly ran out of room.

            “I think I waited too much,” Nylander said with a smile. “Lucky that it slipped by his skate there on the post.”

            The Blackhawks tied it on the game’s second shot 53 seconds later when Lafferty jumped on a turnover by Calle Jarnkrok and scored his ninth.

            Sandin regained the lead for Toronto with his fourth on a shot that hit a Chicago stick and fooled Mrazek at 8:14.

            “When we had some breakdowns or they responded … our response was better,” Tavares said. “We were able to grab the game back and grab momentum.”

            Alexander Kerfoot appeared to give Toronto a two-goal lead just 15 seconds later only to have it overturned when the Blackhawks challenge for offside.

            However, Matthews did push the lead to 3-1 when he scored his 26th off a pass from Nylander with 8:39 left in the first. 

            Matthews, last season’s Hart Trophy winner as NHL MVP and the first player in a decade to score 60 goals, was back after spraining his knee on Jan. 25 — missed five games over a three-week stretch thanks to the All-Star break and Toronto’s bye week.

            “The adrenalin kicks in,” Matthews said. “My energy faded a little bit throughout the game. ... For the most part, I felt pretty good.”

            Chicago got back within one 46 seconds into the second when Kurashev fired his eighth.

            Tavares made it 4-2 as he took advantage of Mrazek's miscue to score his 24th at 7:37 of the middle period.

            Timmins, playing for the first time since Jan. 27, then scored his second on a one-timer for a 5-2 lead with 3:53 left in the middle period.

            NYLANDER MILESTONE

            Nylander joined Matthews, Tavares and Phil Kessel as the only Maples players over the last 20 years to reach 30 goals in 55 games or fewer. The goal was the also fourth-fastest to start a game in franchise history behind only Charlie Conacher in 1932 (7 seconds), Mitch Marner in 2019 (7 seconds) and Ted Kennedy in 1953 (8 seconds).

The Blackhawks have lost three straight and are 2-5-1 in their last eight.“Our guys fought to the end,” Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. “There was no give-up.”Leapfrogged by Tampa Bay for second in the Atlantic Division since last playing Saturday night in a4-3 loss to last-place Columbus, the Maple Leafs opened the scoring after just 9 seconds into the game when Nylander moved in on a breakaway and slid home his 30th goal of the season.“It was Matty’s idea to draw that play up,” Nylander said of Matthews. “Usually it’s not open … luckily (Blackhawks defenseman Jake McCabe) blew a tire there and gave me the space.”The Swede, who has five points in two games, also nearly ran out of room.“I think I waited too much,” Nylander said with a smile. “Lucky that it slipped by his skate there on the post.”The Blackhawks tied it on the game’s second shot 53 seconds later when Lafferty jumped on a turnover by Calle Jarnkrok and scored his ninth.Sandin regained the lead for Toronto with his fourth on a shot that hit a Chicago stick and fooled Mrazek at 8:14.“When we had some breakdowns or they responded … our response was better,” Tavares said. “We were able to grab the game back and grab momentum.”Alexander Kerfoot appeared to give Toronto a two-goal lead just 15 seconds later only to have it overturned when the Blackhawks challenge for offside.However, Matthews did push the lead to 3-1 when he scored his 26th off a pass from Nylander with 8:39 left in the first.Matthews, last season’s Hart Trophy winner as NHL MVP and the first player in a decade to score 60 goals, was back after spraining his knee on Jan. 25 — missed five games over a three-week stretch thanks to the All-Star break and Toronto’s bye week.“The adrenalin kicks in,” Matthews said. “My energy faded a little bit throughout the game. ... For the most part, I felt pretty good.”Chicago got back within one 46 seconds into the second when Kurashev fired his eighth.Tavares made it 4-2 as he took advantage of Mrazek's miscue to score his 24th at 7:37 of the middle period.Timmins, playing for the first time since Jan. 27, then scored his second on a one-timer for a 5-2 lead with 3:53 left in the middle period.NYLANDER MILESTONENylander joined Matthews, Tavares and Phil Kessel as the only Maples players over the last 20 years to reach 30 goals in 55 games or fewer. The goal was the also fourth-fastest to start a game in franchise history behind only Charlie Conacher in 1932 (7 seconds), Mitch Marner in 2019 (7 seconds) and Ted Kennedy in 1953 (8 seconds).UP NEXTBlackhawks: At Ottawa on Friday night to finish a four-game trip.Maple Leafs: Host Montreal on Saturday night to finish a three-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811926,Ford stops production of electric F-150 after battery fire,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. has suspended production and halted shipments of the F-150 Lightning electric pickup after a battery caught fire during a pre-delivery quality check.

            Production at Ford's Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, has been stopped until at least the end of next week. 

            The automaker said in a statement Wednesday night it has no reason to believe electric pickups already in use by customers are affected by the battery issue.











            “By the end of next week, we expect to conclude our investigation and apply what we learn to the truck's battery production processes,” Ford spokeswoman Emma Bergg said in the statement. “This could take a few weeks.”

            The fire happened at an outdoor lot nearby in Dearborn where vehicles are held for quality checks. The truck with the battery problem and two nearby vehicles were damaged by the fire, Bergg said. No injuries were reported.

            The company believes it has identified the root cause of the battery problem, including the likely population of trucks affected by it. “We monitor vehicle data to help ensure our vehicles are performing as expected in the field,” Bergg said.

            The company will continue to hold completed trucks until engineering and production changes are made. 

            Batteries for the trucks are supplied by SK Innovation, a South Korean supplier with a factory in Georgia. 

            The production halt comes at an inopportune time for Ford, which has struggled with quality issues, recalls and high warranty costs for several years.

            The problem also stops production of a popular product. Bergg said the company is still working through a backlog of nearly 200,000 reservations for the F-150 Lightning since it stopped taking them in December 2021. Reservation holders put down $100 deposits, which Ford was converting to orders.

            Last year, Ford sold more than 15,000 of the trucks in its first full year of production.

            There have been previous problems with the lithium-ion batteries used in most electric vehicles. Fires in the batteries can burn very hot and take thousands of gallons of water to extinguish, which has caused difficulty for firefighters attempting to put out battery fires in several Teslas after crashes. General Motors, Hyundai, BMW and others have issued recalls of the batteries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811927,"Embiid has 29 points, helps 76ers snap Cavaliers' win streak","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joel Embiid scored 29 points — including the 10,000th of his career — and the Philadelphia 76ers survived a rocky second half to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 118-112 on Wednesday night. 

            After watching a 28-point lead in the second half melt to four with 90 seconds left, the Sixers were able to put it away by making 13 straight free throws.

            “That's a pretty good team over there that will give other teams trouble,” Embiid said. “Obviously, we knew they would make a run. But they got the stops when we needed to.”











            James Harden added 19 points and 12 assists to help send the 76ers into the All-Star break with their fourth straight victory. De'Anthony Melton added 18 points, and Tyrese Maxey had 16.

            “To win that game despite the adversity was good for us,” Maxey said.

            Donovan Mitchell had 33 points — including 25 in the second half — for the Cavaliers. They had won seven straight. Darius Garland added 27 points for Cleveland, and Evan Mobley had 23.

            “We allowed them to put a little bit of doubt in our minds early, but we figured it out,” Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. 

            After the game, Embiid — scheduled to be a starter in the All-Star Game in Utah on Sunday night — indicated that he may sit the game out due to lingering left foot soreness that has been officially marked on the Sixers injury report since the club's trip to the West Coast in late December. Embiid mentioned that doctors had told him that getting off of the foot was necessary in order to prevent the injury from getting worse.

            “I was trying to get the All-Star Break without missing games"" Embiid said. “But I think that I may have reached the point where I need to follow the doctors advice. We'll see how the next few days go.”

            Embiid passed the 10,000 point mark early in the first quarter. He accomplished the milestone in his 373rd game — the fastest in franchise history ahead of Allen Iverson’s 378. 

            “I can only think what if I didn't miss all these games, but that's not where the focus is,” Embiid said. “I'm just focused on what I can do to help the team. Whether it is scoring a lot, passing, defensively- then I'm going to do it.”

            Philadelphia hit its first six 3-pointers and 11 of 14 shots from the floor to jump out to a 31-10 lead. The Sixers led by 28 early in the second half.

            Cleveland rallied in the second half in part because of its ability to move the ball around and force turnovers. The Cavs forced nine turnovers in the second half, turning them into 20 points while just turning the ball over once.

            “They did a great job of physically out of our stuff,” Bickerstaff said. “They were aggressive on both ends of the floor and it took us too long to recover from that first punch. We showed what we are capable of in the second half with 17 assists and just one turnover.”

            TIP-INS

            Cavaliers: Danny Green made his return to the Cavaliers lineup on Wednesday night, scoring three points in about 12 minutes. Green — who played three games for Memphis this season before being traded to Houston and being eventually waived — was drafted by the Cavs in 2009. Bickerstaff indicated that Green's role will be as much mentor for a young lineup as opposed to on the floor. “We know his game his ability to make shots and defend, but our group needs as much information as they have,” Bickerstaff said. ... Ricky Rubio was inactive for Cleveland with a non-COVID illness. 

            76ers: Philadelphia forward P.J. Tucker was back in the starting lineup after leaving Monday's game against Houston with right calf tightness.

(AP) — Jaren Jackson had 26 points, nine rebounds and four blocks and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Utah Jazz 117-111 on Wednesday night in the last game for both teams before the All-Star break.

            Desmond Bane scored 24 points and Ja Morant had 20 points — on 8-of-26 shooting — and nine assists. Jackson also had five steals.

            Kelly Olynyk led the Jazz with 28 points and 14 rebounds, and Jordan Clarkson had 20 points, nine rebounds and six assists.











            Utah, which trailed by 24 in the first half, cut the Memphis lead to 111-110 when Ochai Agbaji (17 points) scored on a dunk with 1:28 left. But Morant scored the next three points for Memphis and the Grizzlies held on for their second straight victory.

            “Being up 24, you definitely don't want to go into the All-Star break after losing a (big) lead, but we survived,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said.

            Jackson said there were several key factors that helped Memphis hold on. He said the performance “wasn't great,” but the Grizzlies had enough left at the end to escape the Utah comeback.

            “I can't tell you what it was,"" Jackson said. “I'm just happy they missed some shots late, and we made some shots late. We got the ball to who we wanted to get it to and finished it out.”

            Utah scoring leader Lauri Markkanen was out with right knee soreness. Then, four minutes into the game, guard Collin Sexton went out with a left hamstring injury and did not return. That left the Jazz short-handed and relying on their reserves. Talen Horton-Tucker led the Utah bench, scoring 15 points, while grabbing seven rebounds and handing out an equal number of assists.

            Memphis benefitted from poor ball protection by the Jazz in the first half. Fifteen first-half turnovers by Utah resulted in 26 Grizzlies points. Jackson already had 16 points, cashing in on four 3-pointers, while recording three blocks and four steals in the first half. 

            Utah outscored Memphis 33-25 in third quarter, cutting the lead to 88-80 entering the fourth.

            “You see everybody's energy and how they played tonight?” Clarkson said. “Nobody ever gave up throughout the whole game. We had turnovers and missed shots early.”

            But Clarkson noted that the youthful energy of the Jazz along with new teammates helped them overcome early problems in the game while missing key players.

            “One shot away, two plays away from winning the game,” Clarkson said.

            The Jazz entered the night in 10th place in the Western Conference, holding onto the last play-in spot a mere half-game ahead of Portland and Oklahoma City. Utah coach Will Hardy said there has to be a balance to watching the logjam.

            “It can be daunting when you look at the standing,” Hardy said. “How tight everything is. Then you start trying to do math in your head about what you may have to do.” Then he added: “I’d be lying if I said we don’t look at the standings. You do.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811948,"Gilgeous-Alexander scores 29, helps Thunder dominate Rockets","OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Oklahoma City Thunder created the kind of momentum they wanted to take into the All-Star break.

            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 29 points to help the Thunder roll past the Houston Rockets 133-96 on Wednesday night.

            Gilgeous-Alexander was 8 of 16 on field goals and 13 of 15 on free throws. The first-time All-Star played just three quarters because Oklahoma City was up 116-78 heading into the fourth.











            Thunder guard Josh Giddey said coach Mark Daigneault helped the team stay focused. 

            “Guys know the break’s coming up and it’s easy to look past it and kind of brush this game off and just get through it and head into the break,"" Giddey said. ""But coach really emphasized running the finish line. I think we did a really good job of that tonight.”

            The Thunder enter the break with a 28-29 record after finishing last season 24-58. They are positioned to make a run at a playoff spot in the second half of the season.

            “We’re aware of the race for the play-in and the playoff spots. ... Every game we can get, we need,” Gilgeous-Alexander said.

            Lu Dort scored 15 points, Jalen Williams had 13 and Jaylin Williams added eight points and a season-high 16 rebounds for the Thunder, who posted their largest victory margin of the season.

            “We didn’t settle tonight,” Daigneault said. “Transition, we got out and ran. Offensively, we hit the paint. We got to the line a ton. We got to the rim and we sprayed the ball for open shots. I thought we made the right play the majority of the night. So credit to the guys who played together on that end.”

            Jabari Smith Jr. scored 15 points and Jalen Green added 14 for the Rockets, who lost their seventh straight game and enter the break with the worst record in the NBA.

            “I’m going to take some time over the break and not think about it for a little while,” Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. ""But then I am going to take a good amount of the break and really kind of figure out what the next 20, however many games looks like. And maybe there’ll be some some different things, different rotations, different schemes at times.” 

            Gilgeous-Alexander scored 16 points in the first half to help Oklahoma City take a 76-54 lead. 

            The Thunder continued to dominate, outscoring the Rockets 40-24 in the third quarter to put the game out of reach. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 13 points in the period.

            TIP-INS

            Rockets: G Jae'Sean Tate was issued a technical foul in the first quarter after he disagreed with a foul that was called against him. C Alperen Sengun and F/C Usman Garuba were called for technicals later in the quarter. ... G Kevin Porter Jr. missed his 17th straight game with a bruised left foot. ... Garuba was issued a Flagrant 1 for a push in the fourth quarter.

            Thunder: Oklahoma City was called for defensive three seconds twice in the first quarter. ... Held the Rockets to 22.7% shooting in the first quarter. ... Held the Rockets to 33.7% shooting.

            THUNDER DEBUT

            Thunder forward/center Dario Saric debuted after he was acquired in a trade with the Phoenix Suns. He had 12 points and five rebounds in 14 minutes.

            “I thought he was good,"" Daigneault said. ""Plays the right way. Certainly has a great feel for the game stylistically. Just a guy that you don’t have to over coach what we’re doing and stuff. He just kind of plays basketball, figures things out.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811950,"North Korea's Kim breaks ground for housing, farm projects","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un attended groundbreaking ceremonies for new housing and farming projects, which are part of his push for domestic achievements as the country’s economic isolation deepens amid his defiant pursuit of nuclear arms. 

            North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim broke ground Wednesday for the construction of a huge greenhouse farm in the outskirts of the capital, Pyongyang, where senior North Korean official Jo Yong Won in a speech said that providing Pyongyang residents with “fresh vegetables in all seasons” was a “top priority.” 

            Kim also attended a ceremony marking the start of second-stage construction project to build 10,000 new homes in Pyongyang’s Hwasong district. The project is part of broader plans to supply 50,000 new homes in the capital under a five-year national development plan that runs through 2025. 











            Experts say North Korea has severe shortages in quality housing that deepened over decades of economic decay. But living conditions are much better in capital Pyongyang, where Kim in past years has pushed huge development projects that upgraded housing for elites and changed the city’s skyline.

            Kim Tok Hun, premier of North Korea’s Cabinet, gave a speech encouraging the “army-civilian builders” to produce “eye-opening miracles in the construction of the capital city in the great era of Kim Jong Un.” He stressed that the construction should be “carried out without fail” in the face of unspecified “harsh difficulties.” 

            The ceremonies came a week after Kim Jong Un staged a massive military parade in Pyongyang where troops rolled out around a dozen intercontinental ballistic missiles — an unprecedented number despite limited resources while diplomacy remains stalled. 

            But the costs of Kim’s nuclear push appear to be piling up. North Korea’s ruling Korean Workers’ Party is planning to hold a major meeting this month to discuss the “urgent” task of improving agricultural production as outside experts and officials say the country’s food insecurity could be getting serious. 

            Already battered by decades of mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over Kim’s nuclear ambitions, the North Korean economy took a further hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the country to shield its poor health care system with stringent border controls that significantly reduced trade with China, its main ally and economic lifeline. 

            During a December political conference, ruling party members identified key economic projects for 2023 that emphasized construction and agricultural activities — focuses that are less dependent on trade as industrial production has been decimated by sanctions and halted imports of factory materials.

            State media reports on the latest meeting of North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament in January hinted that Kim’s government was still struggling to revive the moribund economy.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un attended groundbreaking ceremonies for new housing and farming projects, which are part of his push for domestic achievements as the country’s economic isolation deepens amid his defiant pursuit of nuclear arms.North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim broke ground Wednesday for the construction of a huge greenhouse farm in the outskirts of the capital, Pyongyang, where senior North Korean official Jo Yong Won in a speech said that providing Pyongyang residents with “fresh vegetables in all seasons” was a “top priority.”Kim also attended a ceremony marking the start of second-stage construction project to build 10,000 new homes in Pyongyang’s Hwasong district.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811951,"AP sources: Irish to promote Parker to OC, hire Guidugli","Notre Dame is promoting tight ends coach Gerard Parker to offensive coordinator and working to hire Wisconsin assistant Gino Guidugli as quarterbacks coach, two people with knowledge of the decisions told The Associated Press on Wednesday night.

            The people spoke on condition of anonymity because deals were still being finalized and needed university approval. 

            Football Scoop first reported Parker would be Notre Dame's offensive coordinator.











            Fighting Irish coach Marcus Freeman was forced to retool his offensive staff following the departure this month of offensive coordinator Tommy Rees to Alabama, where he will hold the same position.

            Freeman spoke to Utah offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig about the position, but the school could not come to an agreement with him after he visited the South Bend, Indiana, campus last weekend.

            Instead, Freeman turned to two coaches he knows well.

            Parker joined Notre Dame's staff last year after Freeman was elevated to head coach to replace Brian Kelly. Parker had been offensive coordinator at West Virginia for the previous two years.

            He and Freeman previously worked together as assistants at Purdue from 2013-16.

            Guidugli and Freeman worked together at Cincinnati as assistants under head coach Luke Fickell from 2017-20 before Freeman left to become Notre Dame's defensive coordinator in 2021.

            Guidugli was offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Bearcats last season and followed Fickell to Wisconsin, where he was set to be receivers coach and passing game coordinator for the Badgers under offensive coordinator Phil Longo.

            Freeman will still have one more opening to fill on his offensive staff. Veteran offensive line coach Harry Hiestand announced his retirement this week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811967,Green helps Nuggets go into break with 118-109 win over Mavs,"DENVER (AP) — Reserve Jeff Green scored a season-high 24 points, Nikola Jokic notched his 21st triple-double of the season and the Denver Nuggets headed into the All-Star break with a 118-109 victory over the short-handed Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night.

            Nikola Jokic finished with 14 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists for the Western Conference-leading Nuggets, who moved to an NBA-best 27-4 at home this season. Michael Porter Jr. hit five 3-pointers and finished with 22 points. 

            “For us to continue to find ways to win and have different guys step up every night, I think it speaks to our chemistry, our depth,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We’ve got a really good team in there.”











            Luka Doncic had 37 points in leading a banged-up Dallas team that was missing guard Kyrie Irving due to lower-back tightness. Doncic and Irving have played alongside each other in two games since Irving was acquired as part of a deal with Brooklyn on Feb. 6. 

             The Nuggets led by 21 in the fourth quarter, only to see the Mavericks cut it to 105-95 with 5:50 remaining on Christian Wood's layup. Soon after, Porter blocked a shot on one end, raced back and hit a 3-pointer on the other to gain some breathing room. 

            Where it really got away from the Mavs, coach Jason Kidd conceded, was in the second, when the Nuggets broke open a one-point game with a 35-19 quarter.

            “You’re sitting in a good place against the best team in the West and so we have to look at doing a better job,” Kidd said. 

            The two teams split their four-game season series. 

            View Denver as a favorite?

            “When you have a guy like Jokic on your team, you're the favorite,"" Doncic said. 

            Jokic joined some exclusive company by going over 500 assists and 500 rebounds before the All-Star break. The other NBA players to accomplish the feat were Russell Westbrook (three times, ’16-17, ’17-18, ’18-19) and Oscar Robertson (’61-62).

            Jokic, the two-time reigning MVP, remains on pace to average a triple-double this season.

            “He makes it look like a walk in the park,” recently acquired backup center Thomas Bryant said of Jokic's ease with triple-doubles. “It’s not easy at all.” 

            Doncic's big night was his 65th career game with 35 or more points. Only LeBron James had more (87) before his 24th birthday. Doncic turns 24 on Feb. 28.

            TIP-INS

            Malone made sure to remind his team the All-Star break didn’t begin until 11 p.m. — well after their game. They listened. 

            “Times have changed, guys get their private jets running, waiting to go somewhere,” cracked Malone, who will coach Team LeBron at the All-Star Game. 

            COLORADO KID

            Backup guard Reggie Jackson jumped at the chance to sign with the Nuggets and play close to home. Jackson, who grew up down the road in Colorado Springs, agreed to a deal with Denver on Tuesday. He wasn't in uniform against Dallas. 

            The 32-year-old Jackson's favorite player as a kid was Chauncey Billups, the Denver native who went to the University of Colorado before embarking on a long NBA career. 

            Jackson will wear No. 7 with Denver — a number Billups wore in 2009 while with the Nuggets.

Michael Porter Jr. hit five 3-pointers and finished with 22 points.“For us to continue to find ways to win and have different guys step up every night, I think it speaks to our chemistry, our depth,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We’ve got a really good team in there.”Luka Doncic had 37 points in leading a banged-up Dallas team that was missing guard Kyrie Irving due to lower-back tightness. Doncic and Irving have played alongside each other in two games since Irving was acquired as part of a deal with Brooklyn on Feb. 6.The Nuggets led by 21 in the fourth quarter, only to see the Mavericks cut it to 105-95 with 5:50 remaining on Christian Wood's layup. Soon after, Porter blocked a shot on one end, raced back and hit a 3-pointer on the other to gain some breathing room.Where it really got away from the Mavs, coach Jason Kidd conceded, was in the second, when the Nuggets broke open a one-point game with a 35-19 quarter.“You’re sitting in a good place against the best team in the West and so we have to look at doing a better job,” Kidd said.The two teams split their four-game season series.View Denver as a favorite?“When you have a guy like Jokic on your team, you're the favorite,"" Doncic said.Jokic joined some exclusive company by going over 500 assists and 500 rebounds before the All-Star break. The other NBA players to accomplish the feat were Russell Westbrook (three times, ’16-17, ’17-18, ’18-19) and Oscar Robertson (’61-62).Jokic, the two-time reigning MVP, remains on pace to average a triple-double this season.“He makes it look like a walk in the park,” recently acquired backup center Thomas Bryant said of Jokic's ease with triple-doubles. “It’s not easy at all.”Doncic's big night was his 65th career game with 35 or more points. Only LeBron James had more (87) before his 24th birthday. Doncic turns 24 on Feb. 28.TIP-INSMavericks: F Justin Holiday was signed Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811969,"The Blonds close out NYFW in bejeweled, glitzy glamour","NEW YORK (AP) — The Blonds shined like gaudy, shimmering jewels in its fall/winter debut, closing out New York Fashion Week for the season.

            Held at the Gallery at Spring Studios in New York on Wednesday evening, colorful, glistening jewels set the tone for the night.

            One of the Blonds’ designers, Phillipe Blond opened the show with a dramatic runway walk in a black skintight jumpsuit with “the Blondes” sprawled all over it. The night was all about big hair, shoes and jewels and that’s exactly what Blond wore and the rest of the fun, twinkly line illustrated.











            The designer also sported a large heart-shaped jewel around his neck while carrying a faux fur floor-length coat designed by independent designer Adrienne Landau.

            Each model that followed Blond's opening became increasingly more camp and grand, playing into old Hollywood glamour reminiscent of the era of Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor's obsession with jewelry was one of the collection's inspirations. Movies such as “Valley of the Dolls,” “Breakfast at Tiffany's” and “Butterfield 8"" played a part in the larger vision for the line.

            “It’s all about celebration of color, sparkle, glamour. And this is sort of a tribute to Elizabeth Taylor, one of our style icons. And the idea of falling in and out of love,” David Blond said before the show. 

            The Blonds partnered with Preciosa for the crystals seen in the show, Christian Louboutin for the custom shoes and Oribe Hair Care for the quaffed wigs, Blond said.

            Some standout pieces were a two-piece emerald green velvet dress with big jewels placed right on the bust and below the stomach on the bunched-up skirt. Another standout look was a mini purple Y2K-inspired sequin dress paired with knee-high Louboutin heels. 

            A white cowl hooded dress with an asymmetrical slit up the leg with a diamond-shaped jewel in the center and a structured black mini-velvet dress lined with silver jewels and a purple jewel on the bust of the dress left the crowd dazzled.

            Model and mother of Elon Musk, Maye Musk was in attendance: ""Well, I’m feeling the most excited about tonight, of course, because I can really go to extremes, which is unexpected,"" she said. “I’m going to be 75 in six weeks. And it’s to show that, you know, we’re still relevant. And I’ve been to some lovely shows and everybody is wonderful. And I feel very, very fortunate.”

            Actor and model Dominique Jackson closed out the show in what was the most jaw-dropping look of the evening. Jackson stunned in a black corset with a giant sparkling diamond strapped to her chest, fishnet tights, platform Louboutin heels, and a big white faux fur coat all the while effortlessly sporting a '70s style afro.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811972,"Kunc, No. 19 Iowa St beat another rated team, top No. 22 TCU","AMES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger figured the time was right to try something new following losses in four of five games.

            So he inserted Aljaz Kunc into the starting lineup for the first time in almost two months to give the team a different look and give Caleb Grill's sore back a rest.

            Kunc responded with career highs of 22 points and five 3-pointers, and No. 19 Iowa State never trailed in a 70-59 win over 22nd-ranked TCU on Wednesday night.











            “Man, he stepped up in a major way,” Otzelberger said. “Offensively he was so effective. He makes 3s. He's a winning player. You have him out there and you can tell the ball moves better. He just understands how to play and what we need, and then defensively and on the glass he does such a good job. It's great seeing him back playing the way we know he can play.”

            The Cyclones won their nation-best seventh game against a Top 25 opponent after losing 64-56 at home to Oklahoma State last weekend.

            “I liked what I saw from ‘Jaz’ even though we didn't play great Saturday,” Otzelberger said. “I thought he was a bright spot and thought we could use that energy and enthusiam.”

            Jaren Holmes added 16 points for the Cyclones (17-8, 8-5), who took sole possession of fourth place in the Big 12, one game behind co-leaders Kansas, Texas and Baylor.

            TCU (17-9, 6-7) lost its fourth straight while playing its fifth game without injured conference preseason player of the year and leading scorer Mike Miles Jr.

            Kunc, playing his fourth game since missing six weeks with a broken finger, made four of his 3s in the first half and hit his fifth midway through the second to restore the Cyclones' double-digit lead after TCU erased much of a 21-point deficit.

            “When he's knocking down shots like he did today, it opens up the floor and takes a lot of pressure off certain guys,” center Osun Osunniyi said. “It sets the tone for the game. They can’t sag off and help in the paint as much because we have shooters.”

            TCU coach Jamie Dixon said the Horned Frogs lost track of Kunc too many times.

            “When we guarded, he fell down and shot an air ball,” Dixon said. ""You can't give them catch-and-shoots. He’s a good player when you leave him open, and we left him open plenty. Congratulations to him.”

            The Horned Frogs got 15 points from Shahada Wells and 13 from Micah Peavy.

            The Cyclones swept the season series. Gabe Kalscheur's 3-pointer with 2 seconds to play gave Iowa State a 69-67 win at TCU on Jan. 7. 

            There was no drama in the return game at Hilton Coliseum. Iowa State got out to a quick 15-2 lead, withstood a TCU run that made it a one-point game and then outscored the Horned Frogs 29-12 spanning the halves to win for the first time in three games.

            BIG PICTURE

            TCU: The Horned Frogs are on their longest losing streak since they dropped four in a row to end the 2020-21 season. Help is on the way. Miles, who averages 18 points per game, is expected to return Saturday for a home game against Oklahoma State.

            “We're not playing as good as we've played. We're searching,” Dixon said. “We haven’t gotten it done on the road against good teams.”

            Iowa State: The Cyclones, one of the top defensive teams in the nation, never let TCU's vaunted fast break get going and have won 11 straight when holding their opponent under 60 points.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Iowa State entered the game off losses in four of five games but was in total control and could make a big jump if it knocks off No. 12 Kansas State on Saturday. The Horned Frogs' status as a Top 25 team is in peril as they began a three-games-in-six-days stretch.

            HOME SWEET HILTON

            The game was the 800th in program history in Hilton Coliseum, the Cyclones' home arena since 1971. The Cyclones own a 595-205 record at Hilton and are 13-1 at home this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811973,"Philippines quake causes hospital evacuation, minor damage","MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A strong earthquake rocked a central Philippine province on Thursday, sending people out of their homes at night, prompting dozens of patients to be evacuated from a hospital and causing minor damage to a government coliseum and business establishments, officials said.

            There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage from the magnitude 6 quake that was set off by a local fault line at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), about 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) west of the coastal town of Batuan in Masbate province, officials said.

            The quake struck about two hours after midnight, rousing many people from their sleep, Masbate provincial disaster-mitigation officer Adonis Dilao said.











            “The first jolt was really strong followed by shaking that woke me up and my baby,” Red Cross officer MJ Oxemer told The Associated Press by telephone from the provincial capital of Masbate city. “We could hear the rumbling of the ground.”

            Dozens of patients from a Masbate provincial hospital were evacuated but later brought back after the quake caused some cracks in the three-story building. A part of the ceiling on a small government coliseum in Masbate city was also damaged, Dilao said.

            Cracks were also spotted in the concrete pillars of some business establishments, including grocery and drug stores in Masbate city’s downtown area, and in some houses, Dilao told The AP by telephone.

            Although business owners have discretion when to reopen, Dilao said they should heed the advice of government safety inspectors because at least two strong aftershocks were felt following the quake. “Unlike typhoons, which can be predicted to give people time to brace, earthquakes can just suddenly hit,” he said.

            The quake knocked out power in many areas of Masbate and nearby Ticao island, and some school classes were suspended, the Office of Civil Defense said, adding that damage assessments by local officials were underway.

            The Philippines lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world’s earthquakes occur. Each year it is also hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.

A part of the ceiling on a small government coliseum in Masbate city was also damaged, Dilao said.Cracks were also spotted in the concrete pillars of some business establishments, including grocery and drug stores in Masbate city’s downtown area, and in some houses, Dilao told The AP by telephone.Although business owners have discretion when to reopen, Dilao said they should heed the advice of government safety inspectors because at least two strong aftershocks were felt following the quake. “Unlike typhoons, which can be predicted to give people time to brace, earthquakes can just suddenly hit,” he said.The quake knocked out power in many areas of Masbate and nearby Ticao island, and some school classes were suspended, the Office of Civil Defense said, adding that damage assessments by local officials were underway.The Philippines lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world’s earthquakes occur.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811974,Buie's late basket lifts Northwestern over No. 14 Indiana,"EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) — Boo Buie drove hard toward the rim, pulled up for a short hook shot and watched his tiebreaking basket swish through the net. Moments later, Northwestern celebrated another win over a ranked opponent. 

            
                Buie scored with two seconds remaining and the surprising Wildcats followed up their first victory over a top-ranked team by beating No. 14 Indiana 64-62 on Wednesday night.

            After defeating Purdue on Sunday for the program’s first win against an opponent ranked No. 1 in the AP poll, the Wildcats (19-7, 10-5 Big Ten) came away with another big victory after the Hoosiers (18-8, 9-6) rallied from 19 down at halftime to tie it in the final minute.











            “More people need to wake up,” Buie said. “This isn't luck. It can't be luck at this point.”

            Northwestern took sole possession of second place in the conference standings with its program-record fourth win over a ranked opponent this season. It's quite a turnaround after five straight losing years.

            There was so much speculation about coach Chris Collins' future after last season the school released a statement saying he would return. Now, he's on the verge of leading Northwestern to its second NCAA Tournament in seven years.

            “Purdue was a great win, but it's been building throughout the year,” Collins said. “If you lose all those games, then you start to have negative thoughts. And we've been through that in the past. It's almost like, let's invent a new way to lose tonight. But now, our guys are finding ways to win because they believe they should, they believe in each other.""

            Northwestern hadn’t beaten Top 25 teams in consecutive games since January 2009. And this one sure wasn’t easy in the end.

            TIGHT FINISH

            The Wildcats led 62-58 with 44 seconds remaining after Buie drove for a layup off a turnover. But Indiana wasn’t finished.

            Former Wildcat Miller Kopp — who had profane chants directed his way by Northwestern fans — stole a pass by Robbie Beran, leading to a tying layup by Trayce Jackson-Davis with 28 seconds left. Buie then buried the winner over Trey Galloway with two seconds left, and Jalen Hood-Schifino’s heave as time expired hit the rim.

            Buie had 21 points, six rebounds and four assists. Chase Audige scored 14, and Northwestern augmented its case for the school's second NCAA Tournament berth with its fourth straight win and seventh in nine games.

            Jackson-Davis led Indiana with 23 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. But the Hoosiers came up short after winning eight of nine.

            Hood-Schifino and Race Thompson each scored 13.

            “At the end of the day, Boo made a hell of a shot,” Indiana coach Mike Woodson said. “You've got to give them credit. They get us down 19, you can't spot a team 19 at home and expect to win all the time. ... I thought we were too hyped, pumped for the game.”

            BIG START

            Audige and Buie scored 11 apiece in the first half, and Northwestern led by 21 before heading to the locker room up 39-20.

            Audige nailed back-to-back 3-pointers to give the Wildcats a 17-12 lead and spark a 17-1 run that delighted rowdy student sections behind each basket.

            Indiana's bench and Woodson got called for technical fouls as the coach argued that Buie should have been whistled for traveling, leading to four free throws for the Wildcats' guard. And Northwestern continued to pour it on from there.

            Buie capped the run when he nailed a 3 to make it 28-13 with just over seven minutes remaining in the half. 

            Brooks Barnhizer made it 39-18 with two free throws in the closing minute. Jackson-Davis made two for the Hoosiers in the closing seconds, and Woodson had more heated words for the officials before heading to the locker room with his team trailing by 19.

            BIG PICTURE

            Indiana: The Hoosiers couldn't overcome their poor start or shaky shooting. They were 3 of 11 on 3-pointers.

            Northwestern: The Wildcats continued to make a case for a spot in the Top 25 as well as the NCAA Tournament, if they haven't clinched one already. “We’re going to the tourney, so that’s great,” Collins said. “Now, we can just focus on getting better and continuing to figure out how we can be the best we can be and shore some things up.""

            Tolu Smith scored in the paint to get the Bulldogs within 66-62 with 1:21 remaining. Kentucky then missed a couple of 3-pointers and had a jumper blocked by Cameron Matthews before giving possession back to Mississippi State with 49 seconds left.

            Shakeel Moore hit a jumper to make it 66-64 with 39 seconds left. The Bulldogs forced a missed 3-pointer as the shot clock ran out on Kentucky's ensuing possession but Livingston came up with the offensive rebound with seven seconds left, was fouled and made both free throws. 











            Mississippi State extended the game at the free-throw line but eventually Tshiebwe made a pair to ice the game.

            Livingston had 13 points (6 of 6 from the line), with five rebounds, three assists and two steals for Kentucky (17-9, 8-5 SEC) and Antonio Reeves scored 14 points. Tshiebwe had seven of Kentucky's 18 offensive rebounds.

            Smith scored 22 points on 8-of-9 shooting and 6 of 7 free throws. Cameron Matthews had 11 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Moore had 14 points and Dashawn Davis added 13 for the Bulldogs (17-9, 5-8).

            The Wildcats led for 17 minutes of the first half, but Mississippi State fought back from a 17-point deficit to trail 36-35 at halftime after Matthews beat the buzzer with a 3-pointer.

            Kentucky had won six of seven before losing to Arkansas and Georgia in back-to-back games. Mississippi State had won five in a row.

            The Wildcats beat Mississippi State for the 17th time in 18 games in 13 seasons with John Calipari as their coach.

            The team departed from Wonju Airport, in South Korea’s Gangwon Province early Thursday morning, Liberty Times reported. The C-130 was the first to land at 9:00 a.m., while the rest of the T-50s arrived in waves between 9:45 a.m. and 10:25 a.m.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4811999,Judge slaps $335K penalty on Ronaldo accuser's Vegas lawyer,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A Las Vegas lawyer has been hit with a $335,000 penalty for pressing a bid in U.S. courts to force Cristiano Ronaldo to pay millions of dollars more than the $375,000 in hush money he paid to a Nevada woman who claimed the international soccer star raped her in Las Vegas in 2009.

            “I find that Ronaldo would not have incurred a majority of the fees and costs that he spent on this litigation absent plaintiff’s counsel’s bad faith,"" U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey said in a scathing, 18-page ruling.

            The judge in Las Vegas held plaintiff Kathryn Mayorga’s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, personally responsible for paying Ronaldo's attorneys, led by Peter Christiansen and Kendelee Works.











            Stovall and associates in the case, Ross Moynihan and Larissa Drohobyczer, did not immediately respond Wednesday to email and telephone messages about the ruling issued Tuesday.

            In a related case, a Nevada state court judge who nearly made long-sealed and long-fought documents public by mistake in August rejected Stovall's bid for a court order to unseal crucial documents, including a Las Vegas police report about Mayorga's rape complaint against Ronaldo.

            “The decision regarding confidentiality is final,” Clark County District Court Judge Jasmin Lilly-Spells said in her ruling, also issued Tuesday. 

            Lilly-Spells pointed to Dorsey's earlier decisions to shield from public view the results of police investigations, a 2010 confidentiality agreement between Ronaldo and Mayorga and allegedly stolen records of attorney-client discussions between Ronaldo and his lawyers.

            The New York Times began a fight to release the records before Dorsey in federal court and the Las Vegas Review-Journal took the case to Lilly-Spells in state court.

            Christiansen welcomed the federal and state court rulings and earlier findings in the case by a U.S. magistrate judge in Las Vegas, saying they showed “hard-working judges don’t allow lawyers to abuse the system.”

            But the rulings aren't quite the end of more than four years of legal battles.

            Stovall is asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn Dorsey's dismissal last June of Mayorga’s civil lawsuit, filed in September 2018 in state court and moved in January 2019 to federal court. If Stovall also appeals the monetary sanction, the appellate judges might consider the matters together.

            The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they are victims of sexual assault, but Mayorga gave consent through Stovall and Drohobyczer to make her name public.

            Mayorga is a former model and teacher who lives in the Las Vegas area. Her lawsuit said she met Ronaldo at a nightclub and went with him and other people to his hotel suite, where she alleged he assaulted her in a bedroom. She was 25 at the time and he was 24.

            Ronaldo, now 38, is one of the most recognizable sports stars in the world. He has captained the national team of his home country, Portugal, and played professionally in Spain for Real Madrid and in Italy for Turin-based club Juventus. 

            In December he accepted a lucrative offer to end his second stretch at English Premier League club Manchester United and play for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr. The deal could pay Ronaldo up to $200 million per year through June 2025, according to media reports. That would make him the highest-paid soccer player in history. 

            Mayorga's lawsuit alleged Ronaldo or his associates violated the confidentiality agreement they reached almost a decade before the German news outlet Der Spiegel in 2017 published an article titled “Cristiano Ronaldo’s Secret” based on documents obtained from “whistleblower portal Football Leaks.”

            Stovall maintained Mayorga never wanted to be named publicly and didn’t break the hush-money settlement. Her lawsuit sought to void it, accusing Ronaldo and his representatives of conspiracy, defamation, breach of contract, coercion and fraud. 

            In documents filed in 2021, Stovall tallied damages at $25 million plus attorney fees.

            Christiansen and Works fought on several fronts for years to keep the confidentiality agreement out of public view. They alleged Stovall improperly used Mayorga to try to capitalize on Ronaldo's fame and fortune.

            Stovall argued that Mayorga, now 39, had learning disabilities as a child and was so pressured by Ronaldo’s attorneys and representatives that she was in no condition to consent to dropping a criminal complaint she filed shortly after her encounter with Ronaldo and accepting the $375,000.

            Ronaldo’s legal team does not dispute Ronaldo met Mayorga and they had sex in June 2009, but maintained it was consensual and not rape.

            Dorsey's ruling this week summarized lawsuits that Stovall filed as “attempts to unwind a years-old settlement agreement regarding serious allegations of potentially criminal acts, fraud, and civil conspiracy among an internationally known athlete and a team of ‘fixers’ that spanned multiple continents.”

            Stovall “sought out and relied on the cyber-hacked, privileged documents of Cristiano Ronaldo’s attorneys to resurrect Mayorga’s long-since-released claims, tainting this case"" beyond redemption, the judge said. She added she “unenthusiastically” dismissed the lawsuit ""as a sanction for that bad-faith lawyering.”

            Las Vegas police reopened the rape investigation in 2018 after Mayorga’s lawsuit was filed. But the elected prosecutor in Las Vegas decided in 2019 that too much time had passed and evidence failed to show Mayorga’s accusation could be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

            Dorsey’s ruling on Tuesday was notable for the amount of the penalty she imposed — just $40,000 less than the amount Stovall has acknowledged Mayorga received in 2010.

            The judge rejected another $276,000 in court fees and costs that Ronaldo’s attorneys sought, but found their billing amounts — $850 per hour for Christiansen, $500 per hour for Works and $350 per hour for others — “reasonable” in the Las Vegas legal market.LAS VEGAS (AP) — A Las Vegas lawyer has been hit with a $335,000 penalty for pressing a bid in U.S. courts to force Cristiano Ronaldo to pay millions of dollars more than the $375,000 in hush money he paid to a Nevada woman who claimed the international soccer star raped her in Las Vegas in 2009.“I find that Ronaldo would not have incurred a majority of the fees and costs that he spent on this litigation absent plaintiff’s counsel’s bad faith,"" U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey said in a scathing, 18-page ruling.The judge in Las Vegas held plaintiff Kathryn Mayorga’s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, personally responsible for paying Ronaldo's attorneys, led by Peter Christiansen and Kendelee Works.Stovall and associates in the case, Ross Moynihan and Larissa Drohobyczer, did not immediately respond Wednesday to email and telephone messages about the ruling issued Tuesday.In a related case, a Nevada state court judge who nearly made long-sealed and long-fought documents public by mistake in August rejected Stovall's bid for a court order to unseal crucial documents, including a Las Vegas police report about Mayorga's rape complaint against Ronaldo.“The decision regarding confidentiality is final,” Clark County District Court Judge Jasmin Lilly-Spells said in her ruling, also issued Tuesday.Lilly-Spells pointed to Dorsey's earlier decisions to shield from public view the results of police investigations, a 2010 confidentiality agreement between Ronaldo and Mayorga and allegedly stolen records of attorney-client discussions between Ronaldo and his lawyers.The New York Times began a fight to release the records before Dorsey in federal court and the Las Vegas Review-Journal took the case to Lilly-Spells in state court.Christiansen welcomed the federal and state court rulings and earlier findings in the case by a U.S. magistrate judge in Las Vegas, saying they showed “hard-working judges don’t allow lawyers to abuse the system.”But the rulings aren't quite the end of more than four years of legal battles.Stovall is asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn Dorsey's dismissal last June of Mayorga’s civil lawsuit, filed in September 2018 in state court and moved in January 2019 to federal court. If Stovall also appeals the monetary sanction, the appellate judges might consider the matters together.The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they are victims of sexual assault, but Mayorga gave consent through Stovall and Drohobyczer to make her name public.Mayorga is a former model and teacher who lives in the Las Vegas area. Her lawsuit said she met Ronaldo at a nightclub and went with him and other people to his hotel suite, where she alleged he assaulted her in a bedroom. She was 25 at the time and he was 24.Ronaldo, now 38, is one of the most recognizable sports stars in the world. He has captained the national team of his home country, Portugal, and played professionally in Spain for Real Madrid and in Italy for Turin-based club Juventus.In December he accepted a lucrative offer to end his second stretch at English Premier League club Manchester United and play for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr. The deal could pay Ronaldo up to $200 million per year through June 2025, according to media reports. That would make him the highest-paid soccer player in history.Mayorga's lawsuit alleged Ronaldo or his associates violated the confidentiality agreement they reached almost a decade before the German news outlet Der Spiegel in 2017 published an article titled “Cristiano Ronaldo’s Secret” based on documents obtained from “whistleblower portal Football Leaks.”Stovall maintained Mayorga never wanted to be named publicly and didn’t break the hush-money settlement. Her lawsuit sought to void it, accusing Ronaldo and his representatives of conspiracy, defamation, breach of contract, coercion and fraud.In documents filed in 2021, Stovall tallied damages at $25 million plus attorney fees.Christiansen and Works fought on several fronts for years to keep the confidentiality agreement out of public view. They alleged Stovall improperly used Mayorga to try to capitalize on Ronaldo's fame and fortune.Stovall argued that Mayorga, now 39, had learning disabilities as a child and was so pressured by Ronaldo’s attorneys and representatives that she was in no condition to consent to dropping a criminal complaint she filed shortly after her encounter with Ronaldo and accepting the $375,000.Ronaldo’s legal team does not dispute Ronaldo met Mayorga and they had sex in June 2009, but maintained it was consensual and not rape.Dorsey's ruling this week summarized lawsuits that Stovall filed as “attempts to unwind a years-old settlement agreement regarding serious allegations of potentially criminal acts, fraud, and civil conspiracy among an internationally known athlete and a team of ‘fixers’ that spanned multiple continents.”Stovall “sought out and relied on the cyber-hacked, privileged documents of Cristiano Ronaldo’s attorneys to resurrect Mayorga’s long-since-released claims, tainting this case"" beyond redemption, the judge said. She added she “unenthusiastically” dismissed the lawsuit ""as a sanction for that bad-faith lawyering.”Las Vegas police reopened the rape investigation in 2018 after Mayorga’s lawsuit was filed. But the elected prosecutor in Las Vegas decided in 2019 that too much time had passed and evidence failed to show Mayorga’s accusation could be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.Dorsey’s ruling on Tuesday was notable for the amount of the penalty she imposed — just $40,000 less than the amount Stovall has acknowledged Mayorga received in 2010.The judge rejected another $276,000 in court fees and costs that Ronaldo’s attorneys sought, but found their billing amounts — $850 per hour for Christiansen, $500 per hour for Works and $350 per hour for others — “reasonable” in the Las Vegas legal market.",2023/02/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812000,China blasts US over response to Chinese balloon incursion,"BEIJING (AP) — China's ceremonial parliament has accused American lawmakers of trampling on the sovereignty of other nations after the U.S. passed a measure condemning a suspected Chinese spy balloon's intrusion into U.S. airspace.

            The statement issued Thursday by the National People's Congress's Foreign Affairs Committee repeated Beijing’s insistence that the balloon was an unmanned civilian weather research airship, a claim the U.S. has dismissed citing its flight route and payload of surveillance equipment.

            While China at first expressed regret over the Feb. 4 incident, it has toughened its rhetoric in a further sign of how badly relations between the sides have deteriorated in recent years. 











            On Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said it will take measures against U.S. entities somehow related to the downing of the balloon, without giving details.

            The resolution earlier passed unanimously by the U.S. House of Representatives “deliberately exaggerated the ‘China threat,'"" the Foreign Relations Committee statement said.

            That was “purely malicious hype and political manipulation,"" it said. “Some U.S. Congress politicians fanned the flames, fully exposing their sinister designs to oppose China and contain China.""

            “In fact, it is the United States that wantonly interferes in other countries’ internal affairs, violates their sovereignty, and conducts surveillance on other countries,"" it said. 

            A range of Chinese government departments have issued daily protests over how the U.S. handled the issue, accusing Washington of overreacting and violating “the spirit of international law."" Beijing has offered no details on what company or government department was responsible for the giant balloon, the remnants of which are being sent to an FBI lab for analysis. 

            Along with Congress's passing of the resolution, the U.S. has sanctioned six Chinese entities it said are linked to Beijing’s aerospace programs. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also canceled a visit to Beijing, putting an abrupt freeze on what some had seen as momentum for a stabilization in relations that have plunged to their lowest in decades amid disputes over trade, human rights, Taiwan and China’s claim to the South China Sea. 

            The House resolution condemned China for a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty and efforts to “deceive the international community through false claims about its intelligence collection campaigns.""

            U.S. officials have said China operates a fleet of such balloons, which are a relatively inexpensive and difficult-to-detect method of gathering intelligence.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812002,Trump election probe grand jury believes some witnesses lied,"ATLANTA (AP) — A special grand jury investigating efforts by then-President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia says it believes ""one or more witnesses"" committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges.

            Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should “seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where the evidence is compelling,” according to portions of the special grand jury's final report that were released on Thursday.

            Those sections are silent on key details, including who the panel believes committed perjury and what other specific charges should be pursued. But it marks the first time the grand jurors' recommendations for criminal charges tied to the case have been made public. And it's a reminder of the intensifying legal challenges facing the former president as he ramps up his third White House bid amid multiple legal investigations.











            Trump is also under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for holding classified documents at his Florida estate. 

            The former president never testified before the special grand jury, meaning he is not among those who could have perjured themselves. But the report doesn't foreclose the possibility of other charges, and the case still poses particular challenges for Trump, in part because his actions in Georgia were so public. 

            Trump and his allies made unproven claims of widespread voter fraud and berated Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp for not acting to overturn his narrow loss to President Joe Biden in the state. 

            Willis has said since the beginning of the investigation two years ago that she was interested in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call in which Trump suggested to Raffensperger that he could “find” the votes needed to overturn his loss in the state.

            “All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,” Trump said during that call. “Because we won the state.”

            Trump has said repeatedly that his call with Raffensperger was “perfect,” and he told The Associated Press last month that he felt “very confident” that he would not be indicted. In a statement on Thursday, he continued to assert he did “absolutely nothing wrong.”

            In fact, he claimed on his social media platform, Truth Social, that the release had given him “Total exoneration,” though it did no such thing and portions having to do with recommended charges are still secret.

            State and federal officials, including Trump’s attorney general, have consistently said the election was secure and there was no evidence of significant fraud. After hearing “extensive testimony on the issue,” the special grand jury agreed in a unanimous vote that there was no widespread fraud in Georgia's election. 

            The grand jury, which Willis requested to aid her investigation, was seated in May and submitted its report to Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney on Dec. 15. The panel does not have the power to issue indictments. Instead, its report contains recommendations for Willis, who will ultimately decide whether to seek one or more indictments from a regular grand jury.

            Over the course of about seven months, the special grand jurors heard from 75 witnesses, among them Trump allies including former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Top Georgia officials, such as Raffensperger and Kemp, also appeared before the panel.

            Graham told reporters Thursday that he has not been contacted by authorities regarding his testimony. “I’m confident I testified openly and honestly,” he said.

            The partial release of the grand jury's report was ordered Monday by McBurney, who oversaw the special grand jury. During a hearing last month, prosecutors urged him not to release the report until they decide on charges, while a coalition of media organizations, including the AP, pushed for the entire report to be made public immediately.

            McBurney wrote in his Monday order that it’s not appropriate to release the full report now because it’s important to protect the due process rights of people for whom the grand jury recommended charges.

            While there were relatively few details in Thursday's release, it does provide some insight into the panel's process. The report’s introduction says an “overwhelming majority” of the information that the grand jury received “was delivered in person under oath.” It also noted that no one on the panel was an election law expert or criminal lawyer.

            Based on witnesses called to testify before the special grand jury, it is clear that Willis is focusing on several areas. Those include:

            — Phone calls by Trump and others to Georgia officials in the wake of the 2020 election.

            — A group of 16 Georgia Republicans who signed a certificate in December 2020 falsely stating that Trump had won the state and that they were the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors.

            — False allegations of election fraud made during meetings of state legislators at the Georgia Capitol in December 2020.

            — The copying of data and software from election equipment in rural Coffee County by a computer forensics team hired by Trump allies.

            
                — Alleged attempts to pressure Fulton County elections worker Ruby Freeman into falsely confessing to election fraud.

            — The abrupt resignation of the U.S. attorney in Atlanta in January 2021.

            Texas A&M (19-7, 11-2) drew within a game of conference leader and top-ranked Alabama (12-1) after No. 10 Tennessee (9-4) beat the Crimson Tide 68-59 earlier in the night.

            Dennis scored 14 points and had 11 rebounds and Tyrece Radford scored 12 for the Aggies who are off to their best conference start in program history. Reserve Andersson Garcia snared 10 rebounds for Texas A&M.

Arkansas missed its last six shots, missed its last three foul shots and committed a pair of turnovers.

            Hayden Hefner's 3-pointer at the horn before intermission carried through the break and ignited a 17-4 run that saw the Aggies turn a 33-21 deficit into a 38-37 lead within the first four minutes of the second half.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812004,Ingram gets 1st shutout; Coyotes beat Lightning 1-0 in SO,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Nick Schmaltz and Clayton Keller scored in the shootout, and Connor Ingram stopped 47 shots for his first career shutout as the Arizona Coyotes beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 1-0 on Wednesday night.

            Ingram made several stops on shots from point-blank range in the final 90 seconds of overtime and then stopped Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov in the shootout as the Coyotes extended their season-high point streak to seven games (4-0-3), the longest such current streak in the league.

            “No doubt about it,” Ingram said when asked if the shutout crossed his mind. “I'm not going to lie to you. Especially near the end of the game you start thinking about it. How many kids can say they had a shutout in the NHL? That's a life-long dream, and it definitely creeps in.”











            Brian Elliott made 26 saves for Tampa Bay, which had won three in a row and six of eight. The Lightning came in off an emotional 4-3 overtime win at Colorado on Tuesday night in a rematch of the 2022 Stanley Cup Final.

            The Coyotes split the season series against Tampa Bay and have beaten division leaders Boston, Carolina, Vegas and both 2022 Stanley Cup finalists at home in 5,000-seat Mullett Arena on the campus of Arizona State University. They are 12-8-2 at home.

            “That team is an unbelievable team,” said Keller, who entered with nine points in his last four games. “I love watching them play. When they have the puck they are fast. They defend hard. That's what we want to be one day, and that is when you want to play your best, when you are playing an unbelievable team like that.”

            The Coyotes’ Troy Stecher was penalized for hooking with 10 seconds left in overtime, and after a Tampa Bay timeout, Kucherov hit a post with 3 seconds remaining to send the game into a shootout. Kucherov beat Colorado with an overtime goal Tuesday. 

            Tampa Bay outshot the Coyotes 42-26 but had only five shots in the third period. The Lightning failed to convert on four power play opportunities.

            “It doesn’t help when games go into overtime and you have to de-ice,” Elliott said of flying from Denver to Phoenix. “It’s part of it. Sometimes that’s the fun of it as well. You can’t dwell on it. You have to embrace the challenge and go out there and try to win a game. We did a good job tonight. I though we generated a ton.""

            The Lightning showed no early ill effects from their second game in two nights, outshooting the Coyotes 21-7 in a scoreless first period. Ingram faced 12 shots as the Coyotes killed two Lightning power plays, and the Lightning also hit a post. Ingram briefly played without a stick on the Lightning's first power play.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Nick Schmaltz and Clayton Keller scored in the shootout, and Connor Ingram stopped 47 shots for his first career shutout as the Arizona Coyotes beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 1-0 on Wednesday night.Ingram made several stops on shots from point-blank range in the final 90 seconds of overtime and then stopped Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov in the shootout as the Coyotes extended their season-high point streak to seven games (4-0-3), the longest such current streak in the league.“No doubt about it,” Ingram said when asked if the shutout crossed his mind. “I'm not going to lie to you. Especially near the end of the game you start thinking about it. How many kids can say they had a shutout in the NHL? That's a life-long dream, and it definitely creeps in.”Brian Elliott made 26 saves for Tampa Bay, which had won three in a row and six of eight. The Lightning came in off an emotional 4-3 overtime win at Colorado on Tuesday night in a rematch of the 2022 Stanley Cup Final.The Coyotes split the season series against Tampa Bay and have beaten division leaders Boston, Carolina, Vegas and both 2022 Stanley Cup finalists at home in 5,000-seat Mullett Arena on the campus of Arizona State University. They are 12-8-2 at home.“That team is an unbelievable team,” said Keller, who entered with nine points in his last four games. “I love watching them play. When they have the puck they are fast. They defend hard. That's what we want to be one day, and that is when you want to play your best, when you are playing an unbelievable team like that.”The Coyotes’ Troy Stecher was penalized for hooking with 10 seconds left in overtime, and after a Tampa Bay timeout, Kucherov hit a post with 3 seconds remaining to send the game into a shootout. Kucherov beat Colorado with an overtime goal Tuesday.Tampa Bay outshot the Coyotes 42-26 but had only five shots in the third period. The Lightning failed to convert on four power play opportunities.“It doesn’t help when games go into overtime and you have to de-ice,” Elliott said of flying from Denver to Phoenix. “It’s part of it. Sometimes that’s the fun of it as well. You can’t dwell on it. You have to embrace the challenge and go out there and try to win a game. We did a good job tonight. I though we generated a ton.""The Lightning showed no early ill effects from their second game in two nights, outshooting the Coyotes 21-7 in a scoreless first period. Ingram faced 12 shots as the Coyotes killed two Lightning power plays, and the Lightning also hit a post. Ingram briefly played without a stick on the Lightning's first power play.“Ingy was outstanding,"" Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said. “That's the first step all the time, when you have great goaltending.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812006,How Ukraine war has shaped US planning for a China conflict,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As the war rages on in Ukraine, the United States is doing more than supporting an ally. It's learning lessons — with an eye toward a possible future clash with China.

            No one knows what the next U.S. major military conflict will be or whether the U.S. will send troops — as it did in Afghanistan and Iraq — or provide vast amounts of aid and expertise, as it has done with Ukraine.

            But China remains America's biggest concern. U.S. military officials say Beijing wants to be ready to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan by 2027, and the U.S. is the island democracy's chief ally and supplier of defense weapons.











            While there are key differences in geography and in the U.S. commitment to come to Taiwan’s defense, “there are clear parallels between the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan,” a Center for Strategic and International Studies report found last month. 

            A look at some of the lessons from the Ukraine war and how they could apply to a Taiwan conflict:

            ARM IN ADVANCE 

            Soon after Russian troops crossed into Ukraine last February, the U.S. and allies began sending massive amounts of weapons across the border from partner nations. 

            But Taiwan would need to be fully armed in advance, CSIS found in dozens of war scenarios it ran for its report. 

            ""The ‘Ukraine model’ cannot be replicated in Taiwan because China can isolate the island for weeks or even months,"" the bipartisan, nonprofit policy research organization and think tank found. ""Taiwan must start the war with everything it needs.""

            Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said Ukraine “was more of a cold-start approach than the planned approach we have been working on for Taiwan, and we will apply those lessons.” 

            For China, Hicks told The Associated Press that an amphibious landing is the hardest military operation to undertake. But that same challenge would also make resupply difficult, particularly if China chokes off ocean access. 

            ___

            STOCKPILE WOES

            The Pentagon cannot pre-position equipment it doesn’t have. Ukraine is putting intense pressure on the U.S. and European defense stockpiles and exposing that neither was ready for a major conventional conflict. 

            For some items “we have weaknesses in both our inventory and our production capacity,” said CSIS International Security Program senior adviser Mark Cancian, an author of the Taiwan report. “In a couple of places, particularly artillery ammunition, it could become a crisis.""

            Ukraine is shooting as many as 7,000 rounds a day to defend itself and has depended on announcements about every two weeks of new ammunition shipments from the U.S. 

            Since Russia invaded, the U.S. has sent Ukraine millions of rounds of munitions, including small arms and artillery rounds, 8,500 Javelin anti-armor systems, 1,600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and 100,000 rounds of 125 mm tank ammunition. 

            One of the biggest stockpile pressure points has been 155 mm howitzer ammunition. The U.S. has sent Ukraine 160 howitzers and more than 1 million howitzer rounds, which have been put to heavy use with as many as 3,000 rounds fired a day, according to the Pentagon.

            Ukraine is waging a different type of war than the U.S. would likely face with China, said Doug Bush, assistant Army secretary for acquisition. A future U.S. campaign would likely involve much more air power and sea power, taking some of the pressure off land-based systems and ammunition. 

            But allies would still need to be supported with land-based systems and ammunition. 

            ___

            REBUILDING TAKES TIME

            The Pentagon’s defense strategy says the U.S. must be able to conduct one war while deterring another, but the supply chain has not reflected that.

            Hicks said the surge of weapons to Ukraine “has not slowed down U.S. support to Taiwan,” but many of the military sales promised to Taiwan are facing the same pressures the Ukraine munitions face, such as limited parts or workforce issues.

            In response, the U.S. has set up a presidential drawdown authority for Taiwan, Hicks said, that will allow the U.S. to send weapons from its own stockpiles instead of arranging new contracts.

            The Army is working with Congress to get the authority to do multiyear contracts, so that companies will invest to meet longer-term needs, especially for the systems Bush called “the big four” — Javelin missiles, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ) launchers, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) munitions and 155 mm rounds.

            “Without that urgency, we risk being behind at the wrong time later,” Bush said. 

            The Army is adding production lines for 155 mm artillery — including major components such as the outer metal shell, chargers, the fuse and the explosive material — while right now all production is at one facility in Iowa. 

            All of that will take time. CSIS reported it could take five years or more to replenish 155 mm, Javelin and Stinger stockpiles.

            “The good news is that I think the Ukraine conflict has alerted people to these weaknesses. The bad news is that they’re going to take a long, long time to solve even if there is a lot of political will,” said Hal Brands, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

            For European stockpiles, there's not much excess left to send, and many of the partner nations are rushing to sign new contracts with industry to replenish inventories. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned this week in Brussels that particularly for larger caliber munitions, such as for ground artillery, it could be as long as 2 1/2 years before some new orders are delivered.

            ___

            SPACE AS A FRONT LINE 

            With its use of tanks and artillery, the Ukraine war often seems like a throwback to 20th century ground wars, but it has provided lessons in how valuable space technology has become for intelligence, communications and propaganda.

            Before the war, satellite imagery showed Russian forces massing along the border, countering Russia's claims that it was just staging a military exercise. As troops crossed the border, Ukrainian civilians fed real-time images and video from their smart phones to expose Russian military positions, record confessions from captured Russian forces and publicize Russian troop defeats and deaths. 

            When Ukraine’s cell towers and power were struck, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk provided a backup by sending hundreds of his Starlink terminals to Kyiv to keep Ukraine connected. 

            “Russia just got its clock cleaned in the information war from Day One, and they were never able to control the narrative coming out of Ukraine” of democracy under attack, Brands said. “We should assume that China won’t make the same mistake, that it will try very aggressively to control the information space.” 

            U.S. space experts are also looking at expanding satellite communications, building on Starlink’s successes. While Starlink is now the main orbiting commercial communications ring, others are coming online. 

            Starlink has thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth at the same low altitude in a ring. In a potential conflict, if one satellite was attacked, it would be quickly backfilled by another orbiting into place behind it. 

            That type of proliferated satellite communications is “the way of the future,” John Plumb, assistant secretary of defense for space policy, told the AP. “This is the thing we need to adapt to.”

            ___

            BE READY FOR CYBERWAR

            While the satellites and their transmissions must be protected, the ground stations to process and disseminate information are also vulnerable. As Russia invaded, a software attack against Ukraine's Viasat satellite communications network disabled tens of thousand of modems. While Viasat has not said who was to blame, Ukraine blamed Russian hackers. 

            China would likely use cyberwarfare to prevent Taiwan from sending out similar messages showing that it was effectively resisting any assault, Brands said.

            That issue has the attention of the U.S. Space Force.

            “If we’re not thinking about cyber protection of our ground networks,"" the networks will be left vulnerable, and the satellites won’t be able to distribute their information, said the chief of space operations, Gen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812008,Haley's candidacy shows balancing act for women in politics,"In announcing her campaign for the Republican presidential nomination this week, Nikki Haley made a subtle reference to the historic nature of her candidacy. 

            “I don't put up with bullies,” Haley said in a video that launched her bid to become the first female president of the U.S. “And when you kick back, it hurts them more if you're wearing heels.”

            Haley has plenty of accomplishments, including becoming the first woman elected governor of South Carolina and representing the U.S. at the United Nations. But her introduction captured the balancing act women — particularly conservative women — often navigate as they aspire to win the top job in American politics. 











            They must show toughness to prove they can compete against rivals who are almost always men for a job that has only been held by men. But there's also something of an invisible line that can't be crossed for fear of being viewed as too tough and repelling voters. 

            “We've seen higher levels of Republican women running and winning in recent elections,” said Kelly Dittmar, director of research and a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “But what you also see these women often doing is working hard to meet that double bind. ... It’s like, ‘I’m tough, but I’m also feminine. I’m also meeting my kind of feminine expectations.’”

            Sexism in politics is hardly limited to one political party, with women in public life often under pressure to appear “likable"" in ways that aren't expected of men. During a Democratic primary debate in 2008, a male moderator pressed Hillary Clinton on the “likability issue"" in relation to her rival, Barack Obama.

            “I don't think I'm that bad,” Clinton responded. Obama broke in to say, “You're likable enough, Hillary.”

            More recently, prominent Democratic women have also sought to project toughness in their campaigns. Sharice Davids, a former mixed martial arts fighter, sparred in a 2018 ad for a Kansas congressional seat. Amy McGrath, who challenged Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell in 2020, highlighted her experience as a Marine fighter pilot.

            But the dynamics are different, Dittmar said, in Republican politics, where voters tend to have more traditional views about stereotypical gender roles. That can incentivize Republican women seeking top offices to demonstrate both their toughness and femininity. She noted how former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin introduced herself as a vice presidential nominee in 2008 with a joke comparing hockey moms to a pitbull with lipstick.

            “It's another way to cue"" to voters that candidates are both tough and feminine, Dittmar said. 

            Haley's formal announcement in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday was peppered with examples. A congressman described Haley as leading with “an iron fist in a velvet glove.” The mother of Otto Warmbier, the young American who died after he was held and tortured in North Korea, said Haley taught her how to fight but also checked on her with the compassion of a fellow mom. And Haley herself called on voters to send “a tough-as-nails woman to the White House.” 

            Haley is one of only five Republican women to launch prominent campaigns for the office this century. By comparison, 12 Democratic women have been prominent candidates, including six in 2020, according to CAWP. The 12 include Clinton as the party's 2016 nominee and a 2020 candidate, Kamala Harris, who became the country's first female vice president. 

            Women face other hurdles their male peers do not, including online abuse that overwhelmingly targets women, especially women of color, and sometimes-sexist media coverage.

            In a pointed example Thursday, CNN anchor Don Lemon said that Haley “isn't in her prime” because she is 51. He added that “a woman is considered being in her prime in her 20s, 30s and maybe 40s.” Lemon himself is 56.

            Haley's main competition so far for the nomination, former President Donald Trump, has a long record of insulting his rivals, targeting women with sexist attacks including criticizing their appearance. 

            Clinton's campaign accused Trump during the 2016 election of repeatedly interrupting her during a debate, saying it resembled a frustrating experience many women have with men. Trump also made critical remarks about the appearance of the last major Republican female candidate to challenge him for the presidency, businesswoman Carly Fiorina. 

            Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the last of six women to drop out of the party's 2020 presidential primary, referenced sexism as a factor, noting the two remaining hopefuls were white men. Trump said her problem was actually a “lack of talent” and called her mean and unlikable. 

            Before Haley made her bid official, Trump called her “a very ambitious person,"" telling conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt that Haley “just couldn’t stay in her seat.” He also said he essentially gave Haley his blessing before she reversed course on an earlier decision not to challenge him. ""I said, ‘You know what, Nikki, if you want to run, you go ahead and run.’”

            Haley, a former accountant and state legislator who became South Carolina's first female and first Indian American governor, is no stranger to sexist and racist attacks. 

            The daughter of Indian immigrants, she has written and talked about growing up in a small town as the only brown-skinned family. During her 2010 campaign for governor, a state lawmaker used a racial slur to reference her. He later apologized. 

            Former Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana, who led GOP efforts to recruit and elect more women to the U.S. House, called Haley's candidacy “good for the party” and the country. 

            Olivia Perez-Cubas is spokeswoman for Winning For Women, which formed to help elect more GOP women after Democratic women led a takeover of the U.S. House in 2018. She said the group wants to ensure the Republican Party is representative of the U.S., which means it needs more diversity, including more women. 

            She is also hopeful that having more women in office or running as candidates will help Republicans attract more female voters, who have been more likely to support Democrats than Republicans in recent presidential elections. AP VoteCast, a broad survey of the electorate, shows 55% of women voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and 43% voted for Trump. 

            “Voters like to see and hear themselves reflected,” she said. “And when we can put forward a strong candidate that’s a woman, that’s great for everyone.” 

            Still, Perez-Cubas acknowledged that just as in many careers, the bar for women is “always just a little bit higher.”

            Republican businesswoman Tudor Dixon was the first woman to be the GOP nominee for governor in Michigan, defeating four male rivals in the 2022 primary. Her nomination was surprising to some voters, Dixon said, including one woman who liked the Republican's policies but said, “I just can’t vote for you because you have four girls and I don’t think you should be leaving them."" 

            Michigan was one of five states where 2022 gubernatorial contests were between two women, a U.S. record. But it also led to “disgusting” comparisons between herself and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Dixon said, such as who was younger or more physically fit — discussions that rarely happen in contests between two men. 

            She applauded Haley for getting into the race, saying it's not an easy thing to do. 

            “You are personally attacked. You put yourself out there, and it’s hard,” she said. ""But young women should see that they can do this, and that the future is that women are doing the same things that men are doing.”

            Evelyn Sanguinetti, who was Illinois' first Latina lieutenant governor when she served with Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, had similar experiences on the campaign trail. She was excited about Haley's bid, noting the historic nature of electing a woman who is of Indian descent and could, she said, lead with empathy and compassion at a time when the country is greatly divided. 

            “I’d like for our daughters to see that, because we’ve been seeing a lot of males, particularly white males, for a really long time,” Sanguinetti said. 

            In her Wednesday speech, Haley made a point to eschew so-called identity politics. But she stood on stage wearing the white of the suffragette movement and had a message to her rivals. 

            “As I set out on this new journey I will simply say this,” Haley said. “May the best woman win.”

            ___

            Associated Press writer Emily Swanson in Washington contributed to this report.In announcing her campaign for the Republican presidential nomination this week, Nikki Haley made a subtle reference to the historic nature of her candidacy.“I don't put up with bullies,” Haley said in a video that launched her bid to become the first female president of the U.S. “And when you kick back, it hurts them more if you're wearing heels.”Haley has plenty of accomplishments, including becoming the first woman elected governor of South Carolina and representing the U.S. at the United Nations. But her introduction captured the balancing act women — particularly conservative women — often navigate as they aspire to win the top job in American politics.They must show toughness to prove they can compete against rivals who are almost always men for a job that has only been held by men. But there's also something of an invisible line that can't be crossed for fear of being viewed as too tough and repelling voters.“We've seen higher levels of Republican women running and winning in recent elections,” said Kelly Dittmar, director of research and a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “But what you also see these women often doing is working hard to meet that double bind. ... It’s like, ‘I’m tough, but I’m also feminine. I’m also meeting my kind of feminine expectations.’”Sexism in politics is hardly limited to one political party, with women in public life often under pressure to appear “likable"" in ways that aren't expected of men. During a Democratic primary debate in 2008, a male moderator pressed Hillary Clinton on the “likability issue"" in relation to her rival, Barack Obama.“I don't think I'm that bad,” Clinton responded. Obama broke in to say, “You're likable enough, Hillary.”More recently, prominent Democratic women have also sought to project toughness in their campaigns. Sharice Davids, a former mixed martial arts fighter, sparred in a 2018 ad for a Kansas congressional seat. Amy McGrath, who challenged Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell in 2020, highlighted her experience as a Marine fighter pilot.But the dynamics are different, Dittmar said, in Republican politics, where voters tend to have more traditional views about stereotypical gender roles. That can incentivize Republican women seeking top offices to demonstrate both their toughness and femininity. She noted how former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin introduced herself as a vice presidential nominee in 2008 with a joke comparing hockey moms to a pitbull with lipstick.“It's another way to cue"" to voters that candidates are both tough and feminine, Dittmar said.Haley's formal announcement in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday was peppered with examples. A congressman described Haley as leading with “an iron fist in a velvet glove.” The mother of Otto Warmbier, the young American who died after he was held and tortured in North Korea, said Haley taught her how to fight but also checked on her with the compassion of a fellow mom. And Haley herself called on voters to send “a tough-as-nails woman to the White House.”Haley is one of only five Republican women to launch prominent campaigns for the office this century. By comparison, 12 Democratic women have been prominent candidates, including six in 2020, according to CAWP. The 12 include Clinton as the party's 2016 nominee and a 2020 candidate, Kamala Harris, who became the country's first female vice president.Women face other hurdles their male peers do not, including online abuse that overwhelmingly targets women, especially women of color, and sometimes-sexist media coverage.In a pointed example Thursday, CNN anchor Don Lemon said that Haley “isn't in her prime” because she is 51. He added that “a woman is considered being in her prime in her 20s, 30s and maybe 40s.” Lemon himself is 56.Haley's main competition so far for the nomination, former President Donald Trump, has a long record of insulting his rivals, targeting women with sexist attacks including criticizing their appearance.Clinton's campaign accused Trump during the 2016 election of repeatedly interrupting her during a debate, saying it resembled a frustrating experience many women have with men. Trump also made critical remarks about the appearance of the last major Republican female candidate to challenge him for the presidency, businesswoman Carly Fiorina.Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the last of six women to drop out of the party's 2020 presidential primary, referenced sexism as a factor, noting the two remaining hopefuls were white men. Trump said her problem was actually a “lack of talent” and called her mean and unlikable.Before Haley made her bid official, Trump called her “a very ambitious person,"" telling conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt that Haley “just couldn’t stay in her seat.” He also said he essentially gave Haley his blessing before she reversed course on an earlier decision not to challenge him. ""I said, ‘You know what, Nikki, if you want to run, you go ahead and run.’”Haley, a former accountant and state legislator who became South Carolina's first female and first Indian American governor, is no stranger to sexist and racist attacks.The daughter of Indian immigrants, she has written and talked about growing up in a small town as the only brown-skinned family. During her 2010 campaign for governor, a state lawmaker used a racial slur to reference her. He later apologized.Former Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana, who led GOP efforts to recruit and elect more women to the U.S. House, called Haley's candidacy “good for the party” and the country.Olivia Perez-Cubas is spokeswoman for Winning For Women, which formed to help elect more GOP women after Democratic women led a takeover of the U.S. House in 2018. She said the group wants to ensure the Republican Party is representative of the U.S., which means it needs more diversity, including more women.She is also hopeful that having more women in office or running as candidates will help Republicans attract more female voters, who have been more likely to support Democrats than Republicans in recent presidential elections. AP VoteCast, a broad survey of the electorate, shows 55% of women voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and 43% voted for Trump.“Voters like to see and hear themselves reflected,” she said. “And when we can put forward a strong candidate that’s a woman, that’s great for everyone.”Still, Perez-Cubas acknowledged that just as in many careers, the bar for women is “always just a little bit higher.”Republican businesswoman Tudor Dixon was the first woman to be the GOP nominee for governor in Michigan, defeating four male rivals in the 2022 primary.

            D’Angelo Russell had 21 points and seven assists during his warm welcome home to the Lakers, who won for just the second time in six games. Los Angeles' five new players all made their home debuts after last week's busy trade deadline, and the Lakers never trailed in one of this up-and-down team's most impressive performances of the season.

            “There was a huge emphasis on getting this win,” Davis said. “Guys came out and played with a lot of energy and urgency. ... It was only our first game together, but it looked good.”











            James only had to play a season-low 29 minutes after taking the previous three games off to rest his sore left ankle and foot immediately after he surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record Feb. 7.

            “I feel really good about what we’ve got brewing, but we need to lock in,” James said. “It’s the first time we’ve all been on the floor together, so we wanted to see what it looks like, and the first 40 minutes looked pretty good.”

            Russell’s debut was actually a homecoming, because he played his first two NBA seasons for Los Angeles before getting traded four times and eventually returning last week. Russell was clearly thrilled to be back in Hollywood, putting on an impressive playmaking performance while also repeatedly exhorting the crowd to standing ovations for the Lakers.

            After he hit a 3-pointer in the second half, Russell celebrated by pointing at the letters on his chest and screaming to the fans: “Like I never left!”

            “I love those moments,” Russell said. “We had Bron tonight, and we seemed a little more fluid. Everybody pitched in. Everybody played a major part in keeping the lead, maintaining it, getting stops. I like what we showcased tonight.""

            The Lakers hit the All-Star break in 13th place in the 15-team Western Conference at 27-32 — but the season isn't over yet, and they've got promising reinforcements.

            Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt and Malik Beasley joined James and Davis in the Lakers' 30th starting lineup of the season, while Mo Bamba fouled out in 16 minutes as the backup center in his Lakers debut.

            “It was just hot,” said Beasley, who scored eight poitns. “We wanted to make a statement and do what we do.”

            Brandon Ingram scored 25 points and C.J. McCollum had 22 points and nine assists in his return from a one-game absence with a sprained right ankle for the Pelicans, who lost for only the second time in six games.

            “We just didn't play with a sense of urgency, and those were my end-of-game comments to our team,” coach Willie Green said. “We have to play with more force and have a sense of urgency that we just didn't have tonight. Not a great effort on our part.""

            New Orleans' Josh Richardson was ejected for arguing a no-call with 10:52 to play.

            TIP-INS

            Pelicans: Zion Williamson attended the game and greeted James during a timeout. He has missed 22 straight games with a strained hamstring, and he is expected to be out for several weeks after the break. ... Former Lakers forward Larry Nance Jr. sat out with left groin soreness.

(AP) — Denis Malgin scored for the second consecutive night, Nathan MacKinnon got his fifth goal in five games since the All-Star break and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Minnesota Wild 3-2 on Wednesday.

            Andrew Cogliano also scored for Colorado, which recovered from a shootout loss at home to Tampa Bay the previous night. Alexandar Georgiev also bounced back with 41 saves. He allowed 11 goals in the previous three games.

            The Avalanche beat Minnesota in the first meeting between the division foes since Oct. 17 despite the Wild holding a 43-19 edge in shots. Colorado had lost three of four, once in overtime and once in a shootout.











            “We know the standings and we know the other team is close to us,” Georgiev said. “We knew it was big points for us and kind of every game for us now is playoff intensity. We know we have to get points and get higher up in the standings, for sure.”

            Kirill Kaprizov scored his 31st goal and Joel Eriksson Ek added his 21st of the season for Minnesota, which has lost five of six since the All-Star break and been outscored 19-10 in the process.

            Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 16 shots for the Wild.

            “We played great. We didn’t get a reward,” Minnesota coach Dean Evason said. “Obviously, it’s a results league and we’re (ticked) off that we didn’t get two points. How do you not feel good about the way you played, right? Yeah, we’re frustrated with the end result and they’ll be very mad and disappointed, which is great. They’ll come back hungry and ready to go in two days.""

            The Avalanche made the most of their scoring chances.

            Cogliano opened the scoring with the only goal of the first period. Devon Toews brought the puck into the offensive zone and slid a pass to Cogliano charging in. He sent a quick shot past Fleury for his ninth of the season.

            MacKinnon assisted on Malgin’s fourth goal of the season. Malgin, acquired from Toronto in December, wristed a shot with Fleury screened for his second goal with Colorado.

            Eriksson Ek deflected a shot from Mats Zuccarello on the power play midway through the second. Eriksson Ek has seven goals and five assists in his past 12 games.

            “We played good, but it doesn’t really matter when the outcome is losing,” Eriksson Ek said.

            MacKinnon answered later in the period with his 18th goal of the season. He had a six-game goal drought heading into the All-Star break but has five goals and three assists in the five games since.

            “I feel like he’s picking up his game here recently,” Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. “The bigger the moment, the better he plays. Last night, the night before, I thought he was great and then tonight, he kind of led the charge for us tonight, especially on the offensive side of it. Looked like he had good legs. He’s making plays and getting dangerous on a bunch of occasions.”

            The Avalanche mustered just 10 shots through two periods, but it was another tough outing for Fleury, who made his first start in three games. He allowed five goals in his last start against Vegas.

            Kaprizov brought the Wild within one with 5:53 remaining on his fourth goal in six games.

            GOOD TIMING

            Avalanche defenseman Josh Manson returned to the lineup for the first time since Dec. 1 after recovering from a lower-body injury. He added to the defensive corps, which was without Cale Makar and Erik Johnson.

            “It’s unfortunate with those guys going down,” Manson said. “It ended up working well. I was trying to get back as soon as I could. But yeah, definitely worked out having those guys unfortunately go out but me being able to step back in since we went down too many right shots.”

            Makar missed his fourth straight game with a head injury. Johnson was placed on injured reserve Tuesday and Brad Hunt was recalled from the American Hockey League. Hunt and third goaltender Jonas Johansson were reassigned to the AHL after the game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812029,Deputies suspended in Nichols case didn't keep body cams on,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Two sheriff's deputies who have been suspended for five days for their role in the arrest of Tyre Nichols failed to keep their body cameras activated after they went to the location where Nichols had been beaten by five Memphis police officers, officials said late Wednesday.

            Shelby County Sheriff's Office deputies Jeremy Watkins and Johntavious Bowers each violated multiple policies after they reported to the location of Nichols' violent arrest on Jan. 7, Sheriff Floyd Bonner said in a statement.

            Nichols had fled a traffic stop but was caught near his home by Memphis Police Department officers who punched him, kicked him and hit him with a baton, police video footage and other documents showed.











            Video released by the city showed several law enforcement officers standing around as Nichols struggled with serious injuries while he sat on the ground, propped up against a police car. Nichols was taken to a hospital in an ambulance that left the location of the beating 27 minutes after emergency medical technicians arrived, authorities have said.

            Nichols died at a hospital on Jan. 10. Five Memphis officers accused of beating Nichols have been fired and charged with second-degree murder. One other Memphis officer has been fired but not charged criminally for his role in the traffic stop that preceded the beating.

            The sheriff’s office previously had said two deputies who went to the scene after Nichols was beaten had been disciplined and were under investigation. But the county law enforcement office had not divulged further details, including their names and the actions they took — or did not take. 

            Reports released by the sheriff's office late Wednesday showed Bowers and Watkins were suspended for five days without pay for failing to keep their body cameras and in-car video turned on while they were at the arrest location. 

            The deputies also did not notify dispatch or their supervisor, the reports showed. Watkins also did not report on his daily log that he went to the arrest location, according to the reports. 

            Bonner said the sheriff's office does not believe that the deputies will face criminal charges.

            Bowers and Watkins have been Shelby County deputies since June 2021, Bonner said. Both suspensions began Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812032,"Thompson, Sabres snap four-game skid with 7-3 win over Ducks","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Tage Thompson scored his 36th goal of the season, Casey Mittelstadt had the go-ahead goal late in the second period and the Buffalo Sabres snapped a four-game losing streak with a 7-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Wednesday night.

            Alex Tuch had a goal and two assists while Peyton Krebs, Dylan Cozens , Tyson Jost and Mittelstadt each had a goal and an assist for Buffalo, which trailed 3-2 in the second period before scoring five straight goals. 

            Zembus Girgensons also scored and Rasmus Dahlin and Jack Quinn each had two assists as the Sabres had 14 of their 18 skaters record at least one point. Eric Comrie stopped 19 shots.











            “I liked the energy, pace, all five guys going in tandem and unison,” Buffalo coach Don Granato said. “It’s our third game back from nine days or 10 days off and it's first time we felt like we got back into a rhythm.”

            Anaheim defenseman Cam Fowler had the fourth two-goal game in his 13-year career, Kevin Shattenkirk had a goal and an assist while Derek Grant had two assists. Lukas Dostal made 37 saves for the Ducks, who have dropped three straight games while being outscored 20-8.

            It is the second time this season and third time in franchise history Anaheim has had least three straight games where it has allowed at least six goals.

            “We didn’t win any puck battles. We were a lot of poke and hope,” coach Dallas Eakins said.

            Mittelstadt extended his point streak to three games with 1:57 remaining in the second period with a high wrist shot from the right faceoff circle that went past Dostal’s glove for his ninth of the season.

            Mittelstadt and the Sabres' third line ended up having a big night with two goals and four assists. Krebs tied it at 3 with a one-timer in front of the net after taking the feed from Quinn.

            ""It felt good to get those goals in right after they came up and had some good shifts. I feel like our line did that all night, we responded pretty well,"" Krebs said.

            Thompson moved into third in the NHL in goals with a one-timer from the left faceoff circle off a pass by Dahlin. Thompson has 20 points (10 goals, 10 assists) in his last 19 games and has a goal in three of Buffalo's four games since the All-Star break.

            GETTING EVERYONE INVOLVED

            It is the sixth time since 2009-10 and second time this season that 14 or more Buffalo skaters recorded at least one point in a game. The Sabres also had 14 skaters get on the scoresheet in an 8-3 win against Detroit on Oct. 31. 

            SHORT-LIVED RALLY

            Anaheim trailed 2-0 after one period as it was being outshot 17-1 at one point. But the Ducks rallied back with three straight goals during a nearly seven-minute span in the second period.

            Shattenkirk scored his first of the year at 6:37. At 34 years, 17 days, he became the oldest Anaheim defenseman with a goal since Francois Beauchemin on March 21, 2018, (37 years, 290 days). 

            Fowler tied it 71 seconds later and then put the Ducks on top 3-2 at 13:08 when he put a loose rebound into the back of the net. However, the Sabres tied it 35 seconds later.

            It is the first time in 10 years the Ducks have had multiple defensemen age 31 or older with goals.

            “I’m trying to create some offense, use my skating as best as I can,” Fowler said. “We felt like if we transitioned the puck well and made them play in their own end, much like any other team, that’s where they are vulnerable. At points we did that in the game, especially in the second period, but it wasn’t consistent.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812034,EPA chief at train derailment site: 'Trust the government',"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency got a first-hand look Thursday at the toll left by a freight train derailment in Ohio, where toxic chemicals spilled or were burned off, leaving the stench of fresh paint nearly two weeks later.

            EPA Administrator Michael Regan, who walked along a creek that still reeks of chemicals, sought to reassure skeptical residents that the water is fit for drinking and the air safe to breathe around East Palestine, where just under 5,000 people live near the Pennsylvania state line. 

            “I'm asking they trust the government. I know that's hard. We know there's a lack of trust,” Regan said. “We’re testing for everything that was on that train.” 











            Since the derailment, residents have complained about headaches and irritated eyes and finding their cars and lawns covered in soot. The hazardous chemicals that spilled from the train killed thousands of fish, and residents have talked about finding dying or sick pets and wildlife. 

            Residents are frustrated by what they say is incomplete and vague information about the lasting effects from the disaster, which prompted evacuations.

            “I have three grandbabies,” said Kathy Dyke, who came with hundreds of her neighbors to a public meeting Wednesday where representatives of railroad operator Norfolk Southern were conspicuously absent. “Are they going to grow up here in five years and have cancer?”

            Regan said Thursday that anyone who is fearful of being in their home should seek testing from the government. 

            “People have been unnerved. They’ve been asked to leave their homes,” he said, adding that if he lived there, he would be willing to move his family back into the area as long as the testing shows it's safe. 

            Those attending the previous night's informational session had questions about health hazards and demanded more transparency from Norfolk Southern, which did not attend, citing concerns about its staff safety. Many who had waited in a long line snaking outside the high school gymnasium came away upset that they didn’t hear anything new. Some booed or laughed each time they heard the village mayor or state health director assure them that lingering odors aren’t dangerous. 

            “They just danced around the questions a lot,"" said Danielle Deal, who lives a few miles from the derailment site. “Norfolk needed to be here.”

            At least five lawsuits have been filed against the railroad, which announced this week that it is creating a $1 million fund to help the community while continuing to remove spilled contaminants from the ground and streams and monitoring air quality.

            “We are here and will stay here for as long as it takes to ensure your safety and to help East Palestine recover and thrive,” Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan Shaw said in a letter to the community. 

            Families who evacuated said they want assistance figuring out how to get the promised financial help. Beyond that, they want to know whether the railroad will be held responsible.

            State and federal officials have promised to make sure Norfolk Southern not only pays for the cleanup but also reimburses residents.

            The White House said teams from the federal health and emergency response and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will go to East Palestine.

            “We understand the residents are concerned — as they should be —- and they have questions. That’s all understandable,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “And we’re going to get to the bottom of this.”

            No one was injured when about 50 cars derailed in a fiery, mangled mess on the outskirts of East Palestine on Feb. 3. Officials seeking to avoid an uncontrolled blast evacuated the area and opted to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, sending flames and black smoke billowing into the sky again. 

            The Ohio EPA said the latest tests show five wells supplying the village’s drinking water are free from contaminants. 

            At least, 3,500 fish, mostly small ones such as minnows and darters, have been found dead along more than 7 miles (11.2 kilometers) of streams, according to the estimates from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.

            Precautions are being taken to ensure contaminants that reached the Ohio River don’t make it into drinking water, officials said. 

            There have been anecdotal reports that pets or livestock have been sickened. No related animal deaths have been confirmed and the risk to livestock is low, Ohio officials said, but the state Agriculture Department is testing samples from a beef calf that died a week after the derailment. 

            The suspected cause of the derailment is a mechanical issue with a rail car axle. The National Transportation Safety Board said it has video appearing to show a wheel bearing overheating just beforehand. The NTSB expects to issue its preliminary report in about two weeks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812041,"In twist of events, Taiwanese superstar Liu Wen-cheng confirmed alive","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Less than a day after the news of musical legend Liu Wen-cheng’s (劉文正) death shocked the Mandarin-speaking world, his former agent changed his story and said he was alive and well.According to an earlier report, after rumors about Liu’s death surfaced, Liu’s long-time agent Hsia Shun-yu (夏順玉) said on Wednesday (Feb. 15) that he had passed away due to a heart attack on Nov. 12, 2022. Public figures and fans alike immediately began mourning the former singer.On Thursday (Feb. 16), Hsia changed his account, though he gave several contradictory explanations. CNA cited him as saying his original intention was to take advantage of rumors circulating in China and fake Liu’s death so Liu, who has kept a low profile since his retirement from singing, can live his life undisturbed.Hsia added that even today, people are offering over NT$2 billion (US$66 million) for Liu to hold concert tours in China. “But he is not interested in making money. He quit show business at 29, why would he sing again at 70? He doesn’t want people to harass him.”However, after discussing the strategy with Liu, the pair decided it was not a good idea to hurt people, which led to the story’s dramatic reversal. Hsia said though Liu did suffer a heart attack, he had recovered, and finds the public’s reaction to the news of his death “funny.”Meanwhile, SETNews reported that Hsia was shocked to get a call from Liu after news of his death spread. “I was shocked, and when I heard that he did not die, I was glad. ”TVBS gave a different account, citing Liu’s aunt Lily Lee Levin (李庚濟) as saying Liu was “unhappy” about how much attention the issue had attracted and did not plan to respond. Liu told Lee Levin that he had not been in touch with Hsia for years.",2023/02/16,6680,Culture

On March 6, wearing masks in schools will become optional.At a Thursday press conference, a member of the media said parent groups are worried children will be bullied if they continue to wear masks at school and asked how the center would deal with this situation. CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) said the Ministry of Education and the county and city education bureaus have been asked to take steps to implement the new guidelines in the schools.Wang said that the CECC will set out the general principles and the schools will then adopt corresponding measures, which the center will respect. As for bullying concerns, Wang said that based on experience over the past years, ""there are relatively few cases of bullying over the wearing of masks in Asian countries, while there are more in Europe and the U.S.""",2023/02/16,3779,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812062,"Global Nicotine Market Trends, In-Depth Research on Market Size, Emerging Growth Factors, Trends,SWOT analysis and Forecasts 2030","Nicotine is a highly addictive substance found in tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco. It is also used in nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) such as nicotine gum, lozenges, patches, and inhalers to help people quit smoking. In terms of growth trends, the market for nicotine and nicotine-related products can be assessed in several ways.The market for tobacco products has been declining in developed countries for several decades due to increasing awareness of the health risks associated with smoking and public health campaigns aimed at reducing tobacco use. In the United States, for example, the prevalence of smoking has declined from 42.4% in 1965 to 13.7% in 2018. This decline has led to a corresponding decrease in the demand for nicotine products.On the other hand, the market for nicotine replacement therapies has been growing steadily. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global market for nicotine replacement therapy was valued at USD 2.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% from 2020 to 2027. This growth can be attributed to the increasing awareness of the health risks associated with smoking and the availability of a variety of NRT products.Another factor that may impact the growth trends of the nicotine market is the rise of alternative nicotine products such as e-cigarettes and vaping devices. These products have gained popularity in recent years, particularly among young adults, and have been marketed as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes. However, the long-term health effects of these products are still unknown, and there are concerns about the potential for these products to increase nicotine addiction among young people.The Market.biz report on Nicotine Market provides the market Size, Share, and growth rate for different segments at both the national and regional levels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812077,Paraguay leader praises Taiwan as 'lighthouse of democracy',"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The outgoing president of Paraguay, whose country is one of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies, spoke of his admiration for the island democracy while on a state visit to Taipei on Thursday.

            Mario Abdo Benitez was welcomed with an honor guard as he walked alongside Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen on a red carpet in front of the Presidential House. Abdo arrived in Taiwan on Tuesday on a five-day visit.

            Taiwan is closely watching as Paraguay is set to hold presidential elections in which the opposition party candidate has said he would break diplomatic ties with Taiwan if elected, according to local media reports. 











            Since Tsai was elected in 2016, China has been on a pressure campaign to poach the island’s remaining diplomatic allies. China claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and opposes any form of exchange between Taiwan and the governments of other countries. Taiwan currently has 14 diplomatic allies.

            “I want to express my deepest and most sincere respect to the Taiwanese people for not giving up their brave struggle for freedom and the safeguarding of their sovereignty,"" Abdo said. ""In the face of continued threats and the tense situation, Taiwan's people have not given up their resolution for peace, continuing to play the role of a lighthouse of democracy in the region.”

            Abdo also thanked Taiwan for its help during the COVID-19 pandemic and said his country's economy suffered the least of Latin American countries during the pandemic as a result of that assistance.

            Tsai did not speak about the possible loss of Paraguay as a diplomatic ally, instead thanking Abdo for his visit and speaking of deepening economic cooperation between the two sides. 

            “I want to thank President Abdo for speaking in support of Taiwan’s participation in international forums many times,” said Tsai in a speech ahead of a private meeting with the Paraguayan president.

            In December 2021, Taiwan lost Nicaragua as a diplomatic ally after the Central American country's president won re-election in a vote the White House said was rigged. Nicaragua then said it would officially recognize only China. 

            In 2022, Honduras, another Taiwan ally, also made Taiwan and China part of its presidential campaign. As a candidate, Xiomara Castro said she would switch diplomatic recognition to China if elected. But after Castro assumed power, her administration said the government would continue to maintain ties with Taiwan for now.

            Though Taiwan has lost allies, it has also stepped up official exchanges with countries such as Lithuania and Slovakia, which do not formally recognize Taiwan as a country. 

            As part of his visit, Abdo met with Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and attended a conference on women's empowerment with Tsai.TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The outgoing president of Paraguay, whose country is one of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies, spoke of his admiration for the island democracy while on a state visit to Taipei on Thursday.Mario Abdo Benitez was welcomed with an honor guard as he walked alongside Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen on a red carpet in front of the Presidential House.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812078,Sennheiser Announces TeamConnect Ceiling Medium for Mid-Sized Spaces,"Newest addition to the TeamConnect Ceiling Solutions portfolio unveiled at ISE 2023

  BARCELONA, SPAIN -  Media OutReach - 16 February 2023 -   Sennheiser, the first choice for advanced audio technology that makes collaboration and learning easier, is pleased to announce a new ceiling microphone for mid-sized meeting rooms and lecture or collaboration spaces. Named TeamConnect Ceiling Medium (TCC M), the new TeamConnect Ceiling solution is unveiled at Integrated Systems Europe in Barcelona.            TCC M delivers all the innovation and features of the award-winning  TeamConnect Ceiling 2 (TCC 2) to a new segment of the meeting space market. With a coverage area of up to 40 m², customers can now bring the power of TCC 2 to their mid-sized meeting space, with a sleek design and at an attractive price-point.            ""With the worldwide success of our TCC 2 for large meeting spaces, we wanted to provide that same experience to mid-size conference rooms and educational spaces,"" said Jens Werner, Product Manager, UC Solutions, Sennheiser. ""Now with TCC M, a whole new meeting category can realize TeamConnect Ceiling Solutions benefits like Trusted Sennheiser Audio Quality, efficient setup, brand agnostic integration and simple management and control. Also, when considering a new design, it was important to us to make a sustainable impact with smaller housing.""   Unlike the TCC 2, TCC M is round, but does offer the same ceiling installation choices - surface mounted, suspended, or flush mounted. These options allow for cable-free tables and flexible furniture arrangement.   TeamConnect Ceiling Solutions employ patented automatic dynamic beamforming technology and the TruVoicelift function. These offer perfect speech intelligibility while allowing the speaker great flexibility in movement and position. The high-quality built-in electret condenser capsules, which are made in Germany, have already proven themselves in numerous Sennheiser microphones. They ensure perfect speech intelligibility and offer outstanding audio quality by capturing the entire meeting room. These features enable the microphone to constantly determine the position of the person speaking, without manually needing to configure speaker zones ahead of time. If additional control is needed, priority and exclusion zones can be set in our industry leading Sennheiser Control Cockpit. This means that no spoken word is lost between the people in the meeting room and the external meeting participants.   Choosing a TeamConnect Ceiling Solution also comes with the added comfort of knowing that you are partnering with a truly customer-centric solution. By owning the manufacturing, Sennheiser has managed to navigate the supply chain crisis significantly better than others and was able to provide customers with full transparency and on-time delivery dates. In addition, starting with all TeamConnect Ceiling Solutions manufactured in 2023, Sennheiser is extending the warranty period from two to five years with product registration.   The TeamConnect Ceiling Solutions are part of the industry-leading TeamConnect Family – Sennheiser's agnostic collaboration portfolio with state-of-the-art technology that suits the size and setup of any conference room.

TAIPEI, Feb. 16, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Cathay Life Insurance, Taiwan's largest insurance company, has announced a detailed new strategy for customers, along with its latest operational performance in the health sector.

The company also joined hands with cross-industry partners to create health-orientated tasks for customers. 

            With risk identification as the core pillar, the company is utilizing technology to better serve customers in areas such as improving health awareness, suboptimal health, and elderly care. The company has also increased commitment to spillover insurance policies, encouraging customers to improve their health in return for a reduced premium or bonuses. These four focus areas allow Cathay Life Insurance to provide the most complete health coverage in the industry.











            ""Cathay Life Insurance has eight million policyholders and services more than 20 million insurance policies in Taiwan.

            One of the four major areas in the strategy involves the newly launched wellness program ""FitBack"", which is embedded in the Cathay Life App. It serves as a constant reminder and encouragement for customers to stay committed to health goals, upgrade their membership levels, and reap the rewards. The company also joined hands with cross-industry partners to create health-orientated tasks for customers.

Presently, the company ranks top when it comes to profits from spillover insurance policies in the market and is aiming to strengthen its position with the launch of the industry's first spillover insurance policy that combines membership levels with discounted premiums.

            As for the area of suboptimal health, Cathay Life Insurance is partnering with local and renowned clinics to provide comprehensive care services. The teams comprise doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and educators to craft a personalized approach to healthcare for policyholders.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812101,Suter lifts Red Wings past Oilers in 5-4 shootout victory,"EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — Pius Suter scored the winner in the fifth round of the shootout, leading the Detroit Red Wings to a 5-4 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Wednesday night.

            Dylan Larkin, Moritz Seider, Robby Fabbri and Olli Maatta scored in regulation for the Red Wings, who have won four straight. Ville Husso made 41 saves overall.

            “It was a huge team win being up 4-2 and they tied it up and still getting away with two points,” Suter said. “In different games, you have to find different ways to score.











            “Today, it was a couple of faceoff plays, our special teams were good and that’s how you keep winning.”

            Ryan Nugent-Hopkins had a pair of goals, and Leon Draisaitl and Derek Ryan also scored for the Oilers, who have dropped their last two. Jack Campbell stopped 19 of 23 shots.

            “We had a couple of breakdowns that they capitalized on,” Draisaitl said. “They really didn’t get much. I thought we dominated the entire game, pretty much.

            “It was definitely frustrating, but it is hard to win in this league when you give up four.”

            Detroit opened the scoring 4:17 into the first period on Larkin's power-play goal — the fourth straight game in which he has scored.

            The Red Wings made it 2-0 when Seider sent a backhand shot from the corner toward the net and it caromed off defenseman Philip Broberg, the post and then Campbell before going in.

            Nugent-Hopkins got the Oilers on the scoreboard 1:26 into the second period, but Fabbri restored Detroit’s two-goal edge on the power play at 9:06.

            Edmonton made it a one-goal game just over two minutes later as Connor McDavid sent a one-handed pass across the crease to Nugent-Hopkins, who recorded his 26th goal of the season in his 55th game. Nugent-Hopkins’ career best is 28 goals in 82 games in 2018-19.

            Maatta made it 4-2 with 3:48 to play in the second.

            Draisaitl scored 3:26 into the third period, and Edmonton pulled even a couple of minutes later on Ryan's goal.

            “Just winning on the road is difficult period, let alone against a team like that with the type of offense they have,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. ""There are moments when they put you on your heels and it’s important for the next shift or the next guy to step up. And I thought, for the most part, we managed the game fairly well tonight and Husse was probably the difference in a tight game on the road.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812102,"Panarin, Zibanejad help Rangers beat Canucks 6-4","VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Artemi Panarin and Mika Zibanejad each had two goals and an assist as the New York Rangers beat the Vancouver Canucks 6-4 Wednesday night for their sixth straight win.

            Chris Kreider and K’Andre Miller also scored for the Rangers, who are 7-0-1 in their last eight games. Igor Shesterkin stopped 25 shots.

            “We keep talking about doing the right things,” Zibanejad said. “And we know we can score and just got to make sure we make the right decisions that we don’t try to sacrifice the defensive part or put ourselves in a bad spot that way. But I thought we did a good job tonight.”











            Andrei Kuzmenko had a goal and an assist and Curtis Lazar, J.T. Miller and Conor Garland also scored for the Canucks, who have lost three straight. Elias Pettersson had two assists and Arturs Silovs had 22 saves in his NHL debut.

            “They’ve got some good weapons on the ice, both on their (defense) and forwards,” Pettersson said. “But we know that. I think we’ve just got to just got to be better.”

            Trailing 5-4, Vancouver pulled Silovs for an extra skater with 2:54 left to play. Panarin sliced a puck to Zibanejad, who sent the puck into the empty net with 1:34 remaining to seal the win.

            Despite the loss, Canucks coach Rick Tocchet was pleased with his rookie goalie's play against the Rangers.

            “You don’t wanna throw him to the wolves but I think he battled and our team battled,” Tocchet said. “That team is built for the Stanley Cup.”

            The Canucks had pulled within one at 8:51 of the third when Kuzmenko fired a shot under Shesterkin’s glove from the top of the slot. It was the Russian’s 23rd goal of the season.

            Vancouver opened the scoring 4:52 into the game as Lazar tipped Dakota Joshua's shot from the bottom of the faceoff circle for his third.

            Zibanejad tied it 59 seconds later with his team-leading 28th as he faked a shot to get Silovs to move, then blasted a wrister past the rookie . It gave Zibanejad six goals during a five-game scoring streak.

            “I got some pretty good speed coming down and try to freeze him and just try to pump fake and see what he gives me,” Zibanejad said. “I’ve done that a couple of times before so I don’t know if he bit on the pump fake and I saw opening between his legs there and tried to put it five-hole and it went in.”

            New York took its first lead of the night at 7:03 when Panarin snapped a blistering shot that Silovs caught a piece of, but the puck bounced in.

            Vancouver capitalized on a power play with 7:15 left in the opening period as Shesterkin lost his stick and Miller sent a snap shot sailing into the net for his 19th to tie it 2-2.

            Panarin tipped Niko Mikkola's long shot past Silovs for his 20th with 4:24 left in the first to regain the Rangers' lead.

            New York pushed its lead to 4-2 at 50 seconds into the second as Kreider tapped a pass across the slot from Zibanejad into the open net.

            Kuzmenko used some dazzling stick work to get around Rangers defenseman Adam Fox, but his ensuing shot pinged off the crossbar. Garland picked up the errant puck and sent a backhanded shot past Shesterkin at 9:26 to pull the Canucks within one.

            “It was good moment for me,” Kuzmenko said. “I win battle 1-on-1 with good skills before net. Garland, nice skills. Good goal for Garland.”

            Miller fired a shot through traffic and over Silovs' glove with 6:32 left in the middle period to restore the Rangers' two-goal lead.

            UP AND DOWN

            The Canucks called up Silovs, the 21-year-old Latvian goalie, from Abbotsford of the AHL on Tuesday and sent G Spencer Martin down.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812104,Hong Kong sees more pro-Beijing voices at UN rights review,"HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong supporters of a tough national security law imposed by China’s ruling Communist Party have set their sights on a United Nations session, drawing concern from rights advocates. 

            The law, which critics say Hong Kong authorities have used to crush dissent following massive 2019 protests, has been a focus at the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’ two-day hearing on China that concludes Thursday in Geneva. The committee reviews respect of those rights in nearly all U.N. member states every few years. 

            Of some 30 reports on Hong Kong submitted for the session, more than half upheld the broadly applied national security law. 











            None of the organizations — some of which were led by pro-Beijing politicians — that provided positive reports filed a submission in the previous review nine years ago, prompting concern from rights advocates that their participation could sway how the committee views human rights situations on the ground. They worry whether events are being reported accurately, especially after some other local civil society groups have been silenced or forced to disband under the sweeping legislation. 

            The submission trend is concerning, Amnesty International researcher Kai Ong said, because the information from the reports is key to getting independent and on-the-ground observations on how human rights in Hong Kong are being protected or violated.

            “It is worrying for the U.N. mechanism itself,” she said. “But it reflects more broadly the uncertainty that many civil society organizations face because it shows that a lot of their work in many areas can be criminalized by Hong Kong government nowadays.”

            Hong Kong returned to China’s rule in 1997 under the promise that the former British colony could retain its own political, social and financial institutions for 50 years. 

            But after Beijing imposed the law on the former British colony in 2020, the city's once vibrant civil society shrank drastically. Activists fled abroad or were jailed under the law. Unions and other independent organizations closed down. The United States imposed sanctions on officials it said were to blame for the abuses.

            The committee has received “unprecedented amount"" of submissions from non-governmental organizations, indicating significant concerns over the human rights situation in China, Hong Kong and Macao, said Michael Windfuhr, the committee’s rapporteur on China. 

            “We also received information of those who said the national security law was positive, just to reflect this,” Windfuhr said Wednesday as he grilled Hong Kong officials over the implementation of the law. 

            One of those positive responses came from Kam Man-fung, deputy secretary general at One Country Two Systems Youth Forum, a Hong Kong-based think tank seeking debate and dialoge between young people in the semi-autonomous city and the mainland. 

            Kam said he was partly motivated by the idea of “telling China’s story well” — a phrase that has been used by Chinese President Xi Jinping to encourage positive depictions of the country. 

            Hong Kong has become a focus under heightened US-China tensions, which motived him to pay more attention to international affairs, Kam said.

            “I just want the world to understand my country and my birthplace more comprehensively,” the pro-Beijing New People’s Party member said. He said his report was entirely self-initiated.

            While pro-Beijing groups were vying to get their side of the story heard by the U.N., Amnesty International said in its report that some other local NGOs, which used to participate in the review, “were forced to disband, prosecuted, or deterred from continuing international advocacy work” out of fear of reprisal and violating the national security law. 

            The Hong Kong government had not given its assurance that NGOs participating in a different U.N. committee’s review in 2022 wouldn't face any retaliation, said Ong. Some local groups also told Amnesty they did not want to go to the hearing in Geneva in person because they worried about surveillance and being monitored by the Chinese authorities, she said. 

            On Wednesday, the Chinese delegation said NGOs that provided information to the review would not be retaliated against.HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong supporters of a tough national security law imposed by China’s ruling Communist Party have set their sights on a United Nations session, drawing concern from rights advocates.The law, which critics say Hong Kong authorities have used to crush dissent following massive 2019 protests, has been a focus at the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’ two-day hearing on China that concludes Thursday in Geneva. The committee reviews respect of those rights in nearly all U.N. member states every few years.Of some 30 reports on Hong Kong submitted for the session, more than half upheld the broadly applied national security law.None of the organizations — some of which were led by pro-Beijing politicians — that provided positive reports filed a submission in the previous review nine years ago, prompting concern from rights advocates that their participation could sway how the committee views human rights situations on the ground. They worry whether events are being reported accurately, especially after some other local civil society groups have been silenced or forced to disband under the sweeping legislation.The submission trend is concerning, Amnesty International researcher Kai Ong said, because the information from the reports is key to getting independent and on-the-ground observations on how human rights in Hong Kong are being protected or violated.“It is worrying for the U.N. mechanism itself,” she said. “But it reflects more broadly the uncertainty that many civil society organizations face because it shows that a lot of their work in many areas can be criminalized by Hong Kong government nowadays.”Hong Kong returned to China’s rule in 1997 under the promise that the former British colony could retain its own political, social and financial institutions for 50 years.But after Beijing imposed the law on the former British colony in 2020, the city's once vibrant civil society shrank drastically. Activists fled abroad or were jailed under the law. Unions and other independent organizations closed down. The United States imposed sanctions on officials it said were to blame for the abuses.The committee has received “unprecedented amount"" of submissions from non-governmental organizations, indicating significant concerns over the human rights situation in China, Hong Kong and Macao, said Michael Windfuhr, the committee’s rapporteur on China.“We also received information of those who said the national security law was positive, just to reflect this,” Windfuhr said Wednesday as he grilled Hong Kong officials over the implementation of the law.One of those positive responses came from Kam Man-fung, deputy secretary general at One Country Two Systems Youth Forum, a Hong Kong-based think tank seeking debate and dialoge between young people in the semi-autonomous city and the mainland.Kam said he was partly motivated by the idea of “telling China’s story well” — a phrase that has been used by Chinese President Xi Jinping to encourage positive depictions of the country.Hong Kong has become a focus under heightened US-China tensions, which motived him to pay more attention to international affairs, Kam said.“I just want the world to understand my country and my birthplace more comprehensively,” the pro-Beijing New People’s Party member said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812105,No. 21 San Diego State gets by Fresno State 45-43,"FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — Matt Bradley scored 10 points and No. 21 San Diego State slipped past Fresno State 45-43 on Wednesday night. 

            San Diego State (21-5, 12-2 Mountain West Conference) has won four in a row and eight of nine overall, extending its win streak against the Bulldogs to eight games. 

            “I told the guys I don’t care what anybody says, it was a beautiful win,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said.











            “We find a way to win. That’s it.”

            Nathan Mensah had eight points, eight rebounds and four blocks for SDSU, and Keshad Johnson added seven points and eight boards. 

            Isaiah Hill converted a three-point play and Anthony Holland made a 3-pointer before Jemarl Baker Jr. hit a turnaround jumper to cap an 8-0 run that gave Fresno State a 41-40 lead with 4:51 to play. 

            Darrion Trammell answered with a layup about a minute later and Jaedon LeDee hit one of two free throws to put SDSU ahead by two. 

            Hill made a layup that tied it 43-all with 2:42 remaining, but Fresno State went 0 for 6 from the field the rest of the way. LeDee sank one of two free throws with 2:07 left to give the Aztecs a 44-43 lead, and Mensah added a foul shot with six seconds to go. Hill missed a shot for the Bulldogs as time expired. 

            “I couldn’t be more proud of our effort, how we hung together,” Dutcher said. 

            “Sometimes when things aren’t going well, teams will crumble. They’ll separate. They’ll get frustrated. And we just stay singularly focused on trying to win the game.”

            Hill led Fresno State (9-16, 5-9) with 16 points and Eduardo Andre had 10 points, nine rebounds, two blocks and two steals. 

            The Bulldogs shot 31% (17 of 55) from the field and went just 2 of 25 from 3-point range. 

            Hill scored 11 points and Andre added eight points with five rebounds in the first half as Fresno State took a 25-23 lead into the break despite shooting 1 of 10 from 3-point distance and committing 10 turnovers. 

            Fresno State shot 6 of 28 (21.4%) from the field and scored just 18 points in the second half on its way to its lowest-scoring output of the season. 

            “Eighteen points we gave them in the second half,” Dutcher said, “and it was just enough to get a victory.”

            San Diego State is 9-0 this season when holding its opponent under 60 points.

            The two countries are not only friends but also partners in a strategic alliance, Abdo said. He said that both Paraguay and Taiwan believe in peace and firmly defend the values of sovereignty, territorial integrity, people's self-determination, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and freedom.

            The president pointed out that the Taiwanese courageously fought for their freedom and defended the nation’s independence and sovereignty.

            Despite facing threats, the Taiwanese have never strayed from their commitment to peace and Taiwan continues to serve as a beacon of democracy in the region, Abdo said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812107,"Singapore achieves its highest fintech funding in three years, even as global fintech investment takes a hit due to economic conditions, lower valuations and turbulence in the crypto space: KPMG Pulse of Fintech H2’22","Singapore fintech investments bucked global trend, up 22 percent to US$4.1 billion in 2022, from US$3.4 billion the previous year. Top three investment areas in Singapore were Crypto/Blockchain, Payments and Wealthtech.   Global fintech market attracts U$164.1 billion across 6,006 deals in 2022 – a strong showing despite falling from the high of US$238.9 billion seen in 2021. Top three fintech investment areas globally are Payments, Crypto/Blockchain and Regtech.   Investors have turned to investing in non-crypto blockchain innovations after the Terra (Luna) crash and bankruptcies of Three-Arrows and FTX     SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 16 February 2023 - Overall fintech investments in Singapore saw a year-on-year rise, hitting a three-year-high of US$4.1 billion across 250 deals in mergers & acquisitions (M&A), private equity (PE), and venture capital (VC) in 2022, according to the KPMG Pulse of Fintech H2'22. 2022's total deal value here saw a 22 percent increase, up from US$3.4 billion in 2021, and a 75 percent increase from 2020's total deal value of US$2.3 billion. The 2022 figure is also the second highest fintech investment achieved by Singapore in the past decade, after investments peaked at US$5.62 billion in 2019 just before Covid-19.   Singapore's 2022 positive showing comes against the backdrop of falling global fintech investment. After reaching a record US$238.9 billion across 7,321 deals in 2021, total global fintech investment across M&A, PE, and VC dropped to US$164.1 billion across 6,006 deals in 2022. While results were substantially lower compared to 2021's peak highs for the world, 2022 was not a poor year as a whole. In fact, it was the third best year for global fintech investment and the second strongest year for global deal volume in the past decade.   Globally, the top three areas for fintech investment in 2022 were Payments, followed by Crypto/Blockchain and finally RegTech. In Singapore, these top three areas of fintech investment were Crypto/Blockchain, followed by Payments and finally WealthTech.   Regionally, the Americas remained the dominant force of fintech investment globally, accounting for US$68.6 billion in investment in 2022; the US accounted for US$61.6 billion of this total. The Asia-Pacific region reached a marginal new high of US$50.5 billion during 2022, while the EMEA region attracted US$44.9 billion. While the payments space attracted the largest share of fintech funding in 2022 (US$53.1 billion), Regtech was the hottest sector of the year, with investment rising from US$11.8 billion in 2021 to US$18.6 billion in 2022.   ""2022 was a tale of two fintech markets. The variance between the first half of the year and the second highlights the rapid shift in investor sentiment amidst a combination of challenges—high inflation and rising interest rates, the lack of IPO exits, the downward pressure on valuations, and, of course, the turbulence in the crypto space,"" said  Anton Ruddenklau, Global Head of Financial Services Innovation and Fintech, KPMG International. ""But the news wasn't all negative. Regtech, in particular, saw incredible investment in 2022, while seed-stage deals received excellent attention from investors after years of late-stage deals getting priority.""   KEY TRENDS     Investors shift to non-crypto blockchain-based solutions      Global investments in crypto and blockchain fell to US$23.1 billion in 2022 from US$30 billion in 2021. The decline was particularly noticeable in the second half of the year as investor sentiment related to the consumer crypto space and crypto exchanges plummeted following the Terra (Luna) crash in late H1'22 and the bankruptcy of crypto hedge company Three Arrows Capital in July. In Singapore, cryptocurrency and blockchain funding in Singapore also declined 21 percent from US$1.5 billion in 2021 to US$1.2 billion in 2022.           Given the FTX bankruptcy in November, it is likely that investment in crypto-focused firms will remain very slow into H1'23 as many investors work to review and significantly enhance their due diligence and governance processes related to investments in the crypto space. There could also be a shift in investment to jurisdictions with stronger regulatory frameworks for crypto activities.           With consumer crypto offerings losing their lustre, investors have started to turn their attention to broader blockchain-based solutions and value propositions. This includes investing in blockchain-based technologies that underpin solutions to real-world problems, such as conducting real-time payment settlement pre-validation, streamlining cross-border payments and tokenising assets.           One trend seen in 2022 that is expected to grow heading into 2023 is the shift of investors from blockchain companies focused on the retail market to startups focused on providing solutions for the SME market. One area increasingly attracting attention is the provision of SME-focused decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions, including solutions focused on SME loan financing or trade financing.       Payments remains a hot space in the fintech market      Globally, payments remain the strongest area of fintech investment in 2022, with US$53.1 billion in investment compared to US$57.1 billion in 2021. In Singapore, funding for payments rose 57 percent from US$628.4 million in 2021 to US$984.8 million in 2022.           A popular source of alternate financing, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), continues to drive interest despite valuation and regulatory challenges faced by firms. With inflation high and interest rates rising, BNPL companies will likely continue to have their margins challenged. Despite the challenges faced by some standalone BNPL firms, there continued to be momentum in the space, particularly on the part of corporates looking to embed or create their own BNPL offerings.           Interest in embedded payments also continued to grow during 2022, spanning a wide variety of sectors — from retail and e-commerce to gaming and ride-hailing. Corporates showed particular interest in the space, likely as a means to extend their customer value.        Cost of compliance remains key driver of regtech interest      The regtech space was a bright light of fintech investment in 2022, attracting a new high of US$18.6 billion in investment — well above the previous record of US$12.1 billion seen in 2021.           The ever-increasing cost of compliance is a major challenge for financial services companies everywhere in the world, with multinational companies particularly challenged to manage their compliance across multiple jurisdictions. With no end in sight to regulatory change both globally and in individual jurisdictions, it's not surprising that regtech investment climbed for the fourth year in a row during 2022 as investors and corporates embraced regtechs able to provide simpler, cost-efficient and sustainable solutions for managing compliance requirements.           The growth of digital banking, digital payments and crypto in different jurisdictions over the last few years has driven significant investment in regtech aimed at ensuring that such transactions are accurate, transparent, reliable and compliant. Recently, investors have shown very strong interest in companies able to provide multi-dimensional services. For example, in 2022, US-based Cross River Bank raised $620 million in PE funding to grow its fintech-focused compliance offerings, aimed at enabling a broad range of financial services activities, including payments, marketplace lending, banking-as-a-service platforms, capital-markets, and other digital banking activities.           That said, Singapore may have some way to go to attract fintech investments in this space. Locally, there was a 5 percent decline in Regtech deal value to US63.30 million in 2022, from $66.63 million in 2021.        Expanding access to a broader base of investors      The wealthtech sector globally attracted over $1.2 billion in total investment during 2022 — a very strong year, despite the decline from 2021's investment peak of $2 billion. Singapore also experienced a wealthtech sector rally attracting US$500 million in fintech investments in 2022, up from US$29.60 million in 2021. H2'22 saw the two largest wealthtech deals of the year, including the $323 million acquisition of UK-based Pollen Street Capital and the $300 million raise by Singapore-based crypto firm Amber.           This comes as a growing number of wealthtechs have, over the past year, focused on developing solutions able to give a broader base of investors unique access to asset classes that have typically only been used by institutional or high net worth investors – such platforms are able to cost-effectively facilitate fractional investments which traditionally had a high minimum investment.           Recognising that investors today have a wealth of information at their fingertips, both traditional wealth management firms and wealthtechs have been grappling with ways to enhance the value they provide to their clients and to build deeper relationships to help with retention. This has led to increasing interest and investment in solutions intended to improve the wealth management experience.      GLOBAL HIGHLIGHTS   The sharp drop-off in fintech investment between H1'22 and H2'22—from US$119.2 billion to US$44.9 billion—highlights the rapidly shifting market conditions much more clearly. H1'22 saw numerous US$1 billlion+ deals, including eight M&A—including the US$27.9 billion acquisition of Australia-based Afterpay by Block, two VC raises—Germany-based Trade Republic and UK-based Checkout.com, and one PE deal—US-based Genesis Digital Assets.   H2'22 by comparison saw just three M&A deals over US$1 billion—all in the US, including the US$8.4 billion buyout of Avalara, the US$1.7 billion buyout of Billtrust, and the US$1.6 billion buyout of Computer Services Inc. The largest VC raise of H2'22 was an US$800 million raise by Sweden-based Klarna—in what was a significant rounding down (A). The largest PE deal was a US$250 million raise by US-based Avant.     US drives fintech investment in Americas; region sees record Seed stage investment        Fintech investment in the Americas was US$68.6 billion in 2022, with the US accounting for the vast majority of this total (US$61.6 billion). By comparison, Brazil attracted US$1.8 billion and Canada attracted US$1.3 billion in fintech investment. While total investment declined year-over-year in the Americas, angel & seed-stage deals attracted a record US$4.5 billion—up from US$3.4 billion in 2021. Angel & seed-stage deals also saw the median deal size rise from US$2.4 million to US$3 million year-over-year. The Americas also saw its second strongest year of CVC-participating investment in 2022, with US$18.2 billion of investment; the US accounted for US$14.9 billion of this total.        Fintech investment in Asia-Pacific rises to record US$50.5 billion in 2022        Fintech investment in the Asia-Pacific region climbed to a slight new record high in 2021, rising from US$50.2 billion in 2021 to US$50.5 billion in 2022. The US$27.9 billion acquisition of Australia-based buy now, pay later company Afterpay by Block in H1'22 accounted for over half of this total. The impact of the one megadeal was particularly noticeable when looking at H1'22 and H2'22 results separately—with fintech investment in H2'22 just US$5.8 billion, compared to the US$44.6 billion seen in H1'22.           As a result of the Afterpay acquisition, Australia led fintech investment in the Asia-Pacific region—with US$30.2 billion of investment. Despite a decline from 2021's US$7.9 billion, investment in India remained robust at US$6 billion. Singapore saw fintech investment rise from US$3.4 billion to US$4.1 billion year-over-year. Fintech investment in China remained very weak in 2022 at just US$770 million.        EMEA sees large decline in fintech funding year-over-year      Fintech investment in the EMEA region dropped from US$79 billion across 2,379 deals in 2021 to US$44.9 billion across 1,977 deals in 2022. Investment in H1'22 was far more robust than H2'22, accounting for US$32.8 billion in investment compared to US$12.1 billion. The lack of US$1 billion+ fintech deals in H2'22 accounted for much larger drop-offs—with the largest deal in H1'22 the US$3.9 billion buyout of Italy-based SIA, compared to the US$840 million buyout of UK-based Nucleus Financial Group in H2'22.        Fintech investment likely to remain subdued heading into H1'23      With no end in sight to the macroeconomic challenges plaguing the public markets and the IPO window expected to remain closed well into the first half of 2023, fintech investment globally is expected to remain quite subdued, even compared to H2'22. While M&A activity could begin to pick up, deal sizes will likely be much smaller as investors wait for valuations of late-stage companies to settle. Regtech will likely remain one of the most resilient sections of fintech investment, in addition to B2B solutions within all fintech verticals. While investment in crypto is expected to be particularly weak in H1'23 as investors reconsider their due diligence processes and regulators consider tightening crypto regulations, the broader area of blockchain-based solutions—including institutional use cases, cross-border payments, gaming, and NFTs— will likely gain additional attention from investors.           Despite any short-term softness in the global fintech market, the long-term outlook for fintech investment remains quite positive given the ongoing transformation of financial services occurring in many different jurisdictions and the growing focus globally on embedding financial services offerings into other sectors.""      With interest rates still rising, valuations are going to remain quite tricky for some time. This will likely keep a lot of the biggest potential M&A transactions on the shelf as investors wait to see if prices come down even further,"" said  Anton Ruddenklau, Global Head of Financial Services Innovation and Fintech, KPMG International. ""That said, M&A activity will likely increase for smaller size deals as corporates and larger fintechs look to buy fintech capabilities at good value."" Hashtag: #KPMG

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812130,Emirates signs 3-year deal to sponsor British team in SailGP,"Emirates is expanding its sponsorship in sailing with a three-year deal to become the title partner of Sir Ben Ainslie’s British team in the SailGP global league.

            The squad will be known as Emirates Great Britain SailGP Team starting with this weekend's regatta in Sydney. The team showed off the new red and white color scheme and the Emirates logo on the wingsail and hulls as it sailed its foiling 50-foot catamaran past the Opera House and Sydney Harbor Bridge on Thursday.

            It’s a breakthrough team title sponsorship in SailGP, which was co-founded by tech tycoon Larry Ellison and five-time America’s Cup winner Russell Coutts and has three regattas left in its third season, which will culminate in a $1 million, winner-take-all championship race at the end of the San Francisco regatta in early May.











            The announcement of the Emirates deal in Sydney came a day after SailGP announced that Rolex has signed a 10-season partnership as the global presenting partner as well as the title sponsor of the opening regatta of Season 4, the Rolex United States Sail Grand Prix in Chicago on June 16-17.

            “I don’t think it’s any exaggeration to say that Emirates is one of a handful, if not the biggest and most prestigious brands in sports sponsorship,” Ainslie said in an interview with The Associated Press. “So, for our team to be associated with that is a massive statement. We’re incredibly proud to now be partnered with Emirates. We’ve talked a lot about the collaboration that we’re looking to set up with our team with like-minded partners that really want to come together and share a lot of these challenges around sustainability.”

            Emirates has sponsored Team New Zealand in the America’s Cup since 2004. The Kiwis are the two-time defending champions.

            “We’ve always been interested in growing our sports portfolio in the UK,” Emirates chief marketing officer Boutros Boutros said in an email. “We’re proud sponsors of Arsenal and Emirates FA Cup; and we also support cricket, tennis and golf across the country. When Ben reached out with an opportunity to expand our presence into the sailing world, we were very interested.”

            Boutros said he attended SailGP’s first-ever Middle East regatta in Dubai, which is Emirates’ home base, in mid-November “and was amazed at the large audience the sport attracts, and also the great potential this partnership can have. Sailing is also one of the most sustainable sports in the world and that’s a key part of our collaboration. We look forward to working closely with like-minded partners to share challenges, ideas and drive joint sustainability initiatives.”

            Ainslie is the most-decorated sailor in Olympic history, with four gold medals and a silver. He helped Oracle Team USA successfully defend the America’s Cup in 2013 in a stirring comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand and has led his own British team since 2017 in the competition for the oldest trophy in international sports. 

            Ainslie is the majority owner of Emirates Great Britain SailGP Team and has made big strides on the business side in recent months. He obtained a significant injection of private investment late last year, meaning Ellison’s Oracle Racing no longer owns any portion of the team. Ainslie also signed a three-year partnership with renewable energy company Low Carbon to aid his team’s quest to become the most sustainable elite sports team in the world. 

            “To bring in Emirates with our team as title partner is a really strong fit, not only for our team but the league and showcase the level the league is at that it can attract these sorts of partners,” Ainslie said.

            On Jan. 30, Emirates successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight with one of its two engines entirely powered by so-called sustainable fuel. Air carriers worldwide are trying to lessen their carbon footprint. 

            The Emirates deal puts Ainslie in a bit of a conundrum. Emirates supports Arsenal in the Premier League. “My home team is Chelsea, so I’m trying to decide whether that means I’m going to ditch Chelsea and start supporting Arsenal. I don’t know where that puts me. In trouble, I guess,” he quipped.

            Emirates Great Britain SailGP Team is third in the nine-boat fleet heading into the Sydney regatta, behind two-time defending champion Team Australia and New Zealand.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812131,Israel demolishes West Bank home of Palestinian attacker,"HEBRON, West Bank (AP) — Israeli forces demolished the home on Thursday of a Palestinian behind a deadly shooting in the occupied West Bank, as tensions and unrest surge in the region.

            The military said the demolition was carried out after an Israeli court rejected appeals to spare the residence. The home, in the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron, was demolished in a controlled explosion. A flash and then grey tufts of smoke were seen emerging from the apartment in the early morning hours. 

            Israel says home demolitions are meant to deter future attackers but critics say they amount to collective punishment against the families of assailants and only exacerbate tensions with Palestinians.











            In the fatal shooting incident last year, Muhammed Kamel al-Jabari opened fire at the entrance to an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, killing an Israeli man and wounding several civilians before a security guard shot him dead. 

            The demolition comes as unrest has been roiling the region for months. Israel has been conducting near-nightly arrest raids in the West Bank, which were prompted by a spate of Palestinian attacks against Israelis last spring. Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in 2022, making it the deadliest year in those territories since 2004, according to a leading Israeli rights group. 

            Nearly 50 Palestinians have been killed in those lands just this year, a sign that the fighting has intensified in recent weeks, just as Israel's new, far-right government has risen to power. It has promised to take a tough line against the Palestinians, and already has taken steps to ramp up West Bank settlement building. 

            Israel says most of those killed have been militants. But youth protesting the incursions and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed.

            Some 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis last year while at least another 11 people have been killed in attacks this year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812133,Ruling Taliban display rare division in public over bans,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — A rare public show of division within the ranks of Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban emerged in recent days when Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, a powerful government figure, gave a speech seen as implicit criticism of the movement’s reclusive supreme leader. 

            The Taliban leadership has been opaque since the former insurgents' takeover of the country in August 2021, with almost no indication of how decisions are made. 

            In recent months, the group’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, has appeared to take a stronger hand in directing policy. In particular, it was on his orders that the Taliban government banned women and girls from universities and schools after the sixth grade.











            The bans raised a fierce international uproar, increasing Afghanistan’s isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed — and worsening a humanitarian crisis. The bans also appeared to contradict previous policies by the Taliban government. 

            Between the Taliban takeover until the December ban on attending universities, women had been allowed to continue their studies. Taliban officials repeatedly promised that girls would be allowed to attend secondary school, but a decision to allow them back last year was suddenly reversed. 

            Haqqani made his comments in a speech over the weekend to a graduation ceremony at an Islamic religious school in the eastern province of Khost.

            “Monopolizing power and hurting the reputation of the entire system are not to our benefit,” Haqqani said, according to video clips of the speech released on social media by his supporters. “The situation cannot be tolerated,” he added.

            Haqqani said now that the Taliban have taken power, “more responsibility has been placed on our shoulders and it requires patience and good behavior and engagement with the people.” He said the Taliban must “soothe the wounds of the people” and act in a way that the people do not come to hate them and religion. 

            Haqqani did not refer to Akhundzada, but the remarks were seen by many commenting on social media as directed at him. Haqqani also did not mention the issue of women’s education, but he has said publicly in the past that women and girls should be allowed to go to school and universities. 

            Zabihullah Mujahed, the top spokesman for the Kabul government, said in an apparent reaction to Haqqani's comments — without naming him — that criticism is best voiced privately.

            ""If someone criticizes the emir, minister, or any other official, it is better — and Islamic ethics also say — that he should express his criticism directly and secretly to him,” not in public, he said.

            Akhundzada, an Islamic scholar, almost never appears in public and hardly ever leaves the Taliban heartland in southern Kandahar province. 

            He surrounds himself with other religious scholars and tribal leaders who oppose education and work for women. Only one known photo of him, years old, exists. Akhundzada came to Kabul only once since the Taliban takeover to give a speech to an assembly of pro-Taliban clerics, though he was not shown in media coverage at the closed event. 

            The Taliban have typically dealt with internal differences behind the scenes, and Haqqani’s comments “are a major escalation,” said Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia program and senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center. The Taliban leaders have the same broad vision, but “in Kandahar, they’re hermits, they’re not involved in the day-to-day,"" said Kugelman. In Kabul, they have to govern and provide services, he added.

            Haqqani leads a faction of the Taliban known as the Haqqani network, built around the family of the same name centered in Khost. The network battled U.S.-led NATO troops and former Afghan government forces for years and was notorious for attacks on civilians and suicide bombings in Kabul. The U.S. government maintains a $10 million bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani for attacks on American troops and Afghan civilians.

            His comments pointed to an apparent difference between some senior Taliban, who have had to rapidly adjust to the demands of government after two decades of fighting as insurgents.

            When they took power in 2021, Taliban officials said they wanted better ties to the world. They said they would not return to the social restrictions on women or punishments, such as public lashings, that they imposed during their first time in power in the 1990s.

            But over the nearly 20 months since, the Taliban have barred women from most jobs, middle school and high school as well as from parks. They've also ordered women to wear head-to-toe clothing in public.

            The deputy prime minister in the Taliban government, Abdul Salam Hanafi, indirectly criticized the ban on education for women and girls in a speech in Kabul this week.

            “If we don’t improve the quality and quantity of the education system and do not update it, we will never succeed,” he said. He added that the duty of Islamic scholars requires more than prohibiting a behavior or practice — they must also offer a solution and a path forward. 

            Ahmed Rashid, a veteran Lahore-based journalist who wrote several books about the Taliban, said he didn't expect change from Akhundzada and his Kandahar-based supporters.

            Rashid said that unity is a priority for the Taliban in the face of what they see as U.S. and NATO threats, and it's doubtful there is “any kind of revolt” within the ranks. But those in the Taliban leadership dealing with the burden of government have “realized they can’t continue like this,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812134,South Korea defense report revives 'enemy' label for North,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea called North Korea “our enemy” in its biennial defense document published Thursday, reviving the label for its rival for the first time in six years, as tensions worsen between the two countries.

            North Korea conducted an unprecedented number of missile tests in 2022, including simulated nuclear attacks on South Korea. In response, South Korea’s conservative government led by President Yoon Suk Yeol has been seeking a stronger U.S. security commitment and boosting its own military capabilities.

            Descriptions of North Korea in past South Korean defense white papers reflect the changing rocky ties between the two Koreas. Past South Korean documents called North Korea the “main enemy,” “present enemy” or “enemy” in times of animosity. But they avoided such references when relations were improved.











            North Korea “doesn’t give up its nukes and is persistently posing military threats to us, so the North Korean government and military … is our enemy,” the 2022 South Korean defense white paper issued Thursday said. 

            The document noted that in December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called South Korea “our undoubted enemy” in a speech at a key ruling party meeting. It also cited the passage of a new North Korean law authorizing pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons in a broad range of scenarios. 

            The document said the North Korean nuclear program and provocations “are seriously threatening our security.” It said the main objectives of South Korean defense policies include bracing for threats and a potential invasion by North Korea, deterring a war on the Korean Peninsula and contributing to a peaceful future Korean reunification.

            North Korea didn’t immediately respond to the revived use of enemy terminology in the South Korean defense paper, though it has lashed out at past such labels, calling them provocations that demonstrated South Korean hostility.

            South Korea first called North Korea its “main enemy” in 1995, a year after North Korea threatened to turn Seoul into “sea of fire” — rhetoric the North has since repeatedly used when confrontations flared with the South.

            During a previous era of inter-Korean detente in the 2000s, South Korea stopped using the enemy terminology, but revived it after 50 South Koreans were killed in attacks blamed on North Korea in 2010 — 46 in the torpedoing of a navy ship and four in the shelling of a border island. 

            South Korea again avoided using enemy labels when it was governed by Yoon’s liberal predecessor Moon Jae-in, who espoused greater reconciliation with North Korea. Defense documents published during Moon’s 2017-2022 rule didn’t mention North Korea by name when they said South Korea’s military “considers any force that threatens and violates the sovereignty, territory, people, and properties of the Republic of Korea as an enemy.”

            The latest defense paper refers to Kim Jong Un by name without any of his titles, while previous papers issued under Moon’s government used both his name and titles — “Chairman Kim Jong Un"" or “State Affairs Commission Chairman Kim Jong Un.""

            Yoon, who took office in May last year, has vowed a stern response to North Korean provocations. During his election campaign, Yoon wrote on Facebook that “the main enemy is North Korea"" after it conducted a series of missile tests.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea called North Korea “our enemy” in its biennial defense document published Thursday, reviving the label for its rival for the first time in six years, as tensions worsen between the two countries.North Korea conducted an unprecedented number of missile tests in 2022, including simulated nuclear attacks on South Korea. In response, South Korea’s conservative government led by President Yoon Suk Yeol has been seeking a stronger U.S. security commitment and boosting its own military capabilities.Descriptions of North Korea in past South Korean defense white papers reflect the changing rocky ties between the two Koreas. Past South Korean documents called North Korea the “main enemy,” “present enemy” or “enemy” in times of animosity. But they avoided such references when relations were improved.North Korea “doesn’t give up its nukes and is persistently posing military threats to us, so the North Korean government and military … is our enemy,” the 2022 South Korean defense white paper issued Thursday said.The document noted that in December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called South Korea “our undoubted enemy” in a speech at a key ruling party meeting.

He claimed that the government had not prepared well for Pelosi’s visit, even though four months elapsed between her announcing her plans and actually arriving in Taiwan.The government should have conducted more talks with the U.S. administration and with the Pentagon in particular, while collecting more information about the activities and intentions of the Chinese military, he said.",2023/02/16,2018,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812150,Turkey quake revives debate over nuclear plant being built,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A devastating earthquake that toppled buildings across parts of Turkey and neighboring Syria has revived a longstanding debate locally and in neighboring Cyprus about a large nuclear power station being built on Turkey’s southern Mediterranean coastline.

            The plant’s site in Akkuyu, located some 210 miles (338 kilometers) to the west of the epicenter of the Feb. 6 quake, is being designed to endure powerful tremors and did not sustain any damage or experience powerful ground shaking from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks. 

            But the size of the quake — the deadliest in Turkey’s modern history — sharpened existing concerns about the facility being built on the edge of a major fault line. 











            Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned company in charge of the project, says the power station is designed to “withstand extreme external influences” from a magnitude 9 earthquake. In nuclear power plant construction, plants are designed to survive shaking that is more extreme than what’s been previously recorded in the area they’re sited.

            The possibility of a magnitude 9 earthquake occurring in the vicinity of the Akkuyu reactor “is approximately once every 10,000 years,” Rosatom told The Associated Press via email last week. “That is exactly how the margin of safety concept is being implemented.”

            An official with Turkey’s Energy Ministry, when contacted by the AP, said there were no immediate plans to reassess the project. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol. Some activists, however, still say the project — the first nuclear power plant in Turkey — poses a threat.

            Nuclear facilities are constructed of heavily reinforced concrete, sized for significant earthquake shaking and far more robust than commercial buildings, said Andrew Whittaker, a professor of civil engineering at the University at Buffalo who is an expert in earthquake engineering and nuclear structures.

            The fact that it’s sited off the western end of the East Anatolian Fault, which was linked to last week’s powerful tremor, suggests that the design would have been checked for significant shaking, Whittaker added. 

            Still, Whittaker said, it would be prudent to reassess seismic hazard calculations in the region for all infrastructure, including the plant.

            “There’s no reason to be concerned, but there’s always a reason to be cautious,” he said. 

            That’s little comfort to activists in Turkey and on both sides of ethnically divided Cyprus. They’ve renewed their calls for the project to be scrapped, saying that the devastating earthquake is clear proof of the great risk posed by a nuclear power plant near seismic fault lines. 

            In a statement to the AP, the Cyprus Anti-Nuclear platform, a coalition of over 50 Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot environmentalist groups, trade unions and political parties, said it “calls on all political parties, scientific and environmental organizations and the civil society to join efforts and put pressure on the Turkish government to terminate its plans for the Akkuyu nuclear power plant.”

            Cypriot European Parliament member Demetris Papadakis asked the European Commission what immediate actions it intends to take to halt the plant because of the dangers posed by building a nuclear power station in a seismic zone so close to Cyprus.

            Nuclear power plants worldwide are designed to withstand earthquakes and shut down safely in the event of major earth movement — about 20% of nuclear reactors are operating in areas of significant seismic activity, according to the World Nuclear Association. 

            For example, Japanese nuclear plants, including the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant, are in regions where earthquakes of up to magnitude 8.5 may be expected, the association said. Stricter safety standards were adopted after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, when a tsunami crashed into the Daichi plant, melting three reactors and releasing dangerous levels of radiation. And the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California was designed to safely withstand earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding that could potentially occur in the region too, according to its operator. 

            Turkish nuclear regulators provided the license for the plant’s construction in Akkuyu in 1976 following eight years of seismic studies to determine the most suitable location, but the project was slowed down after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. Construction of the first reactor started in 2018. Large nuclear power plants have traditionally taken a while to build because of the size, scale and complexity of the infrastructure, and delays associated with first-of-a-kind plants. 

            According to Rosatom, a study by Turkey’s Office for the Prevention and Elimination of Consequences of Emergency Situations indicates that the site in Akkuyu – some 60 miles (95 kilometers) from Cyprus’ northern coastline – is located in the fifth degree earthquake zone, which is considered the safest region in terms of earthquakes. 

            The plant design includes an external reinforced concrete wall and internal protective shell made of “prestressed concrete,” with metal cables stretched inside the concrete shell to give additional solidity to the structure, the company said. And the modern reactor design, Russia’s VVER-1200, includes an additional safety feature — a 144 ton steel cone called the “core catcher” that in an emergency, traps and cools any molten radioactive materials, Rosatom added.

            The company emphasized that power units with VVER-1200 reactors comply with the post-Fukushima requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

            There’s a political dimension to qualms about the plant: Cyprus has accused Turkey of augmenting the Turkish Cypriots’ dependence on it in order to entrench the island’s ethnic division. Turkey has said it would supply the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north of the island with electricity through an undersea cable. A pipeline suspended a couple of hundred meters under the Mediterranean’s surface is already supplying the north with water. 

            The plant, whose first of four reactors is scheduled to go online later this year, will have a total capacity of 4,800 megawatts of electricity, providing about 10% of Turkey’s electricity needs. According to government figures, if the power plant started operating today, it could singlehandedly provide enough electricity for a city of about 15 million people, such as Istanbul, Rosatom added.

            It’s estimated to cost $20 billion. Rosatom has a 99.2% stake in the project, and is contracted to build, maintain, operate and decommission the plant.

            McDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island. Suzan Fraser, in Ankara, Turkey, contributed.NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A devastating earthquake that toppled buildings across parts of Turkey and neighboring Syria has revived a longstanding debate locally and in neighboring Cyprus about a large nuclear power station being built on Turkey’s southern Mediterranean coastline.The plant’s site in Akkuyu, located some 210 miles (338 kilometers) to the west of the epicenter of the Feb. 6 quake, is being designed to endure powerful tremors and did not sustain any damage or experience powerful ground shaking from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks.But the size of the quake — the deadliest in Turkey’s modern history — sharpened existing concerns about the facility being built on the edge of a major fault line.Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned company in charge of the project, says the power station is designed to “withstand extreme external influences” from a magnitude 9 earthquake. In nuclear power plant construction, plants are designed to survive shaking that is more extreme than what’s been previously recorded in the area they’re sited.The possibility of a magnitude 9 earthquake occurring in the vicinity of the Akkuyu reactor “is approximately once every 10,000 years,” Rosatom told The Associated Press via email last week. “That is exactly how the margin of safety concept is being implemented.”An official with Turkey’s Energy Ministry, when contacted by the AP, said there were no immediate plans to reassess the project. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol. Some activists, however, still say the project — the first nuclear power plant in Turkey — poses a threat.Nuclear facilities are constructed of heavily reinforced concrete, sized for significant earthquake shaking and far more robust than commercial buildings, said Andrew Whittaker, a professor of civil engineering at the University at Buffalo who is an expert in earthquake engineering and nuclear structures.The fact that it’s sited off the western end of the East Anatolian Fault, which was linked to last week’s powerful tremor, suggests that the design would have been checked for significant shaking, Whittaker added.Still, Whittaker said, it would be prudent to reassess seismic hazard calculations in the region for all infrastructure, including the plant.“There’s no reason to be concerned, but there’s always a reason to be cautious,” he said.That’s little comfort to activists in Turkey and on both sides of ethnically divided Cyprus. They’ve renewed their calls for the project to be scrapped, saying that the devastating earthquake is clear proof of the great risk posed by a nuclear power plant near seismic fault lines.In a statement to the AP, the Cyprus Anti-Nuclear platform, a coalition of over 50 Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot environmentalist groups, trade unions and political parties, said it “calls on all political parties, scientific and environmental organizations and the civil society to join efforts and put pressure on the Turkish government to terminate its plans for the Akkuyu nuclear power plant.”Cypriot European Parliament member Demetris Papadakis asked the European Commission what immediate actions it intends to take to halt the plant because of the dangers posed by building a nuclear power station in a seismic zone so close to Cyprus.Nuclear power plants worldwide are designed to withstand earthquakes and shut down safely in the event of major earth movement — about 20% of nuclear reactors are operating in areas of significant seismic activity, according to the World Nuclear Association.For example, Japanese nuclear plants, including the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant, are in regions where earthquakes of up to magnitude 8.5 may be expected, the association said. Stricter safety standards were adopted after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, when a tsunami crashed into the Daichi plant, melting three reactors and releasing dangerous levels of radiation. And the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California was designed to safely withstand earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding that could potentially occur in the region too, according to its operator.Turkish nuclear regulators provided the license for the plant’s construction in Akkuyu in 1976 following eight years of seismic studies to determine the most suitable location, but the project was slowed down after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. Construction of the first reactor started in 2018. Large nuclear power plants have traditionally taken a while to build because of the size, scale and complexity of the infrastructure, and delays associated with first-of-a-kind plants.According to Rosatom, a study by Turkey’s Office for the Prevention and Elimination of Consequences of Emergency Situations indicates that the site in Akkuyu – some 60 miles (95 kilometers) from Cyprus’ northern coastline – is located in the fifth degree earthquake zone, which is considered the safest region in terms of earthquakes.The plant design includes an external reinforced concrete wall and internal protective shell made of “prestressed concrete,” with metal cables stretched inside the concrete shell to give additional solidity to the structure, the company said. And the modern reactor design, Russia’s VVER-1200, includes an additional safety feature — a 144 ton steel cone called the “core catcher” that in an emergency, traps and cools any molten radioactive materials, Rosatom added.The company emphasized that power units with VVER-1200 reactors comply with the post-Fukushima requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency.There’s a political dimension to qualms about the plant: Cyprus has accused Turkey of augmenting the Turkish Cypriots’ dependence on it in order to entrench the island’s ethnic division. Turkey has said it would supply the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north of the island with electricity through an undersea cable. A pipeline suspended a couple of hundred meters under the Mediterranean’s surface is already supplying the north with water.The plant, whose first of four reactors is scheduled to go online later this year, will have a total capacity of 4,800 megawatts of electricity, providing about 10% of Turkey’s electricity needs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812151,Asian shares skid after inflation report thumps Wall Street,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares slipped in Asia on Friday after benchmarks on Wall Street had their biggest drop in four weeks as investors registered disappointment over an inflation reading that came in hotter than expected.

            Oil prices and U.S. futures also declined after the S&P 500 fell 1.4% Thursday following news that inflation at the wholesale level slowed by less than economists had forecast. It echoed a report on prices at the consumer level from earlier this week that suggested inflation isn’t cooling as quickly and as smoothly as hoped.

            Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.6% to 27,523.40 while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.4% to 20,899.72. The Kospi in South Korea sank 0.8% to 2,455.42. 











            The Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.2% to 3,243.82 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.8% to 7,350.00. Taiwan’s benchmark lost 0.5%.

            Bangkok's SET index fell 0.2% after the government reported the economy grew at a meager 2.6% annual pace in 2022 and slowed more than expected in the last quarter of the year, to a 1.3% annual expansion, as a rebound in tourism failed to make up for weaker exports. 

            On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3% to 33,696.85, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 1.8% to 11,855.83. 

            The S&P 500 ended at 4,090.41. A 2.7% fall for Microsoft, 3.3% drop for Nvidia and 4.7% slide for Tesla were some of the heaviest weights on the benchmark index.

            Stocks have been churning recently on worries that persistently high inflation will push the Federal Reserve to get even more aggressive on interest rates. Higher rates can drive down inflation but also drag on investment prices and raise the risk of a serious recession. 

            Such fears have been most clear in the bond market, where yields have leaped this month as traders raise their forecasts for how high the Fed will take interest rates.

            Treasury yields rose Thursday as traders upped their bets for how high the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher rates hurt the economy and weigh on financial markets. Other data on the economy chipped away at hopes the Fed might wrestle inflation lower without causing a severe recession.

            The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.67% from less than 4.60% before the inflation report’s release and from less than 4.10% earlier this month. It’s near its highest level since November, when the yield reached levels last seen in 2007.

            Thursday’s inflation report showed that prices at the wholesale level were 6% higher last month than a year earlier, slower than December’s rate but worse than expected. Perhaps more concerning was that inflation accelerated in January on a month-to-month basis even after stripping out prices for food, energy and other layers. 

            The inflation report thudded onto Wall Street along with a batch of other data painting a mixed picture of the economy. 

            Fewer workers applied for jobless benefits last week than expected, suggesting that layoffs remain low across the economy. That’s good news for workers and another signal of strength for the job market, but the Fed worries it could also add upward pressure on inflation. 

            Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said in a speech Thursday that she saw “a compelling economic case” at the Fed's meeting earlier this month to raise rates by double what it did. 

            In other trading on Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 64 cents to $77.85 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing basis, gave up 68 cents to $84.46 per barrel. 

            The dollar rose to 134.67 Japanese yen from 133.99 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0653 from $1.0673.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812153,"Ukraine says Russia turns to decoy missiles, intel balloons","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia has switched its aerial strike tactics to fool Ukraine’s air defenses, using decoy missiles without explosive warheads and deploying balloons, a senior Ukrainian official said Thursday.

            “The Russians are definitely changing tactics” as the war approaches its one-year anniversary, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in an interview with The Associated Press.

            The goal of the decoy missiles, Podolyak said, is to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defense systems by offering too many targets.











            “They want to overload our anti-aircraft system to get an extra chance to hit infrastructure facilities,” Podolyak said, adding that Ukraine's air defenses are adapting to the challenge.

            In the AP interview, Podolyak also renewed Ukraine’s appeals for long-range missiles that would enable it to strike Russian troop concentrations far behind the front lines, and also stressed that “we just don’t have enough shells.”

            He argued that speeded-up supplies of weaponry from Western partners would quicken an end to the war and said drawn-out war would favor Russia, not least because its population is more than three times that of Ukraine.

            “A protracted war is the slow death of Ukraine,” he said. “Russia has enough time. Why? They will live in poverty. They always live like this. They don’t need comfort. They can live in a camp. They can live in isolation.”

            But nearly a year into the Russian invasion, the human, economic and diplomatic costs are proving huge for Moscow. Its military difficulties include a growing shortage of missiles, Ukrainian and Western officials say. It has fired wave upon wave of missiles and killer drones at Ukraine since October, in a sustained and targeted effort to take out power supplies and other essential infrastructure over the winter.

            Podolyak said Russia is facing “missile exhaustion"" and that shortages are forcing its change in tactics. He said Russia is mixing older Soviet-era missiles with “new missiles that have some value.” 

            Moscow has not acknowledged problems with weapon supplies. But Britain's Defense Ministry said in late November that Russia appeared to be stripping nuclear warheads off old cruise missiles and then firing the missiles as blanks at Ukraine. “Russia almost certainly hopes such missiles will function as decoys and divert Ukrainian air defenses,"" it said.

            Ukraine's Western allies have progressively boosted the country's air defenses in response to Russia's expanded bombardments of the power grid and other targets. The sophisticated Western-supplied systems have helped deny air superiority to Russia’s much larger air force and blunted its missile and drone attacks.

            The changed Russian tactics — seen by some as evidence that Moscow is adapting its brute-force war strategy into something more nuanced — appeared to pay dividends Thursday when Russian forces fired 36 missiles in a two-hour overnight burst. Ukrainian air defense batteries shot down 16 of them — a lower rate of success than against some previous Russian waves.

            Another new feature of Russia’s strategy is the use of what Podolyak called “special air balloons.” He wouldn’t go into detail about their suspected purpose. But they may be intended to possibly confuse or provide intelligence about Ukrainian air defenses.

            Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said the Russian balloons carried reflectors to mislead air defenses, and indicate that Moscow is ""starting to use other methods.”

            Air Force spokesman Yurii Ihnat said: “The enemy wants our air defense systems to spend ammunition on these balloons, the cost of which is quite small.”

            Kyiv’s military administration said six such balloons were detected floating over the capital on Wednesday. Ukrainian air defenses shot down most of them.

            Russia's new use of balloons in Ukraine comes after the Biden administration shot down a China balloon, saying it was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals. 

            Russia's latest barrage of cruise and other missiles hit targets in the north, west, south, east and center of the country, Ukrainian officials said.

            One of the strikes killed a 79-year-old woman and injured at least seven other people in the eastern city of Pavlohrad, the regional governor said.

            Overall, Russian attacks and shelling over the previous 24 hours killed at least seven people, Ukraine’s presidential office said Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812154,From tents to tanks; a big year in Ukraine for NATO allies,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, the leaders of NATO’s 30 member countries held an emergency summit to address what they described as the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades — the launch of what would become the biggest land war in Europe since 1945.

            “In this very evolving and difficult situation, it’s hard to predict what will (happen) in the future, but allies are providing support and are very committed to continue,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters. What that support might look like was an open question.

            In the months that followed, Ukraine’s supporters at NATO and elsewhere sent fuel, helmets, medical supplies and other non-lethal support. Then, after much hand-wringing, came artillery and air defense systems in the hope that these would not provoke Russia's President Vladimir Putin.











            NATO, as an organization, was wary of being dragged into all-out war with nuclear-armed Russia. Technically it still is, but a year on the Ukraine Contact Defense Group this week held talks at NATO’s Brussels headquarters, where the alliance's leaders, ministers and envoys usually sit.

            Having just secured a promise of sorely needed battle tanks Ukraine wanted more: fighter jets.

            “Ukraine has to win this war,” said Hanno Pevkur, the defense minister of Estonia, a Baltic country that shares a border and a long history with Russia and is extremely wary of Putin’s intentions. The government has stepped up conscription and NATO has boosted its troop presence there.

            “We had many questions. Should we send tanks? Now this decision is made,” Pevkur said. “Always, there has been the question before, and then the answer after that. We know that Ukraine needs any kind of help, and that means also jet fighters.”

            All that’s missing, it might seem, is the boots of allied troops on the ground. Indeed, the public in Europe and North America could be excused for believing that their taxes funding the world’s most powerful security organization are being spent in a war with Russia.

            In the year since the Russians invaded, the U.S. has provided more than $27 billion in military help to Ukraine. Two senior defense officials estimated this week that other allies have stumped up more than $19 billion worth, with over $1 billion each from Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland.

            That’s on top of the tens of billions the West is sending to keep Ukraine’s battered economy afloat.

            For the nationalist government of Hungary, a NATO ally, there is no doubt about what this means.

            “If you send weapons, if you finance the entire annual budget of one of the belligerents, if you promise more and more weapons, more and more modern weapons, then you can say whatever you want. No matter what you say, you are in the war,” Prime Minister Viktor Orban said last month.

            Not so, says Stoltenberg. Even as he exhorted allies and partners this week to give Ukraine more weapons and ammunition, the former Norwegian prime minister insisted, in response to a question from The Associated Press, that NATO is not at war with Russia.

            “Neither NATO nor NATO allies are party to the conflict. What we do ... is to provide support to Ukraine. Ukraine is defending itself,” he said. “The type of support that we provide to Ukraine has evolved as the war has evolved.”

            Indeed it has, and some of it is tough to find despite the West’s best intentions. Ukraine now fires daily as many artillery shells as a small NATO country orders during a peace-time year, and Europe's defense industry just can’t keep up.

            “This has become a grinding war of attrition, and therefore it’s also a battle of logistics, and this is a huge effort by allies to actually get in the ammunition, the fuel, the spare parts which are needed,” Stoltenberg said.

            Perhaps one of the most important changes sparked by the war has been the realization that NATO’s collective defense guarantee — the pledge that an attack on any ally will be met with a response from them all — is no longer an abstract promise.

            Former U.S. President Donald Trump undermined confidence in that guarantee by threatening to abandon any ally that he considered was not spending enough on its armed forces.

            Early in the war his successor, Joe Biden, vowed that NATO would defend “every inch” of its territory, to dissuade Putin from targeting any member. Finland and Sweden even gave up their traditional stance of non-alignment to apply to join NATO and secure that very protection.

            One year on, some 40,000 troops are under NATO command in eastern Europe, from Estonia down to Bulgaria on the Black Sea. Around 100,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Europe. Some 140 warships ply European waters, aerial surveillance runs round the clock and a total 130 aircraft are on permanent standby.

            Those forces are only meant to remain on allied territory but member countries near Russia’s borders, like Lithuania, say they are prepared to go “all the way” in their support for Ukraine. They believe the country should be permitted to join NATO, war or not.

            When NATO leaders meet in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in July they are likely to consider upping the ante with more hi-tech equipment. It’s hard to believe that any ally might ponder sending troops. But 18 months ago not even NATO believed that Putin would invade Ukraine.

What that support might look like was an open question.In the months that followed, Ukraine’s supporters at NATO and elsewhere sent fuel, helmets, medical supplies and other non-lethal support. Then, after much hand-wringing, came artillery and air defense systems in the hope that these would not provoke Russia's President Vladimir Putin.NATO, as an organization, was wary of being dragged into all-out war with nuclear-armed Russia. Technically it still is, but a year on the Ukraine Contact Defense Group this week held talks at NATO’s Brussels headquarters, where the alliance's leaders, ministers and envoys usually sit.Having just secured a promise of sorely needed battle tanks Ukraine wanted more: fighter jets.“Ukraine has to win this war,” said Hanno Pevkur, the defense minister of Estonia, a Baltic country that shares a border and a long history with Russia and is extremely wary of Putin’s intentions. The government has stepped up conscription and NATO has boosted its troop presence there.“We had many questions. Should we send tanks? Now this decision is made,” Pevkur said. “Always, there has been the question before, and then the answer after that. We know that Ukraine needs any kind of help, and that means also jet fighters.”All that’s missing, it might seem, is the boots of allied troops on the ground. Indeed, the public in Europe and North America could be excused for believing that their taxes funding the world’s most powerful security organization are being spent in a war with Russia.In the year since the Russians invaded, the U.S. has provided more than $27 billion in military help to Ukraine. Two senior defense officials estimated this week that other allies have stumped up more than $19 billion worth, with over $1 billion each from Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland.That’s on top of the tens of billions the West is sending to keep Ukraine’s battered economy afloat.For the nationalist government of Hungary, a NATO ally, there is no doubt about what this means.“If you send weapons, if you finance the entire annual budget of one of the belligerents, if you promise more and more weapons, more and more modern weapons, then you can say whatever you want. No matter what you say, you are in the war,” Prime Minister Viktor Orban said last month.Not so, says Stoltenberg. Even as he exhorted allies and partners this week to give Ukraine more weapons and ammunition, the former Norwegian prime minister insisted, in response to a question from The Associated Press, that NATO is not at war with Russia.“Neither NATO nor NATO allies are party to the conflict. What we do ... is to provide support to Ukraine. Ukraine is defending itself,” he said. “The type of support that we provide to Ukraine has evolved as the war has evolved.”Indeed it has, and some of it is tough to find despite the West’s best intentions. Ukraine now fires daily as many artillery shells as a small NATO country orders during a peace-time year, and Europe's defense industry just can’t keep up.“This has become a grinding war of attrition, and therefore it’s also a battle of logistics, and this is a huge effort by allies to actually get in the ammunition, the fuel, the spare parts which are needed,” Stoltenberg said.Perhaps one of the most important changes sparked by the war has been the realization that NATO’s collective defense guarantee — the pledge that an attack on any ally will be met with a response from them all — is no longer an abstract promise.Former U.S. President Donald Trump undermined confidence in that guarantee by threatening to abandon any ally that he considered was not spending enough on its armed forces.Early in the war his successor, Joe Biden, vowed that NATO would defend “every inch” of its territory, to dissuade Putin from targeting any member. Finland and Sweden even gave up their traditional stance of non-alignment to apply to join NATO and secure that very protection.One year on, some 40,000 troops are under NATO command in eastern Europe, from Estonia down to Bulgaria on the Black Sea. Around 100,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Europe. Some 140 warships ply European waters, aerial surveillance runs round the clock and a total 130 aircraft are on permanent standby.Those forces are only meant to remain on allied territory but member countries near Russia’s borders, like Lithuania, say they are prepared to go “all the way” in their support for Ukraine. They believe the country should be permitted to join NATO, war or not.When NATO leaders meet in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in July they are likely to consider upping the ante with more hi-tech equipment. It’s hard to believe that any ally might ponder sending troops. But 18 months ago not even NATO believed that Putin would invade Ukraine.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/02/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812155,Israeli FM promises cooperation with Ukraine against Iran,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Israel and Ukraine on Thursday agreed to step up cooperation in a shared struggle against Iran, Israel's foreign minister announced, as he wrapped up the first visit to Kyiv by a senior Israeli official since Russia's invasion last year.

            But Foreign Minister Eli Cohen gave few details on what type of cooperation would take place. He also gave no indication that Israel had met a longstanding Ukrainian request to join the U.S. and other Western allies in providing weapons to the Ukrainian military.

            Israel considers Iran to be its greatest enemy, citing the country's nuclear program, its hostile rhetoric and its support for militant groups along Israel's borders. 











            With Iran now providing attack drones to Russia in the Ukrainian war, Israel could be in a position to assist Ukraine with intelligence on arms shipments and expertise on how to counter the aerial threats.

            Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, Cohen was evasive. “We spoke about deepening cooperation with Ukraine against the Iranian threat in the international arena,” he said.

            Since the outbreak of the war, Israel has walked a tightrope between assisting Ukraine and avoiding friction with Russia, with which it has strategic regional interests. Unlike other western countries, Israel has not imposed sanctions on Russia or Russian officials or provided Ukraine with weapons. 

            It has provided humanitarian support to Ukraine, including a field hospital. Cohen said Thursday that Israel would provide $200 million in loan guarantees to build hospitals in Ukraine and reiterated an Israeli pledge to give Ukraine a sophisticated air-defense warning system. 

            But he gave no specifics on when that system might be delivered, made no mention of Russia and did not publicly respond to Ukrainian appeals for Israeli arms.

            “Israel, as stated in the past, stands firmly in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and remains committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” Cohen said.

            Ukrainian leaders have talked in the past about some intelligence cooperation with Israel. Cohen refused to answer questions about the topic.

            The visit came just before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion and as Western nations seek to increase aid to the country. 

            Cohen earlier met with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said on Twitter afterwards that he was “thankful for all of the support that Israel and Israelis have provided over the past year.”

            “During our detailed and frank talks, we focused on ways to enhance bilateral relations, increase assistance, and address shared security challenges,” he said.

            Yevgen Korniychuk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Israel, said that Israel “again assured us that they will bring the early warning system, but they didn’t say when.” 

            Cohen was reminded of the hardships endured by Ukrainians when air raid sirens sounded as he entered the country’s Foreign Ministry. 

            Cohen also made stops at Bucha, where hundreds of people were found dead, some with their hands tied, after a Russian withdrawal last year. Ukrainian officials allege atrocities. Cohen also visited Babi Yar, a ravine in Kyiv where nearly 34,000 Jews were killed within 48 hours in 1941 when the city was under Nazi occupation. The killing was carried out by SS troops along with local collaborators.

            Cohen said earlier this year that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government “will definitely do one thing: publicly, we will talk less” about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but would keep providing Ukraine with humanitarian aid. Shortly after taking office, he spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

            Israel maintains good working relations with both warring countries, and has large populations of Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. Israel also relies on security coordination with Russia over neighboring Syria, where Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes against Iranian military positions in the past decade. 

            As other Western nations step up assistance to Ukraine, pressure has built on Israel to share some of its sophisticated military means with Ukraine, including from the U.S. 

            Secretary of State Antony Blinken said following a meeting with Netanyahu in Jerusalem last month that he had emphasized “the importance of providing support for all of Ukraine’s needs – humanitarian, economic, and security.”

            Last year, Israel’s former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, attempted briefly to mediate between the sides, flying to Moscow shortly after Russia’s invasion and meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Bennett said an interview earlier this month that Putin assured him at the time that Russia would not kill Zelenskyy.KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Israel and Ukraine on Thursday agreed to step up cooperation in a shared struggle against Iran, Israel's foreign minister announced, as he wrapped up the first visit to Kyiv by a senior Israeli official since Russia's invasion last year.But Foreign Minister Eli Cohen gave few details on what type of cooperation would take place.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812166,KPMG China expects border reopening provides opportunity to turn around the Government’s deficit,"KPMG China recommends measures to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness by attracting talent and foreign investment

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 16 February 2023 - KPMG China estimates Hong Kong's deficit for the fiscal year would be doubled the original deficit estimate, however, as the borders reopen and anti-epidemic measures are relaxed, the situation would turn around. Despite the third deficit in four years, Hong Kong's fiscal reserves remain healthy and can be used to assist local people and enterprises, while supporting ongoing targeted measures to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness in medium to long term.   KPMG China forecasts the Hong Kong SAR Government will record a HKD 120.9 billion deficit for the fiscal year 2022/23, compared to the Government's original estimate of a HKD 56.3 billion deficit, driven by less than expected land related revenue and stamp duty revenue. KPMG China estimates the city's fiscal reserve to stand at HKD 836.2 billion by the end of March 2023.   John Timpany, Partner, Head of Tax in Hong Kong, KPMG China, says: ""The opening of the borders and the relaxation of anti-epidemic measures provide an opportunity for an economic turnaround. Short-term fiscal deficit due to relief measures to support citizens and businesses is acceptable. KPMG China believes that the Government should make the timely and right use of fiscal reserves to stimulate the economy, prepare for the turnaround, and maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness.""   KPMG China suggests immediate measures such as the distribution of consumption vouchers worth HKD 5,000 to Hong Kong permanent residents and new arrivals, with a portion of vouchers designated to certain targeted sectors such as catering and entertainment. KPMG China also proposes that Hong Kong permanent residents aged 70 or above receive HKD 5,000 cash through the Old Age Allowance. With the launch of the global promotional campaign ""Hello Hong Kong"", KPMG China recommends that the Government provide monthly work allowance of HK$3,000 to newly employed tourism workers during 2023/24 over a three-month period, at the same time extend the Tourism Industry Additional Support Scheme by providing each eligible licensed travel agent with a one-off cash subsidy.   In the short-to-medium term, KPMG China recommends the Government introduce new allowances to encourage stay-at-home parents to return to the workforce and revisit the tax bands and lower the progressive rates to attract talent to Hong Kong. In order to build the territory into a world class smart city, KPMG China suggests the Government refine the current tax incentives for research and development (R&D) expenditure, as well as take the lead in digitalizing its work flow and service delivery in order to leverage the ongoing technological advancement for Government's operations.   Alice Leung, Tax Partner, KPMG China, says: ""In order to attract talent and support business growth, the Government could introduce a tax concession where share-based remuneration offered by strategic enterprises to its Hong Kong employees would be exempt from Salaries Tax. Apart from this, the Government could provide immigration incentive by shortening the number of years required to obtain a Hong Kong permanent residency from 7 years to 4 years for successful applicants / employees under Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, Top Talent Pass Scheme and certain tax incentives to make it more attractive and comprehensive.""   Possible long-term measures from the Government include enhancing sustainable economic growth and Hong Kong's competitiveness by attracting more foreign investment. When it comes to attracting businesses, including attracting companies to establish regional headquarters in Hong Kong, the Government should adopt 50% of the normal tax rate (i.e. 8.25%) for profits derived from regional headquarters in Hong Kong. KPMG China also suggests to enhance the tax system by providing clarity on the definition of non-taxable capital gains from the disposal of shares and other equity interests and relaxing the existing stringent conditions for tax deduction of interest expenses.   Stanley Ho, Tax Partner, KPMG China, says: ""The Government should create a senior body to deal with tax policy issues, one that is responsible for enhancing Hong Kong's overall tax competitiveness as well as formulating the tax policies and measures for specific industrial sectors in Hong Kong. Moreover, they must expand and optimize the treaty network to cover other principal trading partners' jurisdictions and attract foreign investors to set up companies in Hong Kong, which in turn would promote economic development, enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness in the long run.""   As part of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) collaboration, KPMG China believes that the Government should extend the R&D tax deduction to cover R&D activities carried out in the GBA and provide accelerated tax depreciation allowance for fixed assets for set-ups in the Northern Metropolis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812226,Bartra Wealth Advisors responds to the closure of the Ireland Immigrant Investor Programme (IIP),"Bartra Wealth Advisors, the leading IIP fundraiser in Asia, recorded almost 230 IIP applications and repaid nearly €100 million to IIP investors in 2022 

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 16 February 2023 - On Tuesday 14 February, the Irish government announced the closure of the Immigrant Investor Programme (IIP), which was first introduced in 2012. The Programme has approved investment totaling more than €1 billion, which has benefitted Ireland and many enterprises, both economic and social, including community and sporting organisations.   The Minister of Justice said the decision to close the scheme had taken into account studies by international bodies such as the European Commission, which last year called on EU governments to end national programmes to sell citizenship to investors, which it has long considered a security risk.   Bartra Wealth Advisors, the immigration arm of Ireland's most successful real estate developer Bartra Group which specialises in providing independent Irish immigration investment advisory services on investment in Ireland's much-needed, purpose-built social housing and nursing home IIP projects, reported receiving over 100 phone calls following the announcement from clients in China, Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan, Vietnam, Korea and the USA, asking about their applications and the impact of the IIP's closure.   ""The closure of the Programme will not affect existing projects that have been approved by the Government. For these, we can continue to source the investors required to complete funding and we will continue to be monitored by the Department of Justice in relation to the delivery of the projects and for compliance purposes,"" said Daniel Hinds, COO of Bartra Wealth Advisors. ""Investors who have already been approved by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) will not be affected by the closure of the Programme, and all future visa renewals will be granted as long as the requirements are fulfilled.""   James Hartshorn, CEO and Co-Founder of the company said: ""Since last year, we have been advising our clients who were considering the IIP but had not yet made up their minds to take action and be proactive as policy changes could happen at any time. Ireland in particular offers a great quality of life and a strong economy, as well as world-class healthcare and educational systems making it an easy place for foreigners to immigrate to.""   ""Since we established our business in China in 2016, we have been aggressively expanding our global footprint and offering IIP opportunities to more families looking for better education for their children as well as greater access to the EU and UK. As well as China, we have received approvals of applications for American, Vietnamese, Indian and Korean clients.   ""Bartra's IIP business is a win-win business. It brings capital from all over the world to fund much-needed local infrastructure, which was and remains undersupplied, and to support government initiatives such as the Housing for All policy. For Bartra, building new homes is a key part of our business. As well as providing much-needed housing, our construction programme helps to create jobs and training opportunities, regenerate neighbourhoods and support communities across Ireland. We plan to deliver at least 3,000 new homes between now and 2030, with our primary focus on the continued delivery of sustainable social housing.   ""Bartra is also developing portfolios of nursing homes and care units to support this in-demand sector in Ireland. To ensure the success of the developments, we are one of few groups that integrate development, operation and management into our IIP projects.   ""For our investors, their investment with us is very safe. Last year alone, we made repayments of nearly €100 million to about 100 IIP investors who had invested in our social housing and nursing home projects. Many of their repayments have also been reinvested in other development projects in Ireland and a large number of our clients are now living or plan to live in Ireland with their children who are or will be studying in Irish schools. We believe a diversified community with talent from around the world will only further strengthen Ireland's future economic and social growth.""   Bartra Wealth Advisors also has been supporting Irish nationwide charities, sporting clubs and hospitals with significant investments into these sectors under the IIP Endowment option.   Organisations with IIP-approved projects are welcome to contact Bartra Wealth Advisors to leverage its global client base for raising funds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812282,Ukraine war saga unfolds across the lives of 5 friends,"BUCHA, Ukraine (AP) — In the cemetery where Oleksii Zavadskyi and Yurii Stiahliuk are buried, the women they loved take drags on the men’s favorite brands of cigarettes. Clouds of smoke are exhaled in silence.

            Interlaced between Anastasiia Okhrimenko’s dainty fingers are Camels. Anna Korostenska lights L&M’s, her hands shaking in the cold. An intimate ritual when the men were still alive — at the end of the day, when it was just the two of them — it is now a somber tradition carried on after death.

            Oleksii and Yurii were killed on Ukraine's eastern front five months apart. One was Vadym Okhrimenko’s best friend and died in his arms. “Gone, in an instant,” he says, briskly packing his combat uniform and gear. Soon he returns to the battlefield, heavy with sorrow, hungry for revenge. 











            The five had known each other since childhood. They came of age in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb now synonymous with the war’s most horrific atrocities. Their interwoven tales reveal how Russia's invasion of Ukraine almost one year ago changed their lives, their neighborhood, their country.

            “This war is not just about soldiers,” says Anna. “It’s about everyone connected to them, and their pain.” 

            With each passing month, sedimentary layers of grief formed: violent occupations followed by tearful separations and interminable waiting. Between chaotic front lines where victory turned to attrition and homes assailed with constant air raids and power cuts, love blossomed, friendships deepened and the fear of death burrowed in. 

            As the conflict that killed their loved ones rages on, Anna, Anastasiia and her brother, Vadym, wrestle with a question that all of war-torn Ukraine must grapple with: After loss, what comes next? 

            HISTORY UNFOLDING

            In Bucha, familiar childhood landmarks are imbued with a new, dark history. 

            There is the building behind the playground where dozens took shelter from the approaching Russian troops; the garages where Russian soldiers burned to death those sheltering inside; the supermarket, from where the funeral processions now start. 

            The occupation, which lasted 33 days from the start of the invasion on Feb. 24 to April 1, when Russian troops withdrew, became a potent symbol of the war’s horrors. Liberation revealed the mass murder of civilians and cruel accounts of rape. More than 450 people were killed, according to local authorities. 

            Anastasiia fled the area for another. Anna remained in Bucha until March 10. She spent nights in the shelter as Russian tanks rolled past her neighborhood of Sklozavod, soldiers ransacked shops and ran over a man sitting in a car. All this, she witnessed. 

            “We are still processing,” says Andrii Holovyn, 50, the community’s priest, who presided over Yurii’s funeral and those of countless other soldiers after him. “People are living in constant danger, without light, with no breaks in between.” 

            The occupation propelled the childhood friends to act. Oleksii’s mother and sister escaped to Germany. Vadym’s wife fled to the Czech Republic. Yurii asked Anastasiia to leave her job and stay at home. 

            They were very different, the three men. Yurii had an aura of eternal youth, the kind of guy who smiled broadly even when enraged. Oleksii was a brawler, a rebel on the outside but intensely introverted. Vadym, a terse, self-described “football hooligan,” was their leader.

            Stirred by the massacre in their hometown, they joined the army in the spring of 2022. No one could afford to fold their arms and watch the war happen, said Vadym.

            LIVING CALL TO CALL

            This was the moment Anastasiia chose to propose marriage to Yurii. 

            It was her way of telling him he could count on her to wait for him. They had been together for seven years, a relationship sparked the day that Yurii, the boy she had met as a child and known only as her brother’s friend, reappeared in her life with an innocuous greeting on social media.

            “I realized that he was the only person with whom I could imagine my future,” she says. 

            It was a no-frills ceremony. Papers were signed, rings exchanged. But future plans were elaborate. “First, we had to win this war,"" Anastasiia says, twirling her wedding band around her finger. “Probably the first thing we would do after is go on a honeymoon.”

            Yurii arrived in the eastern city of Kramatorsk in July, heading toward the salt-mining town of Bakhmut, which would turn out to be the focus of the war's longest battle. Says Anastasiia: “I lived from call to call."" 

            Through him, she bore witness to the hellscape that was the war. 

            
                Russia had shifted tactics, withdrawing troops from the north after fierce Ukrainian resistance and concentrating on what Moscow described as the “liberation” of the contested Donbas region. 

            His correspondence with Anastasiia over six months revealed his unit was constantly on the move. The shelling and artillery battles were relentless, he told her. After one night of extensive bombardment, he texted, “I will definitely return,” with an emoji blowing a heart-shaped kiss. 

            In August, he complained that the enemy had more advanced weapons while they had to make do with automatic guns. Helpless, they spent hours hiding in the trenches. 

            The night before Ukraine’s Independence Day on Aug. 25, Yurii said he expected the Russians would mark the occasion with missiles. He made her promise to sleep in the corridor, away from windows. 

            He returned to the front later. When the shelling ceased for a moment, Yurii made a dash for the car, thinking he had just enough time as the enemy reloaded weapons. 

            Then the shooting started again. 

            It was Vadym, not Yurii, who called Anastasiia that morning. He had bad news from the Military Commissariat. 

            “Tell me it’s not true,” reads the last text message she sent her husband. “I’m begging you, tell me you’re alive.” 

            A DECLARATION OF LOVE

            September was a turning point. 

            Ukraine launched surprise counter-offensives in the northern and southern regions, denting the image of Russia’s military might. Kyiv was encouraged to seek more arms from the hesitant West to sustain the fight, and Oleksii finally summoned the courage to tell Anna he loved her for the first time. 

            Theirs was an affair only the two of them understood, one in which moments of affection could quickly devolve into thunderous arguments. 

            Oleksii was Anna’s first kiss at 15, but there was no relationship to speak of until Yurii’s death. That changed him. Oleksii revealed he had loved her his entire life but had stayed away because she had been with one of his friends. Now he didn’t care anymore. 

            “Yurii’s death pushed us to accept the fact that you can do anything in this life while you are still alive,” Anna says. 

            After Yurii's funeral, Anna planned to spend the night with Anastasiia to comfort her grieving friend. Oleksii, who had taken leave to attend the burial, walked her to the door and kissed her. 

            After, he called her almost every day. 

            In mid-September, he seemed especially tired on a video call while stationed in Zaporizhzhia. He asked Anna to help him find out how long soldiers were permitted to take leave. He sent her a link, an information page for officers looking to get time off to get married. 

            “Zavadskyi, do you want to go on vacation or get married?” she asked him, teasing. 

            “Let’s combine the practical with the pleasant,” he responded. That was Oleksii’s style. They were engaged. 

            Before autumn turned to winter, Ukraine liberated the northern city of Kharkiv and Kherson in the south. The victories boosted morale, but were won bit by bit with the help of Western weapons that wore down Russian forces and supply lines. 

            In the east, gains were harder to come by. Russian forces, with Wagner mercenaries, unleashed human wave tactics to exhaust Ukrainian defenses. On January 11, Oleksii was deployed to a position near Bakhmut, very close to the same front where Yurii was killed.

            On Jan. 13, he called. It was too cold to sleep, he said, quivering. The combat lines were very close; he was 15 meters away from the enemy. He was scared. 

            In long-range battles it’s not easy to see when you’ve killed someone, he explained. He had sent videos of himself from these positions before, shooting toward the faraway enemy lines, crying out: “For Stiahliuk!” — for Yurii. But here, he could clearly see how the bodies of the men he extinguished fell. 

            Anna told him, sharply. “You have to understand: If you don’t kill, they will kill you.” 

            He died the next day from a bullet to the neck. 

            BROTHERS IN ARMS

            Until their redeployment to the east, they had felt invincible. In Zaporizhizhia, they had captured two prisoners after an ambush operation and pushed the Russians back by at least 10 kilometers. Oleksii was both an infantryman and drove the platoon’s armored vehicle. 

            In Bakhmut, they were tasked with carrying out dangerous maneuvers at the foot of the flank, close to enemy lines.

            “You have to fight every day, every minute,” Vadym says. Russian attacks seemed endless; their soldiers walked passed the corpses of their own comrades in their relentless push toward Ukrainian positions. 

            In the middle of the shootout on Jan. 14, Oleksii suddenly collapsed. As there was no blood, Vadym thought he had suffered a shock. 

            He dragged his friend to cover and looked for a pulse. He could swear he felt one, but the medic at the scene said Oleksii died instantly.

            This time, Vadym could not bring himself to call Anna. As the commander of their platoon, Vadym had felt responsible for protecting his best friend. He promised Oleksii’s father, Sergey, he would bring him back home alive. “I was ashamed,” he says. Yurii had been with a different unit. 

            “There are no golden or miraculous words that can instantly ease their pain,” says Holovyn, the priest of the parishioners who come to him with their tales of suffering. The other day, the teacher of the Sunday school told him her husband had died on the front, but that his body remains in Russian controlled territory. Lying there in the snow. 

            In Bucha, some people are already rebuilding. The smell of sawdust wafts in the air, as workmen repair destroyed roofs and residents embrace the precarity of living without peace. 

            In Oleksii’s grandmother’s home in Bucha, Anna holds her fiance’s shirts close to catch the lingering scent of him. “They say the Earth spins. My Earth has stopped,” she says.

            Time hasn’t made it any easier for Anastasiia, either. “You come out of a stressful state and begin to realize what is actually happening.” Sometimes she catches herself still waiting for a call. 

            Side by side, both women stood together at the funerals of the men they loved. “Only Nastya understood me — like no one else,” Anna says, using a nickname for Anastasiia and clasping her hand. 

            For Vadym, the time to leave has come. “Only fools have no fear at all,” he says, realizing that he is the last of his brothers in arms. “But I will try to survive.”

            The next day, he is gone.

            The fifth round of nationwide protests that began last month came a day before the deadline for lawmakers in the lower house of parliament to wrap up what has been one of the most rancorous debates in recent years. It concerns the flagship policy of President Emmanuel Macron’s second term, which would raise the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64.

            There were fewer disruptions during Thursday's protests than recently, with the Paris Metro and most main line train services working normally and most schools unaffected. However, a railway worker walkout disrupted high-speed TGV trains and regional services. Almost a third of flights were canceled at Paris’ second busiest airport, Orly.











            In addition, classes were canceled at a handful of universities due to student blockades.

            Paris police put the number of people marching in the French capital at an estimated 37,000. The CGT union, one of eight backing the protest, put the number at 300,000.

            The CGT claimed that 1.3 million people marched Thursday, compared to 2.5 million last Saturday. There was no official national estimate.

            “These reforms are robbing people of their rights. I'm here today to show (President) Macron that he cannot be deaf and that there are consequences when you try to defy the majority of the country,” said Pierre-Yves Toudic, a 34-year-old engineer who was protesting at the Bastille Plaza in central Paris.

            The proposed pension reform has unleashed the most turbulent debate in years in the National Assembly, with uncertainty looming over the final outcome.

            Opponents filed thousands of amendments to delay debate, now making it uncertain if the lower house will actually get to the critical Article 7, which sets out the change to the age of retirement, before the Friday midnight deadline. The pension bill — whether or not it has been fully debated — will then automatically go to the Senate for consideration.

            Lawmakers on Thursday afternoon were debating amendments related to the second of 20 articles in the bill. The legislative process is not expected to end for several weeks.

            Despite opinion polls consistently showing growing opposition to the reform and his own popularity shrinking, Macron insists that he’s living up to the key pledge he made when he swept to power in 2017 and before his April 2022 reelection.

            “The current pension system is not equitable, not fair. Some people can receive a pension of more than 10,000 euros ($10,706) per month for example,” said 34-year-old economics professor Clemence Lonchal.

            The powerful hard-left union CGT is keeping its eye on March 7, when unions are threatening to bring France to its knees. CGT head Philippe Martinez said the strategy was to “keep up pressure on lawmakers” to reject the bill. The union this week called on support from trash collectors, which could see trash piling up in the French streets.

            A group of student unions also called for action March 7 by those not yet in the pension system and a “day of action and mobilization” March 9.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812284,"Indian officials end 3-day probe of BBC, alleging tax dodge","NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s tax officials on Thursday left the BBC offices in New Delhi and Mumbai after searching them for three days seeking information about the organization’s business operations amid allegations of tax evasion. Opposition political parties and other media organizations criticized the move as an attempt to intimidate the media.

            Television images showed tax officials leaving in cars after spending nearly 60 hours at the BBC office in New Delhi. They made no statement about the searches that started on Tuesday morning.

            ""The Income Tax Authorities have left our offices in Delhi and Mumbai. We will continue to cooperate with the authorities and hope matters are resolved as soon as possible,"" BBC News tweeted.











            “We are supporting staff —some of whom have faced lengthy questioning or been required to stay overnight— and their welfare is our priority. Our output is back to normal and we remain committed to serving our audiences in India and beyond,” it said.

            ""The BBC is a trusted, independent media organization and we stand by our colleagues and journalists who will continue to report without fear or favor,"" it said.

            Prime Minister Narendra Modi's critics questioned the timing of the searches, which came weeks after the BBC aired a documentary critical of Modi in the U.K.

            Kanchan Gupta, an adviser to India’s Information and Broadcasting Ministry, said there was no connection between the two.

            ""Whether you are a media organization or you are a manufacturer, the purpose of tax laws apply equally to everybody. And if you are found in violation of those tax laws, the appropriate action is taken as the due process of law,” Gupta said in an interview with Mirror Now television news channel.

            The Indian tax department hasn’t so far issued any statement on what prompted the searches of the BBC offices since officials arrived there Tuesday morning.

            The Press Trust of India news agency cited unnamed officials as saying on Thursday that investigators collected financial data from select BBC staffers and made copies of electronic and paper data from the news organization. 

            The survey is being carried out to investigate issues related to international taxation and transfer pricing of BBC subsidiary companies, the agency said.

            India’s News Broadcasters and Digital Association criticized the income tax “surveys” at the BBC offices.

            While the association “maintains that no institution is above the law, it condemns any attempt to muzzle and intimidate the media and interfere with the free functioning of journalists and media organizations,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday.

            The main opposition Congress party leader, Mallikarjun Kharge described the government action as an assault on freedom of the press under Modi’s government.

            Reporters Without Borders, an international media watchdog, denounced the Indian government’s action as ""attempts to clamp down on independent media.""

            “These raids have all the appearance of a reprisal against the BBC for releasing a documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi three weeks ago. They have come at a time when independent media are being hounded more and more, and when pluralism is shrinking in India due to increased media concentration,"" the group said in a statement on Thursday.

            The documentary, “India: The Modi Question,” was broadcast in the U.K. last month, examining the prime minister’s role in the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the western state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister at the time. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence.

            Modi has denied allegations that authorities under his watch allowed and even encouraged the bloodshed, and the Supreme Court said it found no evidence to prosecute him. Last year, the court dismissed a petition filed by a Muslim victim questioning Modi’s exoneration.

            The second portion of the two-part documentary examined “the track record of Narendra Modi’s government following his re-election in 2019,” according to the BBC website.

            The program drew an immediate backlash from India’s government, which invoked emergency powers under its information technology laws to block it from being shown in the country. Local authorities scrambled to stop screenings organized at Indian universities, and social media platforms including Twitter and YouTube complied with government requests to remove links to the documentary.

            The BBC said at the time that the documentary was “rigorously researched” and involved a wide range of voices and opinions.

            “We offered the Indian Government a right to reply to the matters raised in the series — it declined to respond,” its statement said.

            India’s Foreign Ministry called the documentary a “propaganda piece designed to push a particularly discredited narrative” that lacked objectivity.

            Press freedom in India has been on a steady decline in recent years. The country fell eight places, to 150 out of 180 countries, in the 2022 Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. Media watchdog groups accuse the Modi government of silencing criticism on social media under a sweeping internet law that puts digital platforms including Twitter and Facebook under direct government oversight.

            Some media outlets critical of the government have been subjected to tax searches. 

            Authorities searched the offices of the left-leaning website NewsClick and independent media portal Newslaundry on the same day in 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812285,"For Ukrainian circus performers, future still up in the air","BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Nearly a year since fleeing Ukraine for Hungary amid the bombs and terror of Russia's invasion, more than 100 young circus performers still hold intensive daily training sessions in Budapest while waiting to see what an uncertain future holds. 

            The group, whose members are between the ages of 5 and 20, found a home with the Capital Circus of Budapest after leaving their circus schools and lives behind in the cities of Kharkiv and Kyiv in March 2022.

            Trainer Svetlana Momot, who fled Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, with an initial group of 12 of her students last year, watched and reflected Monday as some of the young circus artists swung from suspended rings, dangled from aerial silks and rehearsed acrobatic stunts in one of the Budapest circus' training halls. 











            Momot said that in the past year, the performers had to learn to live, cook, clean and study together in close quarters. But her goal from the beginning was to ensure that, despite being uprooted from their homes, their intensive daily training would not be interrupted.

            “When they’re busy (with training), they don’t have time to think about the bad things. It distracts them,"" Momot said. ""What I see is that we live as one family and as a creative team. ... I think it hasn't affected their training, and I try to keep them in the form they were in Ukraine.”

            After Russia invaded Ukraine, the Budapest circus and a Hungarian school for acrobats extended their solidarity to the Ukrainian performers, offering them accommodation, food and the ability to continue their training, Capital Circus of Budapest director Peter Fekete said. 

            “We have to realize that all people need a purpose in life. Even an 8-year-old child can ask the questions, ‘Why am I alive, what is my purpose in the world?’"" Fekete said. 

            ""If we provide an opportunity to train, and if we set goals that we want to achieve through opportunities to perform, then in their everyday lives they won't be focused only on the difficult situation they are in, but artistic performance can fill their lives to some degree,"" he said.

            Anna Lysytska, a 14-year-old acrobat, said it had been difficult at first to adapt to life in Hungary after fleeing her home in Kharkiv. But staying focused on her training, she said, had helped ease the transition.

            “At first it was hard, but then we got used to it a little and started to go to our training sessions,” she said. “We set up a routine and then started studying at a Hungarian school. We love it here.” 

            Lysytska's twin sister, Mariia, said what she liked most about Hungary at first was that “there were no explosions,” but that she had since formed friendships that made it easier to be far from home. 

            “When we came to this school, we became friends (with the Hungarians) right away and started communicating with them, so I have positive feelings about it,” Mariia said. 

            While some of the performers plan to eventually join family members who have settled in countries like Germany and Slovakia, almost all of them want to return to Ukraine whenever the war ends, Momot said.

            “We were all in the same situation where we had no other option but to leave people behind in Ukraine. Our families are broken,” she said. 

            Still, as Russia tries to ramp up an offensive in eastern Ukraine and to bolster its hold on other parts of the country, it remains unclear when the performers can return safely to their homes. Until then, their futures, and the question of where home is, remain up in the air. 

            The Ukrainian troupe recently returned from a competition in Monte Carlo, Fekete said, where two of the performers brought home gold and silver medals. 

            “When I hugged one of the little girls at the airport and I said we were going home, I corrected myself and said, ‘Well, home to me.' She stopped me and said, ‘It’s home for me, too,'” he said.

            Deputy Navy Commander Hu Zhan-hao (胡展豪) and his wife attend the ceremony at the Lungteh Shipyard. His wife gave a short speech and officially christened it the Hsu Chiang, which had been selected in an online naming contest in April 2022, per the Military News Agency.

            Hu pointed out that construction of the ship began in December 2021 and expressed his sincere gratitude to all the parties involved, including the National Chung Shan Institute for Science and Technology. He said that the ceremony is a demonstration of the Taiwan Navy’s dedication to continuously improving its combat power and safeguarding national security.

            It also proves that the promotion of independent national defense policies can provide a platform for domestic industrial economic growth and innovative technologies, Hu said. This way, the industry can always maintain competitiveness, and at the same time enhance military strength, bolster R&D, and drive industrial development, he added.











            The name Hsu Chiang was taken from the Hsu Chiang River in Keelung City. Once a warship is named, its mission to defend territorial waters and protect national security begins, per Liberty Times.

            The Tuo Chiang-class corvette is armed with Sea Sword air defense missiles, a 76 mm gun, a T-74 machine gun, and a Phalanx close-in weapon system, giving it the ability to hit air and sea targets simultaneously. It has a maximum speed of 40 knots (74 kmh), a displacement of 685 tonnes, and a maximum operational range of 1,800 nautical miles (3,333 km).

The visit focused on Infineon's contribution to enabling the global energy transition with energy-saving semiconductor solutions, as well as by investing in solutions that further reduce the CO2 footprint in its chip manufacturing.       Frank-Walter Steinmeier Federal President of Republic of Germany signs on wafer     Infineon is currently building a new plant for two billion euros that will focus on so-called compound semiconductors. These semiconductors are based on new materials like silicon carbide and gallium nitrite that enable further energy-efficiency increases. Energy-saving semiconductor solutions play a central role in the energy transition. Among other things, these solutions are used in wind turbines, solar power systems, e-vehicles and charging infrastructures. Kulim 3 will be ready for equipment in summer 2024 and will create 900 high value jobs. Infineon confirmed that construction work is on schedule.   During Steinmeier's visit, Ng Kok Tiong, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Infineon Technologies Kulim presented its investment in expanding the exhaust air purification system at the Kulim site. Avoiding CO2 emissions is a clear priority for Infineon in implementing its climate strategy. Modern exhaust-air purification systems offer the greatest leverage in this regard. The upgrade in Kulim is expected to result in an approximately eight percent reduction of global direct site-related emissions (Scope 1) by the end of the 2023 fiscal year, compared to the previous year. A planned new exhaust-air purification system in Austin, USA, will lead to further savings.   The company has also set the goal of operating 100 percent of its plants in Malaysia with green electricity in the future and is in close exchange with local suppliers and the government to this end. The initiative will help further improve Infineon's positive climate contribution. Today, the company's energy-efficient solutions help save 33 times the amount of CO2 emitted during their production.   ""Infineon is fully aligned with the trends of decarbonization and digitalization,"" said C.S. Chua, President and Managing Director of Infineon Asia Pacific. ""The growing demand for renewable energy, e-vehicles as well as energy-efficient applications will lead to a strong increase in the demand for power semiconductors. Our investments in Kulim and beyond are laying the foundation for being able to serve this growing need as well.""  Hashtag: #InfineonTechnologiesAG

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812305,Iraqi soldiers killed in clashes with suspected IS cell,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Three Iraqi troops were killed Thursday when a suspected Islamic State militant detonated an explosive vest, state media reported, as security forces remain on high alert for sectarian attacks.

            The soldiers were carrying out a raid on a suspected IS cell in the Tarmiya district north of the capital after receiving intelligence that the militants were planning to target Shiite Muslims making the annual pilgrimage to the shrine and burial site of Imam Moussa al-Kadhim in northern Baghdad, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported.

            In addition to the suicide bomber, two other members of the cell were killed in clashes with the army, it said. The army was searching the surrounding area for other potential militants.











            Meanwhile, amid chilly temperatures and heavy security, thousands of black-clad pilgrims from across Iraq marched Thursday in the annual procession in marking the death of a Shiite saint. 

            Pilgrims traditionally travel on foot to the shrine and burial site of Imam Moussa al-Kadhim, the seventh of 12 Shiite imams who died in a Baghdad prison in the eighth century. The procession leads to the site in the northern Baghdad neighborhood of Kadimiyah. Participants wear black, with some carrying out self-flagellation to publicly express their mourning. 

            Tents were pitched along the kilometers of road that the pilgrims were walking Thursday, handing out food and water free of charge. Thousands of Iraqi security forces were deployed across the city to ensure the safety of the pilgrims, while some roads and bridges were closed to vehicles to allow pedestrian traffic only.

            Sadiq Jaffar, 27, of Baghdad, told The Associated Press he was taking part in the pilgrimage “because it is important to my identity, despite all the problems that the country is facing such as the increase in the price of food and the rampant corruption.”

            This year’s pilgrimage takes place just ahead of the 20-year anniversary next month of the U.S. invasion of Iraq that led to the downfall of longtime dictator Saddam Hussein. Hussein had banned such pilgrimages from taking place.

            During years of civil war that followed, insurgents repeatedly targeted Shiite pilgrims during their religious ceremonies.

            Iraq emerged from a yearlong political stalemate with the formation of a government in October, but hopes for stabilization of the political and economic situation were shortlived. 

            Measures taken by the United States in recent months to stamp out money laundering and the channeling of dollars to Iran and Syria from Iraq have severely restricted Iraq’s access to hard currency, leading to devaluation of the currency and inflation of prices.BAGHDAD (AP) — Three Iraqi troops were killed Thursday when a suspected Islamic State militant detonated an explosive vest, state media reported, as security forces remain on high alert for sectarian attacks.The soldiers were carrying out a raid on a suspected IS cell in the Tarmiya district north of the capital after receiving intelligence that the militants were planning to target Shiite Muslims making the annual pilgrimage to the shrine and burial site of Imam Moussa al-Kadhim in northern Baghdad, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported.In addition to the suicide bomber, two other members of the cell were killed in clashes with the army, it said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812306,"Key developments in the aftermath of Turkey, Syria quakes","ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — The number of people killed in the Feb. 6 earthquakes that devastated parts of southern Turkey and northern Syria continues to rise. As chances of finding more survivors dwindled, some foreign search teams that rushed in to help have started leaving. 

            Here’s a look at key developments Thursday from the aftermath of the earthquakes:

            UN APPEALS FOR $1 BILLION FOR TURKEY











            The United Nations has launched an appeal for $1 billion in funds to help humanitarian agencies in Turkey assist millions of people affected by the earthquakes.

            A U.N. statement said funding from the appeal would target 5.2 million people, with the resources allowing aid organizations “to swiftly ramp up their operations to support government-led response efforts in areas including food security, protection, education, water and shelter.” 

            Martin Griffiths, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said the people of Turkey were experiencing ""unspeakable heartache.” Griffiths visited devastated regions of the country last week.

            “I met families who shared their stories of shock and devastation. We must stand with them in their darkest hour and ensure they receive the support they need,” the statement quoted Griffiths as saying. 

            The U.N. noted the earthquakes damaged schools, hospitals and other public buildings, separated families and orphaned hundreds of children. 

            In making the appeal, the U.N. also said the country hosts the world’s largest number of refugees, with more than 1.74 million living in 11 provinces hit by the quake. 

            DEATH TOLL RISES IN TURKEY

            Turkey's disaster management agency, AFAD, revised the country's death toll to 36,187. That pushed the combined reported death toll for Turkey and Syria to 39,875.

            More than 108,000 people were injured in Turkey in the 7.8 magnitude quake that struck at 4:17 a.m. local time and a magnitude 7.5 quake the first temblor likely triggered nine hours hours later. 

            A 17-year-old girl was rescued Thursday morning, 248 hours after the original quake, from the debris of a collapsed building in Kahramanmaras, a city located near the epicenter, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency reported.

            The girl, Aleyna Olmez, told reporters from her hospital bed that she was well and tried to pass the time by distracting herself. “I had nothing with me,” she said.

            Hacer Atlas, a rescuer who was involved in reaching Olmez, told Anadolu: “First we held her hand, then we took her out. She is in a very good condition,. She can communicate. I hope we will continue to receive good news about her.”

            INCOMPLETE PICTURE IN SYRIA

            The United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Syria said the country’s death toll is likely to rise further as teams scramble to remove rubble in hard-hit areas.

            In an interview with The Associated Press, Muhannad Hadi defended the U.N.’s response to the disaster, which many in Syria have criticized as slow and inadequate. Hadi said the UN urged “everybody to depoliticize the humanitarian situation and focus on supporting us to reach the people.” 

            The U.N. has reported a death toll of about 6,000 for all of Syria, including 4,400 in the country's rebel-held northwest. That figure is higher than those reported by government authorities in Damascus and civil defense officials in the northwest, who have reported 1,414 and 2,274 deaths respectively. 

            If accurate, it would push the combined deaths in Syria and Turkey to well above 42,000.

            “We’re hoping that this number will not increase by much,” Hadi said. “But from what we are seeing … the devastation of this earthquake is really not giving us a lot of hope that this will be the end of it.”

            The global chief of the Red Cross said after a visit to Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, that the impact on access to housing, water, fuel, and other basic necessities could make another cholera outbreak there “possible.” 

            Aleppo witnessed some of the worst fighting of the country’s ongoing civil war and experienced a cholera outbreak in late 2022. Jagan Chapagain, who is secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said families staying in makeshift shelters without adequate heating urgently need permanent housing. 

            “They are still living in very basic conditions in very, very cold school rooms,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. “If this continues for a long period of time, then there will be health consequences.”

            Chapagain said the disaster also has been ruinous for Syrians’ mental health.

            “If the conflict had broken their backs, I think this earthquake is breaking their spirit now,” he said. 

            SOME SEARCH TEAMS DEPART

            Onlookers at Istanbul Airport clapped to display gratitude to a 27-member team of Greek rescuers who were heading back home after ending their mission to search for survivors in southern Turkey's hard-hit city of Adiyaman.

            Team leader Ioannis Papastathis told the Anadolu Agency late Wednesday that he was leaving Turkey with “unforgettable memories.”

            “On the one hand, there was love and the warm welcome of the people, on the other hand, suffering. The destruction was huge. The weather was cold. These affected me a lot,” the agency quoted him as saying.

            Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said close to 8,000 rescue and aid workers from 74 countries were still assisting Turkish teams in their efforts. Around 4,200 personnel from 15 countries have left, he said.

            “I would like to thank each and every one of them,” Cavusoglu said during a joint news conference with his visiting counterpart from Costa Rica.

            WORST DISASTER ON NATO TERRITORY

            
                NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has described the earthquakes in Turkey as the military alliance's worst natural disaster.

            “This is the deadliest natural disaster on alliance territory since the foundation of NATO,” Stoltenberg told reporters during a joint news conference with Cavusoglu in Ankara on Thursday. “We salute the courage of the Turkish first responders and we mourn with you.”

            Stoltenberg, who is scheduled to visit the disaster area later, said the alliance had deployed thousands of emergency response personnel to support relief efforts.

            “The focus going forward will be on reconstruction and supporting the displaced,” Stoltenberg said. He added that the alliance will be setting up temporary housing for thousands of people displaced by the quake while also using its airlifting capabilities to transport tens of thousands of tents.

            Meanwhile, Stoltenberg, who is pressing Turkey to ratify Sweden and Finland’s memberships in the alliance, stressed that the two Nordic countries were among countries showing solidarity with Turkey. Sweden, Stoltenberg added, would hold an international donor conference in March. 

            Turkey has held up the two countries’ applications to join in NATO, arguing Finland and Swden need to crack down on groups Ankara considers to be national security threats.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812308,Karsdorp in for Roma return after making peace with Mourinho,"MILAN (AP) — Three months after a fallout with José Mourinho that looked to have ended Rick Karsdorp’s career at Roma, the defender is set to return to the team.

            
                Mourinho unleashed a vicious tirade apparently aimed at Karsdorp after Roma’s 1-1 draw at Sassuolo in November, saying he had been “betrayed by a player with an unprofessional attitude.”

            While he did not specifically name Karsdorp, the Netherlands defender has not played for Roma since.











            However, a seemingly inevitable move away from the Italian capital did not materialize in January and the right back appears to have made peace with Mourinho. So much so that the Portuguese coach even came close to apologizing for his harsh words.

            “As for how things are between us, there has been no problem since December,” Mourinho said Wednesday. “The problem arose against Sassuolo because of the player’s attitude on the bench and when he came on, which I didn’t like. Then I went a bit overboard with my choice of words.

            “After that period, the media thought it was over between us but it wasn’t. We’ve always has a good relationship … Lots of people stuck their oar in without knowing the facts — and I’m not referring to you journalists.”

            However, the situation between Roma and Karsdorp deteriorated so badly that players’ union FIFPRO released a statement at the end of last year “strongly condemn(ing)” the club’s treatment of the player.

            But Mourinho and Karsdorp insisted this week that the 28-year-old Dutchman had simply been sidelined by injury problems.

            “I had some problems the last couple of weeks with my knee, every time was swollen,” Karsdorp said. “So I had some pain but now I’m feeling good.

            “This is my sixth year here. I love to play for this club. The thing I want to say, between me and the coach, is that people like FIFPRO and my lawyer they were talking not on my behalf. People said things that were not true. The thing is I just want to play for this club and, as I said before, I am happy to be back.”

            Karsdorp could be set for his first Serie A appearance since that Sassuolo match when Roma hosts relegation-threatened Hellas Verona on Sunday at Stadio Olimpico.

            Roma, which was held to a 1-1 draw at Lecce last weekend, is involved in a tight battle for the Champions League places.

            Mourinho’s team currently occupies fourth place in Serie A and the final qualifying berth for Europe’s elite club competition, but it is above AC Milan on goal difference alone. Head-to-head is the first tiebreaker at the end of the season.

            Roma is also only two points ahead of sixth-place Lazio. But the team is level on points with Atalanta and only three points below second-place Inter Milan.

            Verona has not lost in its past four matches to move within two points of safety.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812320,Ben Yedder in terrific form as Monaco chases PSG,"Wissam Ben Yedder's disappointment over missing the World Cup was so big that his current scoring form for Monaco has taken many by surprise.

            After an uninspired start to the season, the striker peaked at the right time last year and hoped that France coach Didier Deschamps would notice. But despite being a regular with Les Bleus for the past two years, Ben Yedder was not included in the squad for the tournament in Qatar.

            At 32, Ben Yedder's chance to feature on the world's biggest stage was likely gone for good.











            The diminutive forward with excellent finishing skills had repeatedly spoken about his ""dream"" to play at the World Cup, so few imagined that Ben Yedder could bounce back so quickly from the pain of being left out.

            One of those few was Philippe Clément. 

            Soon after Deschamps' list was announced, the Monaco coach said Ben Yedder was obviously upset, but insisted that his player was not “a kid,” and would soon put the disappointment aside.

            He was right. 

            Since the league resumed at the end of December following France's runner-up finish at the World Cup, the former Toulouse and Sevilla forward has scored eight goals, embodying Monaco's resurgence as the club bids for a Champions League berth.

            Since the turn of the year, Monaco has amassed 17 points — the most of any side in 2023 — and Ben Yedder has largely contributed to that superb run of form.

            Last weekend, he moved up to 14 goals for the season — 19 in all competitions — following his brace in a 3-1 win over leader Paris Saint-Germain. The goals helped Monaco extend its unbeaten league run to eight matches. 

            Ahead of Sunday's trip to Brest, Monaco moved into the top three for the first time this season, just two points behind second-place Marseille, with PSG having a five-point lead at the top of the table. PSG hosts Lille on Sunday and Marseille travels to Toulouse.

            Ben Yedder was rewarded this week for his five goals in January with the trophy for best league player of the month. If he keeps that pace up, Ben Yedder will likely be brought back in by Deschamps for upcoming European Championship's qualifiers.

            After taking over from previous coach Niko Kovac, Clément has transformed Monaco into a true contender. The former Club Brugge tactician first brought stability to the Monaco backline, then instilled his team with his attacking spirit.

            “All my players have a winning mentality and don’t just play to stop the opposition,"" Clément said. ""They believe in themselves and their teammates. It is true that we do everything to score while trying to be solid defensively too. You have to find the right balance, and that’s what I’ve seen in recent weeks.”

            With 51 goals in 23 league games — including 22 since after the World Cup break — Monaco boasts the second-best attack this season. In addition, the team has scored at least once in each of its last 33 league games.

            Ben Yedder is not the only one to pile up goals for Monaco. Forward Breel Embolo has 12 league goals under his belt despite having to share opportunities with Ben Yedder.

            “It’s only early February, and Breel has already surpassed his career high in single-season goals,” Clément said. “People often talk to me about combining the two, but I wonder if they would have scored so much if they were always together on the pitch.”

            The two strikers are enjoying sustained support from another very effective duo of creative players in Caio Henrique and Aleksandr Golovin, who have delivered seven and six assists, respectively.

            “Only Paris Saint-Germain are doing better than us and have as many weapons,"" Clément said. “This is where we see the strength of our collective, because beyond the scorers, everyone brings their contributions to the table.”

But despite being a regular with Les Bleus for the past two years, Ben Yedder was not included in the squad for the tournament in Qatar.At 32, Ben Yedder's chance to feature on the world's biggest stage was likely gone for good.The diminutive forward with excellent finishing skills had repeatedly spoken about his ""dream"" to play at the World Cup, so few imagined that Ben Yedder could bounce back so quickly from the pain of being left out.One of those few was Philippe Clément.Soon after Deschamps' list was announced, the Monaco coach said Ben Yedder was obviously upset, but insisted that his player was not “a kid,” and would soon put the disappointment aside.He was right.Since the league resumed at the end of December following France's runner-up finish at the World Cup, the former Toulouse and Sevilla forward has scored eight goals, embodying Monaco's resurgence as the club bids for a Champions League berth.Since the turn of the year, Monaco has amassed 17 points — the most of any side in 2023 — and Ben Yedder has largely contributed to that superb run of form.Last weekend, he moved up to 14 goals for the season — 19 in all competitions — following his brace in a 3-1 win over leader Paris Saint-Germain.

            In a video address to the 169-seat parliament, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Norway for the donation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812323,Study: Don't blame climate change for South American drought,"Climate change isn’t causing the multi-year drought that is devastating parts of Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia, but warming is worsening some of the dry spell’s impacts, a new study says.

            The natural three-year climate condition La Nina – a cooling of the central Pacific that changes weather worldwide temporarily but lasted much longer than normal this time – is the chief culprit in a drought that has devastated central South America and is still going on, according to a flash study released Thursday by international scientists at World Weather Attribution. The study has not been peer reviewed yet. 

            
                Drought has hit the region since 2019 with last year seeing the driest year in Central Argentina since 1960, widespread crop failures and Uruguay declaring an agricultural emergency in October. Water supplies and transportation were hampered, too.











            “There is no climate change signal in the rainfall,” said study co-author Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College in London. “But of course, that doesn’t mean that climate change doesn’t play an important role in the context of these droughts. Because of the extreme increase in heat that we see, the soils do dry faster and the impacts are more severe they would have otherwise been.”

            The heat has increased the evaporation of what little water there is, worsened a natural water shortage and added to crop destruction, scientists said. The same group of scientists found that climate change made the heat wave last December 60 times more likely.

            And cutting down trees in the southern Amazon in 2020 reached the highest rate in a decade and that translates to less moisture being available farther south in Argentina, said study lead author Paola Arias, a climate scientist and professor at the Environmental School of the University of Antioquia in Colombia.

            The team of scientists at World Weather Attribution use observations and climate models to see if they find a climate change factor in how frequent or how strong extreme weather is. They compare what happened to how often it happened in the past, and they run computer simulations that contrast reality to what would have happened in a world without human-caused climate change from burning of fossil fuels. 

            In this drought’s case, the models actually show a slight, not significant, increase in moisture from climate change but a clear connection to La Nina, which scientists say is waning. It will still take months if not longer for the region to get out of the drought — and that depends on whether the flip side of La Nina — El Nino — appears, said study co-author Juan Rivera, a scientist at the Argentine Institute for Snow Research, Glaciology and Environmental Sciences.

            In the past, the team of scientists has found no obvious climate change connection in some droughts and floods, but they do find global warming is a factor in most of the severe weather they investigate.

            “One of the reasons why we do these attribution studies is to show what the realistic impacts of climate change are. And it’s not that climate change makes everything worse,” Otto said. “Not every bad thing that’s happening now is because of climate change.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812324,The primary thing about Taiwan elections,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese love their democracy and avidly follow the drama, infighting, colorful personalities, mudslinging, and strategic political moves, while the media is full of detailed and breathless accounts from a wide range of outlets across the political spectrum.Recently there has been a lot of speculation about how this year’s primaries are going to be held, especially on the Kuomintang (KMT) side. All that press attention is justified, different election methods could make or break candidates in key races, including in the presidential primary.Unlike the systems used in American primaries, Taiwan’s primary methods change frequently, even within the same election for the same type of position. Because voters are not registered here by party, adopting the American system is not an option.For party chairs, the best primary is when there is no need for one. This is often the case when there is a popular incumbent, no one bothers to challenge them.There are also negotiated primaries, where two or more candidates declare their candidacy, but the party negotiates between them to choose one and the others voluntarily step aside. There is, of course, usually some reward for doing so, such as a guaranteed spot on the legislator list, or the backing of the nominee for the one that steps aside in a different race (such as backing for county commissioner now, the other will be backed in a run for legislator).Then there are hand-picked, or forced nominations, where the party chair and the electoral committee simply nominate a candidate, challengers be damned. There are risks with this strategy, as the spurned challengers have ways of taking revenge or exacting a price, such as leaving the party and running as an independent or even as the candidate of another party.Prior to last year’s 9-in-1 elections, for many electoral cycles, it was more common to have opinion poll-based primaries. Polling companies are hired by the party, usually three companies, in order to guard against bias or one of the companies being paid under the table to tamper with the results.Candidates campaign in the run-up to those polls and actively let voters know the dates the polling will be held in hopes they will answer their phone and vote for them if they get a call from a polling firm. Then the results are tallied, and the winner announced.Pure opinion poll primaries are in theory the best way to pick the most popular candidate with the highest chance of winning, in theory. The problem is that often the public knows very little about the candidates when those in the party leadership have a much better idea of how they will actually perform in an election race.In some cases, those opinion poll numbers may be weighted by the party to favor certain types of candidates, such as in the last election, the KMT weighted the polls to strongly benefit younger candidates in city and county council races. This was part of KMT Chair Eric Chu’s (朱立倫) plan to invigorate the party with younger faces and blunt the image of the party as an old folk’s home.Primaries for party positions, such as the chair, are only open to party members. However, this has been used in the past for primaries for candidates for public office as well, though fully party member primaries have not been used in a while.Fully party-member primaries run the risk of being overly influenced by party factions. There is also the chronic risk of vote buying, which is virtually impossible in pure opinion poll primaries.The KMT has been particularly fond of the 70/30 model, which is when the candidates for public office are chosen 70% by public opinion poll and 30% by party members. This is an attempt to get the best of both worlds and provide more value to being a party member.Choosing what form of primary is going to be used in any given race is a highly strategic one. It also gives the party chair a lot of power. Hence all the press interest.In the last election cycle, opinion polling primaries were the standard for city and county council races. There were some angry losing candidates who left their parties, but overall it worked as it should.The primaries for the 22 mayors and county commissioners were where things got interesting, highlighting the strategic thinking in the battle between then-Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chair Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and KMT Chair Eric Chu.Both parties early on went with opinion polling, with the KMT kicking things off in Nantou and the DPP in Pingtung. The KMT Nantou primary went off without a hitch.Not so in Pingtung. It was a bitter and ugly primary. That ugliness may have been a factor in the election, the DPP candidate won by a tiny margin, and the KMT candidate is still suing for a recount.Then, both parties switched to hand-picking candidates, and I suspect that each party did so for different reasons.On the KMT side, Chu most likely wanted to ensure that moderate, female, and electable candidates were chosen. The KMT has a lot of deep blue politicians who like to take positions, especially on China and sovereignty issues, that are deeply unpopular with the broad voting public.I’m pretty certain that Chu wanted his electoral slate to be full of the kind of people who would not constantly be generating headlines for saying things like “China is doing a great job handling the terrorists in Xinjiang” or pushing for CTiTV News to be allowed back on cable television. That kind of talk by even one major candidate would depress the vote for the entire slate.Tsai’s calculation was probably that she wanted to avoid the disunity and bad press that came out of the Pingtung primary playing out nationally. A veteran of the fractious Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) presidency, and remembering well the historical image of the DPP as being the party of chaotic infighting, she most likely opted for this more cautious path to promote an image of stability.For the most part, Chu’s strategy worked out very well. The only deeply unpopular comments coming from his party members were not running in the election, and were generally ignored by voters.He did have to spend a lot of time putting out fires and trying to avert rebellions with his heavy-handed approach. His efforts at quelling widespread rebellion in Taoyuan were epic but ultimately successful.However, while he was desperately trying to hold his strategy in Taoyuan, it blew up in his face in Miaoli, where a disgruntled candidate (and convicted murderer, which is why Chu did not want him) ran as an independent and won the election. Less dramatically, the same occurred in Kinmen.Those two losses were the failures of his strategy, and cost the KMT the ability to gain in the number of races won, but for Chu it was probably well worth it. The party lost two small races, but picked up big prizes, like Taipei, Taoyuan, and Keelung.In Tsai’s case, her strategy was a disaster. Her hand-picked candidate for Taoyuan went down in flames over several scandals, while she was ordering her party to defend him anyway, which went down like a Chinese spy balloon with voters across northern Taiwan.The public was not having it and eventually, she replaced him with another hand-picked candidate, but that provoked another primary hopeful to bolt the party and run as an independent. That partially split the pan-green vote in Taoyuan.All eyes now are on how the primaries are going to be held for the upcoming national elections for president and legislators, on the KMT side especially.In Taipei, several potentially brutal primaries are forming, with a group of younger Taipei city councilors planning legislative runs against older candidates who feel they have earned their chops, and in one case challenging a sitting KMT lawmaker. These rebels against the established way of doing things are calling for generational change (a topic for an upcoming column) and are causing considerable upset in the party.How will Eric Chu handle this? He has consistently called for younger blood in the party to try and revive the party’s fortunes with younger voters, but on the other hand, this will cause considerable anger among party stalwarts.The younger candidates have called for full opinion poll primaries, whereas stalwarts are pushing for the 70/30 formula. If Chu picks one or the other method, it looks like he is picking their side.On the other hand, if he handpicks the candidates, then he is definitely taking sides. Then he takes the risk of candidates bolting the party to run as independents, or even worse, for the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP).In the presidential race, I suspect one of the reasons that New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) has not publicly declared his presidential candidacy is because he wants Eric Chu to declare the primary format first. There is strong opposition in some quarters of the KMT to him running, especially from those who come from 49er families that fled the Chinese Civil War.If it is a full opinion poll primary, that favors Hou, and that indicates that Chu is looking to go with Hou because he wants the best candidate for the party with the highest chance of winning. If Chu goes with 70/30, it indicates that Chu wants to make it harder for Hou, as his support is lower in the party than with the general public.It would also indicate that Chu wants either himself or perhaps Terry Gou (郭台銘) to be the party’s candidate. Traditionally in the KMT, the party chair was automatically the party’s candidate, and in theory, Chu could try to revive that and install himself as the candidate, but it would likely cause outrage in the party.The KMT and DPP will be announcing their primary formats in late March/early April.",2023/02/16,841,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812335,Türkiye earthquake: World Vision provides fuel and heaters in Northwest Syria,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 16 February 2023 - As the death toll from the Turkish and Syrian earthquake keeps rising, millions of people in northwestern Syria are in desperate need. World Vision says the earthquake in Türkiye and Syria has created need greater than any other natural disaster the organisation has responded to in over a decade.   Johan Mooij, World Vision Syria Response Director, said, ""Hospitals and health clinics that survived the earthquake in Syria were already overstretched and underfunded – now they are unable to even keep the power on due to lack of fuel. Families who have been displaced multiple times already due to the Syrian conflict, have been displaced again. The amount of money and effort it will take to rebuild the structural damage could take a generation to get to pre-earthquake levels. This is especially the case in Northwest Syria where the humanitarian response plan has been consistently underfunded for most of the past 12 years. This is a humanitarian emergency that is catastrophic in historic terms, that requires an aid response that is historic in its generosity.""   After the earthquake, World Vision teams responded quickly to assess the most urgent needs on the ground and provided 17,000 litres of fuel to health facilities as well as search and rescue teams in Northwest Syria to enable them to keep running their operations transporting and treating the wounded. World Vision has also provided much needed heaters and fuel to more than 1,605 impacted households seeking refuge in collective shelters scattered across the Northwest. This will allow displaced families to stay warm until more temporary solutions are found.   Meanwhile, World Vision plans to distribute emergency relief items such as food, water, shelter and winterisation items, as well as medical supplies to several health facilities struggling to respond to growing needs.   A recent needs assessment conducted by World Vision in Northwest Syria showed that 94% of surveyed people's homes and shelters had been affected by the earthquake, while 82% were sheltering in collective shelters as a result of these damages. In addition, 42% of respondents reported that education facilities had been damaged in their neighbourhoods, and 84% of them said the earthquake had impacted their children's ability to access education services. So far, World Vision's emergency assistance has reached more than 78,000 women, men and children in Northwest Syria with fuel, heaters, ready to eat meals and health care assistance.   World Vision said that already dire and spiralling humanitarian conditions in Northwest Syria due to conflict - combined with the damage, limited access, loss of life and injuries - have meant the suffering as a result of the earthquake and aftershocks has been uniquely devastating.   Johan Mooij added, ""Entire streets and villages have been reduced to rubble, whole families killed, and millions left homeless. People already living in extreme poverty have lost what little they had. Prior to the quakes, 6 or 7 people were sharing tents due to the scale of displaced from the conflict. Now it's 16 or 17 people in each tent. Children have been traumatised and will need psychosocial and physical support to deal with the impact of this disaster.   ""We have not seen suffering and devastation of this scale in over a decade. The impact is so enormous that World Vision warns that it could take a generation for survivors to recover, and maybe longer in Northern Syria, where millions were already living on humanitarian aid.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812397,Biden takes new steps to address racial inequality in gov't,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Thursday ordered the federal government to do more to address racial inequality as the challenges and complexities of systemic racism are again drawing the public's attention. 

            The order, signed during Black History Month, requires that an initial review into long-standing disparities in government services and treatment that he ordered on his first day in office become an annual requirement for federal agencies. The reviews are aimed at increasing access to federal programs, services and activities for disadvantaged communities. The new order also directs federal agencies to have equity teams and name senior leaders who would be accountable for increasing equity and addressing bias.

            “My Administration has embedded a focus on equity into the fabric of Federal policymaking and service delivery,” Biden wrote in the order, adding that, “By advancing equity, the Federal Government can support and empower all Americans, including the many communities in America that have been underserved, discriminated against, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.”











            Last month, Tyre Nichols, a Black man, died several days after he was severely beaten by five police officers following a traffic stop in Memphis, Tennessee. Nichols was one of several Black men across the United States who died after encounters with police recently. The problem also extends to racial disparities in wealth, housing, crime and education that reflect decades of discriminatory policies. 

            Chiraag Bains, the president's deputy assistant for racial justice and equity, said that the new order shows Biden is “doubling down” on the commitment he made on his first day as president “to put equity at the center of how this government operates.”

            The order institutionalizes Biden's pledge that government be open and accessible to all and “is a recognition that achieving equity is not a one- or a two-year project. It's a generational commitment,"" Bains told The Associated Press. 

            Federal agencies would need to improve the quality and frequency of their engagement with communities that have faced systemic discrimination. And it formalizes Biden's goal of a 50% bump in federal procurement dollars that go to small and disadvantaged businesses by 2025. 

            Under the order, agencies must also focus on new civil rights threats, such as discrimination in automated technology and access for people with disabilities and for those who speak languages other than English. It also includes a push to improve the collection, transparency and analysis of data to help improve equity.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Thursday ordered the federal government to do more to address racial inequality as the challenges and complexities of systemic racism are again drawing the public's attention.The order, signed during Black History Month, requires that an initial review into long-standing disparities in government services and treatment that he ordered on his first day in office become an annual requirement for federal agencies.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812398,"Nigerian leader defends currency swap as pain, protests grow","ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said Thursday that the country's redesigned currency would bolster the upcoming presidential election, appealing for an end to violent protests over a resulting cash shortage that has led to daylong lines at banks, business closures and people unable to pay for basic needs.

            As he came under growing pressure to intervene after days of bank attacks by Nigerians who have failed to withdraw their money, Buhari pointed to the expected gains from swapping out the old naira notes, from curbing surging inflation to reducing the influence of money in the Feb. 25 vote to elect his successor.

            “This is a positive departure from the past and represents a bold legacy step by this administration towards laying a strong foundation for free and fair elections,” Buhari said.











            Nigerians have been unable to access cash in recent weeks after the country’s central bank started switching out currency notes of higher denominations of 1,000 naira ($2.16), 500 naira ($1.08), 200 naira (43 U.S. cents) with redesigned ones.

            Policymakers said the move will help make Africa’s largest economy cashless and more inclusive. But a limited supply of new notes in banks has resulted in pain instead for many who deposited their old currency ahead of a Feb. 10 deadline but are now unable to withdraw cash to use.

            The West African country is heavily reliant on cash and only 45% of adults owned a bank account as of 2021, according to the World Bank. The limited supply has forced people to wait in line at banks all day and night to try to withdraw cash only enough to last them a day. 

            On Wednesday, weeklong protests against the cash shortage crisis further escalated in Nigeria’s southern region where two banks were set ablaze and major roads were blocked, halting commercial activities. In Edo state, police fired tear gas at demonstrators as they attacked bank facilities.

            In addition to the pain of continued fuel scarcity in major cities across Nigeria, many businesses also have been forced to close, further squeezing the informal economy — ranging from agriculture to street trade — that is key to economic growth.

            Buhari urged against “violence capable of disrupting the electoral processes” in the election that would see Africa’s most populous country elect a new president after his second and final term.

            “Unscrupulous officials in the banking industry” sabotaging the court-contested monetary policy by hoarding new currency notes must be prosecuted, said Buhari, who extended the use of the old 200 naira note until April 10. “I am deeply pained and sincerely sympathize with you all over these unintended outcomes.”ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said Thursday that the country's redesigned currency would bolster the upcoming presidential election, appealing for an end to violent protests over a resulting cash shortage that has led to daylong lines at banks, business closures and people unable to pay for basic needs.As he came under growing pressure to intervene after days of bank attacks by Nigerians who have failed to withdraw their money, Buhari pointed to the expected gains from swapping out the old naira notes, from curbing surging inflation to reducing the influence of money in the Feb. 25 vote to elect his successor.“This is a positive departure from the past and represents a bold legacy step by this administration towards laying a strong foundation for free and fair elections,” Buhari said.Nigerians have been unable to access cash in recent weeks after the country’s central bank started switching out currency notes of higher denominations of 1,000 naira ($2.16), 500 naira ($1.08), 200 naira (43 U.S. cents) with redesigned ones.Policymakers said the move will help make Africa’s largest economy cashless and more inclusive. But a limited supply of new notes in banks has resulted in pain instead for many who deposited their old currency ahead of a Feb. 10 deadline but are now unable to withdraw cash to use.The West African country is heavily reliant on cash and only 45% of adults owned a bank account as of 2021, according to the World Bank. The limited supply has forced people to wait in line at banks all day and night to try to withdraw cash only enough to last them a day.On Wednesday, weeklong protests against the cash shortage crisis further escalated in Nigeria’s southern region where two banks were set ablaze and major roads were blocked, halting commercial activities. In Edo state, police fired tear gas at demonstrators as they attacked bank facilities.In addition to the pain of continued fuel scarcity in major cities across Nigeria, many businesses also have been forced to close, further squeezing the informal economy — ranging from agriculture to street trade — that is key to economic growth.Buhari urged against “violence capable of disrupting the electoral processes” in the election that would see Africa’s most populous country elect a new president after his second and final term.“Unscrupulous officials in the banking industry” sabotaging the court-contested monetary policy by hoarding new currency notes must be prosecuted, said Buhari, who extended the use of the old 200 naira note until April 10. “I am deeply pained and sincerely sympathize with you all over these unintended outcomes.”",2023/02/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812399,Zelenskyy asks for support for Ukraine at Berlin film fest,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday asked artists and filmmakers to unequivocally declare their support for his country during a live video address at the opening of the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival.

            Referring to the Berlin Wall which divided the German capital from 1961 to 1989 into the capitalist west and communist east, Zelenskyy said that now Russia, which attacked Ukraine almost one year ago, is building a new — figurative — wall in his country.

            “This is a wall between freedom and slavery,” Zelenskyy said adding that the art world cannot remain indifferent because amid silence the “voice of evil only becomes louder and more convincing.”











            Zelenskyy, a former comedian and actor, features prominently in Sean Penn’s film about the war in Ukraine, “Superpower,” which will have its world premiere at the Berlinale.

            Before the opening ceremony, U.S. actress Anne Hathaway lauded the Ukrainian president as a “hero of our time” and thanked the festival for inviting him via video link, German news agency dpa reported.

            Germany’s minister of culture also stressed the importance of culture in times of war and crisis. “Whoever makes films and whoever shows films in dark times resists bondage,"" Claudia Roth said.

            This year's film festival, which runs until Feb. 26, will see 18 films compete for the Golden and the Silver Bear awards. The winners will be chosen by a jury headed by American actor, screenwriter and director Kristen Stewart.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812400,"Moldova: New pro-Western government sworn in, faces 'crises'","CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldova's new government led by pro-Western economist Dorin Recean was sworn in Thursday after winning Parliament's approval, as the small former Soviet republic signaled a shift to security concerns amid Russia’s war in neighboring Ukraine.

            Recean, a 48-year-old economist who served for a year as President Maia Sandu’s defense and security adviser, was tapped by her last week as prime minister-designate after Natalia Gavrilita suddenly quit the position.

            All lawmakers present from Moldova’s ruling Party of Action and Solidarity, which holds 63 seats in the country’s 101-seat legislature, voted in favor of Recean’s government. One was absent. The Moscow-friendly parties, the Communists and Socialists, which hold 31 seats, abstained from voting, and the 6 Shor Party lawmakers boycotted the vote.











            Sandu told the new government as she swore it in later Thursday that it has to lead Moldova through “a very difficult period, marked by multiple crises,” and highlighted European Union membership as the only way the country can “preserve and strengthen” its democracy.

            “The task of the new government is to provide security to the citizens and put the Republic of Moldova on a path of reconstruction and development, despite the crises,” she said. “We need decisive steps to strengthen the security of the country. The war in Ukraine continues, and this war carries risks for us.”

            Moldova’s cabinet will remain largely unchanged under Recean, with the foreign affairs, interior, and defense ministers retaining their posts. He told lawmakers Thursday that his main focus will be to introduce “discipline and order” in Moldova’s institutions, breathe new life into the struggling economy and ensure peace and stability.

            As well as focusing on European integration, Recean said, Moldova’s security sector “must be strengthened, and the activity of those who want to bring war here must be drastically countered.”

            “Moldova has vulnerabilities in the context of the war in Ukraine,” said Recean, who also served as interior minister between 2012 and 2015, “and these vulnerabilities must be treated with the utmost care.”

            On Monday, Sandu held a news briefing in which she outlined an alleged plot by Moscow to overthrow her country’s government using what she described as external saboteurs, to put the nation “at the disposal of Russia,” and to derail its aspirations to one day join the EU.

            Sandu said that the purported Russian plot envisioned attacks on government buildings, hostage-takings and other violent actions by groups of saboteurs. Russia strongly denied those claims a day later as “absolutely unfounded and unsubstantiated.""

            “Threats to our country remain high. Destabilization attempts are a reality and for our institutions, they represent a real challenge,"" Sandu said Thursday.

            Since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, non-NATO member Moldova has faced a string of problems. These include a severe energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supplies; skyrocketing inflation; several missiles that have traversed its skies from Russia’s war next door, and a huge inflow of refugees fleeing the war.

            On Thursday, Moldovan authorities said that missile debris “from Russia’s air strikes against Ukraine” has been found by border officials in a rural area near the northern border with Ukraine, but did not say when the missile was fired. It is the fourth such incident recorded in Moldova in recent months.

            Tensions also soared in Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, after a series of explosions occurred last April in Transnistria — a Russia-backed separatist region of Moldova where Russia bases about 1,500 troops.

            Costin Ciobanu, a political scientist at the Royal Holloway University of London, said that Moldova's change of government shows “security concerns are high on the list” of the authorities and that Sandu going public with her Russian plot claims lends “credence to the idea that Moldova has to focus on its security.”

            “The main narrative behind the change of government was that the state has to focus more on the security dimension than on economic development and a cost-of-living crisis,” he told The Associated Press. “Because many people were doubtful about the rationale behind the change.”

            In the wake of the war, Moldova has looked to foster closer ties with its Western partners. Last June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine. But full membership will be contingent on a series of reforms such as tackling corruption and strengthening the rule of law.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812433,"NATO pledges Turkey quake aid; appeals for Finland, Sweden","NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Turkey on Thursday that the military alliance would be sending ""tens of thousands of tents"" to the country as authorities race to offer shelter to people left homeless following last week's major earthquake.""In your time of need, NATO stands with Turkey,"" Stoltenberg said in talks with Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.""This is the deadliest natural disaster on alliance territory since NATO was founded,"" he said, adding that NATO would use its ""strategic airlift capabilities"" to transport aid more swiftly.In Turkey alone, more than 50,000 buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged across 11 provinces by the quake.Stoltenberg will also visit areas affected by the quake during his trip.But Stoltenberg also repeated his appeal to Turkey to approve of Finland and Sweden's bids to join NATO. The two Nordic countries, neutral throughout the Cold War, sought membership in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""I continue to believe that the time is now to ratify both Finland and Sweden,"" Stoltenberg said.All existing NATO members' legislatures must ratify the entry of any potential new member.So far, only Turkey and Hungary, arguably the two NATO members still seeking to maintain more cordial ties with Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine, have not done so. Hungary has parliamentary votes on the matter scheduled for March.Turkey resisted Finland and Sweden's bids from the outset, accusing both countries of harboring people it considers terrorists, usually either Kurds or supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric and former ally living in the US whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan now blames for orchestrating a 2016 failed coup attempt.But Turkey's objection to Sweden's bid, in particular, has become more strident in recent weeks. This follows a pair of public protests in Sweden — the first by Kurdish activists and the second by far-right activists — involving the burning of an effigy of Erdogan and then of copies of the Quran.NATO countries have been lobbying Ankara to reconsider its position. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, for instance, made similar appeals this week on a visit to Finland and then Sweden.Since finding renewed reason to oppose Sweden's bid, Turkey has suggested it might be more willing to approve Finland's accession separately first, and its foreign minister repeated this idea on Thursday.""We could evaluate Finland's NATO membership process separately from Sweden,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a joint press conference with Stoltenberg. ""Turkey's position on the two countries has been clear and unambiguous from the beginning.""Stoltenberg sought both to stress that in his opinion both bids were ripe for approval, and to hint that handling the two countries separately could prove an option.""Both can be ratified now,"" Stoltenberg said. ""But the main issue is not that they are ratified together. The main issue is that they are ratified as soon as possible.""Stoltenberg will hold talks with President Erdogan later on Thursday in Ankara.msh/fb (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812434,How football helps build bridges in Kosovo,"On a cold and foggy day in Brezovica, a mountain village not far from Prizren in southern Kosovo, a group of girls file into the local sports hall to get ready for football practice. This is a rare sight, as football is still regarded by many in Kosovo as strictly a man's game.But what is really extraordinary is that these girls are from both Serb and ethnic Albanian families.Aurora Cakolli, 14, is among the members of KFV Prishtina, who have made the 80 kilometer-journey (50 miles) from the capital to Brezovica. They've come here to train, before playing a match against FC Brezovica in the neighboring village of Strpce. Brezovica and Strpce are two of the few large Serbian communities in southern Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are in the majority. Serbian is the language of instruction in the schools here, while Aurora is taught in Albanian back in Pristina.However, there is no language barrier for these football players, as they communicate in English. The two groups share both a passion for football and an interest in learning about each other. After all, the opportunities for girls to play football in Kosovo are few and far between.""It's difficult to be a female football player in Kosovo,"" Aurora confirms. ""I played for a boys' team until I found out about KFV Prishtina.""In Kosovo, there is no organized football for girls under the age of 17, which is part of the reason the United Nations (UN) launched this project, which aims to give younger girls more opportunities to play while at the same time breaking down ethnic barriers.""This project is the only opportunity there is for girls under 17 to play football,"" says Armenda Filipaj, the founder of KFV Prishtina.""Empowerment through football is very important in our country, especially as girls from all ethnic groups take part through these teams.""Under the UN project, five clubs have been established so far, two Albanian, two Serbian and one Goran. The Gorans are a Slavic-Islamic minority from southwestern Kosovo. The project's $24,000-budget (€22,375) has gone to pay for jerseys and cover the costs of hiring coaches, referees and transportation.Given the fact that there are few decent artificial turf pitches in Kosovo, the girls often have to travel long distances for the game they love. However, Armenda Filipaj always manages to find somewhere for her girls to train and play.""I love football and I'm happy to have such good training and playing opportunities,"" says 14-year-old Jana Simanovic, one of the FC Brezovica players, before the match against KFV Prishtina. The Serb team is clad in yellow, while their ethnic Albanian opponents wear blue. The jerseys of both teams bear the logo of the United Nations.They are among the more than 170 girls playing football as part of the project. Given their differing ethnic backgrounds, the games between these teams have something of an international flair. There's no mistaking the fact that both teams are out there to win, as evidenced by the animated gesturing of the two coaches on the sidelines. But before kickoff, the high-fives between the players are an indication that such games are also about breaking down barriers. Even an odd personal friendship has blossomed.""Today's training and friendly match with Pristina is something special, because we are aware of where we live and the way things are right now,"" says FC Brezovica coach Zvonko Staletovic. ""For us, it's all about football, nothing else.""To understand just how deep the divisions generally are between the ethnic groups, it helps to bear in mind how football is organized here. In the rest of country, no Serb can be a member of a Kosovar team or the sports federation. Kosovar sports are organized exclusively by Kosovo Albanians.""There were initiatives to bring in players from the Serb minority,"" Taulant Hodaj, secretary general of the Kosovo Football Federation (KFF), tells DW.""There were Serbs who wanted to play for Kosovo, but unfortunately there was political pressure from Serbia that prevented male and female players from participating in competitions organized by the Kosovo Football Federation.""The KFF became a member of FIFA and UEFA in May 2016, despite Belgrade's best efforts to keep it out. Serbia's objections were ultimately rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. However, Serbia, which sees Kosovo as a breakaway province, has been able to keep the country out of political associations such as the UN, due to the veto power of its close ally, Russia.While the international football federations did welcome Kosovo into their ranks, they were anything but blind to the potential problems that lingering ethnic resentment could bring. Therefore, FIFA and UEFA have adopted rules designed to prevent Kosovo from being drawn against Serbia or Bosnia-Herzegovina in international competitions such as the Euros, World Cup qualifiers or the UEFA Nations League.The girls in Strpce are far removed from such divisions. What counts for them is the opportunity to pursue their passion for football, and getting to know each other. As a result, many have learned that they have much more in common than just their love for the beautiful game.""It would be nice to play football together every day and then enjoy the rest of the day together,"" says Jana Simanovic, a Kosovo Serb who dreams of one day playing in international tournaments.She hopes that her example and those of the other girls will set a precedent. More opportunities for young Serbs and Kosovo Albanians to play football together can only help reduce political tensions in this still bitterly-divided nation.This article was adapted from German.",2023/02/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812435,South Korea brands North Korea an enemy state,"A biennial study by South Korean experts on Thursday reported an increase in Pyongyang's stockpile of weapons-grade uranium and its increasing arsenal of missiles.During a period of detente in the 2000s, South Korea ceased using such enemy terminologies, but brought them back after 50 South Korean navy sailors were killed in a 2010 torpedo attack that Seoul blamed on North Korea.For the first time since 2016, the defense paper described the North Korean regime as ""our enemy,"" citing the isolated country's military and cyber provocations.The report said that North Korea has continued reprocessing spent fuel from its reactor and now has some 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium. That figure is up from 50 kilograms in a previous report for 2022, it said.The document said Pyongyang's nuclear programs and tests were ""seriously threatening our security.""""As North Korea continues to pose military threats without giving up nuclear weapons, its regime and military, which are the main agents of the execution, are our enemies,"" the document said.The paper said the North had violated a 2018 inter-Korean military pact that bans hostilities on 15 occasions in the last year alone.These included the firing of artillery inside a military buffer zone and the launching of missiles launched across the de-facto maritime border into the South in November.In a description that remains unchanged since 2018, the report said Pyongyang had secured ""substantial"" amounts of highly enriched uranium"" and a ""significant level of capability"" to miniaturize atomic bombs.Crucially, the document noted that the North had itself defined the South as an ""undoubted enemy"" in December 2022. ""Therefore, the North Korean regime and the North Korean military, which are the main agents of the activities, are our enemy,"" it said.North and South Korea have remained technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty. A rare spell of diplomacy in 2019 came to an end, and talks have stalled with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un renewing an emphasis on military development.Kim last year declared his country an ""irreversible"" nuclear state. The North has carried out sanctions-breaching weapons tests nearly every month since, including the test launch of its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile.Seoul's new conservative administration has responded by seeking a stronger US security commitment, ramping up joint drills, and boosting its own military capabilities.rc/fb (AP, AFP)",2023/02/16,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812439,Turkey earthquake: 'People were killed under state supervision',"In southeastern Turkey, despair is turning into righteous indignation. On February 6, an area roughly the size of mainland Portugal was struck by two powerful earthquakes. The first, at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT), measured 7.8 on the Richter scale; the second, just nine hours later, measured 7.6.The earthquake, which also hit northern Syria, claimed more than 35,000 lives in Turkey and 6,000 in Syria. Those numbers have been rising by the hour.According to Turkish authorities, nearly 13 million people in 10 cities have been affected, and at least 33,143 buildings have either collapsed, been severely damaged or require immediate demolition. The number is likely to rise as officials continue to assess the damage.An estimated 1 million people are currently without shelter. Most of them are living in tents or student dormitories.Now, as the public's initial shock wears off and the dust settles, the sheer scale of the devastation is becoming even more apparent. And with that also comes the question of who is to blame.""Destiny's plan includes such things,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told an earthquake victim during his brief visit to the region, 56 hours after the disaster.In response, many locals asked on social media, ""Why doesn't destiny ever visit Japan?""Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay pointed the finger at 134 builders from the region who have been arrested across the country on suspicion of shoddy or negligent construction. Some were arrested at airports as they attempted to flee the country with large sums of cash.The Ministry of Justice sent a letter to prosecutors to establish ""Earthquake Crime Investigation Offices.""But the recent history of earthquake investigations in Turkey raises the question of whether senior officials, who were allegedly negligent in the inspection and approval processes, will actually be punished. That has not been the case in the past.This is not the first time Turkey has woken to such a disaster.On August 17, 1999, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck just 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Istanbul, killing more than 18,000 people. That disaster left scars on the nation, and in 2001, new legislation was enacted for the inspection and construction of earthquake-resistant buildings. These regulations were updated in 2018 to adapt to more recent technical and scientific standards.""We thought that, in good faith, the buildings built after 2001 were less risky throughout the country. But the data we received from the region has changed our perspective,"" said Haluk Sucuoglu, a professor of engineering at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara and director of the Structural and Earthquake Engineering Laboratory there. He added that there are plenty of plans, laws and regulations but no action.""It's like having a great judicial system, but no law enforcement to catch criminals,"" he said.According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, 51% of the citizens of 10 provinces affected by the earthquake lived in buildings built after 2001.Sucuoglu says that even the officials responsible for enforcing the laws have admitted to him many times that construction companies, especially in smaller cities, have political influence and use it to avoid being supervised. The companies are more focused on maximizing their profits than on building safety, he says.According to regulations introduced in 2001, buildings have to be inspected by expert auditing firms. But until recently, auditing firms were selected and paid for by the contractors themselves. This, of course, creates a conflict of interest.""We know that construction companies even opened the auditing firms and inspected their own construction standards,"" Sucuoglu said.But the auditing firms are not the only ones responsible for approving construction. The municipality also issues a license for the building. If the municipality does not, then the central administration in Ankara can.Lawyer Murat Kemal Gunduz says that the Ministry of Environment can issue licenses for large projects and mass housing. Gunduz also emphasizes that, according to the law, the ministry's main responsibility is to monitor all licenses issued.The phrase ""Imar Barisi"" or ""construction amnesty"" is a term that is often heard before elections in Turkey. It refers to any regulation that legalizes previously illegal constructions. It grants amnesty — in exchange for a fee — to buildings that don't have permits or comply with building codes. Experts say governments use it as a way to win votes before elections.""Construction amnesty means unsafe structures,"" says Eyup Muhcu, president of the Chamber of Architects of Turkey. The Chamber's own building was the only one left standing in its part of the city of Kahramanmaras.According to the latest related regulations, initiated on June 8, 2018, and signed by Erdogan, buildings that violate zoning laws will be legalized ""in accordance with the home owner's declaration,"" allowing the state to withdraw from any responsibility.Muhcu believes that it is the duty of the state to ensure the safety of citizens' lives and property and that such regulations contradict that duty. He says the regulation should be considered null and void because it acts against the Turkish state's basic responsibilities.""The reason there is illegal construction in this country is because of those who issue these amnesties, namely the government,"" says Muhcu.  ""Some people are making money from these illegal constructions; some resources are being transferred somewhere. In fact, these people were killed under the supervision of the state itself.""At a 2019 rally in Kahramanmaras, Erdogan boasted that thanks to the construction amnesty rules, his government had solved problems that around 144,000 locals faced.A total of 7,085,969 building registration certificates were issued across Turkey, of which 5,848,927 were for residential units, according to Environment Minister Murat Kurum. In a statement last year, he said: ""The target has been reached in the construction amnesty: 25.592 billion Turkish lira have entered the state coffers.""That equalled $4.1 billion or €3.8 billion at the time. Enough to build earthquake-resistant apartments for 600,000 people, according to Dr. Bugra Gokce, a city planner working for the municipality of Istanbul.In the 10 provinces hit by the recent earthquake, 294,165 buildings had been issued legalization certificates. Experts believe thousands died in these buildings. Instead of being fortified or demolished, they were subject to amnesty under the new regulations.Amnesty laws have created an understanding in society that ""building violations are tolerated."" This has led to an increase in unauthorized construction and the legitimization of illegal building. It is considered to be one of the most significant sectors for corruption in society.Erdogan's ruling alliance had previously asked the Turkish parliament to discuss a new ""construction amnesty"" law. But that discussion has now been postponed due to the Kahramanmaras earthquake, and there is even discussion about whether or not the elections, slated to be held this May, can be held.The construction sector has been a significant part of the Turkey's economic growth during Erdogan's rule. It is a labor-intensive sector that creates many jobs, especially for low-skilled workers. It is also a driving force behind the growth of other sectors, and the government has implemented policies to support the construction sector by offering favorable financing.In 2002, when Erdogan's AKP party came to power after the traumatic 1999 earthquake, building cooperatives built one out of every three apartments in Turkey. The share of cooperatives fell to 9% in 2010 and to just 1% in 2021, leaving the housing sector almost completely in the hands of a loosely regulated market.Haluk Sucuoglu from the Middle East Technical University  says that over the past two decades, the government has chosen to invest more in visible structures such as roads and bridges because these earn political credit in the eyes of voters.""Reducing the risk of earthquakes does not give you any added [political] value,"" he told DW. ""The resources you put into it just create a labor force for a while. But it is not like opening an industrial plant or a transportation facility.""""But when an earthquake happens, you lose a lot,"" he concluded. ""These decisions should be made correctly, in the light of information and science.""Erdogan's Directorate of Communication has said Turkey is facing the ""disaster of the century.""But many experts in the country believe that this was a preventable catastrophe and that what the country is in fact facing is the ""negligence of the century.""Pelin Ünker and Gülsen Solaker contributed to this report.Edited by: Cathrin Schaer",2023/02/16,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812441,Poland-Turkey relations: Cordial and growing ever closer,"Finland and Sweden have been waiting for months to join NATO. In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the two Scandinavian countries applied to join the military alliance in May 2022. Out of NATO's 30 members, only Hungary and Turkey blocked their membership bids.Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban recently declared that he would no longer obstruct the northern expansion of the alliance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has suggested that Ankara could approve Finland's application for membership but attached conditions to his approval of Sweden's bid.Erdogan is demanding that Sweden take a harder line on the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulen movement and extradite to Turkey activists from both organizations who have been granted asylum in Sweden.Now Poland's PM Mateusz Morawiecki hopes to be able to end the stalemate. During a visit to Stockholm on Monday, he promised to use the excellent relations between Poland and Turkey to convince the Turkish president to approve Sweden's accession to NATO.It is true that despite geographic distance and cultural differences, relations between the two countries have been cordial for several hundred years.""Sentimentality, which has grown up over the course of several centuries, plays an important role in relations between Poland and Turkey,"" said Bruno Surdel, Turkey expert at the Polish Centre for International Relations (CIR). ""And then there is Poland's political realism in recognizing Turkey as a superregional geopolitical power.""This is illustrated by the numerous meetings between Poland's President Andrzej Duda and Erdogan in recent years.""Because of their longstanding bilateral contacts, the relationship between the two presidents is marked by mutual respect,"" said Aleksandra Spancerska of the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM).But it certainly wasn't always this way: Poland and Turkey have in the past been bitter enemies. In the 17th century, both states — then the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire — shared a common border along the Dniester River (now in Ukraine) and waged several bloody wars against each other.In 1683, Polish King John III Sobieski played a key role in the defeat of Kara Mustafa Pasha, grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire, stopping the Ottoman advance into Central Europe outside Vienna.But these old conflicts are a thing of the past. For 300 years, Poland and Turkey (the Ottoman Empire until the end of World War I) have been seen as allies. ""Russia, the common foe, brought the two nations together and cemented the friendship,"" explains Bruno Surdel.When Poland was divided up at the end of the 18th century between Russia, Prussia, and Austria — disappearing entirely from the world map for 123 years — the Ottoman Empire refused to recognize the partition.After several failed insurrections against the partitioning powers, Turkey became a safe haven for many Polish migrants. In 1842, Polish settlers established a Polish village, Polonezkoy (Adampol in Polish), near Istanbul.In the middle of the 19th century, Poland's national poet Adam Mickiewicz worked to set up a Polish military unit in the Ottoman Empire to fight Russia in the Crimean War. He died in Constantinople (Istanbul) in November 1855 while preparations were still ongoing.The alliance between the two countries remained strong into the 20th century. Poland was the first European country to recognize the Turkish Republic declared by Ataturk in 1923.During World War II, when Poland was occupied first by Nazi Germany and later by Soviet Russia, the Polish Embassy in Ankara remained operational.During the Cold War, Communist Poland and Turkey belonged to two enemy alliances — the Warsaw Pact and NATO respectively. With the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, however, relations between the two countries were restored in the early 1990s.Poland's accession to NATO further strengthened the close relationship. Warsaw backed Turkey's attempt to join the EU and was restrained in its criticism of Ankara for the persecution of opposition figures after the failed coup of 2016.Most recently, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has given Turkey a more significant role at international level. At a time when there were hardly any countries with which both Moscow and Kyiv were willing to talk, Turkey offered to act as a mediator. The historic agreement between Ukraine and Russia that allowed for the resumption of grain exports was concluded thanks to Turkey's mediation.""Poland recognizes the geopolitical significance of Turkey, its function as a bridge between the Middle East and Europe, between Russia and Europe, and its military strength,"" said Bruno Surdel. ""Poland does not have such strong relations with any other important country outside Europe.""The devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria on February 6 triggered a wave of help and support in Poland. On the very same day, 76 Polish firefighters and eight rescue dogs flew to the region from Warsaw. A group of emergency doctors followed soon after. The Polish rescue teams were deployed in Adiayaman and Besni and were able to rescue 13 people in one week. They also set up a Polish field hospital where over 100 people were treated.This article was originally published in German.",2023/02/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812442,"Airbus sees profit boost, but defense and space challenges","PARIS (AP) — Airbus is urging stepped-up European cooperation to ensure the continent’s security and future access to space after a year that saw the company suffer fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine and the crash of a European satellite launcher.

            The France-based plane maker on Thursday reported a record overall 2022 profit of 4.25 billion euros ($4.55 billion), up from 4.21 billion euros the year before, despite inflation challenges and supply chain disruptions that slowed efforts to ramp up aircraft production.

            CEO Guillaume Faury said the company aims to deliver 720 planes this year, up from 661 last year, in an effort to keep up with growing demand by airlines as travel picks up worldwide following COVID-19 disruptions.











            On Tuesday, Air India unveiled an massive order that included 250 Airbus passenger jets. Airbus didn't disclose financial terms of the deal, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars.

            Airbus took in 820 orders in 2022 and reported revenue of 58.8 billion euros ($63 billion). U.S. rival Boeing has lagged behind Airbus in deliveries but has been closing the gap, reporting 774 orders and 480 deliveries last year. 

            Both companies are struggling with shortages of engines and other supply chain issues that limit how fast they can build and deliver planes. 

            Those supply issues have overshadowed what is otherwise a rebounding market for aircraft, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. 

            Demand has been supported by the travel recovery from the worst of the pandemic, a spike in fuel prices that put a premium on newer, more efficient aircraft, and the need for smaller, single-aisle aircraft flying point to point such as the Airbus A-321. 

            “It's nothing to do with markets and everything to do with supply,"" Aboulafia said. ""The market's fine — it's just a question of what supply can bear.”

            The Airbus Defence and Space business struggled last year, notably taking a 477 million euro ($511 million) loss on the long-troubled A400M military transport plane, in part linked to unusually high inflation.

            Faury said the European space sector also was hit by the loss of access to Russia's Soyuz rocket launchers and the failure of a new Vega-C rocket soon after takeoff from French Guiana in December. The Vega-C is made by Arianespace, part owned by Airbus.

            “Europe’s independent access to space is now fundamentally challenged,"" Faury told reporters in Toulouse.

            The last year “has proven the need for a stronger Europe in defense and space ... to maintain the peace, stability and security which our societies have become used to,"" Faury said. 

            While pledging that Airbus is on track to meet promises to reduce the industry's heavy carbon emissions, he added: “There is no sustainability without security.”

            He noted that Airbus planes operated by Russian airlines no longer have access to parts or maintenance provided by the company because of Western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

            “We start to hear about situations where they are missing parts or components or an inability to keep some of the planes in flight,"" Faury said. “But we are not speaking with the Russian airlines. We miss visibility. And yes, we are we are slightly concerned about the way the planes are operated, but we have no real means to act.""

            Airbus is still buying titanium from Russia but looking for other suppliers, Faury said, adding that “it will still take some time to be fully independent from the Russian sources.”

            Shares in Airbus, which employs 134,000 people worldwide, were trading up 3% on Thursday morning after the annual results.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812443,NATO chief urges Turkey to let Nordic pair join quickly,"ANKARA (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday urged Turkey to ratify the applications of Finland and Sweden to join the military organization, repeating his claim that the Nordic neighbors have done enough to satisfy Ankara’s demands that they crack down on extremism.

            At a news conference in Ankara standing alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Stoltenberg also condemned the burning of the Muslim holy book, the Quran, at a protest in Sweden but he said that this is not illegal in Europe.

            Alarmed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago, Finland and neighboring Sweden abandoned decades of nonalignment and applied to join the alliance. All 30 NATO members approved their applications, and 28 have ratified their accession. Only Turkey and Hungary have failed to do so.











            Stoltenberg and most allies have long said that both the Nordic neighbors should join at the same time, but in recent days NATO’s top civilian official has soften his stance amid Turkey's reluctance to ratify Sweden's accession. 

            “My position is that both can be ratified now. But the main issue is not whether they are ratified together, the main issue is that Finland and Sweden are ratified as soon as possible,” he told reporters in Ankara.

            Turkey accuses the government in Stockholm of being too soft on groups it deems to be terror organizations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups. Earlier this month, Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland joining.

            “It would not be a realistic approach to say that Sweden has fully fulfilled its obligations,” Cavusoglu said Thursday. “At the moment, we have not yet seen the concrete steps we want.”

            With cracking down on extremism a likely vote-winner in elections scheduled in Turkey for May — although the polls might be delayed due to the devastating earthquake that rocked Turkey and Syria last week, killing almost 40,000 people — the rhetoric from Ankara has become increasingly heated.

            In recent weeks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed anger at a series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm. In one case a solitary anti-Islam activist burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, while in an unconnected protest an effigy of Erdogan was hanged.

            “I understand and I share the pain because I personally regard the burning of the holy book as a disgraceful act,” Stoltenberg said, but he also praised Sweden for being “able to prevent other (protests) with the burning of the Quran.”

            “Not all acts which are disgraceful or immoral or provocative are illegal, but it is important to have a strong position and that is what we have seen daily from the Swedish government,” the former Norwegian prime minister said.

            Hungary has not publicly raised any substantial objections to either country joining NATO, but it has chosen to push back its ratification date for their applications three times.ANKARA (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday urged Turkey to ratify the applications of Finland and Sweden to join the military organization, repeating his claim that the Nordic neighbors have done enough to satisfy Ankara’s demands that they crack down on extremism.At a news conference in Ankara standing alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Stoltenberg also condemned the burning of the Muslim holy book, the Quran, at a protest in Sweden but he said that this is not illegal in Europe.Alarmed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago, Finland and neighboring Sweden abandoned decades of nonalignment and applied to join the alliance. All 30 NATO members approved their applications, and 28 have ratified their accession. Only Turkey and Hungary have failed to do so.Stoltenberg and most allies have long said that both the Nordic neighbors should join at the same time, but in recent days NATO’s top civilian official has soften his stance amid Turkey's reluctance to ratify Sweden's accession.“My position is that both can be ratified now. But the main issue is not whether they are ratified together, the main issue is that Finland and Sweden are ratified as soon as possible,” he told reporters in Ankara.Turkey accuses the government in Stockholm of being too soft on groups it deems to be terror organizations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups. Earlier this month, Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland joining.“It would not be a realistic approach to say that Sweden has fully fulfilled its obligations,” Cavusoglu said Thursday. “At the moment, we have not yet seen the concrete steps we want.”With cracking down on extremism a likely vote-winner in elections scheduled in Turkey for May — although the polls might be delayed due to the devastating earthquake that rocked Turkey and Syria last week, killing almost 40,000 people — the rhetoric from Ankara has become increasingly heated.In recent weeks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed anger at a series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm. In one case a solitary anti-Islam activist burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, while in an unconnected protest an effigy of Erdogan was hanged.“I understand and I share the pain because I personally regard the burning of the holy book as a disgraceful act,” Stoltenberg said, but he also praised Sweden for being “able to prevent other (protests) with the burning of the Quran.”“Not all acts which are disgraceful or immoral or provocative are illegal, but it is important to have a strong position and that is what we have seen daily from the Swedish government,” the former Norwegian prime minister said.Hungary has not publicly raised any substantial objections to either country joining NATO, but it has chosen to push back its ratification date for their applications three times.",2023/02/16,,World

            The city's population declined 0.9% to 7.3 million at the end of 2022 from a year earlier, according to provisional data released by the Census and Statistics Department. It said there was a net outflow of 60,000 residents, with 21,200 new residents arriving.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812446,"China, Iran call on Afghanistan to end restrictions on women","BEIJING (AP) — China and Iran have urged mutual neighbor Afghanistan to end restrictions on women’s work and education.

            The call came in a joint statement Thursday issued at the close of a visit to Beijing by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi during which the two sides affirmed close economic and political ties and their rejection of Western standards of human rights and democracy.

            Since taking over Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban has banned women and girls from universities and schools after the sixth grade and forced out those in elected offices and other prominent positions.











            “The two sides ... called on the Afghan rulers to form an inclusive government in which all ethnic groups and political groups actually participate, and cancel all discriminatory measures against women, ethnic minorities and other religions,"" the statement said, adding that the U.S. and its NATO allies “should be responsible for the current situation in Afghanistan."" 

            The U.S. had backed Afghanistan's elected government against the Taliban, but withdrew amid the rising costs and dwindling domestic support for a government that was unable to counter a Taliban revival.

            The call for women's rights is notable coming from Iran’s hardline Shiite Muslim regime, which has been challenged by months of protests sparked by the death of a young woman in police custody for allegedly violating clothing requirements.

            The country’s theocracy has executed at least four men since the demonstrations began in September over the death of Mahsa Amini. All have faced internationally criticized, rapid, closed-door trials. 

            The bulk of the China-Iran joint statement emphasized strong political and economic ties, the quest for peace and justice in the Middle East and denuclearization in spite of Tehran's alleged drive to produce atomic weapons.

            In a meeting earlier with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Raisi expressed support for China's crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and claim to self-ruling democratic Taiwan. 

            China and Iran portray themselves, alongside Moscow, as counterweights to American power, and have given tacit, and in Iran's case, material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

            “China supports Iran in safeguarding national sovereignty” and “resisting unilateralism and bullying,” Xi said in a statement carried by Chinese state TV on its website.

            Xi and Raisi attended the signing of 20 cooperation agreements including on trade and tourism, the Chinese government announced. Those add to a 25-year strategy agreement signed in 2021 to cooperate in developing oil, industry and other fields.

            China is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian oil and a major source of investment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812466,"Quake survivors wait amid rubble, to search or say goodbye","ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — Hamid Yakisikli has waited outside the pile of concrete that used to be his house since an earthquake devastated his home in the ancient city of Antakya. He and his two brothers have endured freezing conditions, in big jackets and wool hats, waiting for rescuers to retrieve the body of their mother, Fatma, from under the rubble. 

            Ever since the Feb. 6 earthquake decimated swaths of Turkey and Syria, survivors have gathered outside destroyed houses and apartments, refusing to leave. 

            Hundreds of buildings were reduced to rubble; ancient buildings lie in ruins; and the streets of Antakya's historic center were blocked by mounds of debris and furniture, dividing the city into small blocks of apocalyptic destruction. It was the most deadly quake in Turkey's modern history.











            Over 2 million people have left the disaster zone in Turkey, according to the government. But here in the worst-hit city, hundreds are still waiting. At every corner, a few people look at a pile of rubble, praying for a wife, a sister, a son or a friend. 

            Yakisikli, a retired cook, was closest to his mother. She lived right below him.

            He was home when the quake struck. “We were on the third floor, and we just found ourselves on the ground,” he said. His mother’s second-floor apartment was deep underground. 

            Yakisikli and his brothers initially tried to climb the rubble in search of their mother. One caught a glimpse of her head through the debris — she was lifeless, lying on her back.

            Unable to free her body, they began a long wait. 

            “I can’t have peace of mind without burying her,” said Yakisikli, as he watched an excavator claw at the remains of the building behind his home.

            The Yakisiklis only slept when the excavators turned off their engines, in a tent pitched in an abandoned school near their former home. There was no water, electricity or toilet in the tent. 

            “We will not feel good about leaving. We must get her out and bury her and then we see what we have to do,” he said.

            The Yakisikli brothers find solace in the company of the living — and the occasional laugh, as they spend the days swapping stories about their travels. 

            Some of the people waiting hope for a miracle.

            On Wednesday, Abdulrizak Dagli and his wife read the Quran and raised their hands to the skies, as they waited for rescuers to retrieve their son and his wife, and a missing grandchild. Their 1-year-old granddaughter was pulled out of the debris alive five days after the earthquake.

            Other survivors have refused to move to guard savings, valuable belongings and homes. Some search for documents they hope could help them rebuild the life they knew; others simply look for memories. 

            “We can’t leave our house,” said Gulsen Donmez, a 46-year-old survivor, leaning back on a plastic chair in a park opposite her damaged house. She left for a few days, but soon rushed back. “There are looters who are taking things from homes. We decided to stay here close to the house so we can go check on it all the time.”

            Donmez, her husband, three children and their large dog have slept in a park, first in one of its small food stands, then in an empty kiosk they filled with blankets to keep out the cold. 

            She held her hands to a wood-burning heater outside the kiosk. With no public toilets, she relieves herself in the open air. 

            She said she would wait for as long as it takes to get into her home and retrieve what she can. In the meantime, she has applied for a government-issued tent. Being placed in one would make it easier to access organized aid and begin seeking compensation.

            But that wait may be long as Turkey struggles to provide shelter for the hundreds of thousands of new homeless.

            On Wednesday, volunteers distributed warm meals and hygiene kits. Some gave out flowers to cheer a sad and gloomy city. Municipality workers cleaned the streets, some with large cracks that snaked through the asphalt. 

            People have set tents up in open spaces, parks or schools. Some residents slept in cars parked near their homes. 

            Enise Karaali, 69, and her son Haydar have spent some nights in the car outside their former real estate office, crushed by debris, and others in a tent near their home.

            “I used to live really well. I lost a good life now to live in a car or a tent,” Enise Karaali, holding a bowl of pasta offered by volunteers as she reminisced about her dining room table and house with a garden. 

            In his offices, Haydar Karaali had papers that prove people owe him some $100,000. He won't leave before retrieving them from under the rubble. 

            “We will wait. We will keep coming and going,” she said.

            A few blocks away, silversmith Jan Estefan and his wife used a garden fork and their hands to sift through the rubble. He and his family came out unhurt, but their business, including his silver and collection of ancient coins, were buried.

            He asked rescuers to put the rubble to a place where he can sift through it without disrupting their work, and he's been digging through the pile they made near his shop.

            “We must do this if we want to live without relying on anyone,” said Estefan, as he leaned over to inspect a shining object in the dirt. He picked out an old Syrian coin, and put it in a small paper bag his wife was holding. 

            For the Yakisikli brothers, the wait went on for nearly 230 hours, when finally Fatma Yakisikli was pulled from the rubble. Now, they can bury their mother and being trying to move on. 

            “There is no more life here. Antakya is destroyed,"" he said. “There may be 100,000 funerals.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812467,Boat carrying 71 Rohingya refugees lands in Indonesia,"ACEH BESAR, Indonesia (AP) — A boat carrying 71 weak and hungry Rohingya Muslims fleeing from refugee camps in Bangladesh landed Thursday in Indonesia’s northernmost province of Aceh, local officials said.

            Fifteen-year-old Shorif Uddin, who was on the boat with his parents, said two or three people died while they were at sea because of a lack of food.

            “We have been traveling so long and did not have any food to eat. We are really hungry,” he said.











            He said the Rohingya had been unable to find work or achieve higher education in the refugee camps and decided to leave Bangladesh for Indonesia.

            His parents paid money to board the boat along with other refugees, but the captain fled the vessel as it was passing India, Uddin said.

            Miftach Cut Adek, the leader of the tribal fishing community in Lampanah Leungah village in Aceh Besar district, where the boat landed, said it was in good condition and the engine was working.

            The 71 Rohingya on board included 21 women and 20 children. 

            More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh after an army-led crackdown in August 2017. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and the burning of thousands of Rohingya homes.

            Most of the refugees who have left the camps by sea have attempted to reach Muslim-majority Malaysia, but many have ended up in Indonesia along the way. 

            More than 500 Rohingya landed in Aceh last year. The most recent group was in early January, when 184 people landed on Kuala Gigieng beach, also in Aceh Besar district.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812468,Bellingham fits leadership role as Dortmund racks up wins,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Chelsea's star signings, a whirl of transfer speculation, the roaring crowd of 81,000 — none of it fazed Jude Bellingham.

            At just 19, the England midfielder walked calmly up for the coin toss wearing the Borussia Dortmund captain's armband and then led his team to victory over Chelsea in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday.

            It was a measure of Bellingham's stature at Dortmund and the respect of his teammates that he was picked to lead the team out for one of the biggest games of the season. He looked a confident leader on the field, unafraid to give orders or to fire up the crowd, though he did come close to earning a second yellow card at one stage. Bellingham was careful to keep the 1-0 win in perspective, too.











            “I think it's a good win for us at home, definitely. But it's still only a one-goal lead,” he said in televised comments. “We know how quickly a team like Chelsea can carve us open and create chances to score goals. They've nearly done it tonight. So I think we've got to be grateful that we've performed the way we have, but not get too carried away and understand that we've got another big job on our hands in the second leg.”

            It wasn’t quite Bellingham’s first time as captain — he had worn the armband three times already this season — but to do it at 19 in such a high-pressure game stands out. Only one other player has been a captain in a men's Champions League knockout game while still a teenager — Matthijs de Ligt for Ajax in 2019.

            Coach Edin Terzic felt comfortable giving Bellingham the armband, making it easier to bench regular captain Marco Reus and vice-captain Mats Hummels, both grizzled veterans. In turn that helped Dortmund play at higher intensity, guarding against Chelsea's quick counters and scoring the only goal of the game thanks to Karim Adeyemi's pace.

            Bellingham's age belies his experience, given he's already played 162 games of first-team soccer for Dortmund and his first club, Birmingham. On Sunday, he's in line for his 81st career Bundesliga game as Dortmund hosts struggling Hertha Berlin in an attempt to close the three-point gap to league leader Bayern Munich.

            Dortmund was inconsistent in the first half of the season, not helped by selling Erling Haaland to Manchester City and then losing his replacement, Sébastien Haller, for the first half of the season while he underwent cancer treatment. 

            Dortmund went into the World Cup break a lowly sixth in the Bundesliga, nine points off the top. The extra-long break in Germany, at two months the longest of any the top five European leagues, has revitalized the team. The win over Chelsea was Dortmund's seventh in a row in all competitions to start 2023 with a 100% record. Ending Bayern's record streak of Bundesliga titles is still unlikely, but Dortmund has a shot and plenty of momentum.

            As the season nears its end, the speculation around Bellingham's future will only get louder after three seasons in Germany. While he has two years left on his contract, all indications are that Bellingham will be at the center of the latest transfer saga of a young Dortmund star heading to the Premier League, much like Haaland last season and Jadon Sancho the season before. 

            Whoever buys Bellingham won't just be getting one of the best allround midfielders in world soccer, they'll be getting a leader too.

He looked a confident leader on the field, unafraid to give orders or to fire up the crowd, though he did come close to earning a second yellow card at one stage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812469,Streamline Hotel provides glimpse into NASCAR's storied past,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Vintage racecars crowded into the parking lot of the Streamline Hotel for a “legends party” Wednesday, and hundreds of fans got up-close looks at pieces of NASCAR history.

            They could have found even more by touring the historic building.

            The Streamline, which opened in 1941 and has been widely recognized as the birthplace of NASCAR because it hosted meetings between drivers and officials during its formative years, has once again become a landmark overlooking the “World’s Most Famous Beach.”











            Reimagined as a boutique hotel with a distinct art-deco design, it’s filled with pictures and memorabilia from NASCAR’s early days and stands as one of the few remaining reminders of the series’ roots. It’s a gathering spot — maybe even a tourist attraction — for anyone wanting a glimpse of what those olden days of racing on the beach must have looked and felt like.

            And there’s no shortage of curious customers this week as NASCAR celebrates its 75th anniversary.

            “I couldn’t help but walk through there and put myself in the shoes of 1947, ’48, somewhere in there,” said 2012 NASCAR champion Brad Keselowski, who poked around the hotel recently. “I couldn’t help but do that and think of myself as them and what that place must have looked like then. It’s interesting for sure.”

            It’s a masterpiece to some, something of a marvel to anyone who saw what the dilapidated building looked like less than a decade ago. 

            Real estate magnate Eddie Hennessy bought the 44-room hotel in 2014. He spent upwards of $6 million restoring and renovating it. He delivered a Miami-inspired motif that includes lots of bright colors and intricate details that create the look of a bygone era and restored it to its original glory. 

            “Not too many people could have done what I did,” Hennessy said. “It was the biggest mountain I’ve ever climbed.”

            Hennessy gutted the building down to original concrete and beams, raised ceilings, added modern amenities and gave the hotel a definitive NASCAR feel with pictures the France family allowed him to use. Close friend J.C. France, the son of NASCAR chairman Jim France, gave him exclusive access to NASCAR memorabilia that now adorn the walls of the lobby, the restaurant and the rooftop bar.

            “I’m a racer at heart,” Hennessy said. “I was raised by NASCAR and all kinds of racing. And being so close to the France family, it was out of respect also. This place has so much heritage.”

            He kept tributes to a masonic temple that was part of the original building, went to great lengths (and expense) to move and maintain a heavy vault door, and had racing-inspired murals painted on several interior walls.

            His years-long effort was featured in an October 2014 episode of the Travel Channel’s reality television show “Hotel Impossible.” The show “put us back on the map,” Hennessy said, and created extra buzz surrounding the famed hotel. 

            Renowned gangster Al Capone frequented the hotspot in its heyday along with moonshiners who were among NASCAR’s first generation of racers. When they first started racing on the beach, they drove right by the hotel, which now sits on the western side of a scenic roadway.

            Hennessy recently purchased several nearby properties and cleared the land. He hopes to eventually build on those and further revitalize an area decimated by two hurricanes in 2022. In the meantime, the hotel serves as the centerpiece of that section of Daytona Beach.

            The rooftop bar regularly features live music as well as deejays and specially themed events such as Latin Nights, drag shows and yoga classes.

            The hotel generates much of its income during Speedweeks, Bike Week and Spring Break — all staples of the tourism industry in Daytona.

            Former NASCAR champion Chase Elliott has visited the hotel, and NASCAR superstar Dale Earnhardt Jr. rented out the entire thing for a private launch party for his High Rock Vodka last year. NASCAR also held a 75th anniversary celebration there last month.

            The legends party was the latest draw. Jim France, Hall of Fame driver Bobby Allison and NASCAR vice chairman Mike Helton were on hand for the event.

            “You have to have a vision,” Hennessey said. “People thought I was crazy when I bought this place. It was a lot of trial and tribulation, dealing with a lot of historical aspects, nationally and locally.

            “The hotel was in bad disarray for so long. And for me to change that stigma and reputation was another feat in its own.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812471,Africa CDC expects Mpox vaccines to arrive within 2 weeks,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Africa’s public health body says it hopes Mpox vaccines will finally arrive on the continent “in another two weeks, tops” after months of seeking doses.

            The doses will go first to countries with acute need and the largest overall burden, the acting director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ahmed Ogwell, told journalists on Thursday. Congo and Nigeria have had the highest numbers of Mpox.

            In July, the World Health Organization designated Mpox as a global emergency amid outbreaks in Europe and North America and appealed to the world to support African countries. But no rich countries shared vaccines or treatments with the African continent even as cases in other regions subsided.











            Mpox has sickened people in parts of West and Central Africa since the 1970s but it wasn’t until the disease triggered the outbreaks in Europe and North America that public health officials even thought to use vaccines. Rich countries rushed to buy nearly all the world’s supply.

            In early December, the Africa CDC said the continent was set to receive its first batch of 50,000 Mpox vaccines as a donation from South Korea and would be used first for health workers and people living in the hardest-hit areas.

            Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox but renamed last year because of racism concerns, is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that’s in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals, but it was not known to spread easily among people.

            Since 2000, Africa has reported about 1,000 to 2,000 suspected Mpox cases every year but saw more than 3,000 last year.

            Ogwell said the current outbreak “has been quite stable, not been changing a lot.”

            Outside of Africa, nearly all cases have been in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men.NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Africa’s public health body says it hopes Mpox vaccines will finally arrive on the continent “in another two weeks, tops” after months of seeking doses.The doses will go first to countries with acute need and the largest overall burden, the acting director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ahmed Ogwell, told journalists on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812481,UN official warns of rising earthquake death toll in Syria,"AMMAN (AP) — The United Nations regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syrian crisis said Thursday that the country's death toll from last week's deadly earthquake is likely to rise further as teams scramble to remove rubble in hard-hit areas.

            In an interview with The Associated Press, Muhannad Hadi defended the U.N.'s response to the disaster, which many in Syria have criticized as slow and inadequate.

            The U.N. has reported a death toll of about 6,000 for all of Syria, including 4,400 in the rebel-held northwest. That figure is higher than those reported by government authorities in Damascus and civil defense officials in the northwest, who have reported 1,414 and 2,274 deaths respectively. 











            “We’re hoping that this number will not increase by much,” Hadi said. “But from what we are seeing … the devastation of this earthquake is really not giving us a lot of hope that this will be the end of it.”

            Hadi noted that even before the earthquake, there were some 4.1 million people in need of aid in northwest Syria, many of whom were already displaced and have now become homeless or displaced again.

            Locals struggling with the aftermath of the earthquake have criticized delays in getting U.N. aid to the area. Roads leading to the one border crossing from Turkey to Syria that the U.N. is authorized to use were damaged by the earthquake. The first convoy of aid to enter northwest Syria came three days after the quake.

            The U.N. and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reached a deal Monday to open two additional crossings, but critics say the U.N. should have used additional crossings without waiting for approval or found another way to get aid in, in light of the dire situation on the ground.

            Syrian rescue workers and those who lost homes and family members in the quake have criticized the slow arrival of aid, saying they felt abandoned by the international community.

            “I can assure you that we have done everything we can from the very beginning,” Hadi said. “We asked everybody to put the interests of the people first. We asked everybody to de-politicize the humanitarian situation and focus on supporting us to reach the people.”

            Hadi said 120 aid trucks had crossed into northwestern Syria from Turkey as of Thursday.

            So far, no aid convoys have crossed from Damascus-controlled territory into the rebel-held areas. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the al-Qaida-linked rebel group that controls much of the northwest has so far refused to allow aid to cross from government areas.

            Hadi said the U.N. is “working with all parties” to open the route to aid, but acknowledged that “so far, we haven’t been successful.”

            The U.N. has appealed for $397 million to provide “desperately needed, life-saving relief,” including shelter, food and health care for the next three months.

            More complications will almost certainly arise once the earthquake response moved from immediate emergency aid to rebuilding, but Hadi said it is too early to think about that.

            “What we need to focus on right now is the humanitarian work,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812482,Revelers celebrate street Carnival across German Rhineland,"BERLIN (AP) — Tens of thousands of revelers danced in the streets of Cologne, Duesseldorf, Bonn and other cities and towns across the Rhineland Thursday as they celebrated the traditional start of Carnival in Germany.

            Dressed up in bright colors and creative costumes, they sang loudly and swayed to familiar tunes of brass bands and folklore music, and drank lots of beer.

            It is the first time since the start of the pandemic that Carnival is being celebrated in Germany without any coronavirus restrictions.











            The first day of Carnival in Germany is also traditionally dedicated to women taking over the power in city halls across the Rhineland for a day. They symbolically take away the keys from the — mostly male — mayors, and cut off men's ties and shoelaces in return for kisses.

            In Duesseldorf, costumed elderly women known as Moehnen stormed city hall at 11:11 a.m, German news agency dpa reported.

            “For two years you had your peace, but today it's all about women power. We want the power,” shouted Carnival princess Uasa Maisch. “We’ll cut off your ties. You’re in for it. We want in.”

            In Cologne alone, tens of thousands of people were expected for the festivities. Police deployed more than 2,000 officers, and the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Cologne is located, warned revelers not to drink too much “Koelsch” — the typical, honey-colored beer of Cologne. 

            “Everyone should know when there’s been enough Koelsch,"" Herbert Reul told Cologne daily paper Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger. 

            At the same time, the minister acknowledged that “it’s all the more important that there are these days when you can switch off for a few hours and put your worries aside” when concern about war and inflation are on many people's minds most of the time. 

            Around noontime, Cologne police blocked off the Zuelpicher Viertel neighborhood because it was overflowing with people, dpa reported. No more revelers were allowed to enter the district close to the city's main university that's dotted with many popular bars and pubs.BERLIN (AP) — Tens of thousands of revelers danced in the streets of Cologne, Duesseldorf, Bonn and other cities and towns across the Rhineland Thursday as they celebrated the traditional start of Carnival in Germany.Dressed up in bright colors and creative costumes, they sang loudly and swayed to familiar tunes of brass bands and folklore music, and drank lots of beer.It is the first time since the start of the pandemic that Carnival is being celebrated in Germany without any coronavirus restrictions.The first day of Carnival in Germany is also traditionally dedicated to women taking over the power in city halls across the Rhineland for a day.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812533,Red Cross chief warns of health crisis in quake-hit Syria,"BEIRUT (AP) — Syria could face dangerous outbreaks of disease in the wake of last week's devastating earthquake if hundreds of thousands of displaced people do not get permanent housing soon, the Red Cross' global chief said Thursday, as Syrians struggle to receive humanitarian aid amid the mounting crisis.

            Jagan Chapagain, who is Secretary-General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said families staying in makeshift shelters without adequate heating urgently need permanent housing. 

            “They are still living in very basic conditions in very, very cold school rooms,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. “If this continues for a long period of time, then there will be health consequences.”











            He spoke after returning from Aleppo, Syria’s largest city that for years witnessed some of the worst fighting of the country’s ongoing civil war.

            Aleppo was hit with a cholera outbreak in late 2022. The earthquake’s impact on access to housing, water, fuel, and other infrastructure could make another outbreak “possible,” he said, adding that the disaster also has been ruinous for Syrians' mental health.

            “If the conflict had broken their backs, I think this earthquake is breaking their spirit now,” Chapagain said. 

            
                The deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake that rocked Turkey and Syria over a week ago shattered parts of the war-torn country, both in the northwestern rebel-held enclave and nearby government-held areas. An estimated 3,688 people died on both sides of the frontline in Syria, about 1,400 of them in government-held cities and towns.

            Entire neighborhoods of Aleppo have been abandoned, Chapagain added, with some residents opting to move to rural areas after the quake. Many Syrians were displaced for a second time following the natural disaster, already leaving their homes to escape the airstrikes and shelling.

            The UNHCR estimated that 5.3 million Syrians across the earthquake-hit country could be homeless if viable shelter and aid is not secured.

            In the long term, Chapagain said rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure, already crippled by the war, ought to be a priority. However, the civil war and economic crisis in Syria makes a swift post-earthquake recovery more complicated.

            The IFRC has raised 200 million Swiss francs ($216.8 million) and hopes to support 2.4 million people across the country over the next two years. Dozens of planes and trucks loaded with humanitarian aid have reached government-held Syria. The U.N. appealed for $397 million to support almost 5 million people in rebel-held northwestern Syria, almost all living in poverty.

            During his tour of Aleppo, Chapagain said that aid, which has decreased over the years, was now arriving in larger quantities.

            One woman told him that she had suffered from the dwindling assistance in recent years but “in some way this earthquake brought back humanitarian assistance so (she) could eat food again,” he recalled.

            Still, he said, major gaps in essential goods remain.

            “Even some of the ambulances are struggling to get fuel, and even some of our own cars are struggling to get fuel,” said Chapagain.BEIRUT (AP) — Syria could face dangerous outbreaks of disease in the wake of last week's devastating earthquake if hundreds of thousands of displaced people do not get permanent housing soon, the Red Cross' global chief said Thursday, as Syrians struggle to receive humanitarian aid amid the mounting crisis.Jagan Chapagain, who is Secretary-General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said families staying in makeshift shelters without adequate heating urgently need permanent housing.“They are still living in very basic conditions in very, very cold school rooms,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. “If this continues for a long period of time, then there will be health consequences.”He spoke after returning from Aleppo, Syria’s largest city that for years witnessed some of the worst fighting of the country’s ongoing civil war.Aleppo was hit with a cholera outbreak in late 2022.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812534,Real Madrid visits Osasuna in Spain before Liverpool trip,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The indisputable success of Real Madrid and its record 14 European Cups have left its critics with scant arguments to question its legacy.

            Yet in Spain, where Barcelona boasts its characteristic possession-based passing game, Madrid is often scrutinized for supposedly winning without wowing, for not producing the choral beauty of a Barcelona, or the high-octane attack of other European powers like, for example, Liverpool.

            Carlo Ancelotti, Madrid’s laid-back Italian coach, couldn’t care less, however. When asked recently to define his team’s playing style, he said that it did not have one.











            And he liked it that way.

            After all, Madrid showed last season in its incredible march to the Champions League title a chameleon-like ease to find multiple ways to produce goals with time running down and its opponents apparently in control round after round before it beat Liverpool in the final.

            “They said (we didn’t have style) when we won the Champions League last year. (But) We play soccer well,” Ancelotti said. “Real Madrid does not have a clear soccer identity for the simple reason that I don’t want it to have one. I want a team that knows how to do many things.”

            Madrid on Saturday will again have to adapt to a team whose identity is set it stone.

            Osasuna, a modest club based in the northern city of Pamplona, is happy to relinquish the ball. It plays for the counterattack, either after it pressures to recover the ball near the opposing area, or when it sits back to open space for strikers like Chimy Ávila, an Argentine who leads the team with eight goals this season.

            That commitment to a tried-and-tested style often lets Osasuna overcome the talent gap it has with top teams like Madrid and give them a real test, especially at its raucous El Sadar Stadium, which despite holding only 23,000 fans often sounds like many more.

            Osasuna’s budget for players and staff salaries is 52 million euros ($55 million), compared to 683 million euros ($731 million) for Madrid, the defending Spanish and European champion.

            Madrid will likely need to win to ensure that Barcelona does not add to its eight-point lead at the top of the Spanish league standings.

            After struggling recently, Madrid has won three straight, including two games to claim the Club World Cup and a 4-0 rout of last-place Elche on Wednesday.

            The Osasuna game starts a demanding stretch for Madrid. Three days later, Madrid heads to Anfield to face Liverpool in the round of 16 of the Champions League. After that trip to England, Madrid will play Atletico Madrid in the Spanish league and Barcelona in the Copa del Rey semifinals.

            “We’re taking advantage of all these games to improve each player’s fitness,” Ancelotti said after his team’s win over Elche. “It’s obvious the team is getting better and playing matches helps you to fine-tune their condition.”

            Vinícius Júnior, who leads Madrid with 16 goals overall this season, will be available after missing the match against Elche because of suspension.

            Jagoba Arrasate has coached Osasuna since 2018 and has the team playing its best in years. It fought back for a 1-1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu when it visited Madrid in October. It had risen as high as fourth place this season, even if now it has slid into ninth place as it gears up to play Athletic Bilbao in the other Copa del Rey semifinal match.

            Osasuna is also led by holding midfielder Jon Moncayola and central defender David García, who is expected back after missing one game with illness.

            Barcelona hosts Cadiz on Sunday amid a media uproar regarding its payment of 1.4 million euros ($1.5 million) between 2016-18 for technical reports on referees to a company that belonged to the vice president of the refereeing committee in Spain at that time. The club denies any wrongdoing.

            Third-place Real Sociedad plays Celta Vigo on Saturday, while fourth-place Atletico Madrid welcomes Bilbao on Sunday.

After that trip to England, Madrid will play Atletico Madrid in the Spanish league and Barcelona in the Copa del Rey semifinals.“We’re taking advantage of all these games to improve each player’s fitness,” Ancelotti said after his team’s win over Elche. “It’s obvious the team is getting better and playing matches helps you to fine-tune their condition.”Vinícius Júnior, who leads Madrid with 16 goals overall this season, will be available after missing the match against Elche because of suspension.Jagoba Arrasate has coached Osasuna since 2018 and has the team playing its best in years. It fought back for a 1-1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu when it visited Madrid in October. It had risen as high as fourth place this season, even if now it has slid into ninth place as it gears up to play Athletic Bilbao in the other Copa del Rey semifinal match.Osasuna is also led by holding midfielder Jon Moncayola and central defender David García, who is expected back after missing one game with illness.Barcelona hosts Cadiz on Sunday amid a media uproar regarding its payment of 1.4 million euros ($1.5 million) between 2016-18 for technical reports on referees to a company that belonged to the vice president of the refereeing committee in Spain at that time. The club denies any wrongdoing.Third-place Real Sociedad plays Celta Vigo on Saturday, while fourth-place Atletico Madrid welcomes Bilbao on Sunday.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812536,Potential buyers of Manchester United crunching the numbers,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — After missing out on Chelsea last year, British businessman Martin Broughton knows how potential buyers will be feeling ahead of Friday’s deadline to submit bids for Manchester United.

            The late nights spent crunching the numbers. Checking and double-checking that financial backers will make good on their promises.

            Then that final bid emailed to the New York office of merchant bank Raine Group for approval.











            “Just before you put in the formal bid you go through all of the debate,” Broughton, who has no intention of making a bid for United, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “How much leeway do we leave ourselves? We need to be on the shortlist. At the same time, we don’t want to be overpaying.”

            Friday has been described as a soft deadline for initial offers before the process of determining the next owner of United gathers pace.

            Broughton, a 75-year-old businessman who is the former chairman of British Airways and English soccer club Liverpool, went through all of that last year when heading a consortium that tried to buy Chelsea, with Raine also handling that sale. He made it to the final three, but eventually lost to Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, who paid $3 billion for the London club — a record for a soccer team.

            United is estimated to command as much as double that figure after the American-owning Glazer family announced their willingness to sell last November.

            So far Jim Ratcliffe, the British billionaire owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS, is the only confirmed bidder. But he is expected to face a challenge from Qatar, while other interested parties could become clearer after Friday.

            “I don’t know how many bids there were for Chelsea, but there were at least half a dozen serious bids and that leaves four or five frustrated people,” Broughton said.

            One of those was Ratcliffe, who, despite matching the bid of Boehly and Clearlake, missed the deadline set by Raine and wasn’t considered. He hasn’t repeated that mistake with United, declaring last month his intention to move for the club he has supported since childhood.

            “Jim wants it. He’s prepared to pay properly for it. My surmise would be he’s willing to come up with a big number,” Broughton said. “Personally, I would guess he’d be at the 4-5 billion pounds ($4.8-6 billion) level.

            “Jim, in the Chelsea case, made it clear at the outset that he wasn’t going to be interested at that price, it was too much. Wasn’t interested in discussing, joining in with other potential bidders and then made this very late bid.”

            Broughton, a Chelsea supporter, pitched his attempt to buy out then-owner Roman Abramovich on the premise of a bid by the fans, for the fans. He sees some similarities in Ratcliffe’s pursuit of United.

            “We didn’t see it as just a financial transaction. We saw it more as an opportunity for a greater level of fan involvement. Jim is a fan,” Broughton said, adding “somebody who is a fan, I think is preferable because they will think about what the fans want.”

            Broughton said he wouldn’t be surprised if only a “very small number” of buyers come forward for United, given the estimated price and further investment required to redevelop the club’s iconic Old Trafford stadium.

            A Qatari-backed bid is expected, while it is unknown if a rival offer from the Middle East will also emerge.

            Broughton sees Qatar as a serious threat to Ratcliffe if a bid from the oil and gas rich country emerges.

            “They might feel a knockout price (would do it and say) ... We’ll give you 6 billion (pounds; $7.2 billion) as long as you sell it to us now and don’t carry on the auction.’ A take it or leave, something like that could easily settle it,” Broughton said.

            Broughton has written a memoir of his career called “Whenever I Hear That Song.” In it, he recounts overseeing the sale of Liverpool to John Henry in 2010, as well as his attempts to buy Chelsea after Abramovich was forced to sell in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            While he has sounded out potential investors in Liverpool, with Henry’s Fenway Sports Group open to selling the Merseyside club, he failed to drum up interest. He has not tried to put a bid together for United and is focusing on his passions, such as horse racing.

            Proceeds from his book will go to the charity Retraining of Racehorses.

            Another passion is Chelsea, and he has watched with interest as Boehly and Clearlake have spent more than $660 million on transfers since buying the club for $2.5 billion in May.

            That money has so far failed to produce success on the field, with Chelsea in the middle of the Premier League standings and fighting to stay in the Champions League after losing to Borussia Dortmund 1-0 in the first leg of the round of 16 on Wednesday.

            Broughton said he “very much” regrets missing out on Chelsea, but is encouraged by what he has seen from the new owners.

            “My principle conclusion would be he (Boehly) has shown the commitment that he intends to make a success of it,” Broughton said. “If you compare that to the Glazers, for example, the Glazers have always operated like, ‘How can we make money out of this?’

            “He is looking at it as, ‘I want this to be a success. I want people to see that my ownership of Chelsea has been good for the club.’”

My surmise would be he’s willing to come up with a big number,” Broughton said. “Personally, I would guess he’d be at the 4-5 billion pounds ($4.8-6 billion) level.“Jim, in the Chelsea case, made it clear at the outset that he wasn’t going to be interested at that price, it was too much. Wasn’t interested in discussing, joining in with other potential bidders and then made this very late bid.”Broughton, a Chelsea supporter, pitched his attempt to buy out then-owner Roman Abramovich on the premise of a bid by the fans, for the fans. He sees some similarities in Ratcliffe’s pursuit of United.“We didn’t see it as just a financial transaction. We saw it more as an opportunity for a greater level of fan involvement. Jim is a fan,” Broughton said, adding “somebody who is a fan, I think is preferable because they will think about what the fans want.”Broughton said he wouldn’t be surprised if only a “very small number” of buyers come forward for United, given the estimated price and further investment required to redevelop the club’s iconic Old Trafford stadium.A Qatari-backed bid is expected, while it is unknown if a rival offer from the Middle East will also emerge.Broughton sees Qatar as a serious threat to Ratcliffe if a bid from the oil and gas rich country emerges.“They might feel a knockout price (would do it and say) ... We’ll give you 6 billion (pounds; $7.2 billion) as long as you sell it to us now and don’t carry on the auction.’ A take it or leave, something like that could easily settle it,” Broughton said.Broughton has written a memoir of his career called “Whenever I Hear That Song.” In it, he recounts overseeing the sale of Liverpool to John Henry in 2010, as well as his attempts to buy Chelsea after Abramovich was forced to sell in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.While he has sounded out potential investors in Liverpool, with Henry’s Fenway Sports Group open to selling the Merseyside club, he failed to drum up interest. He has not tried to put a bid together for United and is focusing on his passions, such as horse racing.Proceeds from his book will go to the charity Retraining of Racehorses.Another passion is Chelsea, and he has watched with interest as Boehly and Clearlake have spent more than $660 million on transfers since buying the club for $2.5 billion in May.That money has so far failed to produce success on the field, with Chelsea in the middle of the Premier League standings and fighting to stay in the Champions League after losing to Borussia Dortmund 1-0 in the first leg of the round of 16 on Wednesday.Broughton said he “very much” regrets missing out on Chelsea, but is encouraged by what he has seen from the new owners.“My principle conclusion would be he (Boehly) has shown the commitment that he intends to make a success of it,” Broughton said. “If you compare that to the Glazers, for example, the Glazers have always operated like, ‘How can we make money out of this?’“He is looking at it as, ‘I want this to be a success. I want people to see that my ownership of Chelsea has been good for the club.’”___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812538,"Valimaki, Simonsen share 1st-round lead at Thailand Classic","CHONBURI, Thailand (AP) — Sami Valimaki of Finland carded a bogey-free 8-under 64 Thursday to share the lead with Martin Simonsen of Denmark after the opening round of the Thailand Classic.

            Coming off a second-place finish in the Singapore Classic, where he finished one stroke behind Ockie Strydom of South Africa on Sunday, the 24-year-old Valimaki made five birdies on the front nine — including on his opening three holes — before picking up three more after the turn. 

            “I started nicely and kept it going the whole day,” said Valimaki, whose only European tour win came at the Oman Open in 2020. “When I start hitting the ball really well, it just makes it easy.""











            The Thailand Classic returned to the European tour for the first time since 2016, when it was held in Hua Hin.

            Simosen highlighted his round at the Amata Spring Country Club with an eagle on the 11th hole, to go with seven birdies and a lone bogey on the 13th. 

            Sitting a stroke back was the German pair of Yannik Paul, the Mallorca Golf Open winner last October, and Alexander Knappe. 

            Four-time tour winner Rafa Cabrera Bello of Spain had an error-free round of a 66 to sit two shots off the lead along with Robin Sciot-Siegrist of France, Thirston Lawrence of South Africa, and Fabriozio Zanotti of Paraguay.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812539,Man with torture wounds on his chest stirs anger in Uganda,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Rights activists and others are urging Ugandan authorities to restrain security agents accused of torture after a man who had been missing resurfaced with wounds on his chest. 

            Eric Mwesigwa says he was tortured by security personnel, allegations a military spokesman dismissed in a statement asserting that the man “was not in the hands of any security agency.” That statement angered some who saw it as a sign of impunity amid persistent allegations of torture in this East African country.

            Mwesigwa, a supporter of the opposition figure and popular singer known as Bobi Wine, said earlier this week that hot metal objects were placed on his body, leaving two raw wounds on his chest. His allegations of torture were repeated by Wine on Twitter. 











            The security agents who tortured Mwesigwa wanted to know Wine's plans “to overthrow the government,” said Wine, a former presidential candidate whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu.

            Torture charges against security personnel in Uganda are not new. On Thursday Uganda marked the anniversary of the death of outspoken Anglican Archbishop Janani Luwum, who in 1977 was murdered by torture at the hands of security agents during the regime of dictator Idi Amin. 

            “It’s a contradiction and shame that we commemorate the murder of Archbishop Luwum by Idi Amin when state security operatives torture Ugandans in this manner, today. Respect for human rights is the foundation for democracy and progress,” Charles Peter Mayiga, an attorney who is the premier of the traditional kingdom of Buganda, said on Twitter Thursday, citing the case of Mwesigwa.

            Wine alleges that many of his supporters have suffered torture after being taken into custody in the aftermath of a disputed presidential election in 2021.

            The new torture allegations come amid controversy over the Ugandan government's refusal to renew the local mandate of the United Nations human rights office. Ugandan authorities justified that decision by asserting that the government is committed to protecting its own people. 

            Criticizing the Ugandan government's decision in a statement Wednesday, Human Rights Watch charged that Ugandan authorities have “had a long history of abuse and repression, especially of critics of the government and the political opposition,"" and that they “have failed to hold government security forces accountable for serious human rights violations.”

            
                The European Union and the United States in the past year have raised alarm over torture allegedly perpetrated by Uganda's security personnel. Recent victims include Kakwenza Rukirabashaija, a satirical writer now exiled in Europe.

            Many critics hold President Yoweri Museveni liable, saying the abuses are perpetrated by security agents enforcing his authority. Museveni, who has held power since 1986, has repeatedly said his party doesn't condone torture. 

            Museveni, once praised as part of a new generation of African leaders and a long-time U.S. security ally, still has support among many Ugandans for bringing relative stability to the country. 

            He once criticized African leaders who refused to step aside but has since extended his time in power by overseeing the removal of term limits and an age limit on the presidency in Uganda.

Ugandan authorities justified that decision by asserting that the government is committed to protecting its own people.Criticizing the Ugandan government's decision in a statement Wednesday, Human Rights Watch charged that Ugandan authorities have “had a long history of abuse and repression, especially of critics of the government and the political opposition,"" and that they “have failed to hold government security forces accountable for serious human rights violations.”The European Union and the United States in the past year have raised alarm over torture allegedly perpetrated by Uganda's security personnel. Recent victims include Kakwenza Rukirabashaija, a satirical writer now exiled in Europe.Many critics hold President Yoweri Museveni liable, saying the abuses are perpetrated by security agents enforcing his authority. Museveni, who has held power since 1986, has repeatedly said his party doesn't condone torture.Museveni, once praised as part of a new generation of African leaders and a long-time U.S. security ally, still has support among many Ugandans for bringing relative stability to the country.He once criticized African leaders who refused to step aside but has since extended his time in power by overseeing the removal of term limits and an age limit on the presidency in Uganda.Uganda’s elections are often marred by allegations of fraud and abuses by security forces.",2023/02/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812562,Plunging natural gas prices relieve inflation pressure,"NEW YORK (AP) — The price of natural gas used to heat homes and generate electricity is plunging this year, thanks to a mild winter in the U.S. and Europe — bringing some relief to consumers and helping drive down inflation. 

            The fuel, which in the U.S. is extracted mainly from shale deposits in Texas and around Pennsylvania, accounts for nearly 25% of residential energy needs, making it a big driver in last year's worst bout of inflation in four decades. Since the start of 2023, U.S. natural gas prices have fallen 40% and Europe's prices are not far behind.

            Much warmer than expected weather throughout Europe and North America played a big part in allowing European supplies to hold out amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The winter has been mild enough that large swaths of the Alps have been mostly green instead of white and typically cold and snowy sections of the U.S. have spent most of the winter well above the freezing mark.











            The Energy Department now expects heating bills for U.S. households that use natural gas to rise by 12% this winter instead of 28% it forecast in October. The warm winter has also helped inventories in the U.S., which are expected to close March 16% above the five-year average.

            The sharp drop in energy prices comes amid a broader easing of inflation as the Federal Reserve and other central banks fight high prices by raising interest rates. U.S. inflation is at about 6.4%, well below a year ago but still far above the central bank’s 2% target. The Fed says it'll stay focused on fighting inflation until it's sure prices are on a sustained downward path.

            Energy companies that made record profits last year are now feeling the pinch of falling prices. Natural gas producer EQT Corp. is down more than 8% this year after gaining 55% in 2022.

            With 800,000 of the most critically ill patients having recovered, China has “decisively beaten” the pandemic, according to notes from a meeting of the ruling Communist Party’s all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee presided over by President and party leader Xi Jinping.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812564,German ballet director fired over feces attack on critic,"BERLIN (AP) — The Hannover State Opera said Thursday that it is ending its contract with ballet director Marco Goecke after he smeared dog feces on the face of a newspaper critic whose reviews he had taken exception to.

            Goecke was suspended from his post as ballet chief this week after the Saturday attack on dance critic Wiebke Huester of German daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The confrontation took place during the interval of a premiere at the opera house.

            The theater’s management had called on him to apologize “comprehensively” and explain himself. Goecke later issued a statement describing his behavior as “absolutely unacceptable” but said he had acted ”in the heat of the moment” and while suffering from “nervous strain” resulting from two premieres in quick succession.

            “I apologize for the fact that I finally blew my top, but I also ask for a certain understanding at least for the reasons why this happened,” he said.

            The attack and Goecke’s tepid apology were widely criticized. Hannover’s mayor, Belit Onay, said attacks on press freedom should have “no place” in the city.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812580,"At 103, Sister Jean publishes memoir of faith and basketball","CHICAGO (AP) — At age 103, Sister Jean awakes daily at 5 a.m. She sits up quickly to avoid going to sleep again — ""I’ve got too much to do,” she says. After prayers for the day ahead, she reads the Gospel on her tablet.

            “I guess there aren’t too many 103-year-old nuns using iPads these days – there aren’t too many 103-year-olds, period,” she writes in her memoir that will be published Feb. 28. “But I’m pretty comfortable with modern technology. I’ve always said, ‘If you’re not moving forward, you’re going to get left behind real quick.’ Adaptability is my superpower.”

            In “Wake Up with Purpose: What I’ve Learned in My First Hundred Years,” Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt tells her life story, offers spiritual guidance and shares some of the lessons she's learned.











            The beloved Catholic nun captured the sports world’s imagination and became something of a folk hero as the chaplain for the Loyola Chicago men’s basketball team that reached the NCAA Final Four in 2018. 

            She has been featured by newspapers and TV stations across America. Her NCAA news conference, she was told, had more journalists than Tom Brady drew at the Super Bowl. Her likeness appears on socks, bobbleheads, even a Lego statue at her gallery in Loyola’s art museum. She sees the attention as a holy opportunity to tell her story and share what she’s learned; to help others wake up with purpose. Among her priorities, there’s little that she enjoys more than talking with young people. 

            “I love life so much and enjoy being with young people,” she told The Associated Press. “They’re the ones who keep me going because they bring such joy into my life -- and they keep you updated on what’s happening in their world.”

            She arrived in a wheelchair for the interview at her office in the university's student center. She wore purple Nike Air Max sneakers with the words “Sister” and “Jean” written on the back, and her maroon and gold Loyola scarf that often gets compared to Harry Potter’s. She smiled warmly and waved to prospective students and shook hands with current students, asking them about their classes.

            “What’s your dream?” she asked some of them.

            Samuel Grebener, a 19-year-old freshman, told her he was thinking about medical school. They then talked about their shared love for the Loyola Ramblers. “She knows more about basketball than me,” Grebener said. 

            It was 9 a.m. and by then, she had already written her usual scouting report and emailed the players on the team to congratulate them on a victory.

            “I believe this was a turning point and that we’re now in a winning streak” she wrote. “Our next game will be challenging, but just keep working hard. I will be there in prayer and in spirit and bless your hands virtually.” 

            In her office — surrounded by bobbleheads, posters and pins with her image — she studied game stats carefully in preparation to meet with the team at practice. Before a pizza lunch at the nearby cafeteria, she met other students.

            Catharina Baeten, a 20-year-old-junior, told Sister Jean she had decided to attend Loyola because of its excellent programs in psychology and women-and-gender studies. “And also because of you,” she told the nun. 

            “Everyone loves Sister Jean,” Baeten said later, recalling that she first met the nun during a tour of Loyola when she was in high school. “There’s not a single unkind bone in her body and she represents our values… she’s the embodiment of compassion.” 

            Born in San Francisco in 1919, Sister Jean grew up in a devoutly Catholic family. She witnessed the impact of the Great Depression, World War II and the building of the Golden Gate Bridge, which she recalls crossing on foot when it opened in 1937. 

            Her religious calling, she said, came at the age of 8. She was in third grade when she met a kind, joyful teacher who belonged to the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Brimming with admiration, she would pray every day: “Dear God, help me understand what I should do, but please tell me I should become a BVM sister,” she recounts in her memoir, co-written with sportswriter/broadcaster Seth Davis. 

            “I guess God listened to me on that one,” she writes. 

            She followed her calling to the order’s motherhouse in Dubuque, Iowa, where she made her vows. She went on to teach at Catholic schools in Chicago and southern California, where she also coached girls’ basketball, before she ended at Mundelein College — on the Chicago lakefront —in the 1960s. The school became affiliated with Loyola in 1991, and Sister Jean was hired to help students with the transition. 

            In 1994, she was asked to help student basketball players boost their grades – “the booster shooter” she called herself, and later that year she was named chaplain of the men’s basketball team. The role, she writes in her memoir, became ""the most transformational and transcendent position” of her life. 

            “Sports are very important because they help develop life skills,” she said. “And during those life skills, you’re also talking about faith and purpose.” Her motto: “Worship, Work, Win.” 

            “I know that God will call me when he wants me. So, I just feel I have a lot more work to do,” she said.

            During a recent practice, she watched from the sideline in her wheelchair. On a break, the players on the men's and women’s teams took turns shaking her hand. 

            “Her consistency is incredible,” said senior forward Tom Welch, 22. “She does it every day, every game. She brings the same energy to our pregame prayers.” 

            She also breaks down the strengths and weaknesses of the rivals in her scouting report. She’s “letting us know who’s good at shooting, who to send to the free throw line… pretty in-depth details,” Welch said. “And then sometimes, you know, she’ll make us laugh, feel good for a game.”

            The laughter has been needed this season. The team is 9-16 overall and last in the Atlantic 10 conference with a 3-10 record.

            Allison Guth, the women’s basketball coach, called Sister Jean a legend. 

            “Every day I walk in the office and she’s in her office. You talk about being there at 103. It’s because it’s a passion for her. It’s about love,” Guth said. “I think they should be telling stories about her forever.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812581,Wholesale price pressures emerge despite long-term slowdown,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Wholesale prices in the United States reaccelerated in January, indicating that inflation pressures continue to underlie the U.S. economy despite longer-term signs of improvement.

            From December to January, the government's producer price index jumped 0.7%, driven up in part by a 5% surge in energy prices. That increase compared with a 0.2% drop from November to December, and it was nearly twice the rise that economists had been expecting.

            The producer price data reflects prices charged by manufacturers, farmers and wholesalers, and it flows into an inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve closely tracks. It can provide an early sign of how fast consumer inflation will rise.











            While the monthly inflation surge was worse than expected, price increases measured over the past year continued to show a slowdown: Wholesale prices in January were up 6% from 12 months earlier, compared with a 6.5% year-over-year rise in December and a recent peak of 11.7% in March. It was the seventh straight month of decelerating year-over-year wholesale inflation, though it still came in higher than forecasters had expected.

            Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation was up 5.4% in January from a year earlier and 0.5% from December to January. Food prices, though, fell 1%, the second straight monthly drop. Egg prices, which have been driven up by a wave of avian flu, sank 12.7% from December to January but are still up more than 200% from a year ago.

            In the energy sector, wholesale gasoline prices were up 6.2% from December, diesel fuel 10.9% and natural gas for homes 12.2%.

            “While producer prices are off their peaks, inflation is elevated and the monthly change in prices showed a move in the wrong direction last month,’’ said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “These data will keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates further, to a sufficiently restrictive stance, in order to get inflation back toward"" the central bank's 2% inflation target.

            This week, the government reported that consumer inflation cooled for a seventh straight month compared with a year earlier. But the report also showed that inflationary pressures underlying the economy were likely to keep prices elevated well into this year. The year-over-year consumer inflation figure for January, 6.4%, remains well above the Fed's 2% annual target.

            Since March of last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate eight times in hopes of slowing the economy enough to conquer high inflation. Inflation has, in fact, eased since hitting a four-decade high in mid-2022. The rate hikes have had the broader economic effect of raising the costs of mortgages and auto loans as well as credit card interest rates.

            Despite higher borrowing costs, the U.S. job market has remained surprisingly strong. Employers added a sizzling 517,000 workers last month — nearly three times what forecasters had expected — and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, lowest since 1969.WASHINGTON (AP) — Wholesale prices in the United States reaccelerated in January, indicating that inflation pressures continue to underlie the U.S. economy despite longer-term signs of improvement.From December to January, the government's producer price index jumped 0.7%, driven up in part by a 5% surge in energy prices. That increase compared with a 0.2% drop from November to December, and it was nearly twice the rise that economists had been expecting.The producer price data reflects prices charged by manufacturers, farmers and wholesalers, and it flows into an inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve closely tracks. It can provide an early sign of how fast consumer inflation will rise.While the monthly inflation surge was worse than expected, price increases measured over the past year continued to show a slowdown: Wholesale prices in January were up 6% from 12 months earlier, compared with a 6.5% year-over-year rise in December and a recent peak of 11.7% in March. It was the seventh straight month of decelerating year-over-year wholesale inflation, though it still came in higher than forecasters had expected.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation was up 5.4% in January from a year earlier and 0.5% from December to January. Food prices, though, fell 1%, the second straight monthly drop. Egg prices, which have been driven up by a wave of avian flu, sank 12.7% from December to January but are still up more than 200% from a year ago.In the energy sector, wholesale gasoline prices were up 6.2% from December, diesel fuel 10.9% and natural gas for homes 12.2%.“While producer prices are off their peaks, inflation is elevated and the monthly change in prices showed a move in the wrong direction last month,’’ said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “These data will keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates further, to a sufficiently restrictive stance, in order to get inflation back toward"" the central bank's 2% inflation target.This week, the government reported that consumer inflation cooled for a seventh straight month compared with a year earlier. But the report also showed that inflationary pressures underlying the economy were likely to keep prices elevated well into this year. The year-over-year consumer inflation figure for January, 6.4%, remains well above the Fed's 2% annual target.Since March of last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate eight times in hopes of slowing the economy enough to conquer high inflation. Inflation has, in fact, eased since hitting a four-decade high in mid-2022. The rate hikes have had the broader economic effect of raising the costs of mortgages and auto loans as well as credit card interest rates.Despite higher borrowing costs, the U.S. job market has remained surprisingly strong.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812582,Kosovo marks 15 uneasy years of independence from Serbia,"PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo is celebrating 15 years of independence with a month of celebrations starting Friday while still facing serious challenges with Serbia, which refuses to recognize the autonomy of its former province. 

            A military parade, ceremonies at monuments to national heroes and a special session of parliament are some of the anniversary events planned in the capital, Pristina.

            Europe's youngest country unilaterally declared independence from Serbia on Feb. 17, 2008, nearly nine years after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign in 1999 ended Belgrade's bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists. The International Court of Justice ruled in 2010 that the declaration did not violate international law.











            The United States and most Western powers are among the 117 countries that have recognized Kosovo's statehood, and about 200 international organizations have allowed Kosovo to join, although not the United Nations. A number of European nations, including Bosnia, Cyprus, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Spain, Slovakia and Ukraine, do not acknowledge the Republic of Kosovo. 

            Serbia, which for centuries considered Kosovo the cradle of its civilization, still sees it as part of its own territory. Russia and China have continuously backed Serbia's position, as have Algeria, Morocco, Belarus, South Africa, Iran and other nations that do not want to get drawn into the dispute. 

            While the European Union has mediated negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo since 2011, few of the 33 signed agreements were implemented. Both the EU and the United States have pressed for a faster reconciliation since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago, fearing another conflict in the Balkans. 

            U.S. and EU envoys visited Pristina and Belgrade regularly in recent months to encourage them to accept a new proposal for normalizing relations. The proposal’s details have not yet been made public. 

            U.S. Ambassador to Kosovo Jeffrey M. Hovenier told The Associated Press the proposal was “an interim step, that ... would regularize relations in very meaningful ways and be of enormous benefit both to Kosovo and Serbia.”

            Washington also has increased pressure on Kosovo's government to implement a 2013 agreement to establish an Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities in ethnic-Serb dominated northern Kosovo. In 2015, Kosovo’s Constitutional Court declared part of the agreement unconstitutional on the grounds it excluded other ethnic groups and could entail the use of executive powers.

            According to the 2013 plan, the association would coordinate work on education, health care, land planning and economic development at the local level. Kosovo's government fears the group would eventually undermine the country’s statehood with the help of Belgrade and turn northern Kosovo into another Republika Srpska, a largely self-governing Serbia-dominated entity in Bosnia.

            Pristina accuses Belgrade of exploiting the ethnic Serb minority, which it says represents just 7% of the 1.8 million population, to raise bilateral tensions. Ethnic Serbs have 10 seats in the 120-seat parliament and a government Cabinet post. More than 90% of Kosovo's population is ethnic Albanian.

            Kosovo's prime minister, Albin Kurti, said he was hopeful the new EU-led plan would bring Serbia and Kosovo to the final stage of mutual recognition.

            ""If we normalize relations with Serbia this year, that will be a great thing, not only for Kosovo, but I would say particularly for Serbia,” Kurti said.

            Tensions between Pristina and Belgrade remain tense. Late last year, Serbia asked the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo to send 1,000 of its troops to protect ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo. Members of the community had raised 16 barricades blocking roads in the north following the arrest of a police officer. The request was not approved. 

            Lars-Gunnar Wigemark, head of the EU’s rule of law mission in Kosovo, called December incident a “very tense standoff with barricades” and “the most serious crisis facing Kosovo … for the past decade.”

            The EU has told both Kosovo and Serbia that establishing productive ties is a precondition to their joining the bloc. Kosovo applied to become a candidate for EU membership, while Serbia has sought for years to make progress in its membership talks with Brussels. 

            In Serbia, pro-Russia right-wing groups have demanded that Belgrade stop all normalization negotiations with Kosovo. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has said that would isolate his country internationally and mean the end of Serbia’s integration into the EU. Vucic has said he was ready to consider the latest Western plan.

            Along with ongoing economic problems and needing to meet EU conditions for governance reforms, Kosovo, which is one of Europe's poorest countries, is still grappling with the legacy of the late 1990s war with Serbia. 

            Former President Hashim Thaci and four other wartime heroes from the Kosovo Liberation Army were arrested in November 2020 and transferred to the detention center of a tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, to face charges of murder, torture and persecution. All have denied the charges.

            The special court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the actions of the KLA during and after the war in Kosovo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812584,Group: Tesla workers fired after union push at NY plant,"Several employees at a Tesla factory in New York have been fired a day after launching union organizing efforts, according to Tesla Workers United, but the company says they're not related.

            The workers at the Buffalo plant received an email Wednesday evening updating them on a new policy that prohibits them from recording workplace meetings without all participants’ permission, Tesla Workers United said Thursday. The group, which is behind the union movement, said that such restrictions violate federal labor law and flouts New York’s one-party consent law to record conversations.

            “We’re angry. This won’t slow us down. This won’t stop us,” Sara Costantino, a current Tesla employee and organizing committee member, said in a prepared statement. “They want us to be scared, but I think they just started a stampede. We can do this. But I believe we will do this.”











            In a statement, Tesla said the terminations were the result of poor ratings on performance reviews that were conducted before the union campaign was announced. The list of employees being dismissed was finalized Feb. 3, and Tesla became aware of organizing activities Feb. 13, the company said.

            “We learned in hindsight that one out of the 27 impacted employees officially identified as part of the union campaign,” Tesla said. “This exercise pre-dated any union campaign.”

            TWU said that the firings were unacceptable and that the expectations placed on Tesla workers are “unfair, unattainable, ambiguous and ever changing.” The Tesla plant, which makes solar panels and other renewable energy technology, is not far from a Starbucks location where workers voted to unionize last year. 

            “I feel blindsided, I got COVID and was out of the office, then I had to take a bereavement leave. I returned to work, was told I was exceeding expectations and then Wednesday came along,” organizing committee member Arian Berek, who is one of the fired employees, said in a statement. “I strongly feel this is in retaliation to the committee announcement, and it’s shameful.” 

            The Rochester Regional Joint Board of Workers United has filed a complaint against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the electric vehicle maker of unfair labor practices. 

            In the complaint, the group lists the names of several employees who were part of the factory's autopilot department that were fired. The group says that it believes Tesla “terminated these individuals in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity.” It is asking the NLRB for injunctive relief “to prevent irreparable destruction of employee rights resulting from Tesla’s unlawful conduct.” 

            On Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said without specifically referring to the situation at the Tesla plant in Buffalo that, ""the president supports fundamental rights for workers under the National Labor Relations Act, including the right to organize free from intimidation or coercion.”

            As part of union organizing efforts, the Tesla Workers United organizing committee said in a letter to management Tuesday that employees are seeking a voice on the job at the plant in Buffalo and want to “build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company.”

            Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a hard line against organized labor, despite an invitation to the United Auto Workers union to hold an organizing vote at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California. In 2021 Tesla was ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to make Musk delete a 2018 tweet in which it said that he unlawfully threatened employees with loss of stock options if they chose to be represented by the UAW.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812585,Weekly jobless applications fall again despite Fed rate push,"Fewer Americans filed for jobless benefits last week despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to loosen the labor market with higher interest rates as it tries to cool the economy.

            Applications for jobless aid in the U.S. for the week ending Feb. 11 fell by 1,000 last week to 194,000, from 195,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It’s the fifth straight week claims were under 200,000.

            Jobless claims generally represent the number of U.S. layoffs.











            The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out some of the weekly ups and downs, rose by 500 to 189,500. It’s the fourth straight week that the four-week moving average has been below 200,000.

            Earlier this month, the Fed raised its main lending rate by 25 basis points, its eighth rate hike in less than a year. The central bank’s benchmark rate is now in a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. Chair Jerome Powell appeared to suggest that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes.

            So far, the Fed’s hawkish interest rate policy has tempered inflation, but has had less impact on a resilient U.S. job market.

            Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers added a better-than-expected 517,000 jobs in January and that the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, the lowest level since 1969. Analysts were expecting job gains of around 185,000.

            Job openings rose to 11 million in December, up from 10.44 million in November and the highest since July. For 18 straight months, employers have posted at least 10 million openings — a level never reached before 2021 in Labor Department data going back to 2000. In December, there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.

            Though the U.S. labor market remains robust, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, where many companies overhired after a pandemic boom. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook parent Meta, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs in recent months.

            The Fed’s interest rate hikes have hit the real estate sector the hardest, largely due to higher mortgage rates — currently above 6% — that have slowed home sales for 11 straight month s. That’s almost step-in-step with the Fed’s rate hikes that began last March.

            About 1.7 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended Feb. 4, an increase of 16,000 from the week before.Fewer Americans filed for jobless benefits last week despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to loosen the labor market with higher interest rates as it tries to cool the economy.Applications for jobless aid in the U.S. for the week ending Feb. 11 fell by 1,000 last week to 194,000, from 195,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812586,Doctor says Biden's 'vigorous' as he readies for 2024 run,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite testing positive twice last year for the coronavirus, President Joe Biden has no long-term symptoms and has been declared “healthy, vigorous” and “fit” to handle his White House responsibilities, according to a routine medical checkup performed Thursday.

            The findings were contained in a memo by Biden's doctor, summarizing the exams conducted during a three-hour stay at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. 

            The conclusions reached by Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the president's personal physician since 2009, are likely to be highly scrutinized as the oldest president in history makes plans for an expected reelection campaign. 











            O'Connor concluded in a five-page memo that Biden “remains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency."" But the doctor did not speculate about where Biden's health might be at age 86, when a second term might end.

            The president had a lesion removed from his chest that is undergoing a traditional biopsy. But Thursday's results largely matched the findings after the president's last exam in November 2021, which said his coughing was due to acid reflux and his stiffened gait was the result of spinal arthritis, a previously broken foot and neuropathy in his feet.

            The memo generally labeled Biden's health as “stable"" compared to his last exam, though it noted that his calves and hamstrings had possibly tightened.

            Biden tested positive in July for COVID-19 and experienced “very mild symptoms,” according to the White House. He also had a rebound infection and ultimately tested negative on Aug. 6 of last year. The president continued to work even as he isolated himself in the White House.

            “Well, everything really went well,"" Biden told NBC News on Thursday about the exam ahead of the memo's release.

            Many people, including Democrats, have expressed reservations about Biden seeking a second term in 2024. Only 37% of Democrats say Biden should pursue reelection, down from 52% before last November's elections, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Overall, 22% of U.S. adults said he ought to run again.

            Follow-up interviews with people in the survey indicated that Biden's age was a major concern. They took note of his coughing, a greater sense of fragility in his walking and moments when he misspoke.

            Biden had a colonoscopy in 2021, in which a 3-millimeter “benign-appearing polyp” was identified and removed. He did not undergo a colonoscopy during Thursday's checkup.

            Asked in a recent PBS interview about his age and ability to be president, Biden responded with what has become his stock line: “Watch me. It's all I can say.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite testing positive twice last year for the coronavirus, President Joe Biden has no long-term symptoms and has been declared “healthy, vigorous” and “fit” to handle his White House responsibilities, according to a routine medical checkup performed Thursday.The findings were contained in a memo by Biden's doctor, summarizing the exams conducted during a three-hour stay at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.The conclusions reached by Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the president's personal physician since 2009, are likely to be highly scrutinized as the oldest president in history makes plans for an expected reelection campaign.O'Connor concluded in a five-page memo that Biden “remains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""

            The arrested men, some with alleged links to Russia’s private military Wagner Group, took part in a protest on Wednesday evening of far-right, pro-Russian groups demanding that populist President Aleksandar Vucic rejects a Western plan on normalizing ties with Serbia’s breakaway Kosovo province.

            The protesters gathered in front of the presidency building in downtown Belgrade, carrying banners that read “Kosovo is the heart of Serbia,” “No surrender,” and “Betrayal of Kosovo is betrayal of Russia!”











            They blocked traffic and at one point tore down a metal fence in front of the presidency shouting: “Where is Vucic?” Some hurled eggs at the building.

            Serbian officials were quick to denounce the protest, claiming it was an attempted coup against the president and the government.

            The Interior Ministry said Thursday that the five men were arrested on suspicion of calling “for the violent overthrow of the Government and the President of Serbia, as well as the possession of weapons and explosive materials.”

            Vucic late Wednesday accused the protesters of being anti-Serbian and receiving funding and support from “a foreign country,” apparently referring to Russia.

            “Do you really think it’s possible, you think there won’t be an answer to that? The state will react very efficiently, very quickly, very seriously and very responsibly,” he said.

            The Russian ambassador to Serbia, Aleksandr Botsan-Kharchenko, reacted tweeting that “Russia is determined to continue all-round cooperation with friendly Serbia and does not interfere in Serbia’s internal affairs.”

            “We strongly condemn the threats sent from the gathering that took place last night near the Presidency of Serbia,” he added.

            The protest come amid efforts by U.S. and European Union officials to mediate a solution for the long-standing dispute between Serbia and Kosovo, a former Serbian province whose 2008 declaration of independence Belgrade does not recognize.

            Serbia has relied on its traditional Slavic ally Russia, as well as China, in its refusal to acknowledge Kosovo’s independence, which is backed by Washington and most EU countries. Western officials fear Russia could use simmering tensions in Kosovo to try to destabilize the Balkans and avert some attention from the invasion of Ukraine.

            Vucic has said he is ready to consider the Western plan. Its provisions have not been published but it reportedly stipulates that Serbia would not object to Kosovo’s membership in international institutions, including the United Nations, while Serbia would get a faster track toward the EU membership.BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia’s police on Thursday arrested five people on suspicion of calling for the violent overthrow of the Balkan country’s president during a protest a day earlier, and of arms possession.The arrested men, some with alleged links to Russia’s private military Wagner Group, took part in a protest on Wednesday evening of far-right, pro-Russian groups demanding that populist President Aleksandar Vucic rejects a Western plan on normalizing ties with Serbia’s breakaway Kosovo province.The protesters gathered in front of the presidency building in downtown Belgrade, carrying banners that read “Kosovo is the heart of Serbia,” “No surrender,” and “Betrayal of Kosovo is betrayal of Russia!”They blocked traffic and at one point tore down a metal fence in front of the presidency shouting: “Where is Vucic?” Some hurled eggs at the building.Serbian officials were quick to denounce the protest, claiming it was an attempted coup against the president and the government.The Interior Ministry said Thursday that the five men were arrested on suspicion of calling “for the violent overthrow of the Government and the President of Serbia, as well as the possession of weapons and explosive materials.”Vucic late Wednesday accused the protesters of being anti-Serbian and receiving funding and support from “a foreign country,” apparently referring to Russia.“Do you really think it’s possible, you think there won’t be an answer to that?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812589,"Albanian opposition disrupts parliament, supporters rally","TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albanian opposition supporters protested anew outside the country's Parliament Thursday as lawmakers demanding the government’s resignation for alleged corruption tried to disrupt the house's session, blowing whistles and crowding the podium.

            In their third protest in a week, hundreds of people — including a man who arrived on horseback from a northern area — gathered outside Parliament's main entrance and some threw smoke bombs at police guarding the building. But the turnout and intensity of the crowd was smaller than during a similar protest on Monday. 

            No arrests or injuries were reported, and protesters left after two hours while opposition lawmakers inside continued to disrupt the session.











            The protests are being organized by the center-right Democratic Party of former president and prime minister Sali Berisha, and the left-wing Freedom Party of former president Ilir Meta.

            The opposition accuses Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama and his Cabinet of corruption, links to organized crime and poor economic policies, and blames Rama for the exodus of young Albanians seeking jobs in Western European countries.

            The government denies that. It argues that it has kept inflation low compared to elsewhere in Europe, and has subsidized electricity bills for families and small businesses.

            The opposition set March 3 as a day of a national protest.

            The same day an appeals court will decide who should lead the main opposition Democrats — Berisha or his predecessor Lulzim Basha.

            The party has been plagued by infighting after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in 2021 barred Berisha and his close relatives from entering the U.S. for “corrupt acts that undermined democracy” during his 2005-2013 tenure as prime minister.

            
                Britain did the same last year.

            The governing Socialists on Thursday accepted an opposition request for a debate with Rama, who the opposition claims corrupted Charles McGonigal, a former high-ranking FBI counterintelligence official. McGonigal is accused in the United States of hiding from the FBI key details of a 2017 trip he took to Albania with a former Albanian intelligence official who is alleged to have given him at least $225,000.

            McGonigal met with Albania’s prime minister several times and urged caution in awarding oil field drilling licenses in the country to Russian front companies.

            Rama has acknowledged meeting with McGonigal but denied allegations of giving him money or preferential treatment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812602,"Spain approves menstrual leave, teen abortion and trans laws","MADRID (AP) — The Spanish parliament on Thursday approved legislation expanding abortion and transgender rights for teenagers, while making Spain the first country in Europe that will entitle workers to paid menstrual leave.

            The driving force behind the two laws was Equality Minister Irene Montero, who belongs to the junior member in Spain’s left-wing coalition government, the “United We Can” Party.

            The changes to sexual and reproductive rights mean that 16- and 17-year-olds in Spain can now undergo an abortion without parental consent. Period products will now be offered free in schools and prisons, while state-run health centers will do the same with hormonal contraceptives and the morning after pill. The menstrual leave measure allows workers suffering debilitating period pain to take paid time off.











            In addition, the changes enshrine in law the right to have an abortion in a state hospital. Currently more than 80% of termination procedures in Spain are carried out in private clinics due to a high number of doctors in the public system who refuse to perform them — with many citing religious reasons.

            Under the new system, state hospital doctors won’t be forced to carry out abortions, provided they’ve already registered their objections in writing.

            The abortion law builds on legislation passed in 2010 that represented a major shift for a traditionally Catholic country, transforming Spain into one of the most progressive countries in Europe on reproductive rights. Spain’s constitutional court last week rejected a challenge by the right-wing Popular Party against allowing abortions in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.

            A separate package of reforms also approved by lawmakers on Thursday strengthened transgender rights, including allowing any citizen over 16 years old to change their legally registered gender without medical supervision.

            Minors between 12-13 years old will need a judge’s authorization to change, while those between 14 and 16 must be accompanied by their parents or legal guardians.

            Previously, transgender people needed a diagnosis by several doctors of gender dysphoria. The second law also bans so-called “conversion therapy"" for LGBTQ people and provides state support for lesbians and single women seeking IVF treatment.

            The center-left coalition government is currently under fire for another of Montero’s star projects, a new sexual consent law that was intended to increase protection against rape but has inadvertently allowed hundreds of sex offenders to have prison sentences reduced.

            The “Only Yes Means Yes” Law makes verbal consent the key component in cases of alleged sexual assault. The government is now struggling to come up with an amended version and end the controversy ahead of elections later this year.

            The three initiatives have met strong opposition from the right-wing parties that form Spain’s main opposition bloc.MADRID (AP) — The Spanish parliament on Thursday approved legislation expanding abortion and transgender rights for teenagers, while making Spain the first country in Europe that will entitle workers to paid menstrual leave.The driving force behind the two laws was Equality Minister Irene Montero, who belongs to the junior member in Spain’s left-wing coalition government, the “United We Can” Party.The changes to sexual and reproductive rights mean that 16- and 17-year-olds in Spain can now undergo an abortion without parental consent.

(""First Phosphate"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce the commencement of the Company's exploration drilling program at its Bégin-Lamarche phosphate property in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean Region of Québec, Canada.   Highlights:         4,000 metre diamond drilling program within high grade phosphate layers.           Testing assays of high grade surface phosphate coinciding with a well-defined magnetic structure.     The drilling program will consist of a total of 4,000 metres of drill holes to test the continuity of high grade phosphate-bearing nelsonites that were found on surface as described in the Company's press release dated January 24, 2023 and available at:  https://firstphosphate.com/news.   ""After obtaining results from field samples, geological reconnaissance, and a high resolution magnetic survey completed during the second half of 2022, we are excited to initiate drilling at our Bégin-Lamarche property,"" said First Phosphate President, Peter Kent. ""High grade phosphate assays in nelsonites coupled with a well-defined magnetic structure offer the potential for discovery of a large scale phosphate mineralisation area.""   Phosphate-bearing rock layers in anorthosite are easily identified through magnetic surveying as the phosphate is associated with magnetite. The heli-borne magnetic survey completed in 2022 revealed a strong and continuous high magnetic structure that coincides with multiple grab samples that assayed over 10% P2O5. The characteristic high-magnetic signature of the type of deposit identified at the Bégin-Lamarche will be drill tested.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812613,"China sanctions Lockheed Martin, Raytheon over Taiwan sales","China imposed trade and investment sanctions on Lockheed Martin and a unit of Raytheon on Thursday, saying the step was because of them supplying weapons to Taiwan.Beijing has been stepping up efforts to isolate the island democracy that it claims as part of Chinese territory.China's bilateral ties with the US have also been strained of late amid the shooting down of several balloons which the US says are conducting espionage operations.Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Missiles and Defense, part of the broader Raytheon Technologies Corp., were added to the ""unreliable entry"" list of companies whose activities are restricted because they might endanger national sovereignty, security or development interests.China's Ministry of Commerce announced the sanctions and said that there would be five main areas of impact:It's not clear quite how large an impact these restrictions will have on the two companies in practice.The US bars the sale of most weapons-related technologies to China, meaning their core operations should not be affected very much. But some military contractors also have civilian businesses, in sectors like aerospace and other markets, that are subject to fewer restrictions.The US has no formal ties with Taiwan, as it adheres to the ""one China"" principle that Beijing demands of all its trade partners, namely that they do not recognize Taiwan officially as a country.However, the US treads a fine line on this distinction, simultaneously maintaining its position as Taiwan's main international commercial  partner and military supplier.Washington has been Taiwan's most important partner more or less ever since the 1949 civil war between China's Communist Party and the country's previous nationalist rulers, who ultimately fled to Taiwan and established themselves there.A law in the US also obligates the government to ensure Taiwan has the means to defend itself.Raytheon Missiles and Defense was awarded a $412 million (roughly €385 million at today's exchange rate) contract in September to upgrade Taiwanese military radar as part of a broader US investment package of more than $1 billion for Taiwan's military.Lockheed Martin has supplied Taiwan's military with radar, helicopters and air traffic control equipment. It also supplies Taiwan with the F-16 multirole combat jets that are the backbone of its air force, and a delivery of new-build F-16s is currently planned, slated for potential 2026 delivery.China's sanctions come a few weeks after the US blocked export license renewals for telecommunications giant Huawei, citing its pursuit of ""technology hegemony.""And they also coincide with the US having shot down several balloons that is says are part of a Chinese espionage network.On Thursday, the foreign affairs committee of China's National People's Congress responded critically to a US Congress resolution on the balloons, saying the text ""deliberately exaggerated the 'China threat.'""Calling the document ""purely malicious hype and political manipulation,"" it said some US Congress politicians ""fanned the flames, fully exposing their sinister designs to oppose China and contain China.""Taiwan's military, meanwhile, on Thursday said that it had found the remains of a crashed weather balloon on a remote and strategically located island near the Chinese coast, saying it appeared to be of Chinese making. On Tuesday's Taiwan's Defense Ministry had said it had not spotted any surveillance balloons from China in its vicinity.msh/rs (AP, dpa)",2023/02/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812614,Slow progress towards diversity in England women's cricket,"""I spoke to Adil and he said we had Allah with us and I said we had the rub of the green. It actually epitomizes our team, it's full of quite diverse backgrounds and cultures.""When England's men's side won their first-ever One-Day International cricket (ODI) World Cup in 2019, Eoin Morgan, the team's Irish-born captain, used his post-match press conference to highlight the diversity that ran through the highly successful squad.With the South Asian community consisting of just over 4million people (6.9% of the population of England and Wales) and the Afro-Caribbean community 2.4million (4%), it is of little surprise that one of the country's major sports teams reflects society.Yet, it is a largely different story for the women's side despite the national team entering their professional era almost 10 years ago, with players from minority backgrounds struggling to break into the England team.When England Women won their own ODI World Cup on home turf in 2017, in front of a sold-out Lords' crowd, it was hailed at a momentous moment for women's sports in the country. But the team's 15-person squad consisted entirely of white players.The lack of ethnic diversity within the women's international side was not lost on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who made 'South Asian Action Plan' and 'Transforming Women's and Girls' Cricket' two of their six priorities in a game-wide growth strategy to run from 2020-24.For England bowler Freya Davies, the root to seeing the makeup of the national team more accurately reflect the society they represent is planted with engagement in youth cricket.""I understand that the team at the moment doesn't reflect how society looks at a whole,"" Davies told DW. ""That's a reflection more on where the game was 10 years ago.""The ECB have put a lot of effort into improving their engagement with ethnic minorities. With things like the ACE program, they are making cricket so much more accessible to those communities.""That has to start at the grassroots level, you have got to get ethnic minorities involved at a young age, knowing that cricket is an option for girls.""When I was growing up [cricket as a career] just wasn't an option and for so many girls in this team, if you didn't have an older brother, you didn't play cricket.""The African-Caribbean Engagement Programme Charity (ACE) Davies spoke of was the brainchild of former England player turned TV pundit, Ebony Rainford-Brent, founded in January 2020 to engage with that specific community.The former-bowler felt compelled to open an avenue to the game at the time when a survey showed a 75% decline in the number of black British professional cricketers across the men's game.As the first black woman to play for England, Rainford-Brent was equally aware of the limitations for young girls in accessing pathways into cricket outside of playing for boys teams.Beginning in London, ACE's aim was to offer scholars appropriate opportunities and access often lacking to those from lower socio-economic backgrounds.Having spread across the country in the three years since its launch, the charity has helped plenty of youngsters, but only 33% of those participating in the community hubs are female.Yet, Davies has noticed a perceptible change in the young girls turning up to watch the women's national team, in part down to the targeted exposure ethnic minorities are gaining at youth level.""There is definitely a shift,"" she explained. ""There are so many more girls from diverse backgrounds coming to watch our games, who want to emulate us and be part of the team.""""I think it may take a few years still to be realized but we will see that real shift in what the national team will look like and that's only good for the game.""The ECB's investment in various Girls' CAG programmes has continued to offer small but positive results too, with data showing that in 2022, 14% of participants are from ethnically diverse backgrounds, compared to 10% in 2021.But, although 27-year-old Davies noted that she was hopeful to see the national team become more diverse during her career, she was realistic that it is a change that remians a long-term project.Of the current 15-player squad participating at the T20 World Cup in South Africa, only Sophia Dunkley comes from a ethnic minority, while Dunkley and Izzy Wong were the only two players from an ethnically diverse background of the 18 awarded one-year central contracts by the ECB in November 2022.While the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations' (FICA) most recent women's professional cricket global employment report stated that England had the ""most established women's cricket structure"" the path towards diversity through the youth pathways and the national setup is still long and uncertain.Edited by: Matt Pearson",2023/02/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812615,Anti-poverty campaigners rage as energy giants rake in cash,"LONDON (AP) — Anti-poverty campaigners fumed Thursday after the parent of Britain’s biggest home energy supplier said earnings more than tripled last year as consumers struggled to pay soaring utility bills.

            British Gas owner Centrica followed Shell and BP as the latest U.K.-based energy company to rake in massive profits after oil and natural gas prices surged as the result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That sparked renewed calls from the opposition Labour Party for an expanded tax on those companies' windfall profits.

            Centrica said adjusted operating profit jumped to 3.3 billion pounds ($4 billion) in 2022 from 948 million pounds the previous year. That was good news for shareholders, with the company announcing plans to boost an existing share buyback program by 300 million pounds and pay dividends totaling 59 million pounds, compared with nothing in 2021. 











            The earnings came just two weeks after an investigation by the Times of London found that a debt collection company working for British Gas had broken into the homes of some people who were unable to pay their bills this winter and installed meters that require customers to pay for energy in advance. 

            Centrica officials apologized, said they were unaware of the contractor’s behavior and suspended the practice.

            “The profits of this firm are built on the backs of older people, young families and the disabled suffering in cold, damp homes this winter,’’ said Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition.

            Centrica is both a wholesale energy producer and a retail supplier.

            The company said most of its earnings came from energy trading and marketing, as well as its nuclear power operations. By contrast, operating profit at the retail British Gas Energy unit fell 39%, to 72 million pounds.

            British Gas is the U.K.’s biggest residential energy supplier, with more than 7.5 million customers across the country.

            Centrica said it was “acting responsibly through the energy crisis,” providing 50 million pounds of support for customers and pledging to donate 10% of British Gas profits to help protect vulnerable customers.

            “Therefore, we were extremely disappointed by the allegations surrounding one of our third-party contractors and their approach to pre-payment customers,” Centrica said. “We immediately took action to address this and are completing a thorough independent investigation.”

            Britain has been hard hit by the high cost of natural gas because limited storage capacity left energy suppliers at the mercy of international markets as prices soared.

            That contributed to double-digit inflation that has fueled a wave of public-sector strikes, soaring food bank use and the biggest drop in living standards since records began in the 1950s.

            The government tried to ease the pain with subsidies designed to limit average household energy costs to no more than 2,500 pounds a year, a figure that will rise to 3,000 pounds on April 1. Even with that protection, the average household bill has almost doubled in the past year.

            Centrica acknowledged that more needs to be done to protect customers.

            “We believe a fundamental review of energy regulation is required to ensure the system is ready for the energy transition, works for consumers and allows well-run suppliers to make an appropriate return to compensate for the risks taken,” the company said.

            Britain’s Conservative-led government last year imposed an additional 25% tax on the profits that oil and gas producers make from their U.K. operations. The tax increased to 35% on Jan. 1. 

            On top of that, the government approved a 45% tax on the “exceptional” profits of wholesale electricity producers that took effect this year.

            The Labour Party called on the government to immediately expand the windfall tax on oil and gas producers to provide more help for consumers. The party has criticized the government for allowing energy companies to reduce their tax payments with investments in the U.K.

            “In a matter of weeks, another spike in energy prices will hit families,” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s spokesperson on Treasury issues, tweeted after Centrica’s earnings. “The government must bring in a proper windfall tax on oil & gas giants to stop energy prices rising in April.”LONDON (AP) — Anti-poverty campaigners fumed Thursday after the parent of Britain’s biggest home energy supplier said earnings more than tripled last year as consumers struggled to pay soaring utility bills.British Gas owner Centrica followed Shell and BP as the latest U.K.-based energy company to rake in massive profits after oil and natural gas prices surged as the result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812616,"Domínguez and Phillies agree to $7.25M, 2-year contract","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Right-handed reliever Seranthony Domínguez and the Philadelphia Phillies agreed to a $7.25 million, two-year contract on Thursday that avoided salary arbitration.

            Dominguez gets $2.5 million this season and $4.25 million next year. The deal includes an $8 million team option for 2025 with a $500,000 buyout.

            He had asked for a raise from $727,500 to $2.9 million when the sides swapped proposed arbitration salaries last month and the Phillies submitted $2.1 million 











            Domínguez had Tommy John surgery on July 30, 2020, and returned to a major league mound on the final day of the 2021 season.

            The 28-year-old was 6-5 with a 3.00 and nine saves in career-high 54 relief appearances last year and held opponents to a .197 batting average. He was 2-0 with a 1.69 ERA in nine postseason appearances for the NL champions, getting wins in the Division Series opener against Atlanta and the World Series opener against Houston.

            A native of the Dominican Republic, Domínguez is 11-10 with 25 saves, a 3.14 ERA and 165 strikeouts in 135 games since beginning his big league career with the Phillies in 2018. 

            Dominguez would earn a $100,000 bonus for World Series MVP or winning the Mariano Rivera/Trevor Hoffman reliever of the year award, and $50,000 for finishing second or third for the Rivera/Hoffman award.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812617,Sturgeon’s exit leaves Scottish independence path unclear,"LONDON (AP) — Scotland’s independence movement needs a new leader — and a new plan.

            With the resignation of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the decades-long campaign by Scottish nationalists to secede from the United Kingdom is losing its star politician and strongest communicator, at a time when efforts to hold a new vote on independence are at an impasse.

            The Times of London said Thursday that Sturgeon’s departure was a “huge boost to unionism,” and a “generational setback” to the independence cause. Financial Times columnist Robert Shrimsley said simply: “Nicola Sturgeon ran out of road.”











            
                Sturgeon took the U.K. by surprise when she announced her resignation on Wednesday after eight years in office, saying she knew “in my head and in my heart” it was time to leave.

            She will remain first minister for several more weeks while the Scottish National Party picks a new leader, a job for which there is no clear favorite. Potential successors include Angus Robertson, a Sturgeon ally who serves as Scotland’s constitution secretary, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Health Secretary Humza Yousaf. But none of the contenders has Sturgeon’s profile or proven political skills.

            Voting for the new party leader will open March 12 and close March 27.

            Whoever wins will have to find a way to break the independence logjam. Scottish voters opted by 55% to 45% to remain in the U.K. in a 2014 referendum that was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision.

            Sturgeon took power in the wake of that defeat and tried to forge a path to a second vote. Brexit looked like it might give her a chance: The U.K. as a whole backed leaving the European Union in a 2016 referendum, but voters in Scotland strongly favored remaining. Sturgeon argued that Brexit had made a new referendum essential because it had dragged Scotland out of the European Union against its will.

            But a binding referendum needs agreement from the U.K. government, and the Conservative administration in London has refused to grant one.

            Sturgeon ruled out emulating Catalan separatists in Spain and holding an unauthorized vote, a decision that struck some independence supporters as too cautious.

            Instead she unsuccessfully challenged the British government at the Supreme Court for the right to hold a new referendum. Then she said she would use the next U.K. national election, due by 2024, as “de facto” plebiscite on independence — though it was unclear exactly how that would work.

            The SNP on Thursday postponed a special conference on its independence strategy that had been set for March 19, 

            Recent polls suggest Scots are about evenly split on the issue of independence. John Kampfner of think tank Chatham House said that with Sturgeon gone it’s possible “some of the air has gone out of the bubble” of the independence movement. 

            He said that momentum could weaken even more if the opposition Labour Party wins the next U.K. election, due by 2024, as polls currently suggest it will. He said Labour leader Keir Starmer is a more appealing figure to many Scots than “very English, divisive and right-wing” former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sturgeon’s long-time antagonist.

            Sturgeon exits without fulfilling her dream of leading Scotland to independence, but leaves a large, and contested, legacy. Scotland’s first female leader refashioned the SNP from a largely one-issue party into a dominant governing force with liberal social positions. Her departure brought praise from Nancy Pelosi — who hailed her “strong, values-driven leadership” — and a jibe from Donald Trump, who bid “Good riddance to failed woke extremist Nicola Sturgeon of Scotland!”

            Admirers praised her calm, measured public communications during the coronavirus pandemic — a contrast to Johnson’s erratic bluster.

            But Sturgeon’s plan to make it easier for people in Scotland to legally change their gender caused a storm inside the party that may have hastened her decision to leave.

            Scotland's gender recognition bill would allow people aged 16 or older to change the gender designations on identity documents by self-declaration, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.

            Hailed as a landmark by transgender rights activists, the legislation faced opposition from some SNP members who said it ignored the need to protect single-sex spaces for women, such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers. 

            What to do about the bill — which has been passed by the Scottish parliament but blocked by the U.K. government — will be another challenge for Sturgeon’s successor. Some in the party strongly support it, while others see it as a distraction from the party’s main goal: independence.

            Some have already left to join Alba, the rival party formed in 2021 by former First Minister Alex Salmond, Sturgeon’s now-estranged friend and mentor.

            John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said “the $64,000 question is” whether the party can find a leader with ”the public impact and rhetorical skill"" of Salmond and Sturgeon.

            “The SNP needs more than just a competent first minister. It needs a campaigning politician who can move the dial on the independence debate. That’s the big question mark,"" he told Times Radio.LONDON (AP) — Scotland’s independence movement needs a new leader — and a new plan.With the resignation of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the decades-long campaign by Scottish nationalists to secede from the United Kingdom is losing its star politician and strongest communicator, at a time when efforts to hold a new vote on independence are at an impasse.The Times of London said Thursday that Sturgeon’s departure was a “huge boost to unionism,” and a “generational setback” to the independence cause.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812619,UN: Nigerians hit by extremist violence need $1.3 billion,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least 6 million Nigerians affected by the extremist insurgency in northeastern Nigeria need $1.3 billion in aid this year, according to the U.N. office in Nigeria.

            The 2023 U.N. humanitarian response plan launched on Thursday noted the need for “critical life-saving assistance” as a result of more than 12 years of extremist violence that has killed an estimated 35,000 people and displaced at least 2 million in the region.

            “An estimated 2.4 million people are in acute need and require urgent support,” said Matthias Schmale, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Nigeria. “The large-scale humanitarian and protection crisis shows no sign of abating.” 











            Over 80% of those in need in northeastern Nigeria are women and children, according to the U.N.

            “The ticking time bomb of child malnutrition is escalating in Nigeria’s northeast, with the number of children suffering from acute malnutrition projected to increase to 2 million in 2023,” it said.

            The appeal for aid for those hungry and displaced comes just as Africa's most populous country, with 214 million people, readies for its presidential election on Feb. 25. The humanitarian crisis could further squeeze many in Nigeria, which has an unemployment rate of 33% and 63% of the people are in poverty.

            Boko Haram, Nigeria’s homegrown Islamic extremist rebels, launched an insurgency in 2009 to fight against western education and to establish Islamic Shariah law in the country's northeast.

            Their rebellion has spread over the years to the neighboring West African countries of Cameroon, Niger and Chad. A breakaway faction of the group, known as the Islamic State West Africa Province, has risen to prominence, dominating the Lake Chad region where they often target security force convoys and outposts.

            Some humanitarian needs of affected people are “deepening and increasing,” particularly those related to food insecurity and malnutrition, the U.N. said, citing the situation in Bama, Borno state where at least 4,000 people could die, starve or face acute malnutrition if donors and authorities do not act quickly.ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least 6 million Nigerians affected by the extremist insurgency in northeastern Nigeria need $1.3 billion in aid this year, according to the U.N. office in Nigeria.The 2023 U.N. humanitarian response plan launched on Thursday noted the need for “critical life-saving assistance” as a result of more than 12 years of extremist violence that has killed an estimated 35,000 people and displaced at least 2 million in the region.“An estimated 2.4 million people are in acute need and require urgent support,” said Matthias Schmale, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Nigeria. “The large-scale humanitarian and protection crisis shows no sign of abating.”Over 80% of those in need in northeastern Nigeria are women and children, according to the U.N.“The ticking time bomb of child malnutrition is escalating in Nigeria’s northeast, with the number of children suffering from acute malnutrition projected to increase to 2 million in 2023,” it said.The appeal for aid for those hungry and displaced comes just as Africa's most populous country, with 214 million people, readies for its presidential election on Feb. 25.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812620,"Florida plant nursery fire sends flames, smoke into sky","KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) — A massive fire broke out early Thursday at a nursery in central Florida, burning thousands of plastic pots that sent flames and plumes of thick, black smoke into the air.

            The fire broke out about 2 a.m. at Nursery Supplies Inc. in Kissimmee, which is just south of Orlando in central Florida, authorities told news outlets.

            Hazmat teams from Osceola County and nearby Orange County were monitoring the air quality in the area. No evacuations of nearby homes or businesses have been ordered. Nearly 2 acres (0.81 hectares) of pallets holding the two-gallon plastic pots for plants, some stacked as high as 10 feet (3 meters), caught fire. The pallets at the nursery retail outlet were outdoors, and firefighters were trying to protect the outlet's building from the blaze.











            “There are hundreds of those pallets and that’s, that’s the root of the issue,” Osceola County Fire Rescue Deputy Chief Jon Haskett said early Thursday.

            Video footage from Orlando television stations showed flames and plumes of thick, black smoke rising in the air.

            “We’ve slowed the forward progress of that fire,” Haskett said. “But due to the area that it’s consuming, and the product, it’s just given us a lot of challenges.”

            Fire officials didn't immediately know the fire's cause, but an investigation would start once the fire was under control, Haskett said.KISSIMMEE, Fla.

The pallets at the nursery retail outlet were outdoors, and firefighters were trying to protect the outlet's building from the blaze.“There are hundreds of those pallets and that’s, that’s the root of the issue,” Osceola County Fire Rescue Deputy Chief Jon Haskett said early Thursday.Video footage from Orlando television stations showed flames and plumes of thick, black smoke rising in the air.“We’ve slowed the forward progress of that fire,” Haskett said. “But due to the area that it’s consuming, and the product, it’s just given us a lot of challenges.”Fire officials didn't immediately know the fire's cause, but an investigation would start once the fire was under control, Haskett said.",2023/02/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812623,Pope Francis underlines that papacy is a lifetime post,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has made clear in comments published Thursday by a Jesuit journal that he believes being pope is a lifetime position and that Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation was an exception. 

            “I for the moment do not have that on my agenda,"" Francis told Civita Cattolica, in the clearest statement he has made on the issue.

            The pope also said the resignation letter he wrote two months after his elections was precautionary. 











            “I did it in case I had some health problem that would prevent me from exercising my ministry and I am not fully conscious and able to resign,"" the pope told Civita Cattolica. “However, this does not at all mean that resigning popes should become, let’s say, a ‘fashion,’ a normal thing.""

            He added that a papal ministry should be “ad vitam"" — for life — adding “I see no reason why it should not be so."" 

            The pope made the comments during his recent trip to Africa. 

            In previous remarks, Francis has hailed the decision of his predecessor, Pope Benedict, to resign because he felt due to advancing age he wouldn’t be best able to carry out his duties. Benedict died in January, nearly a decade after he resigned the papacy. 

            Francis, 86, had surgery in 2021 to repair a bowel narrowing and has been hobbled by knee pain that for months saw him use a wheelchair.ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has made clear in comments published Thursday by a Jesuit journal that he believes being pope is a lifetime position and that Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation was an exception.“I for the moment do not have that on my agenda,"" Francis told Civita Cattolica, in the clearest statement he has made on the issue.The pope also said the resignation letter he wrote two months after his elections was precautionary.“I did it in case I had some health problem that would prevent me from exercising my ministry and I am not fully conscious and able to resign,"" the pope told Civita Cattolica. “However, this does not at all mean that resigning popes should become, let’s say, a ‘fashion,’ a normal thing.""He added that a papal ministry should be “ad vitam"" — for life — adding “I see no reason why it should not be so.""The pope made the comments during his recent trip to Africa.In previous remarks, Francis has hailed the decision of his predecessor, Pope Benedict, to resign because he felt due to advancing age he wouldn’t be best able to carry out his duties.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812634,Journalist grabbed in Belarus flight diversion goes on trial,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Belarusian court on Thursday opened the trial of a dissident journalist whose arrest nearly two years ago after a forced diversion of his flight to Minsk caused international outrage.

            Raman Pratasevich, who ran popular messaging app channel Nexta, and his girlfriend were detained in May 2021 when their Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in the Belarusian capital due to a reported bomb threat.

            The U.S. and the European Union denounced the flight's diversion as a hijacking and responded by introducing painful sanctions against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's government.











            Pratasevich's messaging app channel was widely used by participants in mass protests in Belarus against the authoritarian Lukashenko’s reelection in August 2020, which the opposition and the West denounced as rigged. Belarusian authorities responded to the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested, thousands beaten by police and dozens of media outlets and nongovernmental organizations shut.

            On Thursday, the Minsk Regional Court opened the trial of Pratasevich, who was put under house arrest after spending a month in jail following his flight's diversion. Pratasevich has appeared willing to cooperate with the authorities, criticizing the opposition in state television interviews under what was widely seen as official pressure.

            His Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was arrested along with him, was sentenced last year to six years in prison on charges of inciting social hatred.

            Pratasevich faces charges alongside two former Nexta colleagues, who are abroad and will be tried in absentia. They are accused of organizing mass unrest and engaging in plots to overthrow the government, among other charges.MOSCOW (AP) — A Belarusian court on Thursday opened the trial of a dissident journalist whose arrest nearly two years ago after a forced diversion of his flight to Minsk caused international outrage.Raman Pratasevich, who ran popular messaging app channel Nexta, and his girlfriend were detained in May 2021 when their Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in the Belarusian capital due to a reported bomb threat.The U.S. and the European Union denounced the flight's diversion as a hijacking and responded by introducing painful sanctions against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's government.Pratasevich's messaging app channel was widely used by participants in mass protests in Belarus against the authoritarian Lukashenko’s reelection in August 2020, which the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812640,Ryan Seacrest to leave 'Live with Kelly and Ryan' in spring,"NEW YORK (AP) — Ryan Seacrest has revealed he's leaving “Live with Kelly and Ryan” this spring, saying he never expected to stay so long and thanking his co-host Kelly Ripa, who he jokingly called his “work wife.”

            Seacrest ends a six-year run alongside Ripa. His replacement will be Ripa's real-life husband, Mark Consuelos, and a frequent guest host. The show will be rebranded as “Live with Kelly and Mark.”

            “I’m going to miss my work wife and all the laughter we share,” Seacrest wrote on Instagram. “When I signed on to host ‘Live’ in 2017 it was meant to be for three years, but I loved the job and working with Kelly so much that I extended my time and last year I made the decision to stay on for one more final season.”











            Seacrest said he'll stay busy shooting the new season of “American Idol,” his radio show on KIIS-FM and hosting “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin' Eve.”

            “Goodbyes are never easy, but we look forward to welcoming Ryan back regularly with open arms. As a fan-favorite guest host for years, Mark is no stranger to the ‘Live’ family. Having him join the show is so special for us and we’re sure that viewers will feel the same,” Michael Gelman, executive producer of “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” said in a statement. 

            “Live with Kelly and Ryan” on ABC is the No. 1 daytime talk show per household and in total viewership. Ripa has hosted “Live” since 2001, first with Regis Philbin and later with Michael Strahan.

            “I’m so grateful to have spent the last six years beside my dear friend of too many decades to count and will miss starting my days with Ryan,” said Ripa in a statement. “Ryan’s energy, passion and love for entertainment is one-of-a-kind.”NEW YORK (AP) — Ryan Seacrest has revealed he's leaving “Live with Kelly and Ryan” this spring, saying he never expected to stay so long and thanking his co-host Kelly Ripa, who he jokingly called his “work wife.”Seacrest ends a six-year run alongside Ripa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812651,Ethiopia church split resolved amid social media suspension,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Leaders of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church have agreed to resolve their differences peacefully after weeks of deadly confrontations between rival followers of the synod and security forces that have left at least 10 people dead. 

            The church, whose followers form a majority of Ethiopia’s more than 110 million population, had split after members in Oromia declared a new synod on Jan. 22 and expressed a need to exercise their faith in local languages. The church excommunicated several officials who participated in the split. 

            The newly signed agreement allows the use of the Afan Oromo language in churches located in the Oromia region and in other languages across other regions and states that “for this to happen, more budget and manpower will be allocated.” 











            At least 10 people have died and hundreds others arrested during unrest in some parts of the capital, Addis Ababa, and in Oromia, the country’s largest region. 

            An agreement was also reached to secure the release of those who were arrested, church officials said. 

            Elders including Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and retired athlete Haile Gebrselassie were involved in mediating between the two sides, the state-owned Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation reported. 

            Abiy had previously urged church members to resolve their differences and stated that the government would not get involved. He, an ethnic Oromo and a Protestant Christian, was however accused by some followers of undermining the church and siding with the breakaway synod. 

            The widespread tension had resulted in the suspension of access to social media platforms including TikTok, Facebook and Telegram since Feb. 9. The apps remain offline although many Ethiopians are using them through Virtual Private Networks. No official statement was made when internet access to social media was suspended and there has been no word yet on when it will be back. 

            Social media was being used to mobilize people to attend a rally planned by the church to take place on Sunday and which the government had issued a warning against.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812652,Michigan State University gunman's note had possible motive,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The man who shot eight students at Michigan State University, killing three, was found with two handguns and a note containing a possible motive for the attack, police said Thursday. 

            The 9 mm guns, dozens of rounds of ammunition and the two-page note were found with Anthony McRae when he killed himself Monday night after being confronted by police, said campus deputy chief Chris Rozman. 

            Investigators said they still were trying to pin down a motive, three days after the violence at the 50,000-student campus in East Lansing, but the note was a key point.











            “It appears based on the content of the note that he felt he was slighted in some way by people or businesses,” Rozman said at a news conference. “Did a mental health issue amplify that or was it a component of that? We're not sure at this point. We’re working our best to try to determine that as best as possible.""

            McRae, 43, was the lone shooter and had no connection to the victims or to Michigan State as a student or employee, police said.

            Rozman described the investigation as “massively complex.”

            The shootings happened Monday during evening classes at Berkey Hall and nearby at the MSU Union, a social hub where students can study, eat and relax. Students across the vast campus were ordered to shelter in place for four hours — “run, hide, fight” if necessary — while police hunted for the gunman. Some residence halls were a mile away from the shooting scenes.

            Students have described breaking windows and taking other desperate steps to escape Berkey Hall, which will stay closed through the spring term.

            McRae walked nearly 4 miles (6 kilometers) toward his Lansing home after the shootings and said nothing before killing himself in front of police, said Lt. Rene Gonzalez of the state police.

            McRae's father, who shared the house, told police that “his son does not have any friends,” Gonzalez said. “He pretty much sat in his room most of the time.""

            McRae had a misdemeanor gun conviction in 2019, though it didn't bar him from having the handguns, which Rozman noted were purchased legally but not registered. 

            The students who died were from suburban Detroit: Brian Fraser, 20, Arielle Anderson, 19, and Alexandria Verner, 20.

            One of the five wounded students was upgraded to stable condition at Sparrow Hospital. The others remained in critical condition but with “signs of improvement,” interim university President Teresa Woodruff said.

            Two of the students are from China, according to a statement from the Chinese Consulate in Chicago. 

            Classes remain suspended through the weekend, Woodruff said.

            The briefing by police followed a Wednesday night vigil on campus that drew thousands of students. Tom Izzo, the university’s revered basketball coach and father of a student, offered words of comfort.

            “Our hearts are heavy. Our loss has been great. Our lives have been permanently changed,” said Izzo, head coach since 1995. “But with a shared commitment to help each other, and a promise to remember those we have lost, we will learn to find joy once again.”

(AP) — The man who shot eight students at Michigan State University, killing three, was found with two handguns and a note containing a possible motive for the attack, police said Thursday.The 9 mm guns, dozens of rounds of ammunition and the two-page note were found with Anthony McRae when he killed himself Monday night after being confronted by police, said campus deputy chief Chris Rozman.Investigators said they still were trying to pin down a motive, three days after the violence at the 50,000-student campus in East Lansing, but the note was a key point.“It appears based on the content of the note that he felt he was slighted in some way by people or businesses,” Rozman said at a news conference. “Did a mental health issue amplify that or was it a component of that? We're not sure at this point. We’re working our best to try to determine that as best as possible.""McRae, 43, was the lone shooter and had no connection to the victims or to Michigan State as a student or employee, police said.Rozman described the investigation as “massively complex.”The shootings happened Monday during evening classes at Berkey Hall and nearby at the MSU Union, a social hub where students can study, eat and relax. Students across the vast campus were ordered to shelter in place for four hours — “run, hide, fight” if necessary — while police hunted for the gunman. Some residence halls were a mile away from the shooting scenes.Students have described breaking windows and taking other desperate steps to escape Berkey Hall, which will stay closed through the spring term.McRae walked nearly 4 miles (6 kilometers) toward his Lansing home after the shootings and said nothing before killing himself in front of police, said Lt. Rene Gonzalez of the state police.McRae's father, who shared the house, told police that “his son does not have any friends,” Gonzalez said. “He pretty much sat in his room most of the time.""McRae had a misdemeanor gun conviction in 2019, though it didn't bar him from having the handguns, which Rozman noted were purchased legally but not registered.The students who died were from suburban Detroit: Brian Fraser, 20, Arielle Anderson, 19, and Alexandria Verner, 20.One of the five wounded students was upgraded to stable condition at Sparrow Hospital. The others remained in critical condition but with “signs of improvement,” interim university President Teresa Woodruff said.Two of the students are from China, according to a statement from the Chinese Consulate in Chicago.Classes remain suspended through the weekend, Woodruff said.The briefing by police followed a Wednesday night vigil on campus that drew thousands of students. Tom Izzo, the university’s revered basketball coach and father of a student, offered words of comfort.“Our hearts are heavy. Our loss has been great. Our lives have been permanently changed,” said Izzo, head coach since 1995. “But with a shared commitment to help each other, and a promise to remember those we have lost, we will learn to find joy once again.”___This story has been edited to correct the spelling of Gonzalez.___Associated Press journalists Ed White in Detroit and Ao Gao in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",2023/02/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812653,Kentucky high court lets near-total abortion ban continue,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Abortion access in Kentucky remained virtually shut off Thursday after the state's highest court refused to halt a near-total ban that has largely been in place since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

            Kentucky's Supreme Court, which was weighing challenges to the state’s near-total ban and a separate one that outlaws abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy, sent the case back to a lower court for further consideration of constitutional issues related to the more restrictive ban.

            The court weighed in on the issue after Kentucky voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion. The justices heard arguments in the case a week after the November midterm elections, and activists on both sides had anxiously awaited the ruling. The state's Republican-led Legislature passed both of those laws.











            The justices ruled on narrow legal issues Thursday. They left unanswered the larger constitutional questions about whether access to abortion should be legal in the Bluegrass State.

            “To be clear, this opinion does not in any way determine whether the Kentucky Constitution protects or does not protect the right to receive an abortion, as no appropriate party to raise that issue is before us,” Deputy Chief Justice Debra Hembree Lambert wrote. “Nothing in this opinion shall be construed to prevent an appropriate party from filing suit at a later date.”

            Abortion rights groups responded that the fight is far from over.

            “Even after Kentuckians overwhelmingly voted against an anti-abortion ballot measure, abortion remains banned in the state,” Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. “We are extremely disappointed in today’s decision, but we will never give up the fight to restore bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom in Kentucky.”

            Kentucky's Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, called the ruling a “significant victory,” and said his office will continue to defend laws that “stand up for the unborn.” 

            “We are very pleased that Kentucky’s high court has allowed these laws to remain in effect while the case proceeds in circuit court,” Cameron said in a statement.

            The legal challenge brought by two Louisville abortion providers revolves around the state's near-total trigger law ban and six-week ban. The trigger law was passed in 2019 and took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. It bans abortions except when they’re carried out to save the life of the mother or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

            In July, a Louisville judge, Mitch Perry, halted enforcement of the bans because he found that they likely violated the state constitution’s rights to privacy and self-determination. He said it wasn’t the court’s role to determine whether the state constitution guarantees the right to abortion, but it is its role to decide whether the new bans violate constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.

            But the state Court of Appeals reinstated enforcement of the bans and the state Supreme Court opted in August to keep them in place while it reviewed the case.

            On Thursday, the high court ruled that the abortion providers, who challenged the two bans on the premise that they violate patients' constitutional rights, lacked the “third-party standing"" to do so.

            Lambert, though, wrote that the providers do have “first-party” constitutional standing to challenge the trigger ban, pointing to “financial harm” as sufficient grounds for such standing.

            As a result, the justices sent that part of the case back to the circuit court in Louisville to review the plaintiffs' claims that the trigger ban violates the state constitution.

            However, the abortion providers offered “no arguments concerning their own rights” in challenging the six-week ban, the court noted.

            With Kentucky's near-total ban left intact, abortion rights groups said they would continue helping Kentuckians “get the care they need, including helping patients find care out of state.” 

            Thirteen states have current bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, including Wisconsin, where there’s a legal question over which law is in effect but where clinics have shut down. Bans and tight restrictions are currently on hold because of court action in at least six states.

            Meanwhile, a Texas lawsuit poses a threat to the nationwide availability of medication-induced abortion, which now accounts for the majority of abortions in the U.S. The case filed by abortion rights opponents seeks to reverse Food and Drug Administration approval of mifepristone.FRANKFORT, Ky.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812654,"Will the EPL title go to Man City, Arsenal or Man United?","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Just like that, Manchester City is back on top in the Premier League and is once again the team to catch in the race for the title. 

            While Arsenal still has a game in hand, the champions lead the way for the first time since August and, if recent years are anything to go by, will take some stopping. 

            Wednesday’s 3-1 win at Emirates Stadium was a statement of title intent from Pep Guardiola’s team and inflicted a third defeat in four games on a faltering Arsenal, a run that also includes being beaten by City in the FA Cup last month. 











            It also tightens things up at the top of the table, with just five points separating the three leading clubs – bringing third-place Manchester United right into contention.

            Arsenal travels to Aston Villa in the first Premier League game of the weekend on Saturday and has the chance to move back above City, even if only temporarily. 

            City is away at Nottingham Forest later in the day, while United hosts Leicester on Sunday. 

            With so few points separating all three teams, any slip now could have a telling impact on the title race, with the immediate pressure on Arsenal to arrest its recent slide. 

            Having led the table by eight points as recently as recently as Jan. 19, Mikel Arteta’s team knows just how quickly the picture can change. 

            In race that will be as much a test of nerve as much as quality, who will come out on top at the end of the season?

            MANCHESTER CITY

            The preseason favorite and champion in four of the last five seasons, City has the pedigree and the knowhow, which is a major advantage over its rivals. 

            But Guardiola’s team has looked out of sorts for much of the campaign, with the manager recently suggesting his players had lost their edge after so much success during his tenure. 

            That comment felt like an attempt to spark a reaction, but the biggest motivation might have come from outside the club, with the Premier League last week accusing City of breaching a slew of financial regulations that could lead to expulsion from English football’s top division if upheld. 

            That prompted back-to-back wins against Villa and Arsenal, which has propelled City to the top of the table on goal difference. 

            The biggest threat to Guardiola’s bid to win three titles in a row could still come from within, with his team arguably more predictable since the introduction of striker Erling Haaland. 

            There is also the potential that City becomes distracted by the Champions League, the one major trophy it has failed to win under the ownership of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family. 

            The win against Arsenal was evidence of City’s quality – but frailties that have been on show for much of the season leave a question mark hanging over the champions. 

            ARSENAL

            Arsenal will lift the title for the first time since 2004 if it wins the rest of its remaining games. Easier said than done, but having played one fewer than City, its fate is in its own hands. 

            The problem for Arteta is that his team is struggling to win at all at the moment. 

            Ever since he played a slightly weakened team against City in the FA Cup, the long-time leader’s form has plummeted, losing to Everton and drawing with Brentford before Wednesday’s latest defeat.

            Suddenly it feels like the cracks are appearing and questions are being raised over the experience of a young team with little trophy-winning experience in its ranks. 

            While Arteta was an assistant to Guardiola in title-winning campaigns for City, he has never been in this situation as a manager and the focus is on how he handles the pressure of holding off the challenge of his former mentor. 

            Injury to striker Gabriel Jesus has also had an impact, with the Brazilian’s replacement Eddie Nketiah missing key chances against City. 

            As a surprise leader, Arsenal passed virtually every test of its credentials up to the end of January, but its current slump could prove costly. 

            MANCHESTER UNITED

            If Arsenal was an unexpected title challenger at the start of the season, United looked like it had a fight on its hands just to make the top four and Champions League qualification. 

            And after losing its opening two games of the campaign, a relegation fight looked a likelier prospect than a battle at the top. 

            Erik ten Hag has transformed the club’s fortunes and looks ahead of schedule in his rebuild since taking charge at the end of last season. 

            However, his squad still looks too light to maintain a challenge right to the end, with Christian Eriksen ruled out for the majority of the rest of the season through injury and Anthony Martial struggling to stay fit. 

            United’s weaknesses have been highlighted in recent weeks when draws with Crystal Palace and Leeds dented Ten Hag’s ambitions. A late loss at Arsenal was also costly.

            In total United has dropped seven points from its last five games, but still remains within touching distance of the leading two. 

            A major advantage for Ten Hag is the fact that United has already played City and Arsenal twice, while those two teams meet again in April, meaning more dropped points for at least one of them. 

            But it feels too soon for a United team that finished 35 points off City last season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812657,"Celtics remove interim tag, name Joe Mazzulla head coach","BOSTON (AP) — Joe Mazzulla has been so steady guiding the Celtics through a franchise-shaking crisis that their turbulent offseason has taken a back seat to their championship aspirations.

            The team rewarded him by turning a temporary opportunity of a lifetime into a permanent one.

            Boston named Mazzulla its full-time head coach on Thursday, removing the interim tag he had held since stepping in for Ime Udoka in the preseason.











            Udoka initially was given a yearlong suspension before training camp for having an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the organization. The 34-year-old Mazzulla, previously an assistant under Udoka, will now replace his former boss, who is no longer with the team. Mazzulla is the NBA’s youngest head coach.

            “Since I’ve been here I always knew where I stood,"" Mazzulla said Thursday. ""And even though it was an interim position ... I knew I was going to get a fair shake and get an opportunity. I knew I was going to be able to do it the way that I thought to give us the best chance to be successful without any pressure because of that.”

            Terms of his new deal were not released, but the team said his promotion includes a contract extension.

            “I’ve always been surrounded by great people and great coaches,"" Mazzulla said. “I just think I’m a byproduct of all the different environments I’ve been in.”

            Mazzulla's Celtics have the best record in the NBA (42-17) and led Milwaukee by one game in the Eastern Conference ahead of the Bucks' game at Chicago on Thursday night. Boston won't play again until after the All-Star break.

            Mazzulla said he found out the process of making him the permanent coach was underway two days ago and that the deal was finalized after the Celtics' 127-109 win over Detroit on Wednesday.

            Mazzulla and his assistants will coach Team Giannis — the team that will be captained by Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo — in the All-Star Game Sunday at Salt Lake City. Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were named All-Stars.

            “One of the things that's pretty obvious and evident about Joe is he's a really good coach and he also is just an outstanding leader,” Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said. “I think he's done a great job right from the get-go of galvanizing the locker room around a mission.”

            Stevens said he decided to elevate Mazzulla now because of the job he's done and because he didn't want the coach and his staff to enter the second half of the season under ""a cloud of uncertainty.” 

            “They’ve certainly have earned that,” Stevens said.

            He declined to elaborate on why he made the move now instead of waiting until the season ended.

            “We said in our original statement long ago that decision would be made at a later date. We wanted to make sure we were thorough, we were really focused on our team from that day on,"" Stevens said. “I thought the players leadership, the staff's leadership and Joe's leadership have all stood out during that time.”

            Mazzulla, who is from Johnston, Rhode Island, was recognized as the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for games played in October and November after leading the team to a league-best 18-4 record (.818).

            He said being on top of the East is something he would take the time to appreciate over the All-Star break — while also thinking about how the Celtics can maintain their strong play in the second half.

            “It's there, you can't run away, you can't ignore it,” Mazzulla said. “I do think there is a comfort level knowing that. But that was kind of my message to the guys. That at the same time you can't be too comfortable because when we get back, it picks right up.”

            Udoka, a longtime assistant, led Boston to a 51-31 record last season, his first as a head coach — going 26-6 in the final 32 games. The Celtics then beat Brooklyn, Milwaukee and Miami on the way to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games.

            Before training camp, the Celtics banned Udoka for a full season over what two people with knowledge of the matter said was an improper relationship with a member of the organization. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team did not reveal that detail publicly.

            Despite those circumstances, Boston looks fully capable of winning a title.

            “All things considered, everything that we’ve went through this season as a team with coaching changes and guys getting injured, missing games and being in and out of the lineup. ... Overall, it’s been a hell of a start,” Tatum said after the win over Detroit.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team did not reveal that detail publicly.Despite those circumstances, Boston looks fully capable of winning a title.“All things considered, everything that we’ve went through this season as a team with coaching changes and guys getting injured, missing games and being in and out of the lineup. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812660,AP source: Kevin Love discussing possible buyout from Cavs,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Kevin Love's long, winding run with the Cleveland Cavaliers could be ending after nearly nine years.

            The five-time All-Star forward has discussed the possibility of a contract buyout with the Cavs after being dropped from their rotation, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Thursday.

            Love is in the final year of a $120 million, four-year extension he signed in 2018.











            The 34-year-old hasn't played in the last 12 games and his representatives approached the Cavaliers about the buyout, said the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because negotiations continue.

            At this point, nothing has been finalized and the sides are expected to engage in discussions during the All-Star break, the person said.

            Love has been with Cleveland since 2014, and one of the NBA's most versatile big men is the last remaining link from the 2016 title team, which ended the city's 52-year pro sports championship drought.

            Although he's not contributing like he once did on the floor, Love has become a beloved player to Cleveland fans.

            His acceptance of a reserve role last season helped fuel the team's turnaround after winning just 60 games combined in the three previous seasons. And Love's public disclosure of struggling with mental health issues in the past made him relatable and easy to root for.

            The Athletic first reported Love's buyout request.

            Love played well earlier this season before being slowed by a thumb injury. When forward Dean Wade and guard Ricky Rubio recently returned from injuries, Love's minutes shrunk, and lately he hasn't been in coach J.B. Bickerstaff's rotation at all.

            Love's situation became cloudier when the team signed veteran forward Danny Green after he became available via buyout. Green made his debut in Wednesday night's 118-112 loss at Philadelphia while Love sat again.

            Love wants to play, and if the Cavs, who entered the day fourth in the Eastern Conference standings, agree to a buyout, he could draw interest from other contending teams. Miami and Phoenix are among the potential landing spots.

            Last week, Cavaliers president of basketball operations Koby Altman said he had not spoken to Love or his agents about a buyout and expected him to have a contributing role again at some point this season.

            Bickerstaff said something similar while complimenting Love on continuing to be a good teammate and leader.

            “We still believe he’s capable of helping us in big moments because he has that experience and has been through those pressures,” Bickerstaff said Monday night before a win over San Antonio. “I do think there’s going to be times where we really need him because again he’s another one of those guys who’s been through those moments and seen those types of things that we’re going to need hopefully down the stretch here.""

            Love has averaged 17.2 points and 10.5 rebounds since 2008. He spent six seasons with Minnesota before being traded to Cleveland.

            Love had some initial struggles trying to fit in when he first arrived. Accustomed to being the star with the Timberwolves, he had to learn how to be a supporting player aside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.

            Love eventually found his footing, and Cavs fans will long remember his defense on Steph Curry in the closing minutes of Game 7 in 2016 as Cleveland completed a comeback from a 3-1 deficit to stun the Golden State Warriors.

            The satellite service announced on Thursday that it has reached an agreement to provide MLS Season Pass to commercial establishments through DirecTV for Business.

            DirecTV’s residential customers will still need to access MLS Season Pass through the Apple TV app. MLS and Apple began a 10-year agreement on Feb. 1 to carry games worldwide without blackout restrictions.

            It is the second time in less than a year DirecTV has partnered with a streaming service to bring a sports package to businesses. It reached a deal with Amazon Prime Video last fall to air the NFL’s “Thursday Night Football” games.

            Even though it will no longer be the residential carrier of the NFL's “Sunday Ticket” package of out-of-market Sunday afternoon games beginning with the 2023 season, DirecTV remains in the mix to possibly acquire the commercial rights.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812662,Jury: NCAA not liable in ex-Grand Valley quarterback's death,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — An Indiana jury has found the NCAA not liable in the death of a former Grand Valley State quarterback whose widow accused the college sports governing body of failing to warn college athletes about the risks of head injuries while playing football.

            A Marion County jury agreed Wednesday with the NCAA’s arguments that Cullen Finnerty’s death did not result from a concussion he suffered while playing for the Michigan college or smaller blows to the head during his playing days, but from other health problems and addictions, ESPN reported.

            Finnerty won three Division II national championships as the starting quarterback for Grand Valley State in the early 2000s. He died in May 2013 at age 30 after going missing while on vacation with his wife’s family.











            An autopsy found that chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE — a disease caused by concussions and repeated blows to the head — was a contributing factor in Finnerty's death.

            His widow, Jennifer Finnerty, sued the Indianapolis-based NCAA, arguing that the association did not properly protect college athletes and warn them of the risks of head injuries while playing football.

            Following a three-week trial that included testimony from outgoing NCAA president Mark Emmert and several medical experts, the jury agreed with the NCAA's arguments and found that it was not responsible for Cullen Finnerty's death.

            The NCAA has maintained for years that it is not legally responsible for the health and safety of college athletes.

            “The Association was not negligent, and the lawsuit was not supported by medical science linking Mr. Finnerty’s death to college football,” NCAA general counsel Scott Bearby said Wednesday in a statement. “We express our deepest sympathies to Mr. Finnerty’s family and friends.”

            A message seeking comment on the verdict was left Thursday by The Associated Press for Jennifer Finnerty’s attorney, Robert Dassow.

            In November, a Los Angeles jury rejected a lawsuit seeking $55 million filed by Alana Gee, the widow of former USC linebacker Matthew Gee. She argued that the NCAA failed to protect him from repeated head trauma that led to his death.

            The NCAA remains a defendant in dozens of similar cases that argue it should bear some responsibility for the long-term health problems associated with head injuries athletes suffer while playing for their schools, ESPN reported.INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — An Indiana jury has found the NCAA not liable in the death of a former Grand Valley State quarterback whose widow accused the college sports governing body of failing to warn college athletes about the risks of head injuries while playing football.A Marion County jury agreed Wednesday with the NCAA’s arguments that Cullen Finnerty’s death did not result from a concussion he suffered while playing for the Michigan college or smaller blows to the head during his playing days, but from other health problems and addictions, ESPN reported.Finnerty won three Division II national championships as the starting quarterback for Grand Valley State in the early 2000s.

            Videos recorded by his driver and posted on social media by his supporters showed police physically removing Ousmane Sonko from the back seat of his car after he appeared in a Dakar court. 

            Authorities later escorted the 46-year-old politician to his residence, according to Senegalese media. Sonko's supporters saw the incident as the latest attempt to cut short his political career, including his likely presidential candidacy in 2024. 











            Sonko finished third in Senegal's 2019 presidential election and has called on President Macky Sall to say publicly that he won't seek a third term.

            The opposition leader was in court as part of a civil lawsuit against him by Senegal's tourism minister for defamation and public insults. The case stems from accusations that Sonko made against the minister during a news conference late last year. A judge on Thursday postponed the trial until next month.

            After leaving the courthouse, Sonko greeted his supporters from his car. Police officers soon began firing tear gas at the crowd, according to AP journalists at the scene. The officers then stopped Sonko's car and demanded that he get out.

            “The convoy of the main opposition leader is blocked by combat vehicles,"" Sonko's lawyer, Cire Cledor Ly, wrote in a text message to The Associated Press on Thursday afternoon. 

            It was unclear why police broke the car's windows and the government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

            Along with the defamation trial, Sonko also faces rape charges based on accusations from a female employee said she was assaulted at a massage salon. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and would be barred from running for president. 

            In 2021, days of deadly protests erupted after Sonko was arrested for disturbing public order while on his way to the courthouse for a scheduled appearance in the rape case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812664,Jamaica's anti-corruption agency focuses on prime minister,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness is under scrutiny after an anti-corruption agency issued a lengthy report that suggests a potential conflict of interest involving him and contracts awarded to a construction company, some of which were not reported.

            The island’s Integrity Commission noted in its report issued Wednesday that it referred the case to Jamaica’s director of corruption prosecution, who will review the findings. The report also was shared with the speaker of Jamaica’s House of Representatives, who is a member of Holness’ Jamaica Labor Party.

            Holness released a statement noting that the matter occurred nearly two decades ago, and that “at no time have I ever exercised influence on any process for the award of contracts. I strongly disagree with the findings of the Integrity Commission regarding conflict of interest based on mere association.”











            He also noted that it’s a longstanding practice for members of Parliament to recommend local contractors to undertake works in their constituencies, and added that he has referred the commission’s report to his lawyers.

            The commission’s investigation focused on 10 contracts awarded to a construction company from 2007 to 2009, when Holness was minister of education. Only five of those were reported to the Office of the Contractor General as required by law, according to the report.

            The contracts totaled nearly $142,000 and were for work ranging from roof repairs to renovation of a teachers’ cottage.

            The commission found that the prime minister has known two directors and shareholders of Westcon Construction Limited for more than 20 years. Holness said one of them that he knows personally is a former employee in his constituency and personal business, and the other is known to him casually and was hired to do land surveying work, according to the report.

            Officials with the construction company could not be immediately reached for comment.

            The investigation began after a local TV news program in May 2016 questioned the contracts and the relationship between Holness and the construction company officials. 

            It was not clear if Jamaica’s director of corruption prosecution has a deadline to respond to the commission’s findings and whether her response could be appealed by attorneys for Holness.

Holness said one of them that he knows personally is a former employee in his constituency and personal business, and the other is known to him casually and was hired to do land surveying work, according to the report.Officials with the construction company could not be immediately reached for comment.The investigation began after a local TV news program in May 2016 questioned the contracts and the relationship between Holness and the construction company officials.It was not clear if Jamaica’s director of corruption prosecution has a deadline to respond to the commission’s findings and whether her response could be appealed by attorneys for Holness.The commission did not immediately return a message for comment.",2023/02/17,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812666,SOFTBALL '23: Oklahoma favored to win third straight title,"Oklahoma is in the midst of one of the most dominant runs ever in women's college softball.

            Under coach Patty Gasso, the Sooners have won five of the past nine national championships. They could add another rare accolade this season by becoming the first program since UCLA from 1988 to 1990 to win three consecutive titles. 

            Even with NCAA career home runs leader Jocelyn Alo having moved on to play pro ball, the Sooners are favored to win it all again. Oklahoma was the preseason No. 1 in the USA Today/NFCA Division I Preseason Top 25 Coaches Poll and the ESPN.com/USA Softball Collegiate Top 25.











            Gasso doesn’t want to talk about winning another title yet.

            “We don’t talk about winning three,” she said. “Those are words that we’re not really talking about around here because it’s premature. It’s really about the process. It’s the journey. It’s all of that, all the work we put in.”

            It's easy to see why Oklahoma is considered the team to beat.

            Infielder Tiare Jennings may be the nation’s best player. She dominated at last year's Women’s College World Series, setting records with 15 RBIs and five home runs. She entered this season with 179 career RBIs in just two seasons. Infielder Grace Lyons and utility player Jayda Coleman are dynamic defensive players who can hit and Kinzie Hansen is among the nation's top catchers.

            Pitcher Jordy Bahl was the National Fastpitch Coaches Association’s Freshman of the Year last season. Veteran Nicole May and Alex Storako, a transfer from Michigan, are among those who will support Bahl.

            Oklahoma is winning in the transfer portal, too. Cydney Sanders, last year’s Pac-12 Freshman of the Year at Arizona State, had 21 home runs and 63 RBIs for the Sun Devils. Haley Lee, a third-team NFCA All-American last season, transferred from Texas A&M. 

            UCLA, which beat the Sooners for the title in 2019 and reached the semifinals last season, is ready to challenge. Pitcher Megan Faraimo is one of the nation’s best, and the Bruins have the bats to back her up.

            UCLA star Aaliyah Jordan was granted a seventh year by the NCAA after her 2022 season was cut short due to a torn left ACL. The outfielder was a first-team NFCA All-American in 2018 and 2021 and a Softball America first-team All-American during the shortened 2020 season. She helped the Bruins win a national title in 2019.

            Maya Brady, a utility player, was a first-team NFCA All-American in 2021. The niece of NFL great Tom Brady hit two home runs in a Women's College World Series win over Oklahoma last season.

            UCLA also was strong in the transfer portal, adding Arizona’s Sharlize Palacios and Janelle Meono and Oregon’s Brooke Yanez and Rachel Cid. 

            Oklahoma State has been knocking on the door. The Cowgirls beat Oklahoma to win the Big 12 Tournament last season and reached the WCWS semifinals. The Cowgirls have made three straight World Series trips.

            NFCA All-America pitcher Kelly Maxwell leads Oklahoma State, and she has plenty of help. Alabama transfer Lexi Kilfoyl had 13 starts and a 2.36 ERA for the Crimson Tide last season. Freshman Kyra Aycock was one of the nation’s top pitching recruits.

            Freshman infielder Tallen Edwards skipped her senior season at Southmoore (Oklahoma) High School to enroll and is already a starter. She was named the No. 3 overall prospect in Extra Innings Softball’s 2023 Extra Elite 100.

            Graduate senior Chyenne Factor and junior Katelynn Carwile return to anchor the outfield. Infielder Rachel Becker is at Oklahoma State after being a third-team All-American as a shortstop at Purdue last season.

            Florida State should also be in the mix. Pitcher Kathryn Sandercock and utility player Mack Leonard led a team that finished second in the Women's College World Series in 2021 and was the No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament this past season.

            Texas reached the championship series last season and could be a factor again, with infielder Mia Scott and pitcher Estelle Czech leading the charge.

            The Southeastern Conference usually is in the mix, and it should be again. Alabama features veteran pitcher Montana Fouts and outfielder Faith Hensley. Infielders Charla Echols and Skylar Wallace and outfielder Kendra Falby anchor a tough Florida squad. Arkansas could challenge with slugger Hannah Gammill, infielder Kristina Foreman and pitcher Chenise Delce leading the way.Oklahoma is in the midst of one of the most dominant runs ever in women's college softball.Under coach Patty Gasso, the Sooners have won five of the past nine national championships.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812667,US launches artificial intelligence military use initiative,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The United States launched an initiative Thursday promoting international cooperation on the responsible use of artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons by militaries, seeking to impose order on an emerging technology that has the potential to change the way war is waged.

            “As a rapidly changing technology, we have an obligation to create strong norms of responsible behavior concerning military uses of AI and in a way that keeps in mind that applications of AI by militaries will undoubtedly change in the coming years,” Bonnie Jenkins, the State Department’s under secretary for arms control and international security, said.

            She said the U.S. political declaration, which contains non-legally binding guidelines outlining best practices for responsible military use of AI, “can be a focal point for international cooperation.”











            Jenkins launched the declaration at the end of a two-day conference in The Hague that took on additional urgency as advances in drone technology amid the Russia's war in Ukraine have accelerated a trend that could soon bring the world’s first fully autonomous fighting robots to the battlefield.

            The U.S. declaration has 12 points, including that military uses of AI are consistent with international law, and that states “maintain human control and involvement for all actions critical to informing and executing sovereign decisions concerning nuclear weapons employment.”

            Zachary Kallenborn, a George Mason University weapons innovation analyst who attended the Hague conference, said the U.S. move to take its approach to the international stage “recognizes that there are these concerns about autonomous weapons. That is significant in and of itself.”

            Kallenborn said it was also important that Washington included a call for human control over nuclear weapons ""because when it comes to autonomous weapons risk, I think that is easily the highest risk you possibly have.”

            Underscoring the sense of international urgency around AI and autonomous weapons, 60 nations, including the U.S. and China, issued a call for action at the Hague conference urging broad cooperation in the development and responsible military use of artificial intelligence.

            “We are in time to mitigate risks and to prevent AI from spiraling out of control, and we are in time to prevent AI from taking us to a place we simply don’t want to be,” Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said.

            The call to action issued in the Netherlands underscored “the importance of ensuring appropriate safeguards and human oversight of the use of AI systems, bearing in mind human limitations due to constraints in time and capacities.”

            The participating nations also invited countries “to develop national frameworks, strategies and principles on responsible AI in the military domain.”

            Military analysts and artificial intelligence researchers say the longer the nearly year-long war in Ukraine lasts, the more likely it becomes that drones will be used to identify, select and attack targets without help from humans.

            Ukraine’s digital transformation minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, told The Associated Press in a recent interview that fully autonomous killer drones are “a logical and inevitable next step” in weapons development. He said Ukraine has been doing “a lot of R&D in this direction.”

            Ukraine already has semi-autonomous attack drones and counter-drone weapons endowed with AI. Russia also claims to possess AI weaponry, though the claims are unproven. But there are no confirmed instances of a nation putting into combat robots that have killed entirely on their own.

            Russia was not invited to attend the conference in The Hague.

            China's ambassador to the Netherlands Tan Jian did attend and said Beijing has sent two papers to the United Nations on regulating military AI applications, saying the issue “concerns the common security and the well-being of mankind, which requires the united response of all countries,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812676,"Spain passes laws on trans rights, abortion, menstrual leave","Spain's parliament on Thursday passed legislation which makes it easier for trans people to change their gender, expands access to abortion procedures and grants menstrual leave to women suffering from severe period pain.The laws were put forward by the country's left wing coalition government. The transgender law passed with 191 votes in favor, 60 against and 91 abstentions, following a rift in Spain's governing left-wing coalition ahead of elections scheduled for May this year.Thursday's passed bills make Spain the first European country to introduce menstrual leave. The European country is also among the first countries worldwide to allow people to change their gender on their national identity cards with a simple declaration.However, the laws were passed amid wide controversy and loud disagreement.Prior to the law's passing, adults in Spain were required to provide a medical report attesting to gender dysphoria and proof of hormone treatment for two years in order to change their legally registered gender. For minors, the process was even more complex, and included mandatory judicial authorization.The newly-passed law scraps many of the hurdles for those aged 16 and older. It also allows minors aged 14 and 15 to apply for a gender change with their parents' or legal guardians' approval. Minors aged 12 and 13, however, will need a judge's permission.The bill also bans so-called ""conversion therapy"" that seeks to change a person's sexual orientation to heterosexual and outlines government measures for the inclusion of trans people in the workforce, education and housing.LGBTQ+ activists celebrated the vote outside parliament in the capital Madrid on Thursday.The legislation was championed by Equality Minister, Irene Montero, of the left-wing junior coalition partner Podemos (""United We Can"").""This law recognizes the right of trans people to self-determine their gender identity, it depathologizes trans people. Trans people are not sick people, they are just people,"" Montero said ahead of the vote. She described the law as among ""the most important laws of this legislature.""Montero later celebrated the bill being voted into law on Twitter.The passage was also praised by Spain's largest LGBTQ organization, saying it would set an example for other countries.""We're celebrating the fact this law has passed after eight years of tireless work to obtain rights for the trans community,"" Uge Sangil, head of FELGBTI+ told news agency AFP.However, the law created a division within the ruling coalition, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialist Party voicing reservations.Spain's right-wing parties, who now represent the opposition, also staunchly opposed the law. Maria Jesus Moro of the opposition Popular Party made a last-minute appeal to vote against the law ahead of Thursday's session.Other groups expressed their opposition to the bill over concerns it could allow men to compete in women's sport or request a transfer to women's prisons.The Spanish parliament also approved on Thursday another law allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to undergo an abortion without parental consent.The new law also enshrines the right to have an abortion in a state hospital. Over 80% of abortions carried out in Spain are currently done in private clinics, with many doctors in the public health system refusing to perform them, citing religious reasons.Thursday's vote follows an attempt by the right-wing Popular Party to knock down a 2010 legislation which allows abortion within the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. The country's Constitutional Court rejected the challenge last week.Other changes brought about by Thursday's vote include offering free menstrual products in schools and prisons, and free hormonal contraceptives and the morning after pill at state-run health centers.rmt/rs (AFP, AP, EFE)",2023/02/16,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812678,Can ASEAN benefit from the EU's green agriculture push?,"As manufacturing and tourism collapsed in the three years of the COVID-19 pandemic, several Southeast Asian governments realized that they needed to pump more money into their underfunded and underappreciated agriculture sector. That's now paying off.The sector in Cambodia grew by around 6% over each of the past two years compared to 2019, according to government data.Last year, Vietnam's agriculture exports climbed by 9.3% to a new record value of more than €49 billion ($52.3 billion).Despite the healthy growth in the sector, there are concerns. It is a key contributor to climate change in the region. The World Bank estimates that agriculture accounted for 19% of Vietnam's total greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, the second-highest of any sector.And export markets remain rather condensed. China, for instance, purchased around half of all agricultural exports from Cambodia, and around a quarter of Thailand's, last year.In 2022, the EU accounted for just 11% of Vietnam's agricultural exports, according to Vietnamese government data.Now Hanoi and several other Southeast Asian governments are pursuing ""green"" or ""sustainable"" agriculture to boost exports to European states and attract the EU's environment-centric investment opportunities.In late 2021, the European Investment Bank offered a €15 million grant for sustainable agriculture in Cambodia. In August last year, the EU partnered with Bangkok and Chiang Mai in Thailand for sustainable food production. In the Philippines, the EU has a €60 million Team Europe Initiative on Green Economy.The EU's Just Transition Mechanism aims to raise around €55 billion between 2021 and 2027 to help other regions move towards a climate-neutral economy.Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has approved a national strategy on green growth, and reckons the sector will see up to 3% annual growth up until 2030. By that date, it wants organic fertilizers to account for around a third of national use, while also laying down targets on water-saving and forest cover.Thailand and the Philippines, key agricultural economies, are also quickly moving in that direction. ""Food security remains at the forefront of our national agenda. Anchored in our vision for a prosperous, resilient, and secure Philippines by the year 2040,"" Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Philippines president, said during a speech at Davos last month.Ahead of leading a business delegation to Vietnam last year, EU commissioner for agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski, noted that a major breakthrough in agricultural trade was made possible by the signing of the EU-Vietnam free trade agreement in 2020.Through the trade pact, he wrote, ""EU citizens enjoy increased access to Vietnamese tea and coffee, along with an impressive range of nuts, spices, and tropical fruit."" Also because of it, several export goods are protected as ""geographical indications,"" such as Bao Lam seedless persimmon and Luc Ngan lychees.An EU official told DW that they hope cooperation on green agriculture will develop as Brussels looks to sign new free trade agreements with several other Southeast Asian governments.A trade deal could be agreed with Indonesia by the end of this year, after another round of talks earlier this month. Thailand and the Philippines have both expressed a desire to restart negotiations. A trade deal with the latter two Southeast Asian countries could significantly boost sectoral trade with the EU.""Many countries in ASEAN are striving hard to both increase agricultural production and the nutritional value of the food produced locally – all in the name of increasing food security, whilst also attempting to boost agricultural exports,"" Chris Humphrey, executive director of the EU-ASEAN Business Council, said.Although many European businesses are working closely with ASEAN governments in this area, and there's much scope for increased exports of agricultural products from Southeast Asia to Europe, exporters face many hurdles, Humphrey added.That includes distance and logistics involved in trade, but ""also concerns around meeting the regulatory requirements of the EU which for many smallholders is a burden too far.""For the past two years, the EU and European business associations have funded seminars and workshops across Southeast Asia to better explain these regulatory changes. This is particularly a problem for Southeast Asia's smaller and less developed economies.An academic paper published last March on the potential of the EU becoming a market for Laos' agri-food exports found that ""a lack of technical support from relevant stakeholders, new EU rules and regulatory enforcement on agri-food importing… are all important challenges facing Lao exporters.""In addition, the study added, ""obtaining an organic certificate on product standards and safety requirements is another big issue facing Lao exporters.""Analysts in the region say that Brussels must step up its efforts to better educate Southeast Asian officials and businesses about what can be a bureaucratic headache.Boosting relations on the sustainable agriculture front will be far more complex when it comes to Malaysia and Indonesia due to differences over palm oil.Malaysia and Indonesia, the world's two largest palm oil producers, have clashed with the EU for years over Brussels' initiative to fight global deforestation, which would ban imports into EU markets of goods linked to deforestation or forest degradation.Both countries have taken the EU to the World Trade Organization over the European Commission's move to phase out palm oil-based biofuel by 2030.""The Deforestation-Free Products Regulation is a deliberate act by Europe to block market access, hurt small farmers and protect a domestic oilseeds market that is inefficient and cannot compete with the cost of palm oil,"" Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister and Commodities Minister Fadillah Yusof said in late December, according to a Reuters report.Almost a third of Indonesians and a fifth of Malaysians distrust the EU because they think its stance on the environment and climate change could threaten their countries' interests, according to a recent survey of ""elite"" opinion by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak InstituteNonetheless, the EU remains an active investor in conservation projects in both countries. Trade diversification has been the key message of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's ongoing tour of Southeast Asia. He arrived in Malaysia on Thursday and will visit conservation projects in Sarawak in East Malaysia, whose rain forests are home to a wide and unique variety of species.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/02/16,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812679,German cities demand more money for refugees,"When Bielefeld mayor Pit Clausen is asked how his city is coping with taking in Ukrainian war refugees, he remains relaxed. The situation is better than the mood would indicate, says the Social Democratic politician. His city in Germany's western state of North Rhine-Westphalia has some 340,000 residents — 4,000 of whom are refugees fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""A big city like Bielefeld can cope easily with that,"" Clausen says.More than half of those refugees are living with relatives or acquaintances, he says; no one has to sleep in a gymnasium anymore. Almost all of the children have been placed in daycare centers and schools, he says. ""Basically, the system has taken everyone on and accommodated them. The first arrivals already have jobs,"" and have moved on with their lives, Clausen adds.There are around 11,000 cities and towns in Germany. Only a few can report as positive an experience as Bielefeld. In addition to more than one million Ukrainian war refugees, some 244,000 asylum-seekers arrived from elsewhere in 2022 — mainly from Syria, Afghanistan, Turkey, and Iraq.In Miltenberg, a district in Bavaria with a population of around 130,000 inhabitants, Green Party District Administrator Jens Marco Scherf calculates that he has had to take in more asylum-seekers than during the last major bout of arrivals in 2015. The limits of all municipal services have been reached, he says, and he cannot justify burdening the system further.Since the autumn, the small town has had to rent homes to accommodate refugees every week, the local government told DW. But there is a huge waiting list for housing, forcing refugees to live in emergency shelters for extended periods of time. In light of the situation his town is facing, Scherf has called on the federal and state governments to ""limit immigration."" This is exactly what the EU agreed to at its last summit: The borders are to become tighter, and those whose applications for asylum have been rejected are to be deported. This does not affect Ukrainians, however, who need not go through the asylum application procedure.But for other recent arrivals, there are other concerns. Integration is about more than just finding a place to live.In Lindau, a town in the far south of Germany, resources are becoming scarce, even for the city's own citizens. ""When refugees are no longer appropriately housed and cared for, teachers can no longer fulfill their duties properly, childcare options are lacking, gymnasiums are no longer available for schools or club sports — to name just a few examples — then the system is simply overloaded,"" local officials said.The idyllic town on Lake Constance has a population of around 81,000 and advertises itself with the slogan ""very close to paradise."" It is one of many municipalities that has been urgently demanding more help from the federal government for weeks. This is to be one of the main topics of discussion at a refugee policy summit on Thursday led by Germany's Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser.""We will not leave you on your own,"" promised Chancellor Olaf Scholz. In a speech to the German Bundestag, he assured state and local governments would continue to receive ""billions of euros to ensure that new arrivals are well taken care of,"" just as they had done last year.The chancellor, however, sidestepped making any concrete promises, even as many districts in Berlin complain that they are becoming overwhelmed with taking in more refugees.According to Hannes Schammann, Professor of Migration Policy at the University of Hildesheim, whether a municipality can cope with a rise in refugee numbers is a matter of experience.""Cities that created an infrastructure to deal with refugees in 2015 and then did not completely dismantle them are now in a better position,"" Schammann told DW.Belit Onay, mayor of the northern city of Hanover, confirmed this theory. ""After the attack on Ukraine began, we were able to create reception centers in, for example, exhibition halls (…) within a few days,"" he told DW. While he described the situation as ""challenging,"" he said it was still ""currently manageable by continuously working to increase capacity and through strong cooperation between different branches of the city administration.""After a refugee policy summit in the autumn of 2022, the federal government made 4,000 additional apartments available to Ukrainian refugees. However, only about two-thirds of those are occupied. The rest are buildings that had long stood empty and lacked, for example, electricity and water. They will hopefully become available in the near future.The Green Party, which rules in a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), has suggested making it easier for refugees to access the private housing market. Filiz Polat, the Greens' spokeswoman for migration policy in the Bundestag, has proposed changing a law that restricts most asylum-seekers from moving directly to private homes.As it stands, Ukrainians, but not most other refugees, are allowed to enter Germany and almost immediately move in with relatives or friends instead of having to wait for long processing periods in refugee centers. This is despite some 30% of other asylum-seekers already having relatives in Germany, Polat said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk, a public radio station.Miltenberg, for its part, said the proposal was ""worth considering,"" but would require proof that the relative or friend in question has enough space to properly accommodate the refugees.For Mayor Clausen in Bielefeld, more needs to be done to treat Ukrainian refugees and other asylum-seekers as equals, not just in housing. ""It is daft to create first- and second-class"" systems, he says. ""We should completely open up our social systems — as well as education and integration opportunities — to everyone who comes here.""For him, this also includes lifting the ban on asylum-seekers working for an extended period of time, and streamlining lengthy bureaucratic procedures for immigration officers. Like everywhere else in Germany, there is a growing shortage of skilled workers in Bielefeld. The faster refugees are integrated and trained, the more everyone would benefit, Clausen stresses.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/14,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812681,Norwegian aims for historic win for women in UEFA election,"GENEVA (AP) — Aiming to become one of the few women in world soccer politics to win an election against men, Norwegian Football Federation president Lise Klaveness is running for a seat on UEFA's executive committee.

            Klaveness was declared an official candidate Thursday, one of 11 European officials who are vying for seven available seats with a four-year mandate on the UEFA ruling committee.

            UEFA's executive committee has 20 members in total but currently includes only one woman — Florence Hardouin of France, who holds a seat that is especially reserved for women. No woman has ever been elected to a seat open for men.











            Klaveness is a lawyer and former national-team player who made a big impact at the FIFA Congress last year in Qatar with a speech directly addressing the World Cup host nation’s record on labor and human rights.

            Other candidates for the four-year terms include Andriy Pavelko of Ukraine and UEFA vice president Luis Rubiales of Spain, who are among four incumbents seeking to retain their seat. They are fronting their countries' combined bid with Portugal to host the 2030 World Cup.

            The election will be held at a meeting of UEFA's 55 member countries on April 5 in Lisbon, where Aleksander Ceferin will be unopposed for re-election to the presidency he has held since 2016.

            Hardouin is not running for re-election, and Klaveness’ decision to target the election against men left only one candidate for the seat reserved for a woman, Laura McAllister of Wales. McAllister is an academic and a former international player who helped lead a group of Welsh LGBTQ fans wearing rainbow hats at the World Cup in Qatar.

            Denmark’s soccer leader Jesper Møller is also a candidate to retain his UEFA seat. He said in Qatar at the World Cup that Denmark would not vote for FIFA president Gianni Infantino at an uncontested election in Rwanda on March 16.

            One of the biggest decisions facing the next UEFA executive committee is choosing hosts in September for the 2028 and 2032 editions of the men’s European Championship. The UK and Ireland is expected get Euro 2028 and Italy has been favored for 2032. Both are competing against Turkey.

            The UEFA executive committee also includes the Qatari president of Paris Saint-Germain, Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, who represents European clubs on the decision-making body.

            Two seats held by UEFA vice presidents Sándor Csanyi and Fernando Gomes have become vacant because they have reached the age limit of 70. Both are standing on April 5 for European seats on the FIFA Council because the world soccer body does not have age limits for candidates.

            Borussia Dortmund executive Hans-Joachim Watzke is the only candidate for a seat with a two-year mandate on the UEFA executive committee.

            Ceferin is eligible to be UEFA president for a total of 15 years through 2031 despite UEFA having a term limit of 12 years.

            An amendment was passed by UEFA that meant the first three years of his presidency — completing an unfinished mandate of Michel Platini, who was banned by FIFA for alleged financial wrongdoing — did not count against his 12-year limit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812684,School reverses urinal ban after bathroom access debate,"MILFORD, N.H. (AP) — A New Hampshire school board has reversed a policy banning middle and high school students from using urinals after dozens protested the measure, which had been a compromise to a proposal that would have blocked students from using facilities based on their gender identity.

            Students at Milford Middle School and Milford High School can still access the bathroom that “corresponds to their gender identity consistently asserted at school.""

            But at its Feb. 6 meeting, the school board debated a proposal that would require students to use the restroom and locker room of their assigned sex at birth. The proposal upset transgender students, gender nonconforming students and their supporters. 











            The ban on urinals approved by the board was offered as a compromise measure to the proposal. It also capped the maximum occupancy for bathrooms and locker rooms at the number of stalls each contains, and prohibited students from using shared changing areas. 

            Dozens of students walked out several days later. 

            Milford School District Superintendent Christi Michaud said school officials also received emails and phone calls opposing the ban, which led to Wednesday night's vote.

            “The board has listened to folks,” Michaud told WMUR-TV.

            Republicans across the country have been pushing anti-transgender legislation. While New Hampshire bans discrimination based on gender identity in housing, employment and public accommodations, state lawmakers are considering legislation that says public entities are capable of “differentiating between the male and female sexes in athletic competitions, criminal incarceration, or places of intimate privacy.”MILFORD, N.H.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812685,MATCHDAY: Napoli looks to widen lead; Lyon without Lacazette,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Friday:

            ITALY

            Napoli can move 18 points clear at the top of Serie A with a win at lowly Sassuolo. Victor Osimhen had a hat trick in Napoli's 4-0 win over Sassuolo in October. The Nigeria striker has scored eight goals in his past six league matches to take his tally to 17 in Serie A this season. Sassuolo is undefeated in its past four matches, including impressive wins over AC Milan and Atalanta, to inch away from the relegation zone but it is nevertheless only seven points clear of the bottom three.











            GERMANY

            It's a meeting of two established Bundesliga teams wary of relegation as American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo and Hoffenheim travel to Augsburg. Hoffenheim has been in the Bundesliga since 2008 and is 14th in the 18-team league. Augsburg, a top-division team since 2011, is one place higher. Matarazzo was hired last week to stabilize Hoffenheim but lost his first game 3-1 to Bayer Leverkusen to continue a winless run stretching back to October.

            FRANCE

            France striker Alexandre Lacazette is unavailable for Lyon’s trip to struggling Auxerre in the French league. Lyon’s top scorer injured his left thigh last weekend in a 2-1 win over Lens. Lyon will also be without coach Laurent Blanc, who has a lung infection. Blanc will be replaced by Franck Passi in the dugout. After a poor start to the season, Lyon seems to have found the right balance and has won three of its last four league games to move six points off the European places. Auxerre sits in 19th place after posting just three wins in 23 matches.

            SPAIN

            Almeria visits Girona seeking to break a two-game losing run against a team that will likely be a direct rival to avoid relegation. Both teams won promotion last season. Girona is in 11th place, but just two points above Almeria, which is only two points above the drop zone.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812686,Lonely tunes: Humpback whales wail less as population grows,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Those melancholy tunes sung by humpback whales may really be a sign of loneliness.

            Scientists who tracked humpback whales in Australia noticed that fewer whales wailed to find mates as their population grew.

            “Humpback whale song is loud and travels far in the ocean,” said marine biologist Rebecca Dunlop, who has studied humpback whales that breed near the Great Barrier Reef for more than two decades.











            As whale numbers dramatically rebounded following the end of commercial whaling — one of the world’s great conservation success stories — she noticed something unexpected.

            “It was getting more difficult to actually find singers,” said Dunlop, who is based at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. “When there were fewer of them, there was a lot of singing — now that there are lots of them, no need to be singing so much.”

            Scientists first began to hear and study the elaborate songs of humpback whales in the 1970s, thanks to new underwater microphones. Only male whales sing, and the tunes are thought to play a role in attracting mates and asserting dominance.

            Eastern Australia’s humpback whales were facing regional extinction in the 1960s, with only around 200 whales left. But numbers grew and reached 27,000 whales by 2015 — approaching estimated pre-whaling levels.

            As the density of whales increased, their courtship changed. While 2 in 10 males were singers in 2004, a decade later that ratio had dropped to just 1 in 10, Dunlop and colleagues report Thursday in the journal Nature Communications Biology. 

            Dunlop speculates that singing played an outsized role in attracting mates when populations were severely depleted.

            “It was hard just to find other whales in the area, because there weren’t many,"" she said. 

            When whales live in denser populations, a male looking for a mate also has to ward off the competition, and singing may tip off other suitors, she explained. 

            “As animal populations recover, they change their behavior — they have different constraints,” said marine biologist Boris Worm of Canada's Dalhousie University, who was not involved in the study.

            To be sure, the seas are still noisy. Many humpbacks woo with a combination of singing and physical jostling, the Australia researchers report. 

            “Such a big increase in animals over the time they were studying gave them a unique opportunity to get insights about changes in behavior,” said Simon Ingram, a University of Plymouth marine biologist in England, who not involved in the study.

            Ingram said that while humpback whales must have been singers long before whaling depleted their numbers, the new study highlights just how essential their elaborate and beautiful songs were to their survival and recovery. 

            “Clearly singing became incredibly valuable when their numbers were very low,” he said. ___

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812687,Prosecutor suspended by DeSantis asks court to reinstate him,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — An elected Florida prosecutor who says he was suspended by Gov. Ron DeSantis for political gain — and because he is a Democrat — is asking the state Supreme Court to reinstate him, citing a federal judge's ruling that DeSantis violated state law and his First Amendment rights. 

            Andrew Warren, a twice-elected state attorney for Hillsborough County, filed the appeal late Wednesday. It comes a month after a federal judge in Tallahassee dismissed his lawsuit on technical grounds while agreeing with Warren that the Republican governor fired him inappropriately.

            “We’re asking the Florida Supreme Court to affirm that finding and instruct the Governor to follow the law and reinstate me to office. We’re asking them to reiterate that no one is above the law — not even the Governor,” Warren said in a statement. He is also asking a federal appeals court to reinstate him. 











            The governor has refused to reinstate the Tampa-based prosecutor, and his press office did not immediately respond Thursday to an email and phone call seeking comment on the latest appeal. 

            No hearing date has been set. DeSantis appointed four of the seven Florida Supreme Court justices, with the other three appointed by his Republican predecessors. 

            Warren could also appeal his suspension to the Florida Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-12 advantage. 

            Warren is citing last month's ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle, who said that while federal law prevents him from returning Warren to office though a lawsuit centering on state law, he agreed that DeSantis' actions violated both Warren's First Amendment rights and the Florida Constitution. 

            Hinkle, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said the evidence showed that DeSantis had no basis to find Warren incompetent or derelict in his duties, the two reasons cited for the suspension. 

            Instead, DeSantis targeted Warren because he's a Democrat who has publicly supported abortion and transgender rights and because it would politically benefit him, Hinkle wrote. DeSantis is widely expected to run for president next year. 

            Hinkle called on DeSantis to voluntarily reinstate Warren “if the facts matter” to him. He said the governor and his staff never did a serious investigation of Warren before suspending him and ignored facts that argued against the dismissal. 

            The governor had accused Warren of incompetence and neglect of duty, arguing that the prosecutor was picking and choosing which laws to enforce, citing in his executive order the nonprosecution of crimes such as “trespassing at a business location, disorderly conduct, disorderly intoxication, and prostitution.”

            DeSantis’ executive order also cited Warren’s endorsement of statements from prosecutors across the country pledging to not bring criminal charges against people seeking, providing or supporting abortion access — and opposed the criminalization of gender transition treatments.

            No such cases were ever submitted to Warren, who has said that prosecutorial discretion over which cases to pursue and which to dismiss is a normal part of the job.FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812688,"YouTube CEO steps down, severing longtime ties to Google","Susan Wojcicki, a longtime Google executive who played a key role in the company's creation, is stepping down as YouTube's CEO after spending the past nine years running the video site that has reshaped entertainment, culture and politics.

            In an email to YouTube employees that was shared publicly Thursday, the 54-year-old Wojcicki said she is leaving to “start a new chapter focused on my family, health, and personal projects I’m passionate about."" She didn't elaborate on her plans.

            Neal Mohan, who has worked closely with Wojcicki for years, will replace her as YouTube's CEO.











            Although she became one of the most respected female executives in the male-dominated tech industry, Wojcicki will also be remembered as Google's first landlord.

            Shortly after Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin incorporated their search engine into a business in 1998, Wojcicki rented the garage of her Menlo Park, California, home to them for $1,700 a month.

            Page and Brin — both 25 at the time — continued to refine their search engine in Wojcicki's garage for five months before moving Google into a more formal office and later persuaded their former landlord to come work for their company.

            “It would be one of the best decisions of my life,"" Wojcicki wrote in the announcement of her departure. 

            In 2006, Google bought Wojcicki's home to serve as a monument to the roots of a company now valued at $1.2 trillion. During Wojcicki’s career at Google, Brin became her brother-in-law when he married her sister, Anne, in 2007. Brin and Anne Wojcicki divorced in 2015.

            Wojcicki's departure comes at a time when YouTube is facing one of its most challenging periods since Google bought what was then a quirky video site facing widespread complaints about copyright infringement in 2006 for an announced price of $1.65 billion. The all-stock deal was valued at $1.76 billion by the time the transaction closed.

            Although Google was initially derided for paying so much for a video service whose future appeared to be in doubt, it turned out to be a bargain. Besides becoming a cultural phenomenon that attracts billions of viewers, YouTube also has become a financial success with ad revenue totaling $29 billion last year. That was up from annual ad revenue of $8 billion in 2017 when Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., began to disclose YouTube's financial revenue.

            But YouTube's ad revenue during the final six months of last year dropped 5% from the previous year — the first extended downturn that the video service has shown since Alphabet peeled back its financial curtain. Analysts are worried the slump will continue this year, one of the reasons Alphabet's stock price has fallen 11% since it released its most recent quarterly report two weeks ago.

            Wojcicki is also leaving just days before the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a case threatening the freewheeling style that has long been one of YouTube's biggest advantages.

            The case stems from the 2015 death of an American woman killed in Paris during an attack by Islamic State in an incident that spurred the victim's family to file a lawsuit alleging YouTube’s algorithms aided the terror group’s recruitment. If the court decides that tech companies can be held liable for material posted on their sites, experts say the effects could not only destroy YouTube but shake up the entire internet.

            That’s because under the U.S. law, internet companies are generally exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act — itself part of a broader telecom law — provides a legal “safe harbor” for internet companies — a protection that YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen seized upon as an opportunity to launch as video site to “broadcast yourself.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812690,"Museum: London, Athens could share Parthenon Marbles in deal","LONDON (AP) — The chair of the British Museum said Thursday that the U.K. and Greece are working on a deal that would see his institution’s Parthenon Marbles displayed in both London and Athens.

            George Osborne said talks with the Greek government had been “constructive.”

            “I think there is a way forward where these sculptures ... could be seen both in London and in Athens, and that will be a win-win for Greece and for us,” he told the BBC.











            The antiquities, also known as the Elgin Marbles, mostly consist of the remnants of a frieze that ran around the outer walls of the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis in Athens.

            Carved in the 5th century BC, they were taken in the early 19th century by British diplomat Lord Elgin and ended up in the British Museum, which for decades rebuffed Greek demands for their return.

            Athens argues the sculptures were taken illegally when Greece was under Ottoman Turkish occupation and should be returned for permanent display beside the other surviving Parthenon sculptures that are in the Greek capital’s Acropolis Museum.

            The British Museum i nsists it will not break up its collection, but there has been a change of tone recently as museums around the world seek to address concerns about the way ancient artifacts were acquired during periods of imperial domination and colonial expansion.

            The museum has said it wants a “Parthenon partnership” with Greece.

            Osborne, a former U.K. Treasury chief, said he was “reasonably optimistic” about striking a deal, but cautioned that “it may well not come to anything.”

            “It’s a very hard problem to solve but I think there is a way forward,” he said.

            In December, Pope Francis said he would send back to Greece three smaller fragments of sculptures from the Parthenon that the Vatican Museums have held for two centuries.LONDON (AP) — The chair of the British Museum said Thursday that the U.K. and Greece are working on a deal that would see his institution’s Parthenon Marbles displayed in both London and Athens.George Osborne said talks with the Greek government had been “constructive.”“I think there is a way forward where these sculptures ... could be seen both in London and in Athens, and that will be a win-win for Greece and for us,” he told the BBC.The antiquities, also known as the Elgin Marbles, mostly consist of the remnants of a frieze that ran around the outer walls of the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis in Athens.Carved in the 5th century BC, they were taken in the early 19th century by British diplomat Lord Elgin and ended up in the British Museum, which for decades rebuffed Greek demands for their return.Athens argues the sculptures were taken illegally when Greece was under Ottoman Turkish occupation and should be returned for permanent display beside the other surviving Parthenon sculptures that are in the Greek capital’s Acropolis Museum.The British Museum i nsists it will not break up its collection, but there has been a change of tone recently as museums around the world seek to address concerns about the way ancient artifacts were acquired during periods of imperial domination and colonial expansion.The museum has said it wants a “Parthenon partnership” with Greece.Osborne, a former U.K. Treasury chief, said he was “reasonably optimistic” about striking a deal, but cautioned that “it may well not come to anything.”“It’s a very hard problem to solve but I think there is a way forward,” he said.In December, Pope Francis said he would send back to Greece three smaller fragments of sculptures from the Parthenon that the Vatican Museums have held for two centuries.",2023/02/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812691,Germany: Afghan brothers jailed for life for killing sister,"BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany convicted two Afghan men Thursday of killing their 34-year-old elder sister because they didn't agree with her lifestyle.

            The Berlin regional court found the men, aged 28 and 24, guilty of murder for killing the mother of two in July 2021. Her body was later found in a suitcase buried near where the older brother lived in Bavaria.

            Judges sentenced the men to life imprisonment. Announcing the verdict, presiding judge Thomas Gross said the men had sought to deny their sister the right to choose her own life and viewed her as “inferior” because she was a woman, German news agency dpa reported.











            The victim, who was divorced, had tried to start a new relationship that her brothers disagreed with.

            During the trial the older brother, Sayed Yousuf H., had claimed his sister Maryam H.'s death was an accident and his younger brother hadn't been involved. Lawyers for the younger brother, Seyed Mahdi H., had sought their client's acquittal.

            The surnames of the defendants and the victim, who all came to Germany as refugees, were not released for privacy reasons.

            In a separate case, a court in northern Germany convicted a 22-year-old German woman of being an accessory to manslaughter in the killing of a 27-year-old Iraqi man, identified only as Ceetin K.

            The asylum-seeker was killed in April 2017 by the woman's brother and then-boyfriend on the North Sea island of Amrum. His body was found buried in the dunes six months later. The men — both German citizens, have already been convicted of murder, with the brother receiving a seven-year sentence and the other man sentenced to life imprisonment.

            The Flensburg regional court concluded that the defendant, whose name wasn't released, had falsely told her then-boyfriend that Ceetin K. had raped her, resulting in the men's plan to kill him.

            It sentenced the woman Thursday to three years in prison, with three months already considered served due to the length of the court proceedings.

            She was sentenced as a juvenile due to the fact that she was 16 at the time of the killing. The court had sentenced her as an accessory to manslaughter, rather than accessory to murder, because she wasn't aware of the way in which Ceetin K. was to be killed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812692,Advocates chronicle LA's Virgin of Guadalupe street art,"LOS ANGELES (RNS) — There’s nothing that Oscar Rodriguez Zapata enjoys more than going out for a drive to explore Los Angeles’ vast neighborhoods in search of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

            But his biggest L.A. muse is the Virgin of Guadalupe, said Zapata. Murals, mosaics and other artwork depicting the brown-skinned virgin and patron saint of Mexico grace the walls of laundromats, liquor stores, mini markets, churches, bakeries, taquerias and tire shops.











            “Whenever you see a virgencita you feel safe. You know that your people, your gente, your raza are around,” said Zapata, 35, who, though raised Catholic, identifies as nonreligious. “It makes you feel welcome.”

            January marked 10 years since he began documenting images of Guadalupe, at first on his phone for his own pleasure, but eventually taking his hobby more seriously, particularly as he noticed more and more Guadalupe images were vanishing. In late 2017, he created an Instagram profile devoted to his photos of Guadalupe murals in order to preserve them. He now has more than 6,000 followers.

            Zapata focuses on examples of the Virgin on dilapidated buildings in need of a fresh coat of paint or the more intricate and colorful ones that take up entire wall space, as they risk succumbing to gentrification and displacement of Latino communities in L.A.

            The Virgin Mary, he said, “is much more than a religious symbol.”

            “It’s part of the community and part of who we are,” Zapata said.

            Our Lady of Guadalupe is celebrated in many Catholic parishes across Southern California on her feast day, Dec. 12, marking the appearance of Mary to St. Juan Diego, an Indigenous man, near Mexico City in 1531. But Guadalupe finds her way into shrines and murals in Latino neighborhoods year-round, and chroniclers like Zapata document her to pay homage to the culture, faith and traditions of their L.A. neighbors.

            Across Los Angeles, images of the Virgin are believed to thwart vandalism and act as “protector(s) of small immigrant-owned businesses,” according to journalist Sam Quinones’ 2016 book of photographs of murals of the saint, “The Virgin of the American Dream.”

            Quinones has seen business owners commission Virgin Mary artworks on their storefronts as “purely a commercial transaction,” he told an audience last April at “Guadalupe: Holy Art in the Streets of Los Angeles,” an event hosted by the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies at the University of Southern California.

            He spoke of Palestinian and Indian merchants who have put Guadalupe on their walls, with one man saying her image was meant “to show people that I’m with them … that I’m not some foreigner guy,” Quinones recalled.

            Neither Catholic nor religious, Quinones — a reporter who has covered crime and gangs in the United States and Mexico — said he sees the Virgin as “softening the harshness of life,” recalling that he has witnessed how people turned to her in the midst of violence. Once he started photographing her, he said, he became obsessed, turning his head every time he drove by a neighborhood market to see if he would spot a Guadalupe. 

            Between his reporting in Mexico and documenting Guadalupe in L.A., Quinones understood that images of the Virgin Mary served as a guiding force for undocumented Mexican immigrants “to find a way in this new world.”

            “All you’ve got are your guts, your wits and the Virgin of Guadalupe,” he said.

            Brenda Perez created the Restorative Justice for the Arts project to help restore and preserve what she calls “windows into the spiritual landscape” of L.A. A doctoral candidate in psychology, Perez has researched how sacred Indigenous symbols and community art can help heal trauma and resist discrimination. 

            “When murals with her image are whitewashed, it’s a sacrilegious act,” Perez said, recalling a Virgin Mary image on a liquor store wall that was recently painted over. “That’s something that everyone must respect because it’s a culture.”

            Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, said religious and political leaders must work to preserve public art, including murals of the Virgin of Guadalupe, that, she said, “shapes and grounds certain communities.”

            Images of Guadalupe, whether embodied in elaborate public murals or displayed on taco trucks, sanctify spaces and “invite us to think about how we can relate with each other across our differences,” said Flores, author of “The Aesthetics of Solidarity: Our Lady of Guadalupe and American Democracy.”

            Flores has explored how Guadalupe images shape Chicano communities in Denver, Colorado, where residents have used Guadalupe to stand against gentrification in their neighborhoods.

            She recalled asking Denver-based Chicano artist Carlos Fresquez about the significance of his Guadalupe artwork on the side of a liquor store. To the artist, the image was simply a way “to give a sense of place,” Flores said, adding that wherever Guadalupe is, “you will know that Mexicans, Mexican Americans, Chicanos are present there.”

            Illustrating her is a way of saying, “Our people are present here,” Flores said. Painting over or covering Guadalupe artwork, “feels like an affront to our dignity and personhood.”

            Growing up in the L.A. County city of Paramount, Nydya Mora, a youth librarian with a background in urban planning, said the Virgin of Guadalupe “was everywhere all the time.”

            “I just grew fascinated by the creativity that she inspired in people — the creation of these amazing, beautiful, unique murals,” said Mora, 33.

            In 2012, as she was wrapping up her undergraduate degree at Cal Poly Pomona, Mora began to capture Guadalupe street art, thinking of creating a coffee table book for her Catholic mother “to show an appreciation for our culture.” An Instagram account where she posts her photos of “artistic expressions of devotion in LA” has amassed more than 13,000 followers. Mora has also put together a Google map of her Virgin of Guadalupe sightings. 

            One of her more striking images shows a statue of the Virgin atop a bollard at a mini market parking lot in Compton. The shrine is embellished with votive candles and vases filled with flowers propped against the post.

            Her photographs are scheduled to appear later this year at a museum on the grounds of Forest Lawn Memorial Park, a cemetery in the city of Glendale.

            Mora, who grew up culturally Catholic but is not religious, said Guadalupe represents what she cherishes the most: “My mom, my culture and my cities.”

            “To see her (Guadalupe) in the streets of Los Angeles, that’s a form of pride for myself,” she said.

            Zapata agrees. On a recent Saturday in January, he drove to Boyle Heights in the city’s Eastside to shoot a spray-painted image of Mary on the side of Valerio Family Barbershop.

            George Valerio, part owner of the shop, said he commissioned the mural to pay homage to his family’s Catholic faith and to growing up Mexican in the San Gabriel Valley city of El Monte.

            Before heading out, Zapata marked the street and specific neighborhood where Guadalupe was featured. Simply captioning the location of the photo with ‘Los Angeles’ doesn’t fully capture its essence, Zapata said.

            “I want to represent the people in the community,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812693,Climate advocates urge World Bank overhaul as leader exits,"WASHINGTON (AP) — 

            Leading climate figures are urging the Biden administration to use the early departure of the Trump-appointed head of the World Bank as an opening to overhaul the powerful financial institution, which has been increasingly criticized as hostile to less-wealthy nations and efforts to address climate change.

            David Malpass announced Wednesday he would step down by June 30, about one year short of completing the five-year term to which President Donald Trump appointed him.











            Malpass had struggled to tamp down accusations that he was a climate-denier, after a 2022 interview in which he refused to say whether he accepted that fossil fuels were changing the world's climate, saying instead, “I'm not a scientist.”

            His many critics in the United States and abroad had accused the World Bank of continuing its financial support for fossil fuel projects and failing to move quickly enough to unleash funding for switching the world's economy from oil and coal to solar, wind and other climate-friendly renewables.

            Al Gore, a former vice president and leading environmentalist, was among those who welcomed Malpass' announcement. 

            “Humankind needs the head of the World Bank to fully recognize and creatively respond to the civilization-threatening danger posed by the climate crisis. I am very happy to hear that new leadership is coming,” Gore tweeted. “This must be the first step toward true reform that places the climate crisis at the center of the bank’s work.”

            Barbados government leaders at last November's Sharm el Sheikh U.N. climate conference gathered significant global support for calls to overhaul both the World Bank and International Monetary Fund so that nations in the Global South had ways to pay for switching to renewable energy and prepare for rising seas and other climate damage without taking on crushing debt.

            Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Malpass' support for fossil fuels and “abject failure to fund climate action"" was unacceptable. ""Now, the World Bank must make up for his missteps and get ready to be part of the solution for a liveable future,” Markey said in a tweet.

            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen credited Malpass with having made “important recent advances” to overcome the World Bank's image as an institution unfriendly to developing-world nations and to climate progress. 

            “We all must continue to raise our collective ambitions in the fight against climate change,” Yellen said in a statement.

            Malpass later expressed regret for his reluctance to directly acknowledge climate change and increasingly backed climate projects in recent months. 

            His reluctance was criticized at the time by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who said the Biden administration expected the World Bank “to be a global leader of climate ambition and mobilization.""

            Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has been among those calling financing for a fast switch to renewable energy essential to staving off the worst scenarios of climate change, and urging big changes in how the World Bank and IMF do business.

            Created along with the International Monetary Fund as World War II moved toward a close, the World Bank is charged with providing funding to low- and middle-income countries and other entities to promote sustainable development around the world.

            The U.S. traditionally picks the World Bank president, traditionally an American. Possible candidates mentioned by World Bank-watchers to succeed Malpass include Samantha Power, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Rajiv Shah, a former head of USAID.WASHINGTON (AP) —Leading climate figures are urging the Biden administration to use the early departure of the Trump-appointed head of the World Bank as an opening to overhaul the powerful financial institution, which has been increasingly criticized as hostile to less-wealthy nations and efforts to address climate change.David Malpass announced Wednesday he would step down by June 30, about one year short of completing the five-year term to which President Donald Trump appointed him.Malpass had struggled to tamp down accusations that he was a climate-denier, after a 2022 interview in which he refused to say whether he accepted that fossil fuels were changing the world's climate, saying instead, “I'm not a scientist.”His many critics in the United States and abroad had accused the World Bank of continuing its financial support for fossil fuel projects and failing to move quickly enough to unleash funding for switching the world's economy from oil and coal to solar, wind and other climate-friendly renewables.Al Gore, a former vice president and leading environmentalist, was among those who welcomed Malpass' announcement.“Humankind needs the head of the World Bank to fully recognize and creatively respond to the civilization-threatening danger posed by the climate crisis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812694,Gaudin to follow Caray as Braves' new play-by-play announcer,"ATLANTA (AP) — Brandon Gaudin, the former voice of Georgia Tech broadcasts, was selected the new play-by-play announcer for the Atlanta Braves on Bally Sports South and Bally Sports Southeast.

            Gaudin replaces Chip Caray, who on Jan. 30 was named the television play-by-play voice of the St. Louis Cardinals, following the path set by his grandfather, Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Caray.

            Gaudin has called MLB, NFL, college football and college basketball games for FOX Sports and the Big Ten Network for the last seven years. He has remained an Atlanta resident since calling football, men’s basketball and baseball games at Georgia Tech from 2013-16.











            Gaudin, a native of Evansville, Indiana, also serves as the play-by-play voice of Madden NFL for EA Sports.

            Gaudin said Thursday that moving to the Braves broadcast booth ""is the realization of a childhood dream.”

            “I get to be behind the mic for the team I grew up idolizing,"" Gaudin said. “And the team who fostered my love for both sports and broadcasting.”

            Braves president and CEO Derek Schiller said the team had ""a legendary lineup of broadcasters throughout our history and we are excited to find someone who is familiar with our past from growing up a Braves fan and respecting those who came before him.”

            On Wednesday, Diamond Sports, the parent company of 19 Bally Sports regional networks, skipped about $140 million in interest payments. The missed payments started a 30-day grace period that could be the prelude to a bankruptcy filing. Commissioner Rob Manfred said Major League Baseball is prepared for whatever happens to the financially troubled company, including taking over production of the broadcasts.

He has remained an Atlanta resident since calling football, men’s basketball and baseball games at Georgia Tech from 2013-16.Gaudin, a native of Evansville, Indiana, also serves as the play-by-play voice of Madden NFL for EA Sports.Gaudin said Thursday that moving to the Braves broadcast booth ""is the realization of a childhood dream.”“I get to be behind the mic for the team I grew up idolizing,"" Gaudin said. “And the team who fostered my love for both sports and broadcasting.”Braves president and CEO Derek Schiller said the team had ""a legendary lineup of broadcasters throughout our history and we are excited to find someone who is familiar with our past from growing up a Braves fan and respecting those who came before him.”On Wednesday, Diamond Sports, the parent company of 19 Bally Sports regional networks, skipped about $140 million in interest payments. The missed payments started a 30-day grace period that could be the prelude to a bankruptcy filing. Commissioner Rob Manfred said Major League Baseball is prepared for whatever happens to the financially troubled company, including taking over production of the broadcasts.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/17,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4812695,Average long-term US mortgage rate jumps to 6.32% this week,"The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate jumped this week to its highest level in five weeks, bad news for home shoppers heading into the spring buying season.

            Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate rose to 6.32% from 6.12% last week. The average rate a year ago was 3.92%.

            The average long-term rate reached a two-decade high of 7.08% in the fall as the Federal Reserve continued to raise its key lending rate in a bid to cool the economy and and bring down stubborn, four-decade high inflation.











            At its first meeting of 2023 earlier this month, the Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by another 25 basis points, its eighth increase in less than a year. That pushed the central bank’s key rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years.

            Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that some measures of inflation have eased, but he appeared to suggest that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes this year.

            Though those rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investors’ expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.

            The big rise in mortgage rates during the past year has clobbered the housing market, with sales of existing homes falling for 11 straight months to the lowest level in more than a decade. Higher rates can add hundreds of a dollars a month in costs for homebuyers, on top of already high home prices.

            The National Association of Realtors reported earlier this month that existing U.S. home sales totaled 5.03 million last year, a 17.8% decline from 2021. That is the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since 2008, during the housing crisis of the late 2000s.

            The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, climbed this week to 5.51%, from 5.25% last week.
