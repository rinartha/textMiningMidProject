https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799700,Chinese balloon soars across US; Blinken scraps Beijing trip,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A huge, high-altitude Chinese balloon sailed across the U.S. on Friday, drawing severe Pentagon accusations of spying on sensitive military sites despite China's firm denials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly canceled a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing U..S.-China tensions.Aside from the government response, fuzzy videos dotted social media as people with binoculars and telephoto lenses tried to find the “spy balloon” in the sky as it headed southeastward over Kansas and Missouri at 60,000 feet (18,300 meters).It was spotted earlier over Montana, which is home to one of America’s three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Defense officials said.The U.S. actually had been tracking the balloon since at least Tuesday, when President Joe Biden was first briefed, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. According to three U.S. officials, Biden was initially inclined to order the surveillance balloon to be blown out of the sky, and a senior defense official said the U.S. had prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, to shoot it down if ordered.The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, strongly advised Biden against shooting down the balloon, warning that its size — as big as three school buses — and considerable weight could create a debris field large enough to endanger Americans on the ground. The Pentagon also assessed that after unspecified U.S. measures, the possibility of the balloon uncovering important information was not great.It was not the first time Chinese surveillance balloons have been tracked over U.S. territory, including at least once during former President Donald Trump’s administration, officials said.Blinken's trip cancellation came despite China’s claim that the balloon was merely a weather research “airship” that had blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand — as well as China's contention that the balloon was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability.Blinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was “an irresponsible act and that (China's) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.”After passing the sensitive military sites in Montana, the balloon was moving southeastward over the heartland of the central United States during the day and was expected to remain in U.S. airspace for several days, officials said.The development marked a new blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years over numerous issues. Still, U.S. officials maintained that diplomatic channels remain open and Blinken said he remained willing to travel to China “when conditions allow.”“We continue to believe that having open lines of communication is important,"" he said.Biden declined to comment on the matter when questioned at an economic event. Two likely 2024 reelection challengers, Trump, and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, said the U.S. should immediately shoot down the balloon.Several Republican congressmen said the same, and a number blasted the administration for “allowing” the balloon intrusion.“The idea that Communist China has a spy balloon headed towards Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri right now — the home of the Stealth Bomber — is absolutely unbelievable,” said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. “No American should accept this. I don’t.”Jean-Pierre did not shed light on why the administration waited until Thursday to make its concerns public.Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, refused to say on Friday whether there was any new consideration of shooting the balloon down. He said it currently was posing no threat.Ryder said it was maneuverable, not just at the mercy of the wind, and had changed course.Still, weather experts said China’s claim that the balloon had gone off course was not unfeasible. China’s account of wind patterns known as the Westerlies carrying a balloon to the western United States was “absolutely possible - not possible, likely,” said Dan Jaffe, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Washington.As for Blinken's trip, Jean-Pierre said a diplomatic visit to China was not appropriate at such a time. She said that ""the presence of this balloon in our airspace ... is a clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law and it is unacceptable this occurred.”A State Department official said Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman had both protested to the top official at the Chinese Embassy on Wednesday, a day before the Pentagon announced the discovery of the balloon.Blinken’s long-anticipated meetings with senior Chinese officials had been seen in both countries as a possible way to find some areas of common ground at a time of major disagreements over Taiwan, human rights, China’s claims in the South China Sea, North Korea, Russia’s war in Ukraine, trade policy and climate change.Although the trip, which was agreed to in November by Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in Indonesia, had not been formally announced, officials in both Beijing and Washington had spoken in recent days about Blinken’s imminent arrival for meetings on Sunday and Monday.China, which angrily denounces surveillance attempts by the U.S. and others over areas it considers to be its territory and once forced down an American spy plane and held its crew captive on Hainan Island, was relatively conciliatory in its response to the U.S. complaints.In a statement that approached an apology, the Chinese foreign ministry said the balloon was a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research. It said said the airship had limited “self-steering” capabilities and had “deviated far from its planned course” because of winds.“The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure,” the statement said, citing a legal term used to refer to events beyond one’s control.",2023/02/04,1430,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799710,Is EU ready for life without Russian diesel?,"On Sunday, the European Union will join the United States and the United Kingdom in stopping imports of Russian diesel and other refined oil products, as it looks to end its energy ties with Moscow which for years had been its biggest source of energy.The ban is coupled with a price cap on Russian refined fuel, aimed at hurting Russian revenue while ensuring the EU fuel embargo doesn't end up driving up global diesel prices which are already high.The oil products embargo comes two months after a similar ban on Russian crude oil brought in by sea — both announced in June as part of the EU's sixth sanctions package against Russia in response to Moscow's ""brutal and unprovoked attack on Ukraine.""While the crude oil embargo and the oil price cap which came into effect on December 5 passed off without any major disruption, the ban on refined fuels — in particular, diesel with its wide industrial and domestic usage — has pushed the market into uncertainty amid historically low diesel stocks in Europe.""The crude is oil more fungible,"" said Eugene Lindell and Joshua Folds from FGE energy consultancy. ""It's much more difficult to produce diesel/gasoil whereas, for crude oil, the upstream production is much more varied on a global scale. There's a lot more kind of crude in the market and there potentially is diesel/gasoil,"" they told DW.That would largely depend on how successful the European countries are in finding alternative sellers to help fill up the void caused by the ban and how effective Moscow is in finding new markets for its fuel shunned by the EU. If those two things happen, then the impact on supply and prices would be muted and short-lived.If not, then the sanction could lead to major disruptions in diesel-reliant industries such as transportation and agriculture, with fuel price rises further undermining the fight against inflation.The perceived disruption is already driving up diesel prices, which already have been stubbornly high over the past year and a half. While the situation has improved in recent months due to a mild winter, diesel stocks remain at uncomfortable levels.Diesel prices could climb further in the short term to reflect an increase in shipping costs as supplies would now need to come from regions further afield, higher production costs in countries such as the US and the risk premium.""The market is very sensitive right now and very worried,"" the FGE analysts told DW. ""The world still has to see that those Russian flows do get rerouted and that there is not a sustainable disruption to Russian flows. Once the market recognizes that, then the risk premium and the sentiment levels should go lower.""The EU relied on Russia for nearly half its diesel needs before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. That share dropped over the past year but remained significant with EU members buying in excess of 200 million barrels of diesel last year, according to energy analytics firm Vortexa.In fact, in the run-up to the ban, the bloc increased its purchases from the country to pre-invasion levels in preparation to wean itself off Russian fuel, something Kevin Wright, an analyst from energy data firm Kpler, described as the ""last hurrah"" before the embargo kicked in. ""The last chance to buy from the nearest large source, keeping freight costs down compared to supply from further afield,"" he wrote in an analysis on Kpler's website.The ban has left the EU with a void of about 600,000 barrels of diesel and related oil products per day, a gap that the EU intends to plug with increased supplies from the Middle East, Asia and the US. With its own refining capacity under duress, the EU has already been relying on those regions over the past months to make up for the shortfall.That dependence is only likely to increase with the ramp-up of large refineries such as the Al-Zour plant in Kuwait and the Jazan refinery in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Germany has inked a deal with UAE's Abu Dhabi National Oil Co that would see the oil firm provide 250,000 tons of diesel a month in 2023.The bloc could also benefit from so-called washing, wherein Russian diesel would be blended with other non-Russian products in countries such as Turkey and re-exported back into Europe.India and China, which have emerged as the biggest buyers of Russian crude oil in the last 12 months, could play a big role in shoring up the EU's diesel stocks.India's diesel exports to Europe have soared since the invasion as refiners take advantage of low feedstock costs thanks to steeply discounted Russian crude and high diesel prices.In a sign of times to come, last year, when workers' strikes shut down the French refining sector, the EU saw a surge in diesel and related products imports from India, which isn't a traditional supplier of the fuel to Europe.China has raised its first batch of 2023 export quotas for diesel and other refined oil products, exports of which have surged in recent months. The move is expected to keep its diesel exports at record levels, which could potentially help push barrels from other producers westward into Europe.""China policy is the game changer,"" said Mark Williams, a research director at Wood Mackenzie, adding in a note to clients that the country ""holds the key to all of the surplus refining capacity globally.""Russia has managed to keep its crude oil flowing, largely with support from India and China, who have snapped up the oil shunned by Moscow's traditional European buyers at huge discounts. However, rerouting its diesel away from its largest market could be more challenging in the absence of a ready market for Russian fuel.Experts expect Russian diesel earlier sold to Europe to be diverted to Turkey and countries in Latin America and Africa.""Russia has already been forced to discount its diesel heavily to get it sold to people that don't necessarily need it,"" Lindell said.Lindell, who is the head of refined products at FGE, expects a large portion of the Russian diesel to reach Turkey and then be rebranded and reexported into Europe as ""Turkish diesel."" Turkey has seen a big rise in diesel imports from Russia in the past months.""There are countries that are willing to accommodate and to take discounted barrels,"" Lindell said, a reason why FGE doesn't see a decline in Russian oil product exports in 2023.Yet, there are others who say Russia would struggle to relocate all of its diesel and might be forced to cut output.The European Commission has proposed that the European Union set a $100 (€91) per barrel price cap on Russian diesel and a $45 per barrel cap on discounted products like fuel oil.The price cap is meant to ensure that Russian diesel and other oil products can still be sold to third countries and prevent any massive spike in prices following the EU ban by ensuring that key European insurance and shipping firms continue offering their services to shippers carrying Russian oil products to third countries as long as the fuel is purchased at or below an agreed cap level.The oil products price cap would have minimal impact on Russian refining crude runs and distillate exports,  Wood Mackenzie's Williams said, adding that with Russian crude prices as low as $40 a barrel refining margins would still remain strong.""At these levels, Russian refining economics are still very strong, so the incentive to refine crude into oil products remains high,"" Williams said.The price cap mirrors a similar measure put in place for Russian crude. The crude oil price cap of $60 a barrel has helped keep Russian oil flowing but at steep discounts, as was intended.Edited by: Uwe Hessler",2023/02/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799711,China 'spy balloon:' Why doesn't the Pentagon shoot it down?,"""This is all just supposition. No one really knows,"" said Malcolm Macdonald, an internationally recognized space technology engineer and professor at the University of Strathclyde Glasgow in Scotland.And it's important to point that out at the start. We don't know a lot about the technology behind the balloon, or, indeed, whether it is or is not a Chinese spy balloon as alleged by US military and security officials.What we know for sure, said Macdonald, is what the Americans have said publicly.""The Americans have said the Chinese have done this, they've flown over Guan and Hawaii [in the Pacific], it's been over the USA and Canada for a few days now, it was spotted on Thursday by a member of the public and the military has had a look and said, 'Yes, that's what it is.'""Macdonald said images of the balloon suggest it has solar panels that could power fans to steer it, but other than that, it would be nothing more than a standard helium balloon that may have drifted in the wind.Things got trickier, however, when we spoke about the possible surveillance technology onboard, what the Chinese would hope to achieve, if indeed this is a Chinese craft, and why the US has not shot it down.US officials say they have a high level of confidence that the balloon is Chinese, but are not saying why.It was sighted over the US state of Montana, which borders Canada, having flown over the Aleutian Islands, most of which belong to the US state of Alaska. Some belong to Russia.The AFP news agency quotes a senior Pentagon official as saying the balloon was now over ""a number of sensitive sites"" — and that was possibly in reference, wrote AFP, to nuclear missile silos in Montana.""Clearly, they're trying […] to collect information,"" the official added, but added that the balloon's technology was not ""revolutionary"" and that its observations were unlikely to be better than what China was capable with its spy satellites.China, meanwhile, said on Friday that the balloon was an unmanned civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research and said it had been blown off course.In low-Earth orbit, which is at an altitude of about 250-300 kilometers (155-186 miles) in the sky, ""the Chinese can image down to a special resolution of probably about 15 centimeters per pixel,"" said Macdonald. ""If you bring that down to 20-30 kilometers altitude, where the balloon is, you're potentially talking one centimeter per pixel.""But the imaging equipment may just be standard camera technology that anyone can buy online, said Macdonald. And they are unlikely to be using radar technology, which can see through clouds.""The Chinese will have to have assumed that the Americans would shoot it down and that they would try to recover all of the electronics onboard and reverse engineer it,"" said Macdonald. ""Therefore, they're not going to put their best capability onto it, because they wouldn't want to just hand it over to the Americans.""However, spy balloons do have at least one advantage over satellites in espionage.""Satellites have a very predictable motion, so you know when they are going to be overhead,"" said Macdonald, ""so, a balloon offers an element of surprise. You might get a chance to image something that [the others] didn't expect you to be able to see. But at the same time, it would be odd for the Americans not to spot a balloon entering their airspace.""A statement released by the U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday said ""we assess that this balloon has limited additive value from an intelligence collective collection perspective, but we are taking steps, nevertheless, to protect against foreign intelligence collection of sensitive information.""That could, said Macdonald, hint at the balloon's surveilling radio signals intelligence.""There will be radio frequency emissions coming off the missile silos that the balloon is flying over and they probably can't pick them up from low-Earth orbit as they are probably too weak,"" said Macdonald. ""But being 20-30 kilometers above them, the balloon may be able to pick up some radio signals that they couldn't get from orbit.""If the Americans know it's there, said Macdonald, they could turn off all the computers off and bring stuff indoors. ""But it is still an inconvenience.""The balloon has flown over vastly unpopulated areas, so the Americans could have shot it down.They have said, though, that they are concerned about debris falling to the ground. And that is plausible, but concerns over public safety may not be the main reason.Shooting it down would be ""relatively easy — you burst the balloon and it comes down,"" said Macdonald, ""but, ideally, you'd want to catch it before it hits the ground because if it hits the ground, [the electronics onboard] will shatter.""The Americans will want to avoid that happening, so that they can work out what was onboard. It may, then, be a case of their waiting for the best opportunity to shoot and catch the balloon.And if they do shoot it down, it has enough weight for it to drop straight down.""We've done flights with helium balloons. They drift in the wind to about 15-20 kilometers and then they go straight up, more or less. They then come straight down, with a very slight drift. So, as they come down, the wind catch them, but it is more or less straight down,"" said Macdonald.That drift may be over an area of about 100 kilometers, ""but that's relatively confined,"" said Macdonald, and one which pales compared to the 1,400 km over which Australian authorities scoured to find a radioactive capsule.The other option is still that the US just lets the balloon go. They have done that before. They won't want China to know they can see the balloon, they won't want to confirm what they have in their air defense system, said Macdonald.So, the question remains as to why the Chinese would have done this. ""Perhaps there's a sense that the botched COVID-exit has weakened President Xi Jinping and this may be him wanting to project some strength,"" suggested Macdonald.Edited by: Rob Mudge",2023/02/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799713,Can Blinken's visit help recalibrate US-China relations?,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is embarking on a two-day trip to China this weekend in a bid to ease tensions and improve ties between the two countries.The visit, from February 5 to 6, is a follow-up to the meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali in November.In Beijing, Blinken is expected to meet President Xi, and hold talks with high-ranking Chinese officials on a raft of contentious topics.""You have all of the issues in the relationship and both sides will have their inputs into the discussion,"" said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior fellow at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and a former US defense official. ""The agenda will be comprehensive.""On Thursday, days ahead of the visit, the Pentagon said a Chinese spy balloon has been flying over the US for a couple of days. Washington officials said a decision was made not to shoot the balloon down because of the risk of falling debris.It was not clear how the development might affect Blinken's trip.Besides the balloon issue, the war in Ukraine, growing tensions around Taiwan and the US-China high-tech rivalry will likely top the agenda.""From the US side, Russia's war against Ukraine will certainly be touched,"" said Sari Arho Havren, a visiting researcher at the University of Helsinki specializing in China's foreign policy.""Taiwan remains the obvious red line issue, and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang would like to see Blinken reaffirm the 'one-China' policy. In addition, US policies to curb Chinese companies from acquiring certain high-end semiconductors will likely be on the agenda,"" she told DW.On Tuesday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby revealed that Blinken will bring up Russia's war in Ukraine during his visit to Beijing.He said one of the major goals of the visit is to restore and revitalize communication channels on military, climate change and many other issues, which were suspended by Beijing in the wake of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan last August.""This is the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world,"" Kirby said.Meanwhile, the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged the US to work together with Beijing and let their interactions be defined by dialogue and cooperation, rather than confrontation and zero-sum competition.""At the same time, we will firmly defend our sovereignty, security and development interests,"" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning, adding that Beijing wouldn't shy away from the competition.Zhiqun Zhu, a professor of political science at Bucknell University in the United States, views the issue of Taiwan as the most sensitive, yet critical, topic on the agenda.""The two sides lack basic trust on the Taiwan issue and may be sleepwalking into war,"" he said. ""The Chinese side complains that the US government does not strictly follow 'one-China' and is hyping the Chinese threat in the Taiwan Strait. The US side complains that Beijing is planning to alter the Taiwan Strait status quo by force.""Last week, a US air force general predicted that a military conflict over Taiwan could break out between Washington and Beijing as early as 2025. The Pentagon immediately said it doesn't represent the Biden administration's official position.To ease the tensions over Taiwan, Zhu said, the US needs to reassure China about its commitment to the one-China policy, while Beijing needs to scale down military pressure on Taipei.Beijing's refusal to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and deepening economic ties with Moscow, is another irritant in US-China ties.Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in China, said Beijing will surely deny that the increase in its imports of Russian oil and gas over the past ten months has any military implications.Havren from the University of Helsinki said that the US ""is watching carefully if China helps Russia in any way that benefits its war against Ukraine.""Last month, the US determined that some Chinese companies were providing non-lethal assistance to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine. ""I think the topic will certainly be brought up,"" Havren noted.""Whether Beijing will rein in these companies from continuing to deal with Russia, and whether Washington will get assurances of China's neutrality in not helping Russia in its war on Ukraine, is something to watch,"" she told DW.The US is also working together with Japan and the Netherlands to try to limit China's access to semiconductor technology, including advanced chip-making equipment.Beijing has slammed Washington's move, saying that the US is ""abusing export controls"" and ""politicizing technology and trade issues.""Zhu from Bucknell University said China will likely accuse the US of abusing national security laws and forming small ""cliques"" to counter Beijing's rise in a ""new Cold War.""""President Biden said the US wouldn't engage in a new Cold War with China, but one only sees competition in the relationship and a new Cold War seems to be unfolding,"" he said, adding that Beijing will view US efforts to cut China's access to advanced technologies with ""great suspicion.""Despite the tensions and mutual distrust, both sides will likely try to resume dialogue on issues like climate change, said Deborah Seligsohn, a political scientist at Villanova University in the US.""I'm sure they will discuss climate change during the meeting and I hope they will find a way not just to restart the dialogue, but to get more working-level interactions on a range of environment, science, and health issues.""Havrén, however, said the most plausible outcome of Blinken's visit will likely be to keep the communication channels open. ""It will include re-establishing at least some of the bilateral communication channels.""Every Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

            The shooting happened about 10:30 p.m. Thursday, just south of downtown. The officers were initially listed in critical but stable condition. In an update Friday afternoon, police said a 24-year-old officer was in stable condition after being shot in the torso and an arm. A 38-year-old officer was shot in the torso and was treated at a hospital and released.

            The 36-year-old suspect was shot in the ankle. He was treated and released into custody. He has not yet been charged. Police say a gun was recovered at the scene.











            Officers spotted a pickup truck that fit the description of a vehicle used in a robbery, police said in a news release. The truck fled when officers tried to make a traffic stop, and crashed near the well-known Soulard Market, not far from the Anheuser-Busch brewery.

            A suspect emerged from the vehicle and fired several shots at officers, striking them and their car, police said. The officers returned fire, hitting the suspect.

            “Let's all remember that this is a dangerous job that we do,” Police Commissioner Robert Tracy said at a news conference immediately after the shooting.

            Two other St. Louis officers escaped injury after being shot at Tuesday night. Police said a speeding Jeep Renegade cut in front of a police vehicle. A passenger in the back seat of the Jeep leaned out and fired several shots. Both detectives in the police vehicle were unhurt. The Jeep was able to get away.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799716,Pakistan PM warns of 'tough time' to fulfill IMF conditions,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan's prime minister on Friday warned of a “tough time"" as his government struggles to comply with conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for the next tranche of the country's bailout package. 

            Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif addressed an auditorium of top government and military officials in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where a massive suicide bombing at a mosque inside a high security police and government compound on Monday killed 101 people and wounded 225. Most of the casualties were police.

            The attack raised serious questions about the ability of Pakistan's security forces to deal with the recent surge in militancy in the volatile northwest, along the border with Afghanistan. 











            Sharif spoke just days after IMF officials and Pakistan’s Finance Minister Ishaq Dar resumed talks in the capital, Islamabad, on its bailout — even as the country's foreign reserves dwindle further, and are now at the dangerously low level of $3 billion. 

            Analysts say there is barely enough to pay the imports bill for the next three weeks. 

            Pakistan is seeking a crucial installment of $1.1 billion from the fund — part of its $6 billion bailout package — to avoid default. Talks with the IMF on reviving the bailout had stalled in the past months. 

            The IMF gave the finance minister a “very tough time” in the talks, Sharif said. 

            “Our economic challenges at the moment are unimaginable,"" he added. “The IMF conditions which we have to fulfill ... are beyond the imagination. ... But wee we don't have any other option.""

            Later Friday, Pakistan's currency slipped further, with the rupee trading at 270 to the dollar as the markets closed. Last week it traded at 255 for $1.

            Sharif has repeatedly pledged that his government will not default but will manage to secure the loan from the IMF. 

            Along with the unprecedented economic crisis, Pakistan is also struggling in the aftermath of last summer’s devastating floods that caused up to $40 billion in damages, making it difficult for the government to comply with some of the IMF’s conditions, including increases in the price of gas and electricity and new taxes.

            Sharif has often blamed the former premier, Imran Khan, and his government for the economic malaise. Khan was ousted in a no-confidence in Parliament in April, and has since been campaigning for early elections.ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan's prime minister on Friday warned of a “tough time"" as his government struggles to comply with conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for the next tranche of the country's bailout package.Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif addressed an auditorium of top government and military officials in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where a massive suicide bombing at a mosque inside a high security police and government compound on Monday killed 101 people and wounded 225.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799717,Worries abound that Mexico’s Maya Train will destroy jungle,"CALAKMUL BIOSPHERE RESERVE, Mexico (AP) — Miguel Ángel Díaz walks slowly so his footfall on dry leaves doesn’t drive away what he's trying to find in this dense forest of seeded breadnut and sapodilla trees. Coming to a small wetland, a sign warns: Beware of the crocodile.

            Díaz, a tourist guide, shines a laser pointer at a woodpecker and a toucan, and then moves it over to the blue tail of a Yucatecan jay. He learned years ago to decipher the sounds of the Calakmul jungle in Mexico's southern Yucatan. 

            Although it's high season, this recent morning Díaz had a hard time finding tourists to guide. Last year, just over 50,000 visitors came to Calakmul, home to an ancient Mayan city that today is a UNESCO world heritage site. 











            Díaz knows many more people will soon come. 

            “There will be more jobs for us guides,” said Díaz, from the shade of a tree full of lianas. “But it’s going to be a heavy blow to nature.”

            Some 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the crocodile wetland, bulldozers are felling the jungle for the Maya Train, a $20 billion dollar project envisioned by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. A path 40 meters (130 feet) wide is making way for the train, and logs are stacked along the narrow road to the hidden archaeological site. Currently, from the top of nearly-deserted pyramids, the roar of howler monkeys sounds across a sea of green.

            The Maya Train is intended to drive economic development to some of the country's poorest areas, in part by bringing up to three million tourists each year.

            Fonatur, the national tourism agency, says the train will address a lack of transport infrastructure in the country's southeast that has meant “not all our tourist destinations have been fully developed.” There will be 20 stations along the ride, where hotels and commercial markets are planned. It will also be a cargo route for fuel and farm products.

            The 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) of rail will pass through unique ecosystems, including the limestone formations filled with freshwater known as cenotes along the Mayan Riviera. This raised a wave of criticism and lawsuits last year that got international attention and temporarily halted the work. 

            Now the focus has shifted to this section that crosses the intact Calakmul jungle, which is part of the larger Mayan jungle, the largest tropical forest in the Americas after the Amazon. 

            “I’m not against the train, but for a megaproject of this type, planning normally takes more than 10 years,” said British primatologist Kathy Slater, who has been working in Calakmul for a decade with the organization Operation Wallacea. “But this is without planning, it’s crazy, they're not thinking about the impacts.”

            The president wants the train rolling by the end of this year, when his term ends, designating it a matter of “national security” so as to speed up the environmental and public hearing requirements. The army was put in charge of certain sections, including the one that crosses Calakmul.

            A regional Indigenous council filed a complaint over lack of proper consultation and a judge agreed, issuing a stop work order that applied to the nearest city, Xpujil. 

            “They only talked about the benefits of the megaproject, not about the impacts or the damages,"" said Jesús León Zapata, a member of the Xpujil Indigenous Council. The United Nations human rights office warned in December that the national security decree threatened the rights of Indigenous peoples.

            The Associated Press observed work in progress in Xpujil during a trip in January. The president has said several times the national security designation legally allows the work to continue.

            “They haven’t complied with court orders,” said Gustavo Alanís, executive director of the Mexico Environmental Law Center. “It’s a serious thing.”

            The train's path crosses the property of Norma Rosado. From her house with wooden planks and a tin roof, she said the government paid her the equivalent of $5,800. Officials also have promised to improve the roads and, most important to her, to repair the water main, which only delivers water a few hours two days a week, leaving Rosado and her husband to collect as much as they can in an array of tanks on the patio.

            The area has always been forgotten, said Omar Hernández, Norma’s husband, “and from that point of view whatever they give us is significant. But these benefits are small scale because we're just farmers, we can't build hotels. Those will be built by investors."" 

            Hernández hopes to sell organic honey he produces to tourists. He had to relocate his hives though, worried the heavy machinery would scare them away. Hernández, a big man, looks small as he walks through the new clearcut that runs through their land.

            Slater, the primatologist at the University of Liverpool, said that for years environmental officials and non-profits have been trying to convince people to stop raising livestock and instead switch to beekeeping to preserve the forest. 

            “It’s sad” that those efforts could be hindered, said Slater. 

            For the biologist Rodrigo Medellín, at Mexico's largest university, UNAM, the railway simply should not pass through there. “It is going to irreversibly fragment one of the country's most important strongholds for biodiversity,” he said. 

            The Calakmul region is home to one of the most important jaguar populations in Mesoamerica, more than 350 species of birds and one hundred mammals, plus other endangered species — the tapir, puma and ocellated turkey. 

            “I have seen with my own eyes troops of spider monkeys coming through the canopy and suddenly reach the clearcut and there is no way for them to cross,” he said.

            Fonatur proposes 126 wildlife crossings along this section, but only six would be elevated, which large mammals need, said Medellín, known by many as Mexican Batman because of his expertise in bats. 

            As one approaches Volcan de los Murcielagos, a cave that is home to three million bats, the smell of guano gets more intense.

            The first buzz is soft, like that of a hornet’s nest. From the mouth of the cave, 50 meters (165 feet) deep, thousands of bats emerge in a tornado that reaches the sky and covers it with a blanket of black. 

            All agriculture in the southern Yucatan benefits from them because the bats eat 30 tons of insects nightly, controlling pests on corn, chile and bean fields. Yet one version of the rail plan had the tracks passing 700 meters (less than a half mile) from the bat cave. No one is certain of the current plan; there have been many versions. Fonatur communications manager Fernando Vázquez said the agency is not commenting on this section of the Maya Train right now. 

            In the more than 2,100 pages of environmental impact report for this one section of the railway, the cave is not mentioned. It does say the construction will have “severe adverse” impacts on protected species and will cause “habitat fragmentation,” but concludes the project is environmentally “viable” because these effects can be mitigated. The plan is to reforest 74 hectares (183 acres), about ten percent of the 730 hectares (1800 acres) that will be cut down.

            Some of that will be in the Valentin Gomez Farias communal farmlands. Residents there created an ecotourism project nine years ago that has visitors staying in tents under roofs of woven palm. Guests kayak in a lagoon, hike and observe wildlife as part of a project set up with camera traps.

            With the Maya Train coming through, complete with hotel and tourism complexes, José Antonio Guzmán Hernández, who leads the project, fears Calakmul will turn into something more like Cancun or Tulum.

            “We were always trying to keep that from happening,” he said. “But with all this now it feels like it will be like a bomb, it's going to explode.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799719,2 plead guilty to disrupting flight diverted to Maine,"BANGOR, Maine (AP) — Two men from England pleaded guilty to federal charges that they interfered with a flight crew during a tussle that resulted in a flight from Mexico being diverted to Maine.

            The men became unruly and made racist remarks after they were told they would not be served any more alcohol, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday. They interfered with members of the flight crew and flight attendants, and the flight from Mexico to England was diverted to Bangor International Airport in Maine, the department said.

            The men pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Bangor to interference with a flight crew and assault. The Justice Department said the men face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for the interference, which is the top charge.











            The Justice Department said the unscheduled landing caused TUI Airways to incur more than $25,000 in costs.

            The two English men were removed from the plane and arrested at the time. A third passenger was also removed but not charged.BANGOR, Maine (AP) — Two men from England pleaded guilty to federal charges that they interfered with a flight crew during a tussle that resulted in a flight from Mexico being diverted to Maine.The men became unruly and made racist remarks after they were told they would not be served any more alcohol, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799720,Street honoring KKK leader renamed after student-led effort,"MALVERNE, N.Y. (AP) — A street that honored a leader of the Ku Klux Klan in New York has a new name after a yearslong campaign led by high school students.

            The village board of Malverne, on Long Island, voted last year to rename Lindner Place, named after Paul Lindner, a banker who helped develop the village more than a century ago and also served as great titan of the New York State Klan.

            The change became official last week when Lindner Place became Acorn Way.











            ""The true meaning of justice is righting the wrongs that came before you,” Malverne High School sophomore Olivia Brown told WCBS.

            Brown was part of a group of students who began researching Lindner in 2020 and learned he was a Klan leader.

            Students pressed for the street name to be changed in school forums and with the village board, which voted to change the name in September 2022.

            They cheered as the new Acorn Way signs were unveiled Jan. 26.

            Malverne High School senior Jamila Smith told WCBS, “This whole initiative showed me I do want to step up and be a leader.”

            Lorna Lewis, Malverne’s schools superintendent, told the Long Island Herald, “I believe you’ve just witnessed the power of the Maverick public education and what our students can do when supported in their pursuit of civic engagement.""

            Many Americans associate the Ku Klux Klan with the South, but the group's rallies and cross burnings drew large crowds in New York in the 1920s. The Klan of that era targeted Catholic and Jewish communities, as well as Black people.MALVERNE, N.Y.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799721,US tells owners to park old Hondas until air bags are fixed,"DETROIT (AP) — Honda and the U.S. government are urging owners of about 8,200 older vehicles not to drive them until dangerous air bag inflators are replaced.

            The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday issued a “Do Not Drive” advisory for the 2001 through 2003 vehicles with Takata inflators that have a high possibility of exploding and hurling shrapnel in a crash.

            The safety agency says the risk to drivers and passengers is dire because the so-called “Alpha” inflators have a 50% chance of exploding in a crash. If the inflators blow apart, they can shoot shrapnel toward a driver's face that could kill them or cause serious injuries.











            The agency says the Honda and Acura vehicles were recalled previously but records show that repairs have not been made in the affected vehicles. Honda already has replaced 99% of the dangerous inflators.

            Vehicles affected include the 2001 and 2002 Honda Accord and Civic, the 2002Honda CR-V and Odyssey SUVs, the 2003 Honda Pilot, the 2002 and 2003 Acura 3.2 TL and the 2003 Acura 3.2 CL.

            Owners can check to see if their cars are covered by going to https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number. 

            “These inflators are two decades old now, and they pose a 50% chance of rupturing in even a minor crash,” NHTSA Acting Administrator Ann Carlson said in a statement. “Don’t gamble with your life or the life of someone you love – schedule your free repair today before it’s too late.”

            Takata used ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can become more volatile over time when exposed to moisture in the air and repeated high temperatures. The explosion can rupture a metal canister and hurl shrapnel into the passenger compartment. 

            Since 2009, the exploding air bags have killed at least 33 people worldwide, including 24 in the United States.

            Most of the deaths and about 400 injuries have happened in U.S., but they also have occurred in Australia and Malaysia.

            Honda said it has reached out to the owners more than 18 million times with mailed notices, emails, phone calls and even home visits. The company says repairs are free and parts are available. It’s offering free towing and loaner vehicles if needed.

            Potential for the dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that millions have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata Corp. of Japan into bankruptcy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799732,Dutch ministry won't appeal unlawful Afghan airstrike ruling,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The Dutch government said Friday that it will not appeal a court ruling that Dutch forces unlawfully bombed a residential complex in Afghanistan in 2007, killing some 20 civilians, in a civil case brought by four survivors.

            The District Court of The Hague found in November that the late-night attack violated international humanitarian law. The court sided with four survivors of the attack who sued the Dutch state for compensation.

            The defense ministry argued that buildings were being used by Taliban fighters when the military hit the walled compound, known as a “quala,” with munitions fired from attack helicopters and F-16s.











            The Dutch were part of the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan at the time and were fighting the Taliban in a battle for control of the Chora Valley some 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of the capital, Kabul.

            However, some 12 hours had elapsed since the last time the Taliban used the location as a firing position when the bombing occurred, and judges concluded that the military did not have enough information to designate the compound as a military target.

            In a letter to lawmakers Friday, Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren said that 15 years after the attack, the ministry “does not have any further or additional information to substantiate the fact that the quala was a military target at that time.”

            “The State will therefore not lodge an appeal. The State will comply with the court’s ruling by proceeding to pay compensation. The extent of the damage has yet to be determined,” she wrote.

            Liesbeth Zegveld, the Dutch lawyer who represented the survivors in court, said she had informed them via an intermediary in Afghanistan and that they were relieved at the government's decision.

            Ollongren, in her letter to parliament, said her thoughts went out “to the civilian victims of the Taliban’s attack on the Chora Valley and their loved ones. And to those who lost their lives protecting the civilian population during the defense of Chora, including a Dutch soldier, his relatives and comrades.”THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The Dutch government said Friday that it will not appeal a court ruling that Dutch forces unlawfully bombed a residential complex in Afghanistan in 2007, killing some 20 civilians, in a civil case brought by four survivors.The District Court of The Hague found in November that the late-night attack violated international humanitarian law.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799734,Iraqis protest in Baghdad as currency crisis continues,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi protesters rallied Friday in Baghdad, demanding the government take action to stop the economic crisis and the slide of the national currency after the Iraqi dinar plunged further.

            Measures taken by the United States in recent months to stamp out money laundering and the channeling of dollars to Iran and Syria from Iraq have severely restricted Iraq's access to hard currency. 

            The Iraqi dinar slipped to around 1,750 to the dollar at street exchanges in some parts of the country on Thursday, compared to the official rate of 1,460 dinars for $1. On Friday, most exchange stores in Baghdad were closed, while in the northern city of Irbil, the dollar was trading at around 1,710 Iraqi dinars.











            A small crowd of about 150 gathered in central Baghdad on Friday, chanting against Prime Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and carrying slogans. “The rise of the dollar means death to the poor and children,” said one banner. 

            Another read: “Today we will see which of the MPs are with the demands of the people and which are against them.” Some protesters raised pictures of demonstrators who were killed during mass anti-government protests that began in late 2019.

            Since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraq’s foreign currency reserves have been housed at the United States’ Federal Reserve, giving the Americans significant control over Iraq’s supply of dollars. 

            The Central Bank of Iraq requests dollars from the Fed and then sells them to commercial banks and exchange houses at the official exchange rate through a mechanism known as the “dollar auction.”

            Ostensibly, the vast majority of the dollars sold in the auction go to purchases of goods imported by Iraqi companies. However, political and banking sector officials have said that in many cases, invoices were faked or inflated to transfer large sums of money out of the country, including to Iran and Syria, both of which are under U.S. sanctions.

            Late last year, at the request of the U.S., the Central Bank of Iraq blacklisted four banks suspected of money laundering and started using an electronic system for transfers that required entering detailed information on the intended end-recipient of the requested dollars. 

            Since then, most requests for transfers of funds from Iraq's accounts in the U.S. have been rejected, reducing the supply of dollars in the market and leading to a devaluation of the dinar and price inflation.

            Sudani spoke to President Joe Biden by telephone on Thursday evening, and an Iraqi delegation is set to travel to Washington next Friday to discuss financial issues.

            Sudani's office said in a statement that the prime minister had ""issued strict directives to deal with currency smuggling, arrest smugglers and speculators at the dollar exchange rate, confiscate smuggled funds, and subject external checkpoints to monitoring and scrutiny.”

            The Iraqi National Intelligence Service said Friday that it had seized more than 1 million dollars from organized crime groups intending to smuggle the funds. The statement, which was carried by the Iraqi state news agency, did not specify the planned destination of the funds.BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi protesters rallied Friday in Baghdad, demanding the government take action to stop the economic crisis and the slide of the national currency after the Iraqi dinar plunged further.Measures taken by the United States in recent months to stamp out money laundering and the channeling of dollars to Iran and Syria from Iraq have severely restricted Iraq's access to hard currency.The Iraqi dinar slipped to around 1,750 to the dollar at street exchanges in some parts of the country on Thursday, compared to the official rate of 1,460 dinars for $1.

However, political and banking sector officials have said that in many cases, invoices were faked or inflated to transfer large sums of money out of the country, including to Iran and Syria, both of which are under U.S. sanctions.Late last year, at the request of the U.S., the Central Bank of Iraq blacklisted four banks suspected of money laundering and started using an electronic system for transfers that required entering detailed information on the intended end-recipient of the requested dollars.Since then, most requests for transfers of funds from Iraq's accounts in the U.S. have been rejected, reducing the supply of dollars in the market and leading to a devaluation of the dinar and price inflation.Sudani spoke to President Joe Biden by telephone on Thursday evening, and an Iraqi delegation is set to travel to Washington next Friday to discuss financial issues.Sudani's office said in a statement that the prime minister had ""issued strict directives to deal with currency smuggling, arrest smugglers and speculators at the dollar exchange rate, confiscate smuggled funds, and subject external checkpoints to monitoring and scrutiny.”The Iraqi National Intelligence Service said Friday that it had seized more than 1 million dollars from organized crime groups intending to smuggle the funds. The statement, which was carried by the Iraqi state news agency, did not specify the planned destination of the funds.",2023/02/03,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799736,Q&A: Shania Twain talks rebuilding confidence with new album,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shania Twain felt the need on her new album to empower herself the same way she has uplifted listeners with hits like “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” and “She’s Not Just a Pretty Face.”

            So she set aside all feelings of self consciousness — appearing braless for the album's artwork and letting listeners unabashedly hear her surgically repaired voice — on “Queen of Me.” Throughout the album's 12-tracks, the 57-year-old country pop superstar confronts her physical vulnerabilities with authority in ways meant to uplift fans, and herself. 

            Twain’s sixth studio album is her first since having open-throat surgery in 2018 to strengthen her vocal muscles after a long battle with Lyme disease. During the pandemic, the singer said she went into her “writing cave” at home to hone her songwriting skills and penned three albums worth of music with a clear understanding that her powerful vocals might not last forever.











            In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Twain spoke candidly about the album, which is out Friday, regaining her confidence, singing during throat surgery and preparing for her global upcoming tour, which kicks off April 28.

            Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.

            ___

            AP: How do you define your new album, “Queen of Me”?

            TWAIN: Self empowerment is about managing your mindset. Controlling your own mood. Your frame of mind. It just turned into “Queen of Me.” I’m my own boss. I’m the boss of me. I have to tell myself how to think. What to think. It became the theme of the whole album. It ended up representing that uplifting mode of myself.

            AP: Before I listened to your album, I was expecting ballads. But it’s a more upbeat experience. What made you choose that route?

            TWAIN: It was all happening in a mode of lifting my own spirit up. I wanted music that was going to make me want to dance. Even some of the songs that are a little more, for example, “Brand New Me” or “Pretty Liar.” Those are songs that would have maybe stayed more in the melancholy vibe more ballady. But because I was really relying on my songwriting during that time to make me feel a positive energy, everything pretty much turned into this more poppy, dancey, beat-driven, upbeat-driven sounding album.”

            AP: You seem liberated on your album cover. Was that your intent?

            TWAIN: That was the entire intention. You know, throw away the bra. I did a lot of nude photography in that session. That’s obviously a partial nude. I wanted to be on a horse. One of the places I feel most liberated is riding a horse. You can fly. It’s very empowering. It’s like you take this unbridled posture to bridle your freedom. It’s like facing a fear, facing something that’s uncomfortable, getting myself out of my comfort zone — especially on a horse. That’s freedom.

            AP: I heard you sang during surgery. Is that true?

            TWAIN: Yes, I had to be awake, so that I could sing and speak. It was horrible. I’m not going to lie. But there was no way around it. It was the only way. The decision to do the surgery was quick for me, but the recovery was quite long and very very painful. They literally had to stretch the larynx, move everything over and put these crutches in there. You're singing and you speak, so they understand that you have symmetrical closure — which I didn't have before.

            AP: What's been your thoughts after the surgery?

            TWAIN: I may not have it forever. Just with age, the effect of it just might not stand up. So I’ve got to take advantage of it now, enjoy it, get out on the stage, make more records, because I’m not sure I would go through it again.

            AP: I’m sure that’s tough to hear. Do you think about when your voice might go again?

            TWAIN: I don’t think about it. I don’t worry about it. I focus on how to manage my voice the way it is now. For example, before the surgery, it was like a two-hour warmup and so much physical therapy. I just couldn’t sustain it. That’s why I decided to have the surgery. The surgery has reduced all of that to about 20 minutes, which is very normal. That’s ideal. But if I’m not singing for even a week or maybe two weeks, it takes me two to three days to get that voice going again. It’s more work than I had to do before, but it’s worth it.

            AP: What was the first sign of your singing confidence?

            TWAIN: The true confidence was three weeks after the surgery. I made a sound and there was resonance. Instant resonance. I’m like, “Oh, my God. I feel it. I feel it working.” It was a small window, but that kind of put the fire under my butt, too, and I said, “All right, no more excuses.” You’ve got this and you’ve got the best technology available. Top notch surgeon. All the physiotherapy education you need. Get out there and do it.

            AP: With your retooled vocals, how are you mentally getting ready for your tour?

            TWAIN: When I now go out on that stage, I am not afraid of the criticism. I’m not going to be perfect. My voice is not what it used to be. I sing differently. There’ll be holes in it. I’m not the same body I used to be. All these things. But I go out there with the confidence that I’m the best I can be and that I’ve worked hard to be my best. I just am not afraid of the criticism. I’m there for the people that are embracing me for who I am. I will get out there and do my best to make everybody happy, as I always do.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shania Twain felt the need on her new album to empower herself the same way she has uplifted listeners with hits like “Man!

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799743,Michigan judge denies ex-officer's bid to drop murder charge,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — 

            A Michigan judge on Friday refused to dismiss a second-degree murder charge against a former Grand Rapids police officer who was fired after shooting a Black motorist in the back of the head during a struggle over a Taser. 

            Christopher Schurr is scheduled for trial March 13 in the shooting death of Patrick Lyoya last April. Circuit Judge Christina Elmore rejected a defense motion to throw out the case. Defense attorney Matthew Borgula said after the hearing that his team would appeal.











            
                Schurr’s lawyers argued he acted in self-defense and that Michigan law allows police officers to use deadly force to stop someone from fleeing and to make an arrest. Video recordings showed Schurr was straddling Lyoya's body as the Congolese refugee lay face down beneath him.

            
                Prosecutors said the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding probable cause to proceed to trial. A judge at a preliminary hearing found sufficient evidence that a jury could conclude Schurr did not reasonably believe his life was immediately at risk. Elmore agreed.

            Schurr was fired last June after spending months on paid leave. He spent one night in jail, then posted bond.

            Attorneys for Lyoya’s family have filed a separate civil lawsuit against Schurr and the city of Grand Rapids.GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799744,Microsoft: Iran unit behind Charlie Hebdo hack-and-leak op,"After the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo launched a cartoon contest to mock Iran's ruling cleric, a state-backed Iranian cyber unit struck back with a hack-and-leak campaign that was designed to provoke fear with the claimed pilfering of a big subscriber database, Microsoft security researchers say.

            The FBI blames the same Iranian cyber operators, Emennet Pasargad, for an influence operation that sought to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the tech giant said in a blog published Friday. Iran has in recent years stepped up false-flag cyber operations as a tool for discrediting foes. 

            Calling itself “Holy Souls” and posing as hacktivists, the group claimed in early January to have obtained personal information on 200,000 subscribers and Charlie Hebdo merchandise buyers, according to Microsoft's Digital Threat Analysis Center.











            As proof of the data theft, “Holy Souls” released a 200-record sample with names, phone numbers and home and email addresses of Charlie Hebdo subscribers that “could put the magazine's subscribers at risk for online or physical targeting” by extremists. The group then advertised the supposed complete data cache on several dark web sites for $340,000. 

            Microsoft said it did not know whether anyone purchased the cache.

            A representative for Charlie Hebdo said Friday that the newspaper would not comment on the Microsoft research. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

            The Jan. 4 sample release coincided with the publication of Charlie Hebdo's cartoon contest issue. Entrants were asked to draw offensive caricatures of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 

            The French newspaper Le Monde verified multiple victims of the leak from the sample, Microsoft said. The Iranian cyber operators sought to boost news of the hack-and-leak operation — and fuel outrage at the cartoon edition — through fake French “sock-puppet” accounts on social media platforms that included Twitter, Microsoft said. 

            The operation coincided with verbal attacks by Tehran condemning Charlie Hebdo's “insult.” 

            The provocatively irreverent magazine has a long history of publishing vulgar cartoons which critics consider deeply insulting to Muslims. Two French-born al-Qaida extremists attacked the newspaper’s office in 2015, killing 12 cartoonists, and it Charlie Hebdo has been the target of other attacks over the years.

            The magazine billed the Khamenei caricature contest as a show of support for nationwide antigovernment protests that have convulsed Iran since the mid-September death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman detained by Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating the country’s strict Islamic dress code.

            After the cartoon issue was published, Iran shut down a decades-old French research institute. Last week, it announced sanctions targeting more than 30 European individuals and entities, including three senior Charlie Hebdo staffers. The sanctions are largely symbolic as they bar travel to Iran and allow its authorities to block bank accounts and confiscate property in Iran.

            According to the FBI, Emennet Pasargad authored what amounted to a relatively ham-fisted campaign to interfere with the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The group obtained confidential U.S. voter information from at least one state election website and sent threatening email messages to intimidate voters posing as the far-right group Proud Boys, the FBI says.

            Emennet Pasargad has also, since 2018, conducted cyber-operations targeting news, shipping, airlines, oil and petrochemical, financial, and telecommunications, in the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East, the FBI says. The U.S. newspaper chain Lee Enterprises was among the suspected targets, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. 

            The group's attacks since 2020 have primarily targeted Israel, the FBI says. They follow a pattern of intrusion, theft, data leak and then amplification through social media and online forums. In some cases destructive malware has been used.After the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo launched a cartoon contest to mock Iran's ruling cleric, a state-backed Iranian cyber unit struck back with a hack-and-leak campaign that was designed to provoke fear with the claimed pilfering of a big subscriber database, Microsoft security researchers say.The FBI blames the same Iranian cyber operators, Emennet Pasargad, for an influence operation that sought to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the tech giant said in a blog published Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799746,Mark Geiger replaces Howard Webb as head of MLS referees,"NEW YORK (AP) — Mark Geiger will take over from Howard Webb as the head of referees in Major League Soccer.

            The 48-year-old Geiger, who retired as a referee after the 2018 season, was promoted Friday to general manager of the Professional Referee Organization that supplies MLS match officials.

            Geiger started as a MLS referee in 2004 and officiated 186 regular-season games and the 2014 MLS championship.











            He worked three games at the 2014 World Cup, becoming the first American to referee a knockout stage match when he officiated France’s round of 16 victory over Nigeria. Geiger worked three more games at the 2018 World Cup, including England’s round of 16 win over Colombia, and was the VAR for five matches.

            Geiger was hired as PRO’s director of senior match officials in 2019.

            Webb, referee of the 2010 World Cup final, became PRO's manager of video assistant referee operations in 2017 and succeeded Peter Walton as PRO's general manager in January 2018. 

            Webb refereed in the Premier League from 2003-14. He said last August he was leaving at the end of the season to become chief refereeing officer of the Professional Game Match Officials, which is responsible for the officiating in England. He took over from Mike Riley, who had been PGMO's managing director for 13 years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799748,"Man arrested, but motive unknown in Dallas Zoo monkey theft","DALLAS (AP) — The arrest of a 24-year-old man accused of taking two monkeys from the Dallas Zoo has shed some light on a mysterious string of events there as police said Friday that they’ve also linked him to the escape of a small leopard and a gash in the fence of another monkey habitat. 

            What’s still unclear: What police believe led him to do it.

            Davion Irvin, who was arrested Thursday, has been charged with six counts of animal cruelty and two counts of burglary, police said. 











            Irvin’s arrest followed a sighting of him at another home for exotic animals, The Dallas World Aquarium, where an employee recognized him from news coverage of the missing monkeys. 

            “We do believe that (Irvin) was looking to commit another crime,” Dallas police spokeswoman Kristin Lowman said at a Friday news conference.

            After the two emperor tamarin monkeys — named Bella and Finn — went missing from their enclosure Monday, police had released a photo and video of a man they said they wanted to talk to. Police later said that man was Irvin. 

            But any information about a possible motive was still part of the ongoing investigation, Lowman said.

            After getting a tip from the public, Bella and Finn were found Tuesday in the closet of a vacant house in Lancaster, a Dallas suburb about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the zoo. Their disappearance though, was just the latest in a string of odd events at the zoo.

            On Jan. 13, arriving workers found that a clouded leopard named Nova was missing from her cage, and police said a cutting tool had been intentionally used to make an opening in her enclosure. The zoo closed as a search for her got underway, and she was found later that day near her habitat.

            Zoo workers had also found a similar tear in an enclosure for langur monkeys, though none got out or appeared harmed, police said.

            On Jan. 21, workers arriving at the zoo found an endangered lappet-faced vulture named Pin dead. Gregg Hudson, the zoo’s president and CEO, called the death “very suspicious” and said the vulture had “a wound.”

            Lowman said Friday that they are still investigating but the death of the vulture has not been linked to Irvin.

            “The last month has been an emotional roller coaster for the team here at Dallas Zoo,” Harrison Edell, the zoo’s executive vice president for animal care and conservation, said at the news conference.

            Police have said the six counts of animal cruelty that Irvin faces are linked to taking the emperor tamarin monkeys — three counts for each. Lowman said one of the burglary charges comes from the taking of the emperor tamarin monkeys, while the other is related to the leopard.

            Lowman had said at the news conference that one of the burglary counts was related to the cut found in the langur monkeys' enclosure, but she later corrected that to say it was related to the emperor tamarin monkeys. She said Irvin has been linked to the cut in the langur monkey enclosure, though. 

            Police said Friday that they arrested Irvin after receiving a tip that he had been seen near the animal exhibits at The Dallas World Aquarium. Responding officers saw him boarding the city’s light rail and later spotted him a few blocks away, police said. He was then taken to police headquarters for questioning.

            Waylon Tate, an aquarium spokesperson, said Irvin had stopped an employee to ask questions about an animal, and the employee recognized him from the news.

            Irvin remained in jail Friday evening on $25,000 bond. Jail records did not list an attorney to speak on his behalf. Calls to phone numbers listed for his family were not immediately answered.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799749,McKennie on track for Leeds debut at Nottingham Forest,"LEEDS, England (AP) — Weston McKennie likely won't have to wait long for his Leeds debut.

            The United States midfielder joined the Premier League club on loan from Juventus this week and has impressed manager Jesse Marsch ahead of a weekend game at Nottingham Forest.

            “He’s fit, he’s ready, so yes of course he is in consideration to start on Sunday and certainly to be in the squad,” Marsch said Friday at a news conference.











            The 24-year-old McKennie's arrival makes it three U.S. internationals in Leeds' midfield. Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson joined last summer as two key signings for compatriot Marsch.

            McKennie joined Juventus from Schalke in 2020, becoming the Bianconeri’s first American player.

            “He's a competitor. He believes in himself,” Marsch said. “He's aggressive, he's confident, and he has quality. At Schalke they played a little bit similar to the things that I like to do. So even now sitting and talking with him about what we think his role will be, he's pretty clear on how to integrate himself.”

            Rodrigo sustained a small fracture to the bottom of his tibia during last week’s FA Cup win at Accrington Stanley, Marsch said. The striker has had surgery and will be out for two months.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799750,"Shlomo Perel, Holocaust survivor, film subject, dies at 98","JERUSALEM (AP) — Shlomo Perel, who survived the Holocaust through surreal subterfuge and an extraordinary odyssey that inspired his own writing and an internationally renowned film, died on Thursday in central Israel. He was 98. 

            Perel was born in 1925 to a Jewish family in Brunswick, Germany, just several years before the Nazis came to power. He and his family fled to Lodz, Poland, after his father’s store was destroyed and he was kicked out of school. But when the Nazis marched into Poland, he and his brother, Isaac, left their parents and fled further east. Landing in the Soviet Union, Perel and Isaac took refuge at children's home in what is now Belarus. 

            When the Germans invaded in 1941, Perel found himself trapped again by World War II's shifting front lines — this time, captured by the German army. To avoid execution, Perel disguised his Jewish identity, assumed a new name and posed as an ethnic German born in Russia. 











            He successfully passed, becoming the German army unit's translator for prisoners of war, including for Stalin’s son. As the war wound down, Perel returned to Germany to join the paramilitary ranks of Hitler Youth and was drafted into the Nazi armed forces. 

            After Germany's surrender and the liberation of the concentration camps, Perel and Isaac, who survived the Dachau camp in southern Germany, were reunited. Perel became a translator for the Soviet military before immigrating to what is now Israel and joining the war surrounding its creation in 1948. His life regained some semblance of normalcy as he settled down in a suburb of Tel Aviv with his Polish-born wife and became a zipper-maker. 

            “Perel remained silent for many years,” Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, said in a statement, “mainly because he felt that his was not a Holocaust story.” 

            But in the late 1980s, Perel couldn't keep silent about the tale of his wild gambit anymore. He wrote an autobiography that later inspired the 1991 Oscar-nominated film “Europa Europa.”

            As the film captivated audiences, Perel became a public speaker. He traveled to tell the world what he witnessed throughout the tumult of the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis, and to reflect on the painful paradoxes of his identity.

            “Shlomo Perel’s desire to live life to the fullest and tell his story to the world was an inspiration to all who met him and had the opportunity to work with him,"" said Simmy Allen, spokesperson for Yad Vashem.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799751,New Mexico legislators may block local abortion ordinances,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A standoff over abortion in politically conservative regions of New Mexico escalated Friday as Democratic state legislators advanced a bill that would prohibit local governments from interfering with women's access to reproductive health care.

            The initiative from state House Democrats responds to abortion restrictions recently adopted in two counties and three cities in eastern New Mexico where sentiments against the procedure run deep — and amid efforts by states across the nation to restrict abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. 

            A legislative panel endorsed the bill on a party-line, 7-3 vote with opposition from Republican lawmakers who said they were bombarded with emails, phone calls and petitions from constituents in opposition. Additional hearings are planned before the House and Senate potentially votes on the bill, which is supported by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.











            Anti-abortion ordinances, adopted over the past several months by officials in the cities of Hobbs, Clovis, Eunice, and Lea and Roosevelt counties, reference an obscure U.S. anti-obscenity law that prohibits shipping of medication or other materials intended to aid abortions.

            State Attorney General Raúl Torrez says local governments have overstepped their authority to regulate health care access, with local laws that violate state constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. Last month, Torrez petitioned the state Supreme Court to intervene. The court has yet to respond.

            The new bill, sponsored by Rep. Linda Serrato of Santa Fe and other Democrats, would prohibit local governments from interfering with access to reproductive care — including abortion, birth control, and prevention of or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.

            “It's really important ... to make it abundantly clear to everyone that in New Mexico you can access health care and we respect your ability to do so,"" Serrato said.

            The bill would also ban local restrictions on gender-affirming care, which typically can include puberty-blocking medication, hormone therapy or surgeries. That provision is a counterpoint to proposed bans on gender-affirming care for minors or young adults in more than two dozen states. 

            “We've seen so many, to be frank, politically motivated attacks on these two types of health care,"" Serrato told The Associated Press. “We wanted to make sure that people were not scared of accessing their health care.”

            On Friday, Serrato told a House panel that providing gender-affirming health care can save lives by lowering suicide rates and addressing depression as youths come of age and grapple with questions of gender. Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, of Ruidoso Downs, countered that a portion of youths have regrets after seeking gender-affirming health care.

            Jodi Hendricks, executive director of the conservative group New Mexico Family Action Movement, described abortion and gender-affirming care as “elective procedures” and urged legislators to leave room for conscience decisions and support the autonomy of local government.

            “We do not believe that local governments and bodies should lose the right to determine what's best with their communities,"" she said.

            In 2021, New Mexico's Democrat-led Legislature passed a measure to repeal a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures, ensuring access to abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case. 

            But that ruling last June also energized local government efforts to restrict abortion.

            Hobbs Mayor Sam Cobb has said constituents in his community overwhelmingly support the city’s abortion-restricting ordinance, citing hours of public testimony to the city council.

            The ordinances adopted in New Mexico bear hallmarks of a national effort to ban abortion one city at a time led by Mark Lee Dickson, founder of the Texas-based Sanctuary Cities of the Unborn organization. He has traveled extensively in New Mexico to talk to local government boards and faith-based groups.

            “The approach in New Mexico ended up being compliance with these federal statutes,” Dickson told the AP. “They're not explicit abortion bans ... but they have the same result. We call them de facto abortion bans.""

            Dickson said he envisions the ordinances in New Mexico holding up to scrutiny in federal court and helping cities such as Hobbs keep at bay abortion providers and pharmacy chain distributors of abortion pills, amid legal battles over state restrictions on abortion medications.

            “I almost want to show up and say (to state legislators), ‘I double dog dare you to pass it,’” said Dickson, who believes local abortion ordinances are reinforced by federal law and can't be overturned by the Legislature.

            Roosevelt County’s ordinance gives private citizens the power to sue anyone suspected of violations of local regulation of abortion, allowing damages of up to $100,000 per infraction.

            Under the state bill, interference with reproductive and gender-affirming health care could result in civil penalties of up to $5,000, damage awards and compensation for legal expenses.

            Minnesota on Tuesday became the first state Legislature this year to codify abortion rights into law, ensuring that the state’s existing protections remain in place no matter who sits on future courts.SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A standoff over abortion in politically conservative regions of New Mexico escalated Friday as Democratic state legislators advanced a bill that would prohibit local governments from interfering with women's access to reproductive health care.The initiative from state House Democrats responds to abortion restrictions recently adopted in two counties and three cities in eastern New Mexico where sentiments against the procedure run deep — and amid efforts by states across the nation to restrict abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.A legislative panel endorsed the bill on a party-line, 7-3 vote with opposition from Republican lawmakers who said they were bombarded with emails, phone calls and petitions from constituents in opposition. Additional hearings are planned before the House and Senate potentially votes on the bill, which is supported by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.Anti-abortion ordinances, adopted over the past several months by officials in the cities of Hobbs, Clovis, Eunice, and Lea and Roosevelt counties, reference an obscure U.S. anti-obscenity law that prohibits shipping of medication or other materials intended to aid abortions.State Attorney General Raúl Torrez says local governments have overstepped their authority to regulate health care access, with local laws that violate state constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. Last month, Torrez petitioned the state Supreme Court to intervene. The court has yet to respond.The new bill, sponsored by Rep. Linda Serrato of Santa Fe and other Democrats, would prohibit local governments from interfering with access to reproductive care — including abortion, birth control, and prevention of or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.“It's really important ... to make it abundantly clear to everyone that in New Mexico you can access health care and we respect your ability to do so,"" Serrato said.The bill would also ban local restrictions on gender-affirming care, which typically can include puberty-blocking medication, hormone therapy or surgeries. That provision is a counterpoint to proposed bans on gender-affirming care for minors or young adults in more than two dozen states.“We've seen so many, to be frank, politically motivated attacks on these two types of health care,"" Serrato told The Associated Press. “We wanted to make sure that people were not scared of accessing their health care.”On Friday, Serrato told a House panel that providing gender-affirming health care can save lives by lowering suicide rates and addressing depression as youths come of age and grapple with questions of gender. Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, of Ruidoso Downs, countered that a portion of youths have regrets after seeking gender-affirming health care.Jodi Hendricks, executive director of the conservative group New Mexico Family Action Movement, described abortion and gender-affirming care as “elective procedures” and urged legislators to leave room for conscience decisions and support the autonomy of local government.“We do not believe that local governments and bodies should lose the right to determine what's best with their communities,"" she said.In 2021, New Mexico's Democrat-led Legislature passed a measure to repeal a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures, ensuring access to abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case.But that ruling last June also energized local government efforts to restrict abortion.Hobbs Mayor Sam Cobb has said constituents in his community overwhelmingly support the city’s abortion-restricting ordinance, citing hours of public testimony to the city council.The ordinances adopted in New Mexico bear hallmarks of a national effort to ban abortion one city at a time led by Mark Lee Dickson, founder of the Texas-based Sanctuary Cities of the Unborn organization.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799752,California makes flag football a girls' high school sport,"California approved a plan Friday to make flag football a girls’ high school sport amid soaring popularity of the game and a push to get more female athletes on the field.

            The move by the California Interscholastic Federation — the statewide body that governs high school athletics — makes flag football an official sport for girls in the nation’s most populous state for the upcoming 2023-24 year. The plan was approved unanimously by the organization’s federated council in Long Beach, said Rebecca Brutlag, an agency spokesperson.

            Paula Hart Rodas, president-elect of the CIF Southern Section’s council, said the goal is to get more girls involved in high school sports and tap into a widespread love of football by many who are loath to play tackle. Southern California schools spanning from Long Beach to Corona are hoping to start teams in the fall and the approval allows districts to add the sport to their budgets, Hart Rodas said.











            “You can love the game of football and not love getting tackled but still want to participate,” Hart Rodas said. ""Flag right now is aimed directly at getting more girls involved in athletics by adding a different sport that we know girls across the country are interested in, but not willing to play tackle for a variety of reasons.”

            The move adds California to a growing list of states that have included girls' flag football in high school athletic programs, such as Alabama and Nevada. New York state's public high school athletic association took a similar step this week and expects to host the first state championship for girls flag football in the spring of 2024.

            The vote in California comes amid a surge in interest in flag football among younger players in recreational leagues and burgeoning support from the NFL and teams such as the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, which have been running a pilot high school league for girls in Southern California.

            Scores of schools signed up to participate in the pilot and those selected to do so — and the eager young players who played in it — have widely been seen as pioneers in the sport.

            Paul Schmidt said being part of a start-up has been exciting for his 14-year-old daughter, who had never played flag football before she tried out for the team at Redondo Union High School, one of the schools participating in the league. Making the sport official should make it easier to secure field time, he said, and gives a boost to a tight-knit team of girls that has bonded around starting something new.

            “She loves it, loves it. It’s exciting to be in a new sport,” he said.

            Rising interest in flag football — in which no one gets tackled and a play ends when an opposing player pulls a flag from a belt around the ball-carrier's waist — comes amid concern about the risk of concussions and other injuries from tackle football. 

            In the decade leading up to 2018-19, the number of girls playing flag football in U.S. high schools doubled to 11,000, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. 

            Without the CIF's approval, California high schools could organize flag football clubs. But coaches said allowing official interscholastic competition will likely drive more schools to start teams and develop a pipeline of players.

            Troy Vincent Sr., the NFL's executive vice president of football operations, wrote in the Sacramento Bee that times have changed since he played professional football, which back then was “broadly seen as a man’s game."" He said high school players might be able to play into college and beyond as universities have also ramped up the sport.

            Vincent is also pushing to get flag football added to 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

            “This is no longer just a backyard sport for girls’ pickup games during family holiday gatherings,” he said.California approved a plan Friday to make flag football a girls’ high school sport amid soaring popularity of the game and a push to get more female athletes on the field.The move by the California Interscholastic Federation — the statewide body that governs high school athletics — makes flag football an official sport for girls in the nation’s most populous state for the upcoming 2023-24 year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799755,"US may lift protections for Yellowstone, Glacier grizzlies","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The Biden administration took a first step Friday toward ending federal protections for grizzly bears in the northern Rocky Mountains, which would open the door to future hunting in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.

            The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said state officials provided “substantial” information that grizzlies have recovered from the threat of extinction in the regions surrounding Yellowstone and Glacier national parks.

            But federal officials rejected claims by Idaho that protections should be lifted beyond those areas, and they raised concerns about new laws from the Republican-led states that could potentially harm grizzly populations.











            “We will fully evaluate these and other potential threats,” said Martha Williams, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

            Williams told the head of Montana’s wildlife agency in a Wednesday letter that a law allowing grizzlies to be killed if they attack livestock was inconsistent with the state's commitment to bear conservation. She said the 2023 legislative session offered a “good opportunity” to address such problems.

            Friday’s move kicks off at least a year of further study before final decisions about the Yellowstone and Glacier regions.

            The states want protections lifted so they can regain management of grizzlies and offer hunts to the public. As grizzly populations have expanded, more of the animals have moved into areas occupied by people, creating public safety issues and problems for farmers.

            State officials have insisted future hunts would be limited and not endanger the overall population.

            After grizzlies temporarily lost their protections in the Yellowstone region several years ago, Wyoming and Idaho scheduled hunts that would have allowed fewer than two dozen bears to be killed in the initial hunting season.

            In Wyoming, almost 1,500 people applied for 12 grizzly bear licenses in 2018 before the hunt was blocked in federal court. About a third of the applicants came from out of state. Idaho issued just one grizzly license before the hunt was blocked.

            Republican lawmakers in the region in recent years also adopted more aggressive policies against gray wolves, including loosened trapping rules that could lead to grizzlies being inadvertently killed.

            As many as 50,000 grizzlies once roamed the western half of the U.S. They were exterminated in most of the country early last century by overhunting and trapping, and the last hunts in the northern Rockies occurred decades ago. There are now more than 2,000 bears in the Lower 48 states and much larger populations in Alaska, where hunting is allowed.

            The species' expansion in the Glacier and Yellowstone areas has led to conflicts between humans and bears, including periodic attacks on livestock and sometimes the fatal mauling of humans.

            Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte welcomed the administration’s announcement and said it could lead to the state reclaiming management of a species placed under federal protection in 1975. He said the grizzly’s recovery “represents a conservation success.”

            Montana held grizzly hunts until 1991 under an exemption to the federal protections that allowed 14 bears to be killed each fall.

            The federal government in 2017 sought to remove protections for the Yellowstone ecosystem’s grizzlies under former President Donald Trump. The hunts in Wyoming and Idaho were set to begin when a judge restored protections, siding with environmental groups that said delisting wasn’t based on sound science.

            Those groups want federal protections kept in place and no hunting allowed so bears can continue moving into new areas.

            “We should not be ready to trust the states,” said attorney Andrea Zaccardi, of the Center for Biological Diversity. Derek Goldman with the Endangered Species Coalition said state management would be a disaster and was glad federal agencies were looking at the states' laws.

            Dave Evans, a hunting guide with Wood River Ranch in Meeteetse, Wyoming, said the issue is complex, and he can understand why people fall on both sides of the debate.

            “You have so many opinions and some of them are not based on science, but the biologists are the ones that know the facts about what the populations are and what should be considered a goal for each area,” Evans said. “If you're going to manage grizzly bears, there's a sustainable number that needs to be kept in balance. I'm not a biologist, but I would follow the science.”

            U.S. government scientists have said the region’s grizzlies are biologically recovered but in 2021 decided that protections were still needed because of human-caused bear deaths and other pressures. Bears considered problematic are regularly killed by wildlife officials.

            Demand for bear hunting licenses would likely be high if the protections are lifted, Evans said.

            “You would definitely have a higher demand, and it would probably be very expensive,” Evans said. “A guided bear hunt in Alaska can start around $20,000, so I would imagine it would be very sought after.”

            A decision on the states’ petitions was long overdue. Idaho Gov. Brad Little on Thursday filed notice that he intended to sue over the delay. Idaho's petition was broader than the ones filed by Montana and sought to lift protections nationwide.

            That would have included small populations of bears in portions of Idaho, Montana and Washington state, where biologists say the animals have not yet recovered to sustainable levels. It also could have prevented the return of bears to other areas such as the North Cascades region.

            ""While we continue to evaluate the decision from USFWS, this is another example of federal overreach and appears to have a disproportionate impact on North Idaho,” Little said in an emailed statement. He said his office would ""continue to push back against the federal government.”

            Grizzly bear encounters are generally rare in northern Idaho, though wildlife managers occasionally warn people to be on the watch for the animals. In 2021, Idaho Fish and Game officials estimated there were between 40 and 50 grizzly bears in the northernmost part of the state.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799767,FIA confirms the six F1 engine suppliers for 2026-30 cycle,"PARIS (AP) — Formula One's governing body confirmed the six engine providers for the 2026-30 cycle on Friday which aims to use sustainable fuels and greater electric power.

            The FIA said that Alpine, Audi, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes, and Red Bull in partnership with Ford successfully completed the registration process for the next generation of engines.

            German car manufacturer Audi is a new entrant and American automaker Ford is returning to the series.











            ""The power unit is at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of Formula 1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing,” FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem said. 

            The engines will maintain a similar performance level to the current designs, which use V6 internal combustion engines, but will also focus on environmental sustainability with the deployment of electrical power close to 50% and by using a 100% sustainable fuel, FIA said.

            Ford will work to develop the power unit for Red Bull, as well as their sister team, AlphaTauri, from 2026 to at least 2030.

            Ford dominated F1 in the late 1960s and 1970s as an engine manufacturer with Cosworth and Ford is the third most successful engine maker in F1 history with 10 constructors’ championships and 13 drivers’ championships.

            Ford, which owned and ran the Jaguar F1 team, left F1 in 2004 when Jaguar was sold and became Red Bull Racing. 

            Audi is the second-most successful manufacturer in the 24 Hours Le Mans endurance race with 13 wins, and began to work on electrifying the car in that series as early as 2012.

The Christmas album crooner,honorary Mummer and All-Pro center — how many players have all those titles in their NFL.com bio? — considered walking away at the end of last season. His future was one of the more pressing offseason questions on tap, so Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni shipped the big guy two cases of beer to coax him to stay.

            So Kelce stayed.

            “I’ve learned now I don’t know when that last game is going to come,” the 35-year-old Kelce said.











            Hey, at least Kelce knows for sure when the last game this season is going to come.

            Kelce has tried not to consider that the Super Bowl against Kansas City could be his final game as an Eagle. But he’s not the only veteran Eagle and Super Bowl champion with a murky future. Kelce, Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham are the lone holdovers from former coach Andy Reid’s last season with the Eagles in 2012. There’s a chance none of the three will be back for the 2023 season.

            “I know them personally and they are tough guys, tough-minded,” Reid said. “They’re good leaders, fun to be around, and they’re good football players. Each one has their own characteristic, but in general I’d tell you that about all of them, great team guys.""

            Lane Johnson completes the four veteran anchors and was a rookie in former coach Chip Kelly’s first season in 2013.

            The tenured stars — the Core Four — have won a Super Bowl under former coach Doug Pederson and won just four games in 2020. They’ve been hurt and set records. They’ve also raised the standard on what it means to be an Eagle. The best way to do that is go out and win the big one in style.

            “Since the day I got here, that’s all they talk about,” defensive tackle Javon Hargrave said. “Tell me how they feel when they went to the Super Bowl and all the memories they had. It’s pretty cool to have people who have done it before.”

            Hargrave’s nod to the veterans was interrupted when Graham pulled on his gaudy Super Bowl jacket — with tags dangling from the sleeve — at the neighboring locker. All they need is a new ring to complete the ensemble.

            If they beat the Chiefs, some might go out in Philly on top.

            This is no ordinary game for Kelce. On the Kansas City side, there’s Reid, the coach who drafted him. Also over there is his brother, tight end Travis Kelce, marking the first time siblings will face off in the Super Bowl. One more thing, Kelce’s wife Kylie is pregnant and the couple is bringing their ob-gyn to Arizona just in case.

            Kelce has been as durable as they come, with the Super Bowl putting him at 149 consecutive games.

            “He’s out there at practice every day limping around and giving his all to the team,” tight end Dallas Goedert said.

            Let’s take a look at some of the foursome’s finer moments:

            _____

            Jason Kelce. Age 35. Center. Sixth-round pick, 2011. Five-time first-team All-Pro.

            The burly, bushy-haired Bird has been a stalwart of the offensive line since he was drafted and as an Iron Man after he missed most of the 2012 season with a partially torn MCL and torn ACL. He’s in the last season of his contract.

            He’s a fan favorite and has done it all outside the football field, such as singing the national anthem at a 76ers game, partying with the Phanatic and pounding a beer to a roaring ovation at a Phillies postseason game.

            But the moment that endeared him for life to the Philly faithful came at the 2018 Super Bowl parade when he dressed as one of Philadelphia’s famed Mummer’s and the ultimate underdog delivered a fiery, profane speech that whipped the crowd into a frenzy.

            “No one likes us! No one likes us! No one likes us! We don’t care,” Kelce exclaimed. “We’re from Philly! (Expletive) Philly. No one likes us! We don’t care!”

            ___

            Brandon Graham. Age 34. Defensive end. First-round pick. 2010. 2020 Pro Bowl.

            The most famous moment in Eagles history is the trick play that saw QB Nick Foles catch a touchdown to lead them past the New England Patriots for the franchise’s first Super Bowl victory. Right behind it? Graham’s strip-sack of Tom Brady in the same game with 2:21 left in the fourth quarter. Derek Barnett recovered and the Eagles hung on to win 41-33.

            He missed most of last season with a torn Achilles but came back to post a career-high 11 sacks. Graham said he’s not retiring and was excited about testing free-agency for the first time in his career.

            “I know I’m not the guy I was early on,” he said. “I do feel like I’m still pass-rushing the same. I’m able to be dominant in the run game. I’m enjoying being the leader for the guys.”

            ___

            Lane Johnson. Age 32. Right tackle. First-round pick. 2013. Two-time first-team All-Pro.

            Johnson, signed through 2025, bypassed surgery late in the season and has played through the postseason with a torn adductor in his groin. He did not allow a sack all season. But Johnson has received kudos for his openness in dealing with his mental health. Johnson took a leave during the 2021 season as he battled anxiety and depression and has since shared his story at depression treatment clinics in the area.

            “I felt the shame, I felt like it was a crutch,” Johnson said last year.

            ___

            Fletcher Cox. Age 32. Defensive tackle. First-round pick 2012. First-team All-Pro 2018.

            Cox added seven sacks this season to give him 65 in his career. Cox was briefly released last season before signing a new deal for essentially one season. He may not be back in Philly next season but he’s not calling it quits.

            “I’m still playing at a high level,” Cox said. “That hasn’t crossed my mind once, at all.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799769,UN rights chief concerned about Israel's moves amid violence,"GENEVA (AP) — The U.N. human rights chief expressed concerns Friday that steps taken by the new Israeli government, the most far-right in the country’s history, could fuel further violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the wake of a recent spike in bloodshed in the region. 

            Volker Türk cited steps such as forced evictions of Palestinians from their homes and government moves to expedite Israelis’ access to firearms. He called on leaders, officials and everyone else on both sides to stop using language that incites hatred, and to shun violence.

            “Rather than doubling down on failed approaches of violence and coercion that have singularly failed in the past, I urge everyone involved to step out of the illogic of escalation that has only ended in dead bodies, shattered lives and utter despair,” said Türk, who took office in October as the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.











            Israel's ambassador in Geneva accused the rights office of condemning a “legitimate response” by her country — instead of condemning “heinous terrorist attacks” against Jewish worshippers and Israeli civilians.

            The region is facing one of the deadliest periods of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in years. An Israeli military raid last week killed 10 Palestinians — most of them militants — but also a 61-year-old woman. A Palestinian gunman in a shooting attack a day later outside an east Jerusalem synagogue killed seven people, including a 14-year-old.

            Israel’s firebrand national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, responded by taking steps to demolish the home of the gunman and other Palestinian homes in east Jerusalem built without permits, and called for granting more gun licenses to Israelis.

            On Thursday, Israeli aircraft struck a rocket production workshop in the Gaza Strip, after Palestinian militants fired a rocket toward Israel. Over the weekend, a shooting in east Jerusalem by a 13-year-old Palestinian wounded two Israelis.

            “I fear that recent measures being taken by the government of Israel are only fueling further violations and abuses of human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law,"" Türk said.

            Such laws prohibit “collective punishment,” including punitive forced evictions and demolition of homes, he said, warning that expanded licensing of firearms to civilians plus a rise in hateful rhetoric ""can only lead to further violence and bloodshed.”

            Israel has long accused United Nations institutions of anti-Israel bias, and the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council — a 47-member-state body, which like the rights office is based in Geneva — has passed more country-specific resolutions involving Israel than any other single country. 

            The office of Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, lashed out at the statement from Türk's office, saying that he broke his silence over the attacks against Israeli civilians “not by condemning these acts of terrorism, not by offering his condolences to the victims’ families, not by even describing these attacks as acts of terrorism, but by solely condemning the State of Israel.”

            The statement from Türk’s office “does not even have the decency to describe the attacks last week for what they were, acts of Palestinian terrorism targeting the Jewish people,” Eilon Shahar said.

            “Its prejudice towards Israel means it chooses to turn a blind eye to the daily incitement of children by the Palestinian Authority and their support for terrorism,"" she added.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:

            ___

            
                House GOP did not tell Raskin to remove head covering
              











            CLAIM: House Republicans are requiring Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, to remove the headwear he’s donned on the House floor while undergoing chemotherapy.

            THE FACTS: Republicans have made no such request and have in fact been nothing but supportive, a spokesperson for Raskin told the AP. Raskin, who announced he’d been diagnosed with lymphoma last year, attended the year’s first House Oversight Committee hearing on Tuesday wearing a bandana. But as the new Republican House majority takes control, confusion over a joke Raskin made about House rules governing headgear fueled a false rumor on social media. “Kevin McCarthy has insisted Jamie Raskin remove the headscarf he is wearing because chemotherapy has caused his hair to fall out,” wrote one Twitter user in a tweet with 34,000 likes, referring to the Republican House speaker. “You would think they would have compassion for a colleague with cancer but they are monsters.” But Republicans have not imposed such a rule, and the false claim grew from a misunderstanding. In a Tuesday tweet, Punchbowl News reporter Heather Caygle wrote that Raskin had received a standing ovation in a House Democratic Caucus meeting after saying he’d push back on Republican efforts to make him remove his headwear. “And I will make them take off their toupees,” Caygle quoted Raskin as saying. Jacob Wilson, a spokesperson for Raskin, told the AP in an email that Raskin “was responding lightheartedly to a hypothetical question from a colleague” at the caucus meeting. According to Caygle’s tweet, he was asked “what he would do if Republicans made him take off his headwear on the House floor.” Caygle clarified in a follow-up tweet that Raskin said no House Republicans have spoken to him about hat rules. Caygle declined further comment when reached by email. Wilson said the Democrat “has received nothing but support and encouragement from all of his colleagues and leaders on both sides of the aisle.” Mark Bednar, a spokesperson for McCarthy, said the House speaker had not told Raskin to remove his head covering. Hats were banned in the lower chamber in 1837.

                Experts: Pfizer tests on COVID vaccines, treatment in line with industry standards
              

            CLAIM: Pfizer has acknowledged in a statement it conducted “gain of function” research as part of its development of a vaccine and a separate medical treatment for COVID-19.

            THE FACTS: Experts said nothing in a recent statement by the company suggests it’s conducting research designed to make COVID-19 more harmful, as some social media users claim. A statement released Jan. 27 by Pfizer in response to allegations it was conducting risky “gain of function” research triggered another round of false speculation against one of the top makers of COVID vaccines. Gain of function refers to scientific experiments that give an organism a new property or enhances an existing one. In the case of a virus such as the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, that could involve making it more harmful, or giving it the ability to transmit to other species. But the company said no such things in its statement, stressing that its vaccine-related experiments are undertaken only after a new variant has been identified by public health authorities. “This research provides a way for us to rapidly assess the ability of an existing vaccine to induce antibodies that neutralize a newly identified variant of concern,” the company said. “We then make this data available through peer reviewed scientific journals and use it as one of the steps to determine whether a vaccine update is required.” For research related to its antiviral medication Paxlovid, Pfizer said that “most” of the work is conducted using computer simulations or mutations of a non-infectious part of the virus. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said nothing in the statement suggests Pfizer is conducting research designed to “weaponize” COVID-19 or “increase its pathogenicity,” as some social media users claim. “They might be undertaking virologic research to test the limits of their technologies knowing that through virus evolution some of these changes may occur naturally,” he wrote in an email. Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University, agreed, though he said Pfizer’s statement is “written in a technical way” that could have been “made clearer for non-science readers.” “To be gain of function, the researcher needs to deliberately make a change, knowing that change makes the virus more dangerous, and the change must be something the virus could not reasonably do on its own,” Neuman wrote in an email. “Miss out any part of that definition, and it’s not gain of function. That’s a really high bar, and the last part is the key.” Albert Ko, who chairs the epidemiology department at the Yale School of Public Health in New Haven, Connecticut, said the online claims amounted to “scare mongering.” “Engineering the virus does not always mean gain of function research,” he said. “Vaccines are made this way, from taking pieces of one virus and placing it into another virus. It does not necessarily mean a high risk of creating a stronger, more dangerous virus.” At the same time, he said, the company should disclose more information about the work, such as its internal approvals process and safety protocols. A spokesperson for Pfizer declined to respond to requests for additional comment. “The statement stands as our comment on the false allegations currently being made about vaccine research at Pfizer,” Amy Rose wrote in an email.

                Georgia school form on sudden cardiac arrest risks isn’t new
              

            CLAIM: A “Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Form” is now being issued in Georgia high schools, suggesting a new phenomenon relating to the COVID-19 vaccines.

            THE FACTS: That form has been given to families of Georgia students since 2019 in accordance with state law. Social media posts are spreading an image of the educational form provided to Georgia families focused on sudden cardiac arrest — with some users erroneously implying that it is related to COVID-19 vaccines. “Parents are now having to sign a Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Form. But remember the Jab is safe enough to give to babies,” reads one tweet with the image. The document shown in the social media posts is titled “Georgia High School Association Student/Parent Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Form.” But that form predates both the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccines: A version of the same form available online is dated May 2019. Steve Figueroa, a spokesperson for the Georgia High School Association, told the AP that the form has been used since the 2019-2020 school year in response to a state law centered on sudden cardiac arrest prevention. That law, passed in 2019,requires both public and private schools to hold meetings on the symptoms and warning signs of sudden cardiac arrest and to also provide an “information sheet” to parents and guardians. The form details warning signs of sudden cardiac arrest, an abrupt malfunction of the heart. For example, the document instructs parents to consult a doctor if their child faints suddenly or experiences chest pain or shortness of breath during exercise. Flawedclaims and deceptive videos have spread the unfounded theory that the COVID-19 vaccines are behind a wave of young athletes experiencing such cardiac issues. Cardiologists have told the AP there have been instances of athletes experiencing sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrest long before the COVID-19 pandemic and that they have not observed the alleged dramatic increase.

                False claims of NFL referee investigation started as satire
              

            CLAIM: The NFL is investigating AFC championship referee Ronald Torbert because his son made a large wager on the Kansas City Chiefs before they defeated the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.

            THE FACTS: This claim originated on a parody Twitter account, and elements of the post make it clear that it is fiction. Some Bengals fans weren’t happy with calls made in the AFC championship game, which sent the Chiefs to the Super Bowl. But it’s not true that the NFL is investigating the referee who made the calls, despite a misleading post spreading on social media. A Twitter post making the claim came from a satirical account featuring a character from the comedy film “Anchorman” — details lost on some social media users who shared the post as real. “BREAKING: NFL head ref of the AFC Championship game, Ronald Torbert, commenting on the NFL’s investigation on his family member placing a wager on the game this morning,” the post reads. It then quotes Torbert as saying, “I had no knowledge that my son placed a large wager on the Chiefs until after the game.” The post claims Torbert made the comments on a radio station called “101.4 ‘The Juice,’” which doesn’t exist. An internet search for the station brings up several juices sold in amounts of 101.4 fluid ounces. The account that posted it identifies itself as a “parody/satire sports anchor at KVWN sports news,” referring to a fictional news station in the movie. Still, social media users spread the fake quote without that context on Facebook and Twitter, chalking it up to an explanation for why referees made several calls in Kansas City’s favor on Sunday night. In some cases, the post was shared as a screenshot, lacking the satirical disclaimer on the Twitter account. There’s no evidence any such investigation is taking place. Reached for comment, an NFL spokesman pointed to the fact that the account spreading the claim identified itself as satire.

Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, to remove the headwear he’s donned on the House floor while undergoing chemotherapy.THE FACTS: Republicans have made no such request and have in fact been nothing but supportive, a spokesperson for Raskin told the AP. Raskin, who announced he’d been diagnosed with lymphoma last year, attended the year’s first House Oversight Committee hearing on Tuesday wearing a bandana. But as the new Republican House majority takes control, confusion over a joke Raskin made about House rules governing headgear fueled a false rumor on social media. “Kevin McCarthy has insisted Jamie Raskin remove the headscarf he is wearing because chemotherapy has caused his hair to fall out,” wrote one Twitter user in a tweet with 34,000 likes, referring to the Republican House speaker. “You would think they would have compassion for a colleague with cancer but they are monsters.” But Republicans have not imposed such a rule, and the false claim grew from a misunderstanding. In a Tuesday tweet, Punchbowl News reporter Heather Caygle wrote that Raskin had received a standing ovation in a House Democratic Caucus meeting after saying he’d push back on Republican efforts to make him remove his headwear. “And I will make them take off their toupees,” Caygle quoted Raskin as saying. Jacob Wilson, a spokesperson for Raskin, told the AP in an email that Raskin “was responding lightheartedly to a hypothetical question from a colleague” at the caucus meeting. According to Caygle’s tweet, he was asked “what he would do if Republicans made him take off his headwear on the House floor.” Caygle clarified in a follow-up tweet that Raskin said no House Republicans have spoken to him about hat rules. Caygle declined further comment when reached by email. Wilson said the Democrat “has received nothing but support and encouragement from all of his colleagues and leaders on both sides of the aisle.” Mark Bednar, a spokesperson for McCarthy, said the House speaker had not told Raskin to remove his head covering. Hats were banned in the lower chamber in 1837.— Associated Press writer Graph Massara in San Francisco contributed this report with additional reporting from Sophia Tulp in New York.___Experts: Pfizer tests on COVID vaccines, treatment in line with industry standardsCLAIM: Pfizer has acknowledged in a statement it conducted “gain of function” research as part of its development of a vaccine and a separate medical treatment for COVID-19.THE FACTS: Experts said nothing in a recent statement by the company suggests it’s conducting research designed to make COVID-19 more harmful, as some social media users claim. A statement released Jan. 27 by Pfizer in response to allegations it was conducting risky “gain of function” research triggered another round of false speculation against one of the top makers of COVID vaccines. Gain of function refers to scientific experiments that give an organism a new property or enhances an existing one. In the case of a virus such as the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, that could involve making it more harmful, or giving it the ability to transmit to other species. But the company said no such things in its statement, stressing that its vaccine-related experiments are undertaken only after a new variant has been identified by public health authorities. “This research provides a way for us to rapidly assess the ability of an existing vaccine to induce antibodies that neutralize a newly identified variant of concern,” the company said. “We then make this data available through peer reviewed scientific journals and use it as one of the steps to determine whether a vaccine update is required.” For research related to its antiviral medication Paxlovid, Pfizer said that “most” of the work is conducted using computer simulations or mutations of a non-infectious part of the virus. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said nothing in the statement suggests Pfizer is conducting research designed to “weaponize” COVID-19 or “increase its pathogenicity,” as some social media users claim. “They might be undertaking virologic research to test the limits of their technologies knowing that through virus evolution some of these changes may occur naturally,” he wrote in an email. Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University, agreed, though he said Pfizer’s statement is “written in a technical way” that could have been “made clearer for non-science readers.” “To be gain of function, the researcher needs to deliberately make a change, knowing that change makes the virus more dangerous, and the change must be something the virus could not reasonably do on its own,” Neuman wrote in an email. “Miss out any part of that definition, and it’s not gain of function. That’s a really high bar, and the last part is the key.” Albert Ko, who chairs the epidemiology department at the Yale School of Public Health in New Haven, Connecticut, said the online claims amounted to “scare mongering.” “Engineering the virus does not always mean gain of function research,” he said. “Vaccines are made this way, from taking pieces of one virus and placing it into another virus. It does not necessarily mean a high risk of creating a stronger, more dangerous virus.” At the same time, he said, the company should disclose more information about the work, such as its internal approvals process and safety protocols. A spokesperson for Pfizer declined to respond to requests for additional comment. “The statement stands as our comment on the false allegations currently being made about vaccine research at Pfizer,” Amy Rose wrote in an email.— Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo in New York contributed this report.___Georgia school form on sudden cardiac arrest risks isn’t newCLAIM: A “Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Form” is now being issued in Georgia high schools, suggesting a new phenomenon relating to the COVID-19 vaccines.THE FACTS: That form has been given to families of Georgia students since 2019 in accordance with state law. Social media posts are spreading an image of the educational form provided to Georgia families focused on sudden cardiac arrest — with some users erroneously implying that it is related to COVID-19 vaccines. “Parents are now having to sign a Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Form. But remember the Jab is safe enough to give to babies,” reads one tweet with the image. The document shown in the social media posts is titled “Georgia High School Association Student/Parent Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Form.” But that form predates both the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccines: A version of the same form available online is dated May 2019. Steve Figueroa, a spokesperson for the Georgia High School Association, told the AP that the form has been used since the 2019-2020 school year in response to a state law centered on sudden cardiac arrest prevention. That law, passed in 2019,requires both public and private schools to hold meetings on the symptoms and warning signs of sudden cardiac arrest and to also provide an “information sheet” to parents and guardians. The form details warning signs of sudden cardiac arrest, an abrupt malfunction of the heart. For example, the document instructs parents to consult a doctor if their child faints suddenly or experiences chest pain or shortness of breath during exercise. Flawedclaims and deceptive videos have spread the unfounded theory that the COVID-19 vaccines are behind a wave of young athletes experiencing such cardiac issues. Cardiologists have told the AP there have been instances of athletes experiencing sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrest long before the COVID-19 pandemic and that they have not observed the alleged dramatic increase.— Associated Press writer Angelo Fichera in Philadephia contributed this report.___False claims of NFL referee investigation started as satireCLAIM: The NFL is investigating AFC championship referee Ronald Torbert because his son made a large wager on the Kansas City Chiefs before they defeated the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.THE FACTS: This claim originated on a parody Twitter account, and elements of the post make it clear that it is fiction. Some Bengals fans weren’t happy with calls made in the AFC championship game, which sent the Chiefs to the Super Bowl. But it’s not true that the NFL is investigating the referee who made the calls, despite a misleading post spreading on social media. A Twitter post making the claim came from a satirical account featuring a character from the comedy film “Anchorman” — details lost on some social media users who shared the post as real. “BREAKING: NFL head ref of the AFC Championship game, Ronald Torbert, commenting on the NFL’s investigation on his family member placing a wager on the game this morning,” the post reads. It then quotes Torbert as saying, “I had no knowledge that my son placed a large wager on the Chiefs until after the game.” The post claims Torbert made the comments on a radio station called “101.4 ‘The Juice,’” which doesn’t exist. An internet search for the station brings up several juices sold in amounts of 101.4 fluid ounces. The account that posted it identifies itself as a “parody/satire sports anchor at KVWN sports news,” referring to a fictional news station in the movie. Still, social media users spread the fake quote without that context on Facebook and Twitter, chalking it up to an explanation for why referees made several calls in Kansas City’s favor on Sunday night. In some cases, the post was shared as a screenshot, lacking the satirical disclaimer on the Twitter account. There’s no evidence any such investigation is taking place. Reached for comment, an NFL spokesman pointed to the fact that the account spreading the claim identified itself as satire.___Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck___Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",2023/02/03,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799771,Boyhood collides with masculinity in Oscar-nominated 'Close',"NEW YORK (AP) — When Lukas Dhont was 12, a camera was thrust into his hands. For Dhont, who would come out as gay as a young adult, the camera was an escape from the strains and stereotypes he was beginning to feel pushed on him.

            “I needed this other reality in which I could disappear because my own reality was one where I very much felt the pressures of these expectations and these codes and these norms that were put upon my body just because I was male,” the 31-year-old Belgian filmmaker says. 

            In his first home movies, Dhont created silly sci-fi shorts. His brother Michiel (now Dhont’s producer) would play an alien or a zombie. Later, Dhont discovered a wider movie world through things like the films of Chantal Akerman, and realized that cinema could be a place to confront reality, not run from it. 











            “I stopped filming the zombies and turned the camera toward me,” says Dhont. 

            Dhont’s second film, “Close,” dives back into that period of adolescence that was so formative for him. Set in the Belgian countryside, it’s about a friendship between two 13-year-old boys — Léo (Eden Dambrine) and Rémi (Gustav De Waele) — whose tender intimacy is tested, tragically, when Léo, seeking to fit in with other, more macho boys, pushes Rémi away. 

            The film, which follows Dhont’s acclaimed but controversial 2018 debut “Girl,” is a sublimely delicate and devastating portrait of young friendship and the harsh intrusion of gender roles. “Close,” which A24 is expanding in limited release in the coming weeks, won the Grand Prix in May at the Cannes Film Festival, the festival’s second most prestigious prize. Last month, it was nominated for best international film at the Academy Awards. Dhont was at a New York hotel when it was announced. 

            “It was a sort of haze,” Dhont said in a recent interview. “I think I must have screamed in a high-pitched voice that made part of the lobby really panicked.”

            For Dambrine and De Waele, “Close” has, itself, been an experience of friendship. Their own coming of age has happened over the course of making and releasing the film. Dambrine, whom Dhont cast after first seeing him on a train, was 13 when they began and just turned 16. De Waele was 12 when he auditioned and is now nearly 15. 

            “The funny thing is that they’re teenagers now,” Dhont says. “They have long hair and skateboards. It’s been a real gift to be able to experience this whole journey through the eyes of 14-year-olds.”

            “The first day of casting, we were immediately very close to each other,” Dambrine says, speaking on a Zoom interview with De Waele. “I felt a big connection between us. There were 13 boys at the casting and I was immediately close to Gustav because the other boys were a bit boring. Sorry to the other boys.”

            At the end of the day, all the actors filled out a questionnaire. One question: Who's your favorite person in the world? Hours after meeting each other, Dambrine wrote De Waele and De Waele wrote Dambrine. 

            “Lukas still thinks it was a plan,” says Dambrine. 

            “I think Lukas didn’t search for talent,” says De Waele. “He searched for friendship. When I came home from the casting, I said to my parents, ‘I made a friend.’”

            Dhont’s first film, “Girl,” about a teenage ballerina’s gender transition, won the the Caméra d’Or for best first feature in Cannes. But when it arrived on Netflix, some in the LGBTQ community questioned Dhont’s casting of a non-transgender lead and criticized a scene of self-inflected violence as perpetuating a false narrative of gender transition. Dhont has called the backlash a “process of learning” about perspective in storytelling. 

            Some reviewers have also criticized “Close"" and its drastic mid-movie shift of being emotionally manipulative. Dhont, though, cites statistics that show how suicide rates increase among young males as evidence of the fraught nature of teenage years for boys. 

            “The stakes are really high. At least they feel so to me,” says Dhont. “We hope there’s a strong sense of hope for this tragedy to not happen, for it to be avoided. I understand why the film moves as it moves.” 

            Part of Dhont’s motivation in writing “Close” with co-writer Angelo Tijssens was a kind of personal atonement. While Dhont had his own experiences of friends falling away from him, he also distanced himself from some relationships as a kid, and now regrets it. 

            “There were some friends out there that I actively pushed away out of fear,” Dhont says. “I deprived not only myself but them from the love they felt — and I mean love in the broadest sense of the term. I think this film is also an ode to them.”

            A key resource in expanding “Close” beyond Dhont’s own experiences was psychologist Niobe Way’s 2013 book “Deep Secrets: Boys’ Friendships and the Crisis of Connection.” She interviewed hundreds of boys between the ages of 13 and 18. Their conversations, strikingly over time, charted how intimacy and friendships give way to distrust and isolation as boys become men. 

            “I wanted to speak about this society that has this dominance-based masculine culture and tells young men from a early age that there are certain traits valued, like independence, being more distant with the emotional world,” says Dhont. “So we tear them apart, not only from each other, but we rupture the language that connects them to the inside. There are many problems — and I’d even dare to say for a film with a small scope, world problems — that start with what seems like a small rupture but is actually a very big one.”

            Making “Close” — an intimate process that included months of rehearsals and a production that encouraged looseness and warmth — was for De Waele and Dambrine the kind of open-hearted experience for which many of the boys of “Deep Secrets” might have yearned. 

            “It really changed my vision of life,” says Dambrine, “how friendship really works.” 

            It’s also been head-spinning. Says Dambrine: “In Cannes, everyone acts like you’re super famous but you’re just a normal kid who skipped school to come to the festival."" 

            Now they’re headed to the Oscars for what will surely be an even more bewildering spectacle. They hope to see Austin Butler, a Cannes encounter, again. De Waele laments that it's impossible for him to meet his most idolized filmmaker — Billy Wilder — on his first trip to Los Angeles (Wilder died in 2002). 

            “I also want to see Cate Blanchett,” says Dambrine. 

            “Yeah, of course,” echoes De Waele. 

            Both boys may be edging closer to adulthood but they’re giddy in a childlike way talking about their transformative time with “Close.” As they get ready to sign off, Dambrine adds one last observation that he’s clung to. 

            “The movie’s talking about judgment,” Dambrine says. “In your life, people will always judge you. So why do you have to listen to them now and change for them, when you can just skip what they’re saying and live your life and be happy with yourself?”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799772,Cyprus presidential candidates push leadership credentials,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The three front-runners vying for the presidency of ethnically split Cyprus wound down their campaigns Friday, putting pronouncements of their leadership credentials ahead of issues two days before the election. 

            Opinion polls indicate that none of the three, who are all close associates of outgoing President Nicos Anastasiades, will muster more than half of the vote — the bar for an outright win in Sunday's voting. 

            The top two finishers will likely face each other in a runoff election a week later. Some 561,000 citizens are eligible to vote. 











            Averof Neophytou, 61, who took over the leadership of the country’s Democratic Rally party from Anastasiades, doubled down on his ""safe choice"" campaign theme, portraying himself as a steady hand with a surfeit of experience who can get things done.

            “I’ve also understood that those who profess to usher in change will only manage to usher in chaos,” Neophytou told supporters during his final rally Thursday. “This is no time for experiments or mistakes.”

            Career diplomat Andreas Mavroyiannis, who served as Anastasiades' chief negotiator in peace talks with breakaway Turkish Cypriots, sharpened his message for voters who may be disgruntled after a decade of the outgoing president’s leadership. The communist-rooted AKEL party is supporting Mavroyiannis' candidacy.

            “In this election, there are three front-runners but two choices – the continuation of this government or progressive change,” Mavroyiannis told his supporters. “Change is in your hands.” 

            Nikos Christodoulides, 49, a former government spokesperson and foreign minister, is running as an independent. Throughout the monthslong campaign, he hammered home the message that he’d be the president for all Cypriots irrespective of ideology or party affiliation.

            “I have the experience and the knowledge, I have the relationships and above all else, I have the vision to see my country free and reunified,” he said at his final campaign rally.

            Opinion polls have consistently put Christodoulides in the lead, with Mavroyiannis and Neophytou battling it out for the runoff spot.

            Voters will expect the new president to quickly move to buttress an economy buffeted by Russia’s war in Ukraine as high inflation cuts deeply into the take-home pay of Cypriots. 

            Migration has also been a hot-button issue amid a continued influx of migrants that has made Cyprus one of the top European Union countries in terms of asylum applications per capita. 

            Capitalizing on Cyprus’ offshore natural gas deposits amid an energy crunch is another priority issue, as is getting back to the negotiating table with Turkish Cypriots to resolve the ethnic cleave that took place on the island in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece.NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The three front-runners vying for the presidency of ethnically split Cyprus wound down their campaigns Friday, putting pronouncements of their leadership credentials ahead of issues two days before the election.Opinion polls indicate that none of the three, who are all close associates of outgoing President Nicos Anastasiades, will muster more than half of the vote — the bar for an outright win in Sunday's voting.The top two finishers will likely face each other in a runoff election a week later.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799774,Germany debates reintroducing military conscription,"A familiar discussion has begun in Germany, almost a year after Russia started its war on Ukraine: Should compulsory military service be reintroduced? Some countries, for example Latvia, have recently reintroduced it, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius fueled the debate when he said earlier this week: ""It was a mistake to suspend compulsory military service.""Article 12a of Germany's Basic Law reads: ""Men can be obliged to serve in the armed forces, in the Federal Border Guard or in a civil defense unit from the age of 18.""And until 2011 German men between the ages of 18 and 27 were obligated to either serve in the nation's military, the Bundeswehr, or perform an alternative service for a limited period of time in civilian areas such as emergency management or medical care.General conscription was scrapped in 2011 with the goal to professionalize the troops and reduce the size of the Bundeswehr. Now the German army consists only of career soldiers and long-term contract troopers.Patrick Sensburg, a lawmaker with the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), also still thinks the abolition of compulsory military service was a mistake. On March 24, 2011, he was the only member of his party, which was in power at the time, to vote against the suspension.Twelve years later, the reserve colonel is no longer the only one to think this way.""It's not good enough if we can only defend one or two states with a Bundeswehr that is too small and too poorly equipped,"" Sensburg suggests. ""Of course, conscription costs money, national defense costs money. That's a decision we have to make politically: Do we want to be able to defend our country at all?""Over the past two decades, the Bundeswehr has shrunk from more than 317,000 soldiers to just over 183,000. Sensburg is convinced that this number, together with the approximately 100,000 reservists, is not sufficient for an emergency. And voluntary military service is not attractive enough to substantially increase Bundeswehr numbers.""We don't just need the super-specialists, we don't just need the KSK special forces, we also need a certain mass of soldiers to be able to provide national defense,"" says Sensburg, who heads the association of reservists. ""Germany needs a strong military that is well-trained but also has many reservists from all walks of life. But we can only ensure that if we have compulsory military service.""In his interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung national newspaper, the German defense minister admitted compulsory military service would not help Germany at all in the next two or three years. But Pistorius, who himself served in the army as a conscript in the 1980s, believes there must be an open discussion again about the benefits of mandatory military service.A spokeswoman for the German Defense Ministry said in response to a DW inquiry:""Currently the Defense Ministry has no plans to reintroduce conscription. The Bundeswehr is a very different force today from what it was ten years ago or even further back. We have different tasks that require well-trained and specialized personnel. We have different structures and a different operational reality. And we have opened our armed forces to women for the past 20 years.""She goes on to say: ""The former format of compulsory military service would be impossible to implement in the current structures and would be an additional burden. Recruitment, training, and accommodation of conscripts alone would result in a considerable need for investment.""In principle, according to the Federal Ministry of Defense, ""In the event of tension or defense, up to 60,000 reservists could be drafted. Thus, the Bundeswehr is able to fulfill its tasks in national and alliance defense together with the armed forces of our NATO partners.""For defense commissioner Eva Högl, the debate about compulsory military service is, therefore, a ""theoretical debate,"" and Finance Minister Christian Lindner — who heads the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), the smallest party in the three-way coalition government — has brushed it aside as a ""discussion about ghosts.""""This debate about compulsory military service comes up every now and then, but it doesn't have much to do with current reality,"" says lawmaker Wolfgang Hellmich. Just like Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, he is with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). ""It would mean billions would have to be invested in the introduction or re-establishment of structures that are all gone,"" Hellmich tells DW.Hellmich is a member of the German Bundestag's defense committee. Like Sensburg and Pistorius, he thinks the suspension of conscription was a big mistake.But twelve years later, critics say there is no good reason to reintroduce it: There are no district offices for medical screening, no military equipment to train conscripts, and no instructors to do so. There is no plan for how to introduce military service for roughly 700,000 young men and women who turn 18 each year and would then be required to serve. And it would take double-digit billions in contributions to restart the conscription apparatus.Instead of wasting valuable time on the reintroduction of compulsory military service, Germany must focus on recruiting professionals with a wide range of know-how, Hellmich says. ""We don't have a problem in recruiting officers and officer candidates, we have a problem filling jobs in the technical services. So everywhere where it's about logistical supply for the troops and data engineering and cyber security.""And the Bundeswehr still has a massive diversity problem in 2023. Only one in eight soldiers is female. Hellmich is a member of NATO's Parliamentary Assembly, and during a recent visit to Norway he visited a special forces company that was made up entirely of women — which would currently be impossible in Germany, he said.""We need to look more intensively at the issue of personnel recruitment,"" the defense politician concludes.""We need to think about how to get more people to serve in the Bundeswehr. We have to make voluntary service more attractive in order to reach people who will then stay in the Bundeswehr. But compulsory military service wouldn't help one bit at this point in time.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799776,Blinken postpones China trip over suspected spy balloon,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed a diplomatic visit to China after a high-altitude Chinese balloon was spotted over the US.Blinken's abrupt decision on Friday to delay the trip came just hours before he had been due to depart Washington for Beijing.A US official said Blinken and President Joe Biden determined it was best not to proceed with the trip at this time.""We have noted the PRC (People's Republic of China) statement of regret, but the presence of this balloon in our airspace is a clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law, and it is unacceptable that this has occurred,"" a State Department official told reporters.""After consultations with our interagency partners as well as with Congress, we have concluded that the conditions are not right at this moment for Secretary Blinken to travel to China,"" the official added.The balloon has been flying over US skies for a few days now.US defense officials said they believed the balloon was used ""for surveillance."" But China's foreign ministry said it was used for ""mainly meteorological"" purposes.The decision to postpone Blinken's trip comes as Biden's administration weighs a broader response to the discovery of the balloon flying over sensitive sites.The discovery of the balloon alarmed many in Washington, especially Republican members of Congress who have advocated taking a tougher stance with China.Two Republican 2024 reelection challengers, former President Donald Trump, and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador, said the US should immediately shoot down the balloon.Blinken's two-day to Beijing would have been the first by a top US diplomat since October 2018.Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in November at a summit in Indonesia that Blinken would travel to Beijing.The US and China are at loggerheads over Taiwan, human rights, China's claims in the South China Sea, North Korea, Russia's war in Ukraine, trade policy and climate change.According to the State Department, Blinken had told the Chinese he would be prepared to travel to China ""at the earliest opportunity when conditions allow.''The balloon flew over Alaska's Aleutian Islands and through Canada before appearing over the US state of Montana, which is home to one of three nuclear missile silo fields in the country.Washington said it has been tracking the suspected spy balloon for a couple of days since it entered US airspace.US military leaders considered shooting down the balloon with F-22 fighter jets but ultimately decided against it because of the potential safety risk posed by the debris, the official said.The US has also assessed that it had only ""limited'' value in terms of providing intelligence China couldn't obtain by other technologies, such as spy satellites.Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder added the balloon was flying ""at an altitude well above commercial air traffic and does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground.""In a statement on Friday, the Chinese foreign ministry described the balloon as a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research.""The airship is from China and is civilian in nature, used for meteorological and other scientific research. Due to the influence of westerly winds and its limited control capability, the airship deviated from its intended course,"" it said.""China regrets that the airship strayed into the United States by mistake due to force majeure. China will continue to maintain communication with the US side to properly handle this accident,"" it said.lo/jcg (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799777,Taiwan: Czech Republic president-elect elevates ties,"Taiwan and the Czech Republic may not have formal diplomatic ties, but a series of diplomatic breakthroughs this week seems to suggest that the new government in Prague under the leadership of president-elect Petr Pavel is ready to bring the bilateral relationship to the next level, even if it means angering China.On Monday, Pavel, a former NATO general, held a 15-minute phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, in which they expressed the desire to further strengthen the bilateral relationship. The incoming Czech leader even proposed an in-person meeting. The call follows a series of visits by high-level government officials and lawmakers from both sides since 2020.""The call is a continuation of increased political ties between Taiwan and the Czech Republic,"" said Jakub Janda, director of the European Values Center for Security Policy (EVC) based in Prague. ""What the president-elect did is taking the engagement with Taiwan a bit further.""Other analysts say Pavel's move is also a departure from current Czech President Milos Zeman's pro-China foreign policy. ""Pavel signaled his intentions to direct foreign policy differently to the current President Zeman, who has been a staunch proponent of 'pragmatic economic diplomacy' mostly towards China and Russia,"" said Ivana Karaskova, founder of China Observers in Central and Eastern Europe.""He went so far as saying 'yes' to a journalist's question at one of the pre-election interviews asking whether he would visit Taiwan if elected as president. The call is not merely symbolic, but carries a genuine interest in Taiwan and its position in the international arena,"" she told DW.A day after the unprecedented phone call between Pavel and Tsai, China criticized the move, saying that the call is ""a serious interference in China's internal affairs,"" especially after Beijing tried to discuss the matter with Pavel, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. ""We urge the Czech Republic to take immediate and effective measures to correct the wrongdoing, undo the negative impact of this incident and credibly abide by the 'one-China principle.'""Despite Beijing's dissatisfaction, Pavel defended his call with Tsai in an interview with DW, saying that there is no reason why the relationship between Taiwan and the Czech Republic should be reduced as it doesn't affect Prague's foreign policy principles toward China. But on Tuesday, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala reiterated that Prague upholds its ""one-China policy"" despite maintaining a good relationship with Taiwan.Even though the president mostly has ceremonial power in the Czech political system, Janda from EVC told DW that in the current political context, the president can be very visible in foreign policy. ""What this means is that the president-elect will be more hawkish than the government on issues like engaging with Taiwan or standing up to Chinese pressure,"" he said, adding that the Czech government may be a bit more cautious.While Janda thinks China may decide to freeze the contacts of some Czech companies in China or pressure other European companies from dropping Czech contractors, Beijing's diplomatic charm offensive toward European countries in recent months may limit the Chinese government's options to retaliate against Prague.""China is trying to pivot away from the 'wolf warrior diplomacy,' and improve their reputation that has suffered some damage in recent years,"" he told DW. ""So if they try to attack the Czech Republic, which means an attack on the EU internal market, that will basically contradict China's current foreign policy approach. I think both options to launch a retaliation are bad for Beijing.""Apart from promising to strengthen cooperation with Prague in semiconductor design and training talents for cutting-edge technologies, Tsai also said she would encourage Taiwanese companies to treat the Czech Republic as a base in Central and Eastern Europe. Janda from EVC points out that both sides are also exploring cooperation in the security sector.""The effort by many people in Prague is to allow the Czech government to conduct more security cooperation, including intelligence sharing on China and military assistance with Taiwan, in the future,"" he told DW, adding that if both sides agree on the acquisition of weapons in the future, such cooperation will need political support since the export licensing for any weapon system to Taiwan will require approval from the Czech government.Some experts think it's crucial for Taiwan to focus on areas of possible cooperation that can further increase its visibility in the Czech Republic. ""Taiwan needs to have a thorough understanding of what the Czech Republic's needs are and jointly build a strategy on what areas the two sides can realistically deliver,"" said Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan and a former political adviser to the European Parliament.""That would signal to the business sector that they can expect opportunities on the horizon. It's crucial that Taiwan uses this momentum and continues to build on it,"" she told DW.Kolas Yotaka, the spokesperson for Taiwan's presidential office, emphasizes that trade and economy are the areas in which Taiwan hopes to see progress in its bilateral relationship with the Czech Republic. ""We are pragmatic and know that the economy is important for every country,"" she told DW, adding that promoting economic development of all kinds in a democratic context is the key to building trust and reciprocity.During a call with Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu on Wednesday, the speaker of the Czech parliament's lower house, Marketa Pekarova Adamova, revealed that she plans to visit Taiwan next month. ""I assured the minister that systematic support of partners who respect human rights and the principles of liberal democracy belongs among priorities of our parliamentary diplomacy,"" she said in a statement.Ferenczy from the National Dong Hwa University adds that as countries in Central and Eastern Europe gradually form a shared feeling that China is becoming an unreliable partner, Taiwan has proven itself to be a like-minded partner throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With such a perception emerging among some countries in the region, she thinks the Chinese government should expect the Czech Republic to engage with Taiwan in a clearer and firmer way. ""It's accurate to say that across the Czech Republic, there is a growing interest and readiness to talk about Taiwan,"" she said.Edited by: John SilkEvery Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

""This could be part of the solution.""Operational since 1975, the three reactors were initially set to be decommissioned in 2015 but had their lifetime extended until 2025 after Belgium held a review of its phase-out plan.Belgium has two nuclear plants, operated by French utility company Engie, with five reactors still working.Belgium first decided on its nuclear phase-out in 2003 and it was scheduled to be completed by 2025. However, it decided last year to keep the newest plants open until 2035.Belgium took one nuclear reactor, Tihange 2, off its power grid after 40 years on Tuesday evening as part of the country's planned nuclear phase-out. The winding down of nuclear power began with the closure of a reactor at Doel, near the Belgian port city of Antwerp in September.Those two reactors were known for repeated safety issues, having been shut down on previous occasions after the discovery of cracks in reactor pressure vessels. The Belgian government had considered keeping those two reactors online because of energy concerns.Before the reactors were shut down, Belgium had relied on nuclear power for about half of the country's energy needs.The German government and the German city of Aachen, which lies near the Belgian border have repeatedly called for the reactors to be decommissioned in the past.In 2019, the European Court of Justice found that Belgium infringed European Union law by failing to carry out the required environmental assessments before prolonging the life of Doel 1 and 2 nuclear reactors.rc/jcg (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/02/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799781,"For Serrano, second shot at undisputed, then maybe at Taylor","NEW YORK (AP) — Amanda Serrano narrowly missed becoming an undisputed champion last year when Katie Taylor edged her at Madison Square Garden.

            She has another chance at undisputed on Saturday. Win that and she might get a second shot at Taylor, too.

            Serrano (43-2-1, 30 KOs) returns to Madison Square Garden, this time back in her own weight class, to face Erika Cruz (15-1, 3 KOs) with all four belts in the featherweight division on the line. A champion in seven weight classes, she can become the first Puerto Rican to hold all four in one division simultaneously if she adds Cruz's to the three she currently owns.











            “So to me, that was definitely a goal I wanted to accomplish,” Serrano said. “Honestly, once I accomplish this goal, I think I’ve pursued everything in my career, I can retire and be happy. But I won’t.”

            Not with a rematch with Taylor possibly up next. 

            They fought for Taylor's four lightweight titles in April in the first women's boxing match to headline at the Garden in front of a sold-out crowd of 19,187 that was divided between Puerto Rican and Irish fans. Taylor won by split decision in what organizers called the most significant bout in women's boxing history.

            Eddie Hearn, who promotes Taylor, was back at MSG on Tuesday to watch LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Knicks in overtime. As he walked around the arena, he found himself thinking back to the moments before that fight.

            “And I thought to myself, this is one of the biggest basketball games that can take place here. The atmosphere for Taylor-Serrano was a thousand times better,” he said. “I know it’s a different sport, but what I’m trying to say is like, that was such a special sporting occasion that doing it back in Ireland, like, we have to see it again.”

            If Serrano wins, the goal is to get them back in the ring in May at a venue in Taylor's home country, where she has never fought as a pro. If she loses, perhaps the opportunity would go to Alycia Baumgardner, who could become the undisputed champion at 130 pounds with a victory Saturday over Elhem Mekhaled earlier in the event that will stream on DAZN. 

            Baumgardner (13-1, 7 KOs) has owned three belts in the division since edging Mikaela Mayer in October in London, and the vacant WBA belt will become hers with a victory over Mekhaled (15-1, 3 KOs).

            “As I walked in the gym as an 8-year-old girl, I had a vision, I had a plan to become the best and that’s what I’m doing,” Baumgardner said. “Now, here just seeing it come alive, I’m just, I’m hungry and I love to fight.”

            This card is in the smaller Hulu Theater, not the main room where Serrano fought last time, but she said it's no less meaningful. She began this current run atop the featherweight division in the Hulu Theater when she beat Heather Hardy in September 2019.

            Eight months earlier, she had claimed a title at 115 pounds to become a champion in a seventh weight class, then told her team it was time to stick at 126, where she feels most comfortable. She added the third piece by rebounding from the loss to Taylor with a victory over Sarah Mahfoud in September.

            The 34-year-old Serrano has fought anywhere from 115 to 140 pounds and would like to stay at 126. But she doesn't have many matches left before planning to retire at 36 — she pushed the original intention of 35 back a year due to the pandemic — and probably none would be bigger than Taylor-Serrano II. 

            That would require going back up to 135 pounds again. 

            “I say featherweight is where I want to be at, but the only way I’m going to go up is to fight Katie Taylor for the rematch,” Serrano said. “But right now I’m focused on Erika Cruz. I’m focused on becoming undisputed and then after that, it’s game time. So we’ll see, we’ll see.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799782,LAFC's Crépeau standing tall after broken leg in title match,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Maxime Crépeau wanted to watch the last minutes of the MLS Cup final during his ride to the hospital, but he couldn't get a stream to work in the ambulance. The Los Angeles FC goalkeeper and his wife gave up and started refreshing a statistical webpage on his phone, his broken right leg becoming increasingly painful as the adrenaline wore off.

            Crépeau never saw the refresh for the final kick in the championship-deciding penalty shootout because his father had already called him to tell him he was a Major League Soccer champion, in no small part because of that broken leg throbbing before him.

            “From that moment, it was a party in the ambulance,” Crépeau said.











            His dreams of a World Cup appearance for Canada were obviously over, but Crépeau had won a ring and a place in MLS lore with his devastating injury in the 110th minute from a brave — and quite possibly game-saving — challenge on unmarked Philadelphia forward Cory Burke.

            “It was a play I didn’t even think about,” Crépeau said. “It was just really instinct, and I was just going for it.”

            Nearly three months after that November title game, Crépeau is done celebrating, almost done healing and ready to start working again. The goalie who stabilized LAFC’s defense in its championship season has another round of X-rays scheduled early next week, and if they’re OK, he will start running again.

            He won’t be ready for the start of LAFC’s title defense season in three weeks, but he hopes to return in the spring, certainly before June.

            “It's not always beautiful, the journey,” Crépeau said. ""There was a lot of pain (physically), and a lot of pain mentally as well, missing out on the World Cup. ... You're at 100, and you go to zero in a split second. But when you wear that jersey and you see the (champion's) star, I'm emotionally attached to it. Because for me, it's non-negotiable. I always give 110%, whatever happens. I took the worst out of the hit, but that star is something to me. I left my leg for the star.""

            Crépeau has a clear memory of just about every that happened after his split-second decision to challenge Burke went wrong.

            “You realize your leg is broken, and my first thought was, the game is not over, right?” he said. “But I’m kind of in a bit of a shock, and then I have the realization of the World Cup in three weeks. So that was my first five minutes after it happened. And then the pain just kind of creeps in there as well.”

            When he got to the hospital in nearby Baldwin Park, his teammates began FaceTiming him in the midst of their championship celebrations — including his backup, John McCarthy, who made two saves in the penalty shootout to earn the game’s MVP award.

            “The doctors were coming in to evaluate me, and I was like, ‘Just don’t talk to me for a second,’” Crépeau said with a laugh. “‘Just give me five minutes!’ But of course you can’t say that to the doc.”

            Crépeau’s offseason was spent largely in a wheelchair while healing from surgery. He still enjoyed the fruits of his sacrifice as a fixture on LAFC’s celebratory tour of Los Angeles’ top sports and entertainment destinations with the MLS Cup in tow on his two-wheeled excursions.

            “It’s funny, because I never got recognized in public before the final,” he said. “Now, people have started coming up and saying, ‘Hey, what’s up?’ It’s a huge city with a lot of professional teams ... but people are more attached to our club because of this, so it’s a special feeling.”

            AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLOS ANGELES (AP) — Maxime Crépeau wanted to watch the last minutes of the MLS Cup final during his ride to the hospital, but he couldn't get a stream to work in the ambulance. The Los Angeles FC goalkeeper and his wife gave up and started refreshing a statistical webpage on his phone, his broken right leg becoming increasingly painful as the adrenaline wore off.Crépeau never saw the refresh for the final kick in the championship-deciding penalty shootout because his father had already called him to tell him he was a Major League Soccer champion, in no small part because of that broken leg throbbing before him.“From that moment, it was a party in the ambulance,” Crépeau said.His dreams of a World Cup appearance for Canada were obviously over, but Crépeau had won a ring and a place in MLS lore with his devastating injury in the 110th minute from a brave — and quite possibly game-saving — challenge on unmarked Philadelphia forward Cory Burke.“It was a play I didn’t even think about,” Crépeau said. “It was just really instinct, and I was just going for it.”Nearly three months after that November title game, Crépeau is done celebrating, almost done healing and ready to start working again. The goalie who stabilized LAFC’s defense in its championship season has another round of X-rays scheduled early next week, and if they’re OK, he will start running again.He won’t be ready for the start of LAFC’s title defense season in three weeks, but he hopes to return in the spring, certainly before June.“It's not always beautiful, the journey,” Crépeau said. ""There was a lot of pain (physically), and a lot of pain mentally as well, missing out on the World Cup. ... You're at 100, and you go to zero in a split second. But when you wear that jersey and you see the (champion's) star, I'm emotionally attached to it. Because for me, it's non-negotiable. I always give 110%, whatever happens. I took the worst out of the hit, but that star is something to me. I left my leg for the star.""Crépeau has a clear memory of just about every that happened after his split-second decision to challenge Burke went wrong.“You realize your leg is broken, and my first thought was, the game is not over, right?” he said. “But I’m kind of in a bit of a shock, and then I have the realization of the World Cup in three weeks. So that was my first five minutes after it happened. And then the pain just kind of creeps in there as well.”When he got to the hospital in nearby Baldwin Park, his teammates began FaceTiming him in the midst of their championship celebrations — including his backup, John McCarthy, who made two saves in the penalty shootout to earn the game’s MVP award.“The doctors were coming in to evaluate me, and I was like, ‘Just don’t talk to me for a second,’” Crépeau said with a laugh. “‘Just give me five minutes!’ But of course you can’t say that to the doc.”Crépeau’s offseason was spent largely in a wheelchair while healing from surgery. He still enjoyed the fruits of his sacrifice as a fixture on LAFC’s celebratory tour of Los Angeles’ top sports and entertainment destinations with the MLS Cup in tow on his two-wheeled excursions.“It’s funny, because I never got recognized in public before the final,” he said. “Now, people have started coming up and saying, ‘Hey, what’s up?’ It’s a huge city with a lot of professional teams ... but people are more attached to our club because of this, so it’s a special feeling.”Crépeau's first season at LAFC was a clear success even before he capped it by winning a ring, and he appears to be the club's goalie of the future as well.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799784,Officer shot at public library remains in critical condition,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A Tennessee police officer who was shot at a public library while responding to a trespassing complaint remained in “extremely critical condition” on Friday, Memphis Police said.

            The officer was hospitalized Thursday after the shooting at the Poplar-White Station Public Library, a small building on a busy Memphis street surrounded by high-rise office buildings, restaurants and stores.

            The shooting came amid heighted scrutiny nationally of how much force police use after five officers in the same department were fired last month and charged with murder and other crimes in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The cases weren't connected, though the policies of the Memphis Police Department are under intense review locally and nationally.











            Officers were called to the library and encountered a man who had been the subject of a trespassing call in the same neighborhood, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Keli McAlister said. 

            The man had started a confrontation with another person inside the library, and when two officers attempted to talk with him, he pulled out a weapon and shot one of them, McAlister said. The other officer drew his weapon, shooting and killing Torence Jackson Jr., 28, of Indianapolis, the TBI said in a statement. Jackson was a Black man. The two officers involved are also Black.

            There were employees and patrons inside the library at the time of the shooting, but no one else was injured, McAlister said.

            The TBI is working on the case at the request of the Shelby County prosecutor. The bureau often investigates shootings and other use-of-force incidents around the state when officers are involved.

            The agency also investigated how Memphis Police officers responded in the Nichols case, which led to criminal charges against five Black officers. 

            Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was beaten after police stopped him for an alleged traffic violation Jan. 7. He died Jan. 10 at a hospital. Video released after pressure from Nichols’ family shows officers holding him down and repeatedly punching, kicking and striking him with a baton as he screamed for his mother.

            In the weeks since Nichols’ death, the officers' specialized unit was disbanded and two more officers have been suspended.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799785,"Capitals sign Dylan Strome to $25 million, 5-year extension","SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — The Washington Capitals signed forward Dylan Strome to a five-year extension worth $25 million. 

            The team announced the contract Friday during NHL All-Star Weekend, which is taking place in South Florida — the place Strome was drafted third in 2015. 

            Strome will count $5 million against the salary cap through the 2027-28 season. He was set to be a restricted free agent this summer.











            “Dylan is an intelligent and skilled center and has been a great addition to our organization,” general manager Brian MacLellan said. “We are pleased to sign him to a long-term contract. We feel his skill set is a great fit for our team as he enters the prime years of his career at an important position.”

            Strome is getting a raise from the $3.5 million deal he signed with the Capitals after the Chicago Blackhawks opted not to tender him a qualifying offer and made him a free agent. Strome has 11 goals and 25 assists in 36 games this season and ranks third on Washington's roster with 14 power-play points.

            The Mississauga, Ontario, native who played his junior hockey alongside Connor McDavid with the Erie Otters has 206 points in 325 regular-season NHL games with the Arizona Coyotes, Blackhawks and Capitals.

            “So well-deserved,” McDavid told The Associated Press after the All-Star skills competition. “A guy that has worked his way into a really good contract and into a good role on a good team. Happy for him.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799786,Iranian director freed on bail after going on hunger strike,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Acclaimed Iranian director Jafar Panahi was released on bail Friday, two days after going on hunger strike to protest his imprisonment last summer, his supporters said.

            Panahi was arrested last July and later ordered to serve six years on charges of propagandizing against the government, a sentence dating back to 2011 that had never been enforced.

            He is among a number of Iranian artists, sports figures and other celebrities who have been detained after speaking out against the theocracy. Such arrests have become more frequent since nationwide protests broke out in September over the death of a young woman in police custody.











            Panahi, 62, had continued making award-winning films for over a decade despite being legally barred from travel and filmmaking. His latest film, “No Bears,” was released to widespread praise in September while he was behind bars, a week before the protests erupted.

            Yusef Moulai, Panahi’s lawyer, confirmed he had been released on bail and returned home. He said Panahi was in good health after two days without food. He declined to provide further information. 

            The semiofficial ISNA news agency said several artists had welcomed him as he departed the notorious Evin Prison in the capital, Tehran. 

            Panahi had issued a statement earlier this week saying he would refuse food or medicine starting Wednesday “in protest against the extra-legal and inhumane behavior of the judicial and security apparatus.”

            
                He was arrested in July when he went to the Tehran prosecutor’s office to inquire about the arrests of two other Iranian filmmakers. A judge later ruled that he must serve the earlier sentence.

            In “No Bears,” he plays a fictionalized version of himself while making a film along the Iran-Turkey border. The New York Times and The Associated Press named it one of the top 10 films of the year, and film critic Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times called it 2022’s best movie.

            The protests erupted after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, died while being held by Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating the country’s strict Islamic dress code. The demonstrations rapidly escalated into calls for the overthrow of Iran’s ruling clerics, a major challenge to their four-decade rule.

            At least 527 protesters have been killed and more than 19,500 people have been detained since the demonstrations began, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has closely monitored the unrest. Iranian authorities have not released official figures on deaths or arrests.

            Several prominent Iranian filmmakers and other artists have expressed support for the protests and criticized the violent crackdown on dissent. Rights groups say authorities have used live ammunition, bird shot and tear gas to disperse protesters. 

            Iran has executed four men on charges linked to the protests, and rights groups say at least 16 others have been sentenced to death in closed-door hearings.

            Taraneh Alidoosti, the 38-year-old star of Asghar Farhadi’s Oscar-winning 2016 film, “The Salesman,” was arrested in December after taking to social media to criticize the crackdown on protests.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799787,"Report: Navy ships face growing maintenance delays, costs","WASHINGTON (AP) — Navy ships are getting fewer steaming hours because of growing maintenance delays and costs, a troubling trend that comes as at time when the U.S. is struggling to keep pace with China’s growing fleet.

            Operating and support costs grew by about $2.5 billion across 10 ship classes while the number of propulsion hours in which ships were operating or training dipped during a 10-year period that ended in 2021, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. 

            The Navy saw increased maintenance delays, breakdowns and cannibalization of parts — moving them from one ship to keep another one going — during the period.











            The analysis shows “persistent sustainment challenges that have worsened,” compounded by maintenance delays and deferred maintenance noted in previous reports by the GAO, a congressional agency that audits federal programs.

            “Over time this situation has resulted in worsening ship conditions and increased costs to repair and sustain ships,"" the GAO said. 

            A spokesperson for Naval Surface Forces said the Navy appreciates the GAO’s recommendations for improving maintenance delivery times. The goal is 75 mission capable ships — this figure doesn’t include aircraft carriers, sealift ships or submarines — among the 164 ships assigned to the Surface Force, said Cmdr. Arlo Abrahamson.

            “This imperative for 75 mission capable ships drives every program and action we take, and across our force, the enterprise is aligned to reach this north star,” Vice Adm. Roy Kitchener, commander of Naval Surface Forces, said this month at a Surface Navy Association event.

            The Wasp-class amphibious assault ship and littoral combat ships experienced the greatest number of severe “casualty reports” that impair a ship’s ability to operate effectively, the GAO report said. San Antonio-class amphibious transport docks and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers experienced the biggest maintenance delays, the report said.

            The maintenance delays and other problems were troubling at a time when the Navy is struggling not only to keep up with China, which already has a larger fleet, but also is facing other adversaries at sea — including Russia.

            But Diana Maurer, director of defense capabilities and management at the GAO, said the Navy's leadership understands there is a problem and is focused on making improvements. “It's encouraging that it’s not business as usual,” she said.

            The report, released on Wednesday, focused on surface ships and did not look at the submarine fleet. The next report will likely expand to include both surface and undersea vessels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799789,Giant panda Le Le dies after 20 years at Memphis Zoo,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Giant panda Le Le has died, the Memphis Zoo announced Friday. 

            The panda, born July 18, 1998, died Wednesday, zoo spokesperson Rebecca Winchester said in an email. His cause of death has yet to be determined as a medical investigation is pending, the zoo said. 

            “Le Le’s name translates to ‘happy happy,’ and his name perfectly reflected his personality,” the zoo said in a statement. “Le Le was a happy bear that enjoyed apples, engaging with enrichment and relaxing while covering himself with freshly shredded bamboo. He had an easy-going personality and was a favorite of all who met and worked with him over the years.”











            Le Le’s peaceful death as he slept was “sudden and unexpected” with no indication that he was sick, zoo President and CEO Matt Thompson said at a news conference Friday. Nothing in video footage from the days leading up to Le Le’s death indicated that there was anything wrong with him, he said. 

            Le Le had been at the zoo since 2003 and was expected to return to China soon with female panda Ya Ya as a loan agreement ended with the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens. 

            Advocacy groups In Defense of Animals and Panda Voices raised concerns about the pandas’ conditions in the past and applauded the animals’ planned return to China. In recent days, Panda Voices members watching the panda cam saw Le Le collapse and when they tried to get information about his condition, they were told there were no known health issues, according to Tom Clemenson, the group’s U.S. spokesman. 

            “We are absolutely devastated,” Clemenson said. “Our fight continues. We will investigate as best we can.” 

            When asked about these allegations, Thompson, who referred to Le Le and Ya Ya as “two of the most spoiled animals on the planet,” said the groups had made false accusations over the years. Days before the panda's death, there were a couple of hours when he was not eating well, perhaps due to a stomach upset, but it didn't continue and he was “completely normal” a short time after, Senior Veterinarian Felicia Knightly said. Experts from the U.S. and China will complete a post-mortem examination, she said.

            The life expectancy of a giant panda in the wild is about 15 years, but in captivity they have lived to be as old as 38. Decades of conservation efforts in the wild and study in captivity saved the giant panda from extinction, increasing its population from fewer than 1,000 at one time to more than 1,800 in the wild and captivity.MEMPHIS, Tenn.

Last year was the deadliest since 2004, with nearly 150 Palestinians killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Israel intensified its raids in the West Bank after 19 Israelis were killed in a string of Palestinian attacks in the spring of 2022. In total, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis last year.

            Israel says that most of those killed have been militants but others — including youths protesting the incursions and other people not involved in confrontations — have also been killed. Israel says the military raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart future attacks while the Palestinians view them as further entrenchment of Israel’s open-ended, 55-year occupation.JERUSALEM (AP) — The Palestinian health ministry said Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian on Friday at a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank, the latest bloodshed in am Israeli-Palestinian flare-up .The Israeli military said the man, identified by Palestinians as Abdullah Qalalweh, 25, approached troops at Hawara checkpoint near the city of Nablus, refusing orders to stop. The military said soldiers fired warning shots into the air before a soldier shot the man and killed him.Violence has spiked in recent days, with an Israeli military raid on a militant stronghold in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin last week killing 10 people, most of them militants.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799793,$700M Powerball prize latest in string of giant jackpots,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — No, it's not lottery deja vu. 

            There really is another giant lottery jackpot up for grabs Saturday night, the latest in a string of big prizes enticing players to plunk down $2 and try to beat formidable odds.

            This time, it's an estimated $700 million Powerball jackpot drawing, which ranks at the 10th largest in U.S. lottery history. It comes on the heels of a $1.35 billion Mega Millions prize won by someone in Maine less than three weeks ago and a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot won by a California player last November.











            The prizes grow so large because the odds of winning them are so long, at one in 292.2 million for Powerball. That allows jackpots to roll over week after week, getting bigger and bigger.

            The last time someone won the Powerball jackpot was Nov. 19, 2022.

            The $700 million prize is for a winner who chooses to be paid over 29 years through an annuity. Nearly all jackpot winners prefer a one-time check, which for Saturday's drawing would be an estimated $375.7 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799794,"Duggan, Bagent among Senior Bowl QBs vying to improve stock","Quarterbacks Max Duggan and Tyson Bagent have turned the page on terrific seasons that ended badly with national championships in sight.

            TCU’s Duggan and Shepherd's Bagent are trying to improve their NFL draft stock in a weeklong audition ending in Saturday’s Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama. They are among a group of quarterbacks all trying to work their way into Day 2 of the April draft even if none are first-round prospects.

            It’s a new beginning for two players who had disappointing finishes to their college careers. TCU and Duggan, who finished second in the Heisman Trophy race, were blown out 65-7 by Georgia in the national championship game.











            Bagent won Division II’s version of the Heisman, the Harlon Hill Trophy, in 2021. But Shepherd lost 44-13 to Colorado School of Mines in the semifinals to end his final season. Both will play on the American team, along with Houston quarterback Clayton Tune.

            The National team is led by quarterbacks Malik Cunningham (Louisville), Jake Haener (Fresno State) and Jaren Hall, a BYU quarterback who is perhaps the top QB prospect playing in the game. Tennessee’s Hendon Hooker was on hand observing practices and meeting with teams but is recovering from a torn ACL.

            Last year, Pittsburgh’s Kenny Pickett (Steelers) went on from the Senior Bowl to become the only quarterback taken in the opening round.

            Duggan started 43 games in his TCU career. That experience and his impact on the TCU program led Senior Bowl executive director Jim Nagy to compare him to Brock Purdy (Iowa State, final pick of draft by the San Francisco 49ers) and Desmond Ridder (Cincinnati, third-round pick by Atlanta Falcons).

            “I know when I got into scouting, we used to value experience a ton at quarterback,” said Nagy, a former NFL scout. “And guys that lifted programs. That’s why I loved Desmond Ridder so much last year because Desmond really lifted that entire Cincinnati program. Max has played a ton of football so anyone that’s going back and doing a Purdy study, they’re going to look at Max and see he started 40-whatever career games, that can certainly help him.”

            Nagy said Duggan jumped from a seventh-round pick or free agent after the 2021 season to the fourth- or fifth-round range this spring.

            Bagent, meanwhile, is finally getting his shot to prove he can play against FBS competition. He set the NCAA’s all-division record with 159 career touchdown passes while finishing with 17,034 yards.

            “I knew that because I played at a small school, in order to check a lot of the boxes that a lot of the scouts had for me, being able to come here and play against top talent and show that I’m right where I’m supposed to be is huge in this process for me,” Bagent said. 

            He has drawn more interest from NFL teams probably than he did from college programs coming out of high school, when his only other offers were from Robert Morris and the University of Albany. Bagent entered the transfer portal last January and visited West Virginia and Maryland before opting to stay put at the D-II West Virginia school.

            Those two are part of what Nagy called “the most tightly packed group” of quarterbacks during his tenure at the Senior Bowl.

            Hall likes that “hyper competitive” environment.

            “Competition is what we all thrive on,” the BYU quarterback said. “Off the field, it’s whatever, we chop it up and we’re buddies, we get to know each other. And then we step across the lines and it’s just full go.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799796,Spanish court: Amazon violated labor law with delivery app,"MADRID (AP) — A Spanish court has ruled that Amazon broke labor laws by forcing more than 2,000 delivery drivers to use an app that the company controlled for scheduling work and payments and requiring them to use their own cars and cellphones on the job.

            Amazon could not treat workers using its Flex app as self-employed because the e-commerce giant's Spanish subsidiary “assumes the authority to make all decisions regarding the service, setting the conditions of execution and remuneration, and the circumstances of the day, time and duration” of labor, according to the Madrid labor court's decision released Friday. 

            Amazon stopped using the Flex app in Spain in 2021.











            Friday's ruling is the result of a lawsuit brought by Spain’s social security body following a 2019 labor inspection at an Amazon facility. The government agency is seeking to recoup payments that it says Amazon should have made on behalf of the drivers. 

            Amazon has long argued that Flex was an intermediary platform between freelance delivery workers and clients in Spain, rather than a delivery service in its own right. 

            “We respect the court ruling, but we disagree and will be filing an appeal,” the company said in a statement, adding that it worked with a range of delivery companies. 

            “Between 2018 and 2021, we also collaborated with some freelancers through the Amazon Flex program, which accounted for a small percentage of packages delivered in Spain,"" it added.

            The court decision is the latest in a series of legal measures in Spain that are designed to stop e-commerce and delivery app companies from designating workers as self-employed when they have little control over their hours and earnings. 

            Spain’s socialist coalition government in 2021 passed the “Riders Law,” which classified food delivery riders as employees of the digital platforms they work for.

            “This is another step forward for jurisprudence as a corrective mechanism for new ways of working” using apps, said Spain’s UGT union, which backed the lawsuit. 

            The ruling referenced a Spanish Supreme Court decision from 2020, which found that Barcelona-based food delivery app Glovo was illegally treating “riders” as self-employed.

            Spain’s labor ministry fined Glovo 57 million euros ($62 million) last month for violating the same labor laws. The company has since signed a deal with the Madrid regional government to deliver food to vulnerable people in the city.MADRID (AP) — A Spanish court has ruled that Amazon broke labor laws by forcing more than 2,000 delivery drivers to use an app that the company controlled for scheduling work and payments and requiring them to use their own cars and cellphones on the job.Amazon could not treat workers using its Flex app as self-employed because the e-commerce giant's Spanish subsidiary “assumes the authority to make all decisions regarding the service, setting the conditions of execution and remuneration, and the circumstances of the day, time and duration” of labor, according to the Madrid labor court's decision released Friday.Amazon stopped using the Flex app in Spain in 2021.Friday's ruling is the result of a lawsuit brought by Spain’s social security body following a 2019 labor inspection at an Amazon facility.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799797,Activision Blizzard settles SEC charges for $35 million,"Government regulators announced Friday that videogame maker Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay $35 million to settle charges that it failed to maintain controls to collect and assess workplace complaints with regard to disclosure requirements and violated a federal whistleblower protection rule.

            The lack of necessary controls left Activision ""without the means to determine whether larger issues existed that needed to be disclosed to investors,” said Jason Burt, director of the SEC’s Denver office. “Moreover, taking action to impede former employees from communicating directly with the Commission staff about a possible securities law violation is not only bad corporate governance, it is illegal.”

            In paying the settlement, Activision neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings and agreed to a cease-and-desist order, the agency said.











            Friday's settlement comes after the troubled Santa Monica, California-based gaming company settled with U.S. workplace regulators in 2021 over employee complaints about sexual harassment. Workers then also accused the company of discriminating against employees who were pregnant and retaliating against employees who spoke out, including firing them.

            In that settlement, the maker of Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft agreed to create an $18 million fund to compensate people who were harassed or discriminated against. Money left over would go to charities for women in the video game industry or other gender equity measures. Activision also agreed to strengthen its policies and training on harassment and discrimination and hire an independent consultant to oversee its compliance with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's conditions.

            One month before that, in August of 2021, the company announced that its president, J. Allen Brack, was stepping down after the company was hit with a discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit in California. California’s civil rights agency sued the Santa Monica-based company in July of 2021, citing a “frat boy” culture that had become a “breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women.”

            Activision shares fell close to 2%, to $75.60 in afternoon trading on Friday. Shares hovered near $100 in the weeks leading up to the flurry of workplace misconduct charges in the summer of 2021.

            Miami had argued for $2.1 million during a hearing Thursday before a panel of John Stout, Melinda Gordon and Richard Bloch.

            AL batting champion Luis Arraez, an All-Star infielder acquired by the Marlins from Minnesota last month, was awarded a $6.1 million salary on Thursday rather than the team's $5 million figure.











            Luzardo, a 25-year-old left-hander, was 4-7 with a 3.32 ERA in 18 starts last year, striking out 120 and walking 35 in 100 1/3 innings. He is 13-18 with a 3.59 ERA in 45 starts and 16 relief appearances over four big league seasons.

            Luzardo made $715,000 last season and was eligible for arbitration for the first time. He can become a free agent after the 2026 season.

            Players have won two of three decisions this year, with about 20 more scheduled for hearings.

            Seattle defeated Diego Castillo in the first decision this year on Wednesday, and the relief pitcher will get a raise to $2.95 million rather than his request of $3,225,000.

            A U.S. District Court judge in Savannah sentenced Byron Booker, 29, on Thursday. Booker pleaded guilty last fall to a federal charge of premeditated murder of a member of the U.S. military in the killing of 21-year-old Army Spc. Austin Hawk at Fort Stewart, Georgia. 

            Booker previously admitted in court to plotting the slaying with another soldier whom Hawk had reported to superiors for smoking marijuana.











            The June 2020 killing happened barely a month after Booker was honorably discharged from the Army when he completed his time on active duty, according to court records. Prosecutors said Jordan Brown, a soldier from Booker’s former unit, came to Booker complaining that Hawk had ruined his life by reporting him for drug use. Brown said he was being kicked out of the Army.

            According to documents, Hawk was alone in his barracks room when Booker got him to open the door after midnight on June 17, 2020. Booker repeatedly slashed and stabbed Hawk with an unspecified sharp weapon. The medical examiner counted 40 wounds, including a fatal gash across Hawk’s throat.

Brown said he was being kicked out of the Army.According to documents, Hawk was alone in his barracks room when Booker got him to open the door after midnight on June 17, 2020. Booker repeatedly slashed and stabbed Hawk with an unspecified sharp weapon. The medical examiner counted 40 wounds, including a fatal gash across Hawk’s throat.Brown pleaded guilty in December to charges of assaulting a military service member and intimidating a witness.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799801,Jury: Musk didn't defraud investors with 2018 Tesla tweets,"SAN FRANCISO (AP) — A jury on Friday decided Elon Musk didn’t defraud investors with his 2018 tweets about electric automaker Tesla in a proposed deal that quickly unraveled and raised questions about whether the billionaire had misled investors.

            The nine-member jury reached its verdict after less that two hours of deliberation following a three-week trial. It represents a major vindication for Musk, who spent about eight hours on the witness stand defending his motives for the August 2018 tweets at the center of the trial.

            Musk, 51, wasn't on hand for the brief reading of the verdict but he made a surprise appearance earlier Friday for closing arguments that drew starkly different portraits of him.











            Not long after the verdict came down, Musk took to Twitter — the bully pulpit he now owns — to celebrate.

            “Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!” Musk tweeted.

            Musk's decision to break away from his other responsibilities to sit in on the closing arguments even though he didn't have to be there may have had an impact on the jurors, said Michael Freedman, a former federal prosecutor who is now in private practice working for a law firm that has represented celebrities and business executives.

            “It shows he has a presence,” Freedman said. 

            Nicholas Porritt, an attorney who represented aggrieved Tesla investors, said he was disappointed after urging the jurors in his closing arguments to rebuke Musk for reckless behavior that threatened to create “anarchy.""

            “I don’t think this is the kind of conduct we expect from a large public company,” a downcast Porritt said after discussing the verdict with a few jurors who gathered to talk to him. “People can draw their own conclusion on whether they think it’s OK or not.”

            During their discussion with Porritt, the jurors told them they found Musk's testimony that he believed he had lined up the money from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund without a written commitment to be credible. They also expressed doubt about whether Musk's tweeting was the sole reason for the swings in Tesla's stock price during a 10-day period in August 2018 covered in the case.

            The trial pitted Tesla investors represented in a class-action lawsuit against Musk, who is CEO of both the electric automaker and the Twitter service he bought for $44 billion a few months ago. 

            Shortly before boarding his private jet on Aug. 7, 2018, Musk tweeted that he had the financing to take Tesla private, even though it turned out he hadn’t gotten an iron-clad commitment for a deal that would have cost $20 billion to $70 billion to pull off. A few hours later, Musk sent another tweet indicating that the deal was imminent.

            Musk's integrity was at stake at the trial as well part of a fortune that has established him as one of the world’s richest people. He could have been saddled with a bill for billions of dollars in damages had the jury found him liable for the 2018 tweets that had already been deemed falsehoods by the judge presiding over the trial.

            That determination, made last year by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, left the jury to decide whether Musk had been reckless with his tweeting and acted in a way that hurt Tesla shareholders.

            “It may have not been that difficult for the jury,” Freedman said, “because it sort of became like an up-or-down vote."" 

            Earlier Friday, Musk sat stoically in court during the trial’s closing arguments while he was both vilified as a rich and reckless narcissist and hailed as a visionary looking out for the “little guy.""

            Over the course of a one-hour presentation, Porritt had implored the jurors to rebuke Musk for his “loose relationship with the truth.”

            “Our society is based on rules,” Porritt said. “We need rules to save us from anarchy. Rules should apply to Elon Musk like everyone else.”

            Alex Spiro, Musk’s attorney, conceded the 2018 tweets were “technically inaccurate.” But he told the jurors, “Just because it’s a bad tweet doesn’t make it a fraud.”

            During roughly eight hours on the stand earlier in the trial, Musk insisted he believed he had lined up the funds from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to take Tesla private after eight years as a publicly held company. He defended his initial August 2018 tweet as well-intentioned and aimed at ensuring all Tesla investors knew the automaker might be on its way to ending its run as a publicly held company.

            “I had no ill motive,” Musk testified. “My intent was to do the right thing for all shareholders.”

            Spiro echoed that theme in his closing argument.

            “He was trying to include the retail shareholder, the mom and pop, the little guy, and not seize more power for himself,"" Spiro said.

            Porritt, meanwhile, scoffed at the notion that Musk could have concluded he had a firm commitment after a 45-minute meeting at a Tesla factory on July 31, 2018, with Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabia’s wealth fund, given there was no written documentation.

            In his 90 minute presentation, Spiro emphasized Musk's track record helping to start and run a list of companies that include digital payment pioneer PayPal and rocket ship maker SpaceX, in addition to Tesla. The automaker based in Austin, Texas, is now worth nearly $600 billion, despite a steep decline in its stock price last year amid concerns that Musk's purchase of Twitter would distract him from Tesla.

            Recalling Musk's roots as a South African immigrant who came to Silicon Valley to create revolutionary tech companies, Spiro described his client “as the kind of person who believes the impossible is possible.""SAN FRANCISO (AP) — A jury on Friday decided Elon Musk didn’t defraud investors with his 2018 tweets about electric automaker Tesla in a proposed deal that quickly unraveled and raised questions about whether the billionaire had misled investors.The nine-member jury reached its verdict after less that two hours of deliberation following a three-week trial.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799803,"Royals, Zack Greinke finalize $8.5M deal for 2023 season","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Royals finalized Zack Greinke's $8.5 million contract for the upcoming season on Friday, bringing back a well-known and veteran arm to their otherwise young starting rotation.

            The deal for the 39-year-old right-hander includes up to $7.5 million in performance bonuses. He made $13 million with the Royals last season, when he went 3-9 with a 3.68 ERA while allowing two runs or fewer in 17 of 26 starts.

            Greinke began his career in Kansas City as a first-round pick in the 2002 amateur draft. And after fits and starts, and nearly walking away from baseball early in his professional career, he flashed onto the scene two years later, beginning a 20-year career that has included time with the Brewers, Angels, Dodgers, Diamondbacks and Astros.











            It was largely his affinity for then-general manager Dayton Moore that led him to return to Kansas City, where he pitched well last season despite two stints on the injured list. Moore was fired late in the season, though, and it was the new GM J.J. Picollo — one of Moore's longtime lieutenants — who decided to bring Grienke back this season.

            To make room on the roster, the Royals designated left-hander Anthony Misiewicz for assignment. 

            Greinke won the AL Cy Young Award in 2009 in his penultimate season in his first stint in Kansas City. He was later traded to the Brewers for a package of players that helped to form the backbone of back-to-back American League pennant teams and the club that won the 2015 World Series.

            Greinke went on to have plenty of success in his own right, though. He twice helped the Astros to the World Series, pitched for the Brewers and Dodgers in the NL Championship Series and led the Diamondbacks to the playoffs.

            He is first among active pitchers with 514 career starts and 3,247 innings pitched, and he's second to Justin Verlander with 223 win. Greinke is also third in strikeouts (2,882) and has six Gold Gloves and two Silver Slugger awards.

            The Royals had been quiet much of the offseason but have been busy in the weeks leading up to spring training.

            They recently traded starting outfielder Michael A. Taylor to the Twins and injury-prone shortstop Adalberto Mondesi to the Red Sox, netting three pitching prospects in the deals. They also signed reliever Aroldis Chapman to a $3.75 million deal for 2023 in the hopes the seven-time All-Star can bounce back from a disappointing season with the Yankees.

            Earlier in the offseason, the Royals signed pitchers Ryan Yarbrough and Jordan Lyles. Both of them are candidates for the starting rotation, though especially after Greinke's signing, Yarbrough’s value most likely lies in the bullpen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799814,Maid's son tells judge Alex Murdaugh took $4M for her death,"For much of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial, witnesses have talked about a generous and loving man — but prosecutors want jurors to know that same man stole over $4 million from his housekeeper’s relatives after she died at work, and killed his wife and son to cover up his crimes. 

            Prosecutors asked a judge Friday to consider allowing the son of Murdaugh's longtime housekeeper to tell jurors about how after she died in a fall at Murdaugh's home, he promised her family to take care of them and then stole millions in settlements with his insurers.

            Tony Satterfield said his mom cleaned the Murdaugh home, but also babysat their two sons and did anything else they asked over 20 years. She died at age 57 a few weeks after hitting her head in a fall in February 2018 on steps at the family's house.











            “Did you ever get one cent from Alex Murdaugh?"" prosecutor Creighton Waters asked Friday.

            “No,” Satterfield answered.

            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, at their Colleton County home. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder.

            Prosecutors are asking Judge Clifton Newman to allow them to present evidence of Murdaugh stealing money from clients and his law firm to bolster their premise that Murdaugh killed his family to gain sympathy and buy time because his thefts and massive debts were about to be discovered.

            Murdaugh is charged, but hasn't been tried, with a range of about 100 other crimes, including the thefts, running a drug and money laundering ring, tax evasion and insurance fraud for trying to arrange his own death so his surviving son could collect $10 million in life insurance. Police said the would-be fatal shot only grazed Murdaugh's head.

            Newman hasn't ruled yet how much if any of the financial crimes evidence he will allow jurors to hear. The issue of whether jurors can hear testimony about financial misdeeds has been its own mini trial within the double murder proceedings.

            Satterfield testified that after Murdaugh promised to take care of his housekeeper’s family, he suggested they hire one of his friends — who was also a college roommate and godfather to one of his sons — to be the executor of his mother’s estate.

            Satterfield heard little from Murdaugh until they spoke in June 2021. He said Murdaugh told them they were working on a settlement hopefully by the end of the year. Court records show Murdaugh’s insurers had already paid more than $4 million for the fall.

            “Did you give him permission to steal your money?” Waters asked Satterfield.

            “No,” he replied.

            Griffin asked only a few question in cross-examination, but honed in on how Satterfield didn’t know the exact date in June 2021 the conversation took place. Murdaugh’s wife and son were killed on June 7, 2021. Paul Murdaugh was shot twice with a shotgun and Maggie Murdaugh was shot four or five times with a rifle.

            Even though Gloria Satterfield died in an accident, her death was never reported to the Hampton County coroner. State Law Enforcement Division agents exhumed her body about a year after the deaths of Murdaugh’s son and wife, but never announced any findings of reopening the investigation into her death.

            Other lawyers came in to help the Satterfield family and they have collected more than $4 million in settlements from Murdaugh's friend, the bank involved with Murdaugh and others.

            The jury returned to the courtroom late Friday morning to hear from several state agents who collected fingerprints and DNA samples, and also tested guns, ammunition and shotgun pellets found in the bodies of the victims.

            Markings on the cartridges found near Maggie Murdaugh's body matched markings found on fired cartridges discovered near a gun range on the property and elsewhere, implying they could have been fired from the same Blackout rifle, State Law Enforcement Division agent Paul Greer testified.

            But the rifle that fired all those bullets has not been found, Greer said.

            During cross examination, defense attorney Jim Griffin asked a number of questions based on scientific advances in matching guns to fired bullets. The defense argues that based on the new science, ballistics experts can’t say with 100% certainty that there are unique markings linking a gun to a cartridge loaded into a Blackout rifle.

            Greer said the bullets recovered from Maggie Murdaugh's body and bullets found fired at other places on the property weren't suitable to test to see if they came from the same gun.

            ""You aren’t here to tell the jury that any of the weapons in this courtroom were used, in your opinion, to murder Maggie or Paul, correct?” Griffin asked Greer to start his cross examination.

            Greer answered almost all of Griffin's yes or no questions with long explanations saying test results were inconclusive or he hadn't studied every Blackout rifle in the world.

            National Security Adviser Redwan Hussein tweeted that the prime minister made decisions on increasing flights and banking services to the northern Tigray region along with issues to “boost trust and ease lives of civilians.”











            The conflict cut off the Tigray region of more than 5 million people, with humanitarian aid often blocked and basic services severed while health workers pleaded for the simplest of medical supplies. Pressure over the fate of civilians helped lead to the peace deal.

            The conflict is estimated to have killed a half-million civilians in Tigray, according to researchers with Ghent University in Belgium, and others were killed in neighboring Amhara and Afar regions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799817,Missing Florida Lyft driver's car found with slaying suspect,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The car owned by a missing 74-year-old Florida Lyft driver was found in North Carolina and the man who was driving it is wanted in connection with a homicide last week in southwest Florida, authorities said Friday.

            Lyft driver Gary Levin hasn't been heard from since Monday, when his family says he picked up a customer in Delray Beach, Florida. His red 2022 Kia Stinger was spotted in Miami that day, and then in a rural area north of Lake Okeechobee and later in north Florida, officials said.

            The vehicle was seen Thursday evening in North Carolina after the U.S. Marshal's regional task force asked authorities to be on the lookout. Matthew Flores was arrested following a police chase through three counties, Rutherford County, North Carolina Sheriff Aaron Ellenburg told The Associated Press. 











            Ellenburg said North Carolina state troopers used stop sticks to halt the vehicle in Ellenboro. The sheriff said Flores fled briefly on foot before he was apprehended and taken to a hospital for an evaluation. He was later booked into the county jail, and the vehicle was taken to a secure location, the sheriff said.

            Flores, 35, was being held on no bond for a parole violation and a $615,000 bond for charges in North Carolina that include eluding law enforcement, speeding and intoxicated driving. 

            He appeared at a brief hearing in North Carolina where a judge set bail at $2 million and scheduled another hearing Feb. 22, according to news outlets. Flores would eventually be extradited to Florida, where he is a suspect in a slaying on Jan. 24 — nearly a week before Levin went missing on Monday. It was not immediately known whether Flores has a lawyer who can speak on his behalf.

            Authorities are investigating how Flores obtained the missing Lyft driver's car — Levin's family said they do not know whether Flores was the passenger Levin picked up in Delray Beach on Monday. John Eason, the police chief in Wauchula, Florida, told The AP in a phone interview that officers are heading to North Carolina in hopes of interviewing Flores about the Jan. 24 killing and the missing Lyft driver. 

            “Our biggest concern at this point is finding and identifying where Mr. Levin is at,” Eason said. “A lot of that depends on whether the suspect cooperates with us.”

            Flores is facing a second-degree murder charge and other counts stemming from the fatal shooting last month of Jose Carlos Martinez in Wauchula. A woman who Eason said assisted Flores in fleeing from police, Stephanie Velgara, will be charged with being an accessory after the fact in the Martinez killing.

            It wasn’t immediately clear if Velgara has a lawyer to speak on her behalf. Eason said she remained in custody Friday in Florida's Hardee County jail.

            Wauchula is about 70 miles (112 kilometers) southeast of Tampa and about 127 miles (204 kilometers) northwest of Levin’s home in Palm Beach Gardens.

            In an emailed statement Friday, Lyft said “our thoughts are with Mr. Levin’s family and loved ones during this deeply concerning time. We’ve been in touch with his family to offer our support, as well as with law enforcement to assist with their investigation.” 

            But Levin’s daughter, Lindsay DiBetta, told the AP the family has learned that Levin took an unknown customer to Okeechobee, a small city on the edge of Lake Okeechobee, and completed the ride sometime after 4 p.m. on Monday.

            She said the family was told by Lyft that the ride was completed sometime after 4 p.m. He also spoke to friends by phone around 4 p.m. that day and “all seemed well,” Dibetta said.

            But almost immediately, something went wrong, she said. His phone was turned off and no one has heard from him since then.

            DiBetta said the Lyft gig was great for Levin, who loves telling dad jokes and often tells them over and over. “It was the perfect set up for him. He would get a new audience every ride,” she said.

            She said her father was an auto body salesman before retiring to Florida, and that his car “was his baby.”

            “What happened to my dad? Did (Flores) harm my dad?"" DiBetta said. “We just don’t know.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799818,Why is R&B music more explicit than ever? It’s complicated.,"NEW YORK (AP) — Tank was nervous after sending his manager a preview of “When We” — he’d never released a song that explicit. “He’s like, ‘You’re crazy, but it’s jammin'!’” the R&B singer recalled. “It ended up being my biggest record ever.”

            Released in 2017, the seductive chorus of “when we (expletive)” was obviously too explicit for radio, so a “clean” version used the phrase “when we touch.” Despite releasing his first album in 2001 and crafting hits like “Maybe I Deserve” and “Please Don’t Go,” it was “When We” that's been Tank's most successful, finishing No. 1 on Billboard’s 2018 year-end adult R&B airplay chart. 

            “I didn’t reinvent anything vocally — a little R&B here and there, tapped into my rap cadence, tapped into my Migos (style),” Tank, now 47, said. “I was competitive.”











            Being competitive — and collaborative — with hip-hop is one of the reasons today's R&B is more explicit. Last year's Luminate Year-End report found that R&B/hip-hop is America’s most popular genre, accounting for the most U.S. on-demand song streams and the largest share of total album consumption. 

            “It just seems a little bit more extravagant now because some of the R&B singers are acting like rappers,” said Colby Tyner, senior vice president of programming at Radio One and Reach Media, which operates the largest urban radio network in the United States. “It was a clear separation of church and state. Now, it’s a little bit together and so the music reflects it.”

            So how did R&B go from Boyz II Men's “I'll Make Love to You"" to Chris Brown singing ”(expletive) you back to sleep""? It's complicated.

            “It used to be that television and radio was where you got your content. And if it was television and radio, it was censored because of the FCC. Well, you got YouTube, you got all these streaming services and you got social media. So, we are in the authentic era,” said Tyner. “We (radio industry) are the last sort of bastions of 'we can’t do that' because we’re controlled by the government regulations.”

            During interviews over several months, The Associated Press asked those who create the music and industry experts about changes in R&B. Ahead of Sunday's 65th annual Grammy Awards airing on CBS and Paramount+, here are some of their thoughts in their own words:

            THE HIP-HOP EFFECT

            Just one offensive or curse word can lead to a parental advisory label, so what's defined as explicit can be subjective. It's the parent test: Would they want their children listening? While Hollywood has an independent ratings board, record companies and artists determine what receives a parental warning.

            As hip-hop grew in popularity, Billboard had to adapt; Some charts began grouping rappers and singers together, triggering fights for airplay which remains a sore subject. And with the recent explosion of melodic rap — a blend of rapping and harmonizing — spearheaded by artists like Future, Drake, Lil Uzi Vert and Travis Scott, the Grammys now recognize it as a category.

            In the 1990s, a period considered by some as R&B’s last golden age, it was almost unthinkable that an artist would curse because radio couldn’t play it. None of the top 25 songs on Billboard’s 1990 Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart required an explicit label. In 2022, with rap more dominant, all but one in the top 25 — Beyoncé’s “Break My Soul” — needed a clean version.

            ""There was definitely some explicit R&B ... but there’s no limit to what you can say sexually in hip-hop. And then when R&B and hip-hop merged, you had the hip-hop and R&B world —- so that’s literally what happened. And so now, the R&B singers have taken that way of speaking from the hip-hop cats. And the hip-hop cats have taken the melodic singing.” — Robert Glasper, four-time Grammy winner, 2023 R&B album nominee.

            “Chris Brown is the top of the food chain....He lives and rolls like a rapper. He has an entourage like a rapper. His energy is like a rapper — not like Tevin Campbell in the ‘Can We Talk Days,’” said Tyner. “He can make the most sensual, classic, urban AC or R&B record that you would love, but he also can express that other side as well.” — Colby Tyner, SVP of programming, Radio One and Reach Media.

            “We started having to compete with rap music, which is extremely explicit — extremely ... When you’re trying to compete for space on a chart or in a playlist, and these are the things that they’re playing, how do you find your way? How do you even get into the conversation? And so, our language has kind of had to evolve to be competitive.” — Tank, five-time Grammy nominee.

            NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN

            Themes of romance and sensuality have always breathed within soul music, but much of today’s R&B has replaced innuendo with bluntness. But while profanity has increased, artists are divided on whether the actual content has changed, citing classics like Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing,” “Prince’s “Darling Nikki” and much of R. Kelly’s sexually-charged catalog that dominated the '90s and early 2000s. 

            “The stuff my mama used to be listening to in the car: Marvin Sease and Clarence Carter — ‘I be stroking!’ That stuff was pretty vulgar! … So, no, I don’t think it’s more explicit.” — Muni Long, 2023 Grammy nominee for best new artist.

            “A lot of R&B artists were just as savage back in the day — they just had to be tame. Think about it: the record companies forced them to be clean cut and preppy and all those things. I think now, artists have found their freedom.” — Rico Love, vice-president of the Recording Academy and producer.

            “I think music was still explicit back in the day — they just had a better way of delivering it. You go all the way back to Rick James, ‘Super Freak’ — they just had a beating-around-the-bush type of way that they would say things.” — Yung Bleu, R&B recording artist 

            SOCIETAL SHIFT

            While hip-hop’s influence might be the lowest hanging fruit, it’s only one factor within a larger explanation. Psychologist Jean Twenge, author of “iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy--and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood,” says technology has decreased many rules of the past.

            “More technology just allows people to be more independent. And that’s been just a very, very steady change in culture in the U.S. and in many other countries over the past hundred years … individualism is at the root of an enormous number of cultural changes that we see today,” explained Twenge, who authored a study on the rise of swear words in American books. “These changes have affected everybody, not just young people. ... The society has definitely shifted more in that direction of being more casual and favoring self-expression more.”

            Film and TV have also become more explicit in depicting sexual situations, nudity, violence and language. Pop music carries more warnings than ever, and even friendly-family artists like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have released albums labeled as explicit. 

            “It’s not just R&B, the world is more explicit … even in the 90s, it would have been great to use a couple of cuss words in a couple of songs. It would've just hit so much better if you could’ve just went there because it just would have said it better.” — Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, 11-time Grammy winner, 2023 best traditional R&B performance nominee.

            “This generation has kind of become numb to it, the same way as like someone could be bleeding on the floor and someone will be on the phone and just step over that person … we've become numb to a lot, and I think music is included.” — Ashanti, Grammy winner.

            “They say, ‘the truth shall set you free.’ So, I guess the more honest you are, the more free you’re going to be. And that’s where we at. We say whatever we got to say … it's just direct — literally direct. And if you don’t like it, you just don’t like it, and that’s how we feel.” — Lucky Daye, Grammy winner, 2023 best R&B performance nominee.

            EASY ACCESS

            Generation Z and younger Millennials only know a world with the internet, and nearly all teens — 95% — have access to a smartphone, according to a 2022 Pew Research Center study. As information flows faster with each generation, some believe young people are learning mature subject matter earlier, and it trickles into what they create. Making and releasing music is easier than ever; expensive recording studios or record labels are no longer barriers. 

            “This generation feels very free and open, and a lot of people who wouldn’t have had access to create music back then, they can now create in their bedroom. So, there is a vast amount of product coming out. So maybe that’s why it seems like there’s so much explicit music because there’s just more music now, period.” — Chloe Bailey, five-time Grammy nominee.

            “I think art is a reflection of life ... this generation deals with those things more explicitly. I think there’s more access — the internet made that so, where it’s like we get information way quicker. As a father with little kids, they’re getting things quicker than I ever did.” — PJ Morton, 2023 Grammy nominee for best R&B album.

            “I think it’s just the natural progression of now it’s the next generation. … this generation just has everything at their fingertips.” — Robert Glasper, whose “Black Radio lll” is nominated for best R&B album.

            GOING VIRAL

            While it's not hard to guess most teenagers and social media are inseparable, 84% of adults 18-29 say they use at least one social media site, according to 2021 data from Pew. Naturally, social media behavior can influence the content choices people make with their music.

            “The best way to get clicks and streams is let me be as wild as I could possibly be. So, if I’m an R&B singer talking about what sexual positions that I like and how I do it … people are going to pay attention,” said Tyner, the Radio One exec. “Artists would kill to have a “WAP” (by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion) or a big song like that because honestly, really, it only takes one song. You get that one song that’s a monster record, you can live off that song for the rest your life.”

            “Everybody’s just trying to outdo each other. It’s all a popularity contest. So, whoever gets talked about the most, that’s what it is. And the more risqué you are, the more attention, the more you get talked about.” — T-Pain, two-time Grammy winner

            “Sometimes you have to get out there and say things to catch people’s attention…I like being creative and witty and having the double meaning for certain things and being subliminal. But some people like to just splat it on out there!” (laughs) - Ashanti

            “Maybe people feel like that’s what they need to do to get the sales or get the attention. You know, it’s a lotta shakin’ out there (laughs) ... there’s a lot of lyrics that are like cringe if I’m listening to it with my daughter. But music is self-expression — people express themselves however they feel like they need to express themselves.” — Brandy, Grammy winner

            While there is crossover of younger artists on the adult R&B airplay chart, which generally features more traditional R&B, the content is far less explicit. Only 11 of the top 25 songs from last year's year-end chart were labeled explicit, with eight of the 11 by younger artists. On the year-end Hot R&B chart which tracks mainstream R&B, 19 of the top 25 songs carried an advisory.

            Mary J. Blige, a nine-time Grammy winner who has been successful through R&B's changes since the 90s, says it's all about expression.

            “Just like when we were growing up, we came from a place where we expressed ourselves from where we were living and how we were living. So, these new generations are expressing themselves,'' she said.

            Blige, a nominee for album of the year at Sunday's Grammys, says she can relate to younger artists.

            “I’m so proud of them. I love them. They’re doing exactly what we did: They’re speaking from their experience, and I respect that,” Blige said. “I have so much respect for their artistry.”

But while profanity has increased, artists are divided on whether the actual content has changed, citing classics like Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing,” “Prince’s “Darling Nikki” and much of R. Kelly’s sexually-charged catalog that dominated the '90s and early 2000s.“The stuff my mama used to be listening to in the car: Marvin Sease and Clarence Carter — ‘I be stroking!’ That stuff was pretty vulgar! … So, no, I don’t think it’s more explicit.” — Muni Long, 2023 Grammy nominee for best new artist.“A lot of R&B artists were just as savage back in the day — they just had to be tame. Think about it: the record companies forced them to be clean cut and preppy and all those things. I think now, artists have found their freedom.” — Rico Love, vice-president of the Recording Academy and producer.“I think music was still explicit back in the day — they just had a better way of delivering it. You go all the way back to Rick James, ‘Super Freak’ — they just had a beating-around-the-bush type of way that they would say things.” — Yung Bleu, R&B recording artistSOCIETAL SHIFTWhile hip-hop’s influence might be the lowest hanging fruit, it’s only one factor within a larger explanation. Psychologist Jean Twenge, author of “iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy--and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood,” says technology has decreased many rules of the past.“More technology just allows people to be more independent. And that’s been just a very, very steady change in culture in the U.S. and in many other countries over the past hundred years … individualism is at the root of an enormous number of cultural changes that we see today,” explained Twenge, who authored a study on the rise of swear words in American books. “These changes have affected everybody, not just young people. ... The society has definitely shifted more in that direction of being more casual and favoring self-expression more.”Film and TV have also become more explicit in depicting sexual situations, nudity, violence and language. Pop music carries more warnings than ever, and even friendly-family artists like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have released albums labeled as explicit.“It’s not just R&B, the world is more explicit … even in the 90s, it would have been great to use a couple of cuss words in a couple of songs. It would've just hit so much better if you could’ve just went there because it just would have said it better.” — Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, 11-time Grammy winner, 2023 best traditional R&B performance nominee.“This generation has kind of become numb to it, the same way as like someone could be bleeding on the floor and someone will be on the phone and just step over that person … we've become numb to a lot, and I think music is included.” — Ashanti, Grammy winner.“They say, ‘the truth shall set you free.’ So, I guess the more honest you are, the more free you’re going to be. And that’s where we at. We say whatever we got to say … it's just direct — literally direct. And if you don’t like it, you just don’t like it, and that’s how we feel.” — Lucky Daye, Grammy winner, 2023 best R&B performance nominee.EASY ACCESSGeneration Z and younger Millennials only know a world with the internet, and nearly all teens — 95% — have access to a smartphone, according to a 2022 Pew Research Center study. As information flows faster with each generation, some believe young people are learning mature subject matter earlier, and it trickles into what they create. Making and releasing music is easier than ever; expensive recording studios or record labels are no longer barriers.“This generation feels very free and open, and a lot of people who wouldn’t have had access to create music back then, they can now create in their bedroom. So, there is a vast amount of product coming out. So maybe that’s why it seems like there’s so much explicit music because there’s just more music now, period.” — Chloe Bailey, five-time Grammy nominee.“I think art is a reflection of life ... this generation deals with those things more explicitly. I think there’s more access — the internet made that so, where it’s like we get information way quicker. As a father with little kids, they’re getting things quicker than I ever did.” — PJ Morton, 2023 Grammy nominee for best R&B album.“I think it’s just the natural progression of now it’s the next generation. … this generation just has everything at their fingertips.” — Robert Glasper, whose “Black Radio lll” is nominated for best R&B album.GOING VIRALWhile it's not hard to guess most teenagers and social media are inseparable, 84% of adults 18-29 say they use at least one social media site, according to 2021 data from Pew. Naturally, social media behavior can influence the content choices people make with their music.“The best way to get clicks and streams is let me be as wild as I could possibly be. So, if I’m an R&B singer talking about what sexual positions that I like and how I do it … people are going to pay attention,” said Tyner, the Radio One exec. “Artists would kill to have a “WAP” (by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion) or a big song like that because honestly, really, it only takes one song. You get that one song that’s a monster record, you can live off that song for the rest your life.”“Everybody’s just trying to outdo each other. It’s all a popularity contest. So, whoever gets talked about the most, that’s what it is. And the more risqué you are, the more attention, the more you get talked about.” — T-Pain, two-time Grammy winner“Sometimes you have to get out there and say things to catch people’s attention…I like being creative and witty and having the double meaning for certain things and being subliminal. But some people like to just splat it on out there!” (laughs) - Ashanti“Maybe people feel like that’s what they need to do to get the sales or get the attention. You know, it’s a lotta shakin’ out there (laughs) ... there’s a lot of lyrics that are like cringe if I’m listening to it with my daughter. But music is self-expression — people express themselves however they feel like they need to express themselves.” — Brandy, Grammy winnerWhile there is crossover of younger artists on the adult R&B airplay chart, which generally features more traditional R&B, the content is far less explicit. Only 11 of the top 25 songs from last year's year-end chart were labeled explicit, with eight of the 11 by younger artists. On the year-end Hot R&B chart which tracks mainstream R&B, 19 of the top 25 songs carried an advisory.Mary J. Blige, a nine-time Grammy winner who has been successful through R&B's changes since the 90s, says it's all about expression.“Just like when we were growing up, we came from a place where we expressed ourselves from where we were living and how we were living. So, these new generations are expressing themselves,'' she said.Blige, a nominee for album of the year at Sunday's Grammys, says she can relate to younger artists.“I’m so proud of them. I love them. They’re doing exactly what we did: They’re speaking from their experience, and I respect that,” Blige said. “I have so much respect for their artistry.”___Brooke Lefferts and John Carucci in New York contributed to this story.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799819,Greenwood's future remains uncertain after charges dropped,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — A year after his arrest, Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood is free to resume a soccer career that looked set to make him one of the biggest stars in the sport.

            Where he goes from here, however, is unknown.

            The 21-year-old Greenwood, who also played for England's national team, had charges of attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service this week.











            While he is likely to be eager to resume playing after 12 months out of action, United says he will have to wait a little longer.

            On Thursday, United said it would “conduct its own process before determining next steps.”

            No timeframe has been put on that undertaking and Greenwood is not expected to return to training or be considered for selection until it is concluded.

            “I can’t say anything about it,"" United manager Erik ten Hag said Friday. ""I refer to the statement of the club and, at this moment, I can’t add anything.”

            United is one of the most famous soccer clubs in the world, with billions of fans and commercial deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The decision about how to handle Greenwood is likely to be about more than just soccer, with the club’s image and commercial appeal also under consideration.

            On the field, Ten Hag would benefit from a player with the potential to be a key figure for both his club and his national team.

            “He’s a special talent, a special kid that we are going to look after and try to develop into a top, top player,” former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said in 2020.

            By that stage, at the age of 18, Greenwood had already broken into the first team and, blessed with explosive pace, was scoring regularly. He earned comparisons with United great Wayne Rooney and looked destined to become the club’s next icon.

            At a time when Ten Hag is in the market for a replacement for departed striker Cristiano Ronaldo, Greenwood would be an ideal contender and was already being considered as United’s long-term center forward.

            That bright future was brought to an abrupt halt last January when images and videos on social media led to his arrest and subsequent suspension by United.

            The charges were dropped because ""a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction,” the Crown Prosecution Service said, adding that it had “a duty to keep cases under continuous review.”

            While prosecutors accepted the case against Greenwood had to be discontinued, the posts on social media that led to his arrest were widely viewed and heard. That could have an impact on United’s reputation and brand if he plays for them again.

            Sportswear giant Nike, which said it was “deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations,” ended its sponsorship deal with Greenwood last year.

            Because of the nature of the charges, consideration may also be given to the number female fans the club has and a recently-formed women’s team that is growing in popularity.

            “We, as a society, must work together to show women that they will be heard, believed and helped. Nothing should deter a woman from reporting sexual and domestic abuse,” said Farah Nazeer, chief executive of anti-domestic abuse charity Women’s Aid.

            Greenwood may determine his career would be better served by having a fresh start away from United, perhaps in another country. He is likely to be a target for opposition fans, especially if he remains in England, which could affect his form and development as he attempts to rebuild his career.

            Greenwood is free to play again, but his career path looks far from straightforward.

            The 32-team tournament includes Mexico's Necaxa and teams organized by former U.S captain Clint Dempsey, U.S. women's team midfielder Heather O’Reilly and Hashtag United, a British site founded by YouTube personality Spencer Carmichael-Brown.

            TBT Enterprises is organizing the tournament, which runs June 1-4. Wrexham said Friday that its team will include club legends, some from the “Welcome to Wrexham” documentary series on FX.











            Wrexham, bought by Reynolds and McElhenney in 2020, began Friday second to Notts County in England's National League, hoping to gain promotion to fourth-tier League Two.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799824,Authorities: 2 arrested in California shooting that killed 6,"VISALIA, Calif. (AP) — Two gang members were arrested early Friday, one after a gunbattle, in the January massacre of six people including a baby at a central California home associated with a rival gang, the Tulare County sheriff said.

            Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said Noah David Beard, 25, was taken into custody and Angel “Nanu” Uriarte, 35, was wounded in the shootout with federal agents and was undergoing surgery, but was stable and expected to survive. 

            “I’m happy we were able to put these two men behind bars,” the sheriff said.











            The suspects and members of the victims' family have a long history of gang violence but the motive for the shooting “is not exactly clear,” Boudreaux said at a news conference at the sheriff's headquarters in Visalia.

            The Tulare County District Attorney's Office charged both suspects with six counts of murder and other crimes. They face a potential sentence of the death penalty or life in prison without parole, prosecutors said.

            The six victims, including a teen mother and her baby, were gunned down on Jan. 16 in rural Goshen, a community of 3,000 in the San Joaquin Valley. 

            Authorities said both suspects had been under around-the-clock surveillance since Jan. 23 in a massive investigation that culminated in Friday's arrests and involved sheriff's detectives, prosecutors, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other law enforcement agencies.

            Search warrants were served at locations in Goshen and Visalia, and about eight inmate cells associated with the Nuestra Familia prison gang were searched in five state prisons, Boudreaux said. 

            He said sheriff's authorities waited until they had DNA evidence to make the arrests to bolster the case. No further details of the evidence were provided.

            Both suspects had prior run-ins with the law. Uriarte was convicted in 2015 of assault with a firearm in association with a street gang, and Beard had juvenile convictions, prosecutors said in the court filing.

            The victims were identified as: Rosa Parraz, 72; Eladio Parraz, Jr., 52; Jennifer Analla, 49; Marcos Parraz, 19; Alissa Parraz, 16; and Nycholas Parraz, 10 months.

            A surveillance video released by authorities Friday showed a teenage girl running outside and placing a baby on the other side of a fence, then jumping over it herself. Authorities said Beard shot and killed the teen and baby, who were both found dead in the street, shot in the back of the head.

            Among the adult victims was a woman who was found kneeling and shot in the head, authorities said.

            The sheriff has said Alissa Parraz had just been awarded full custody of her son after he spent months in the foster care system. The two were reunited on Jan. 13 — three days before they were killed.

            The shooting was reported by a woman who called 911 during the violence. She is heard on a recording released by authorities frantically telling a dispatcher that her boyfriend was shot and that the shooters were still there.

            “They're coming back,” she said. “Please hurry, please!”

            The Goshen killings were part of a violent and deadly month in California. 

            On Jan. 21, a shooting at Monterey Park dance hall killed 11 and wounded nine. The gunman later killed himself. On Jan. 23, shootings at two Half Moon Bay farms killed seven and wounded one before the suspect was arrested.VISALIA, Calif.

            Those oldies but goodies keep popping up today, but increasingly with a twist. Companies continue to re-release snacks, entertainment and technology that millions of people grew up with, but tweaking them to create hybrids that possess the same heartfelt recognition, with a modern flavor.

            Companies have recognized that they can win over consumers nostalgic for the past and, at the same time, win new generations of consumers with a new spin. 











            ""Younger consumers, like those in Gen Z or younger Millennials, had no direct exposure to many of the fads and trends the first time around so they have a different relationship to them, filtered through more current perspectives,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. “That necessitates a modern spin in order for products to resonate. The younger consumer is often more concerned with curiosity and experience-seeking rather than with simple nostalgia.” 

            The fintech company Klarna said ‘vintage tech’ sales have rocketed in recent years, some unchanged and some with significant updates. Sales for wired headphones increased by more than 300% in February 2022 compared with the previous year. Flip phones sales were up by more than 80% in August, it said.

            Here are a few successful reboots. 

             HAPPY MEALS .... FOR EVERYONE

            Remember when that Happy Meal landed at the table and you didn't know whether to grab for a chicken McNugget or a toy first? For a brief period last year, you could relive that bounty of riches. This week, McDonald’s reported that strong quarterly profits were partially driven by by sales of Happy Meals, these ones for adults with toys made by the streetwear brand Cactus Plant Flea Market. The meals came in a totally redesigned box in Cactus Plant Flea Market’s signature style alongside McD’s iconic Golden Arches. It included either a Big Mac or 10-piece chicken McNuggets, along with fries, a drink and one of four collectible figurines - Grimace, the Hamburglar, Birdie or Cactus Buddy. Half of the toys included in meals were gone in the first four days of the promotion.

            PEAK PEEP

            Celebrating 70 years in business in 2024, the maker of Peeps brought something new to the Easter basket this year by partnering with other classic brands and doubling down on the nostalgia. Just Born Quality Confections has continually updated the classic Easter treat, but this year teamed up with two brands that have been around for decades to create Dr. Pepper Peeps and Mike and Ike Peeps. “Inspiration from earlier ages is nothing new but the nostalgic imprint on this year’s trends is remarkable,” said Agus Panzoni, a trend researcher, speaking about sales in 2022. “Against the backdrop of a changing world, it seems people have been escaping to more comfortable territories as the antidote to everyday life.”

            FLIP THE CALENDAR, FLIP YOUR PHONE

            After vanishing for a decade flip phones are back. Believe it or not, there are teenagers opting out of some technology circles, tired of the glow from their cell phones. A quick search of Amazon or manufacturers websites show numerous models available, but the technology has also been updated in a big way, like Samsung’s Galaxy Z flip phone. The company shipped nearly 10 million foldable smartphones worldwide in 2021, an industry increase of more than 300% from 2020, according to blog post from Dr. TM Roh, head of Samsung’s MX business. Of all the phones sold that year by Samsung, 70% were flip phones. 

            CLASSIC CHARACTERS, WITH A TWIST

            Nostalgia is not a new phenomenon in entertainment and numerous classics have been dusted off for new generations. But movies like “Top Gun: Maverick” and shows such as “Cobra Kai,” based off of “The Karate Kid” movie franchise and “Wednesday,” based on “The Addams Family” television show and films, have begun to resonate heavily. “Top Gun: Maverick” was surprise nominee for best adapted screenplay for the 95th Academy Awards. “Wednesday,” which debuted on Netflix in November and centers around a teenage Wednesday Addams making her way at a new school and solving mysteries, broke Nielsen streaming records and was renewed for a second season. Netflix announced in January that it gained 7.7 million subscribers during the October-December period. “Even those who remember products from the past often want their slice of nostalgia alongside something new and innovative, so that means reinterpreting and reinventing slightly,” Saunders said.Nostalgia sells and marketers know it, having used the brands of yesteryear fully aware that consumers will open their wallets to scratch that sentimental itch.Those oldies but goodies keep popping up today, but increasingly with a twist.

Just Born Quality Confections has continually updated the classic Easter treat, but this year teamed up with two brands that have been around for decades to create Dr. Pepper Peeps and Mike and Ike Peeps. “Inspiration from earlier ages is nothing new but the nostalgic imprint on this year’s trends is remarkable,” said Agus Panzoni, a trend researcher, speaking about sales in 2022. “Against the backdrop of a changing world, it seems people have been escaping to more comfortable territories as the antidote to everyday life.”FLIP THE CALENDAR, FLIP YOUR PHONEAfter vanishing for a decade flip phones are back. Believe it or not, there are teenagers opting out of some technology circles, tired of the glow from their cell phones. A quick search of Amazon or manufacturers websites show numerous models available, but the technology has also been updated in a big way, like Samsung’s Galaxy Z flip phone. The company shipped nearly 10 million foldable smartphones worldwide in 2021, an industry increase of more than 300% from 2020, according to blog post from Dr. TM Roh, head of Samsung’s MX business. Of all the phones sold that year by Samsung, 70% were flip phones.CLASSIC CHARACTERS, WITH A TWISTNostalgia is not a new phenomenon in entertainment and numerous classics have been dusted off for new generations. But movies like “Top Gun: Maverick” and shows such as “Cobra Kai,” based off of “The Karate Kid” movie franchise and “Wednesday,” based on “The Addams Family” television show and films, have begun to resonate heavily. “Top Gun: Maverick” was surprise nominee for best adapted screenplay for the 95th Academy Awards. “Wednesday,” which debuted on Netflix in November and centers around a teenage Wednesday Addams making her way at a new school and solving mysteries, broke Nielsen streaming records and was renewed for a second season. Netflix announced in January that it gained 7.7 million subscribers during the October-December period. “Even those who remember products from the past often want their slice of nostalgia alongside something new and innovative, so that means reinterpreting and reinventing slightly,” Saunders said.",2023/02/04,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799827,Aubameyang cut from Chelsea squad for Champions League,"After Chelsea spent around $357 million during the January transfer window, manager Graham Potter was always going to have a job squeezing his new signings in. 

            And on Friday Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang became a high-profile casualty of that midseason shopping spree when he was cut from Chelsea's squad for the Champions League knockout stages. 

            British record signing Enzo Fernandez, and other newcomers Mykhailo Mudryk and Joao Felix, were included in the 25-man list submitted to UEFA for the remaining rounds.











            Only three new additions to the ‘A list’ of senior players are allowed, meaning the rest of Chelsea's eight recruits missed out, including defender Benoit Badiashile, who was signed from Monaco for around $40 million in January.

            Aubameyang, who was signed from Barcelona last summer and started all six of the group stage games, faces an uncertain future after his omission. 

            Potter admitted there would be “a few awkward conversations"" in his bloated squad. And Aubameyang could find his playing time increasingly limited following the arrival of Portugal striker Felix on loan from Atletico Madrid. 

            Chelsea spent more than top-flight teams in France, Spain, Italy and Germany combined in January as American owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital continued to invest heavily.

            It followed $305 million worth of signings in the summer after the consortium bought the club for $2.5 billion last May.

            Fernandez became the most expensive player in the history of British soccer after joining from Benfica for $131.4 million.

            Mudryk signed from Shakhtar Donetsk in a deal worth around $108 million. 

            Chelsea's spending spree piqued the curiosity of its rivals.

            “I don’t understand this part of the business; what you can do, what you cannot do. However, it’s a big number in the last two windows,"" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said on Friday. “I don’t understand how it’s possible, but it’s not for me to explain how it works.”

            Pep Guardiola referenced the scrutiny his Manchester City has faced since it was taken over by Abu Dhabi in 2008. 

            “It’s none of my business (but) it’s a surprise because it’s not a ‘state’ club,” Guardiola said. “What Chelsea do is not my business, I never involve opinions in other clubs because there are regulations, rules, that we have to do.

            “But we were accused. I don’t forget, eight or nine teams in the Premier League sent a letter to the Premier League (for us) to be banned. That happened to us.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799831,Sri Lanka: Anger at government over independence celebration,"Falling on February 4, Sri Lanka is preparing for an independence day like no other.But it isn't the grandness of the occasion, nor the significance of three-quarters of a century, that makes this anniversary stand out.At a time meant for celebration, Sri Lankans are in anything but a party mood.Many of the country's citizens are outraged by a government willing to spend an estimated LKR 200 million ($548,000 €506,000) amidst a debilitating economic crisis.In the wake of shrinking foreign currency reserves, Sri Lanka was thrust into a spiraling economic crisis last year, with acute shortages of essentials such as fuel and medicine, as well as rising food prices.There are daily power outages lasting for over two hours in many areas of the country. This stems from shortages of fuel for thermal power generation. By September last year, Sri Lanka's year on year food inflation hit 94.9%, and inflation hit 69.8%, dropping to 54.2% and 60.1% respectively, by January.Following its historic debt default in May last year, Sri Lanka is now in the process of negotiating financial assurance from bilateral creditors, an essential step in securing US$ 2.9 billion worth of financing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Sri Lanka's total government external debt totaled US$ 37.6 billion as of the end of 2021.Government statistics show that the country's economy contracted 11.8% during the third quarter, last year.According to a World Food Programme (WFP) situation report on Sri Lanka, published in December, 36% of the families in Sri Lanka are food insecure, and June statistics by UNICEF show that 56,000 children under five years of age have severe acute malnutrition.But, this weekend, the country is planning to celebrate the 75th anniversary of independence from British colonial rule, which ended in 1948. Makeshift tents are already up in Galle Face, Colombo, Sri Lanka's commercial capital, where the national celebration will be held, not far from the site of last year's anti-government protest, which lasted several months. This will be the first independence celebration of veteran politician turned president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who succeeded former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa following his resignation in the throng of mass protests in 2022.Given the daily struggles of the people, the government spending on the celebrations has been subjected to blistering criticism from many Sri Lankans. Earlier on Friday, the 'Aragalaya' movement that led the anti-government protests last year, announced a 24-hour 'Satyagraha,' a peaceful and non-violent form of protest against the celebrations, set to start on the evening of February 3, in Colombo.""We are doing this 'Satyagraha' to highlight our displeasure against the massive misuse of public funds while people of Sri Lanka are suffering without [being able to meet] their basic needs,"" Melani Gunathilaka, an independent activist, and protester from the movement, told DW.Medical shortages, malnutrition and poverty have led to the suffering of the future generations of Sri Lanka, and basic rights and needs of the people are being threatened, she noted.The country's medical officers agree, saying that while the 75th independence should be celebrated, how much is spent, and the mode of celebration should have been decided after considering the economic situation of the country and the people.""Around the country, [public] hospitals, from the National Hospital in Colombo, to peripheral hospitals are faced with drug shortages,"" Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe, media spokesperson for the General Medical Officers Association (GMOA), the most powerful body of medical professionals in Sri Lanka with 130 branches, told DW.""Around 140 drugs are out of stock, while [the] majority of drugs are in short [supply]. Healthcare services are compromised to a certain extent due to this shortage,"" Dr. Wijesinghe added.""So, the GMOA would like to remind the authorities that there are many more priorities when it comes to [the allocation of] limited government funds,"" he said, especially given the drug shortages, and other daily struggles of the general public.But Malinda Seneviratne, an independent political analyst from Sri Lanka, disagrees. A nation state must affirm its status in various ways, and one way of doing this is to collectively celebrate Independence or its National day, he says.He adds that last year, Sri Lankans celebrated the Sinhala and Hindu new year as communities, during the harshest of times, despite the lack of fuel, ongoing power cuts and mass protests. ""Likewise, independence also must be celebrated collectively,"" he said.Seneviratne says that LKR 200 million is not a ""huge"" amount of money considering the current inflation. When divided by the size of the population [of 22 million] it is approximately LKR 10 per person, he noted.""If the government instead distributes this amount equally among the population, won't [the people] instead call it ridiculous? Independence celebration is a national, collective event, so some money is spent,"" he said.Calling for the festivities to be held at a ""minimal cost,"" President Wickremesinghe insisted last week that the celebrations for the 75th anniversary must be held. ""If not, the international community will say [Sri Lanka] has no money even for [celebrating independence],"" Wickremesinghe said.Dhananath Fernando, Chief Executive Officer of Advocata Institute, a Colombo based policy think tank, looks at the dilemma through a different lens.For example, LKR 200 million may be a small amount compared to the education budget [LKR 232 billion], but people sees these things ""emotionally,"" he said,especially when things are not going well, and when children are suffering. ""Sometimes even if LKR 20 is spent by the government, that might still become a concern,"" he added. In this instance, ""the optics"" may not be right, because the government is spending on celebrations while people are suffering.""So rather than spending this money [ on independence celebrations], it would have been a better option to save it instead,"" he said.Fernando sees initiating the reconciliation process between different racial and religious groups as essential for economic harmony, adding it could have been one way of giving the independence day more ""prestige.""Edited by: John SilkEvery Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

Among the most seminal fashion figures of the 20th century, his legacy will remain,'' read a statement form parent company Puig.Born in during the Spanish Civil War in 1934, Rabanne's father was killed by the forces of fascist dictator Francisco Franco in 1937. His mother subsequently moved the family to Paris, where she worked for fashion house Balenciaga.Rabanne began his career designed jewelry for Balenciaga, Givenchy, and Dior before launching his own label in 1966.Rabanne was nicknamed ""Wacko Paco"" for his at times extremely avant-garde designs and eccentric ideas.He was a co-creator, alongside the likes of Pierre Cardin, of the space-age fashion movement. He dressed French icons like Brigitte Bardot and Francoise Hardy, as well as designing Jane Fonda's famous ""Barbarella"" costume.In 1966 he shook up the fashion world when he presented a collection called ""12 Unwearble Dresses."" The show featured barefoot models wearing outfits made out of sharp metals and other unlikely materials.In a 2016 retrospective, Rabanne wrote of his design philosophy that he wanted to go ""as far as is reasonable for one's time and not indulge in the morbid pleasure of the known things, which I view as decay.""Later in life, Rabanne was known for his extremely successful line of fragrances, as well as for his writings on subjects like the predictions of Nostradamus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799834,Family of Minneapolis man killed in no-knock raid sues city,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The parents of Amir Locke, who was shot to death by a Minneapolis police officer when a SWAT team executed a no-knock search warrant one year ago, sued the city and the officer Friday, alleging he was “gunned down in cold blood” in violation of his constitutional rights.

            Locke, 22, who was Black and had hoped to build a career as a hip-hop artist, was sleeping on a couch in his cousin's downtown apartment when authorities entered without knocking Feb. 2, 2022, as part of an investigation into a homicide in neighboring St. Paul, in which Locke was not a suspect. Body camera video showed that Locke was holding a gun before he was shot seconds after the officers burst in.

            “This has got to stop,” Locke's mother, Karen Wells, said at a news conference. “Amir will be the face of banning no-knock warrants. He will not die in vain.” 











            Prosecutors declined last April to charge any of the officers involved, saying the video showed that Locke pointed a gun at Officer Mark Hanneman, justifying his use of deadly force.

            But the lawsuit, filed in federal court by attorneys Ben Crump and Jeff Storms, alleges that Hanneman acted too hastily when he fired three times. And it disputes the official assertions that Locke pointed his gun at officers. It seeks unspecified damages and the appointment of an official to ensure that the city properly trains and supervises its officers.

            “Amir, like many Americans, had a handgun within his reach while he slept. Even half-asleep, while Amir reached for the handgun, he demonstrated proper and responsible handling by keeping the handgun pointed away from the officers and keeping his finger off the trigger. Amir never raised the weapon in the direction of any officer or placed his finger on the trigger,"" the complaint said.

            ""Any reasonable officer would have understood that Amir needed an opportunity to realize who and what was surrounding him, and then provide Amir with an opportunity to disarm himself. Hanneman failed to give Amir any such opportunity even though Amir never pointed the handgun at Hanneman or put his finger on the trigger,” the complaint continued.

            Crump, who has been dubbed “Black America's attorney general,” has won multimillion-dollar settlements in numerous police brutality cases, including $27 million for the family of George Floyd, whose killing by a Minneapolis officer sparked a nationwide reckoning on race.

            “The City will review the Complaint when it receives it,” city spokesman Casper Hill said in an email.

            Wells compared the video showing her son's death to the video that she forced herself to watch of the beating death of Tyre Nichols by police in Memphis, Tennessee, “another person dying by the hands of those that said they're here to protect and serve. ... This can't happen again.” 

            Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and then-Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman said when they declined charges that Locke might not have been shot if not for the no-knock warrant. But they said there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hanneman violated state law on when police can use deadly force.

            Locke was killed during the trial of three former Minneapolis police officers in federal court in St. Paul on civil rights charges in the murder of Floyd. Locke's death rekindled distrust of police and sparked fresh protests over policing and racism. 

            And it led Mayor Jacob Frey to sharply restrict no-knock warrants, requiring officers to knock and wait before entering, with limited exceptions. While some lawmakers called for a statewide ban on no-knock warrants, the proposal died in the Legislature last year. Some lawmakers have expressed interest in bringing it back.

            The complaint alleges that the use of the no-knock warrant that led to Locke's death was “consistent with Minneapolis's custom, pattern and practice of racial discrimination in policing.” And it alleges that police officials should have known from previous legal actions and citizen complaints involving Hanneman that he didn't understand department policies or constitutional rights.

            Locke was killed seconds after the SWAT team entered at 6:48 a.m. The body camera video showed one officer unlocking the door and going in, followed by at least four uniformed officers in protective gear. They repeatedly shouted, “Police, search warrant!” They also shouted “Hands!” and “Get on the ground!”

            The edited video, released the day after, showed an officer kicking a sectional sofa, and Locke was shown wrapped in a comforter, holding a pistol. Three shots were heard and the video ended.

            “I was convinced that the individual was going to fire their handgun and that I would suffer great bodily harm or death,"" Hanneman wrote in his statement to investigators. ""I felt in this moment that if I did not use deadly force myself, I would likely be killed.”

            Crump has previously compared Locke's death with that of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in a botched police raid in Kentucky in 2020 in which her boyfriend shot at officers first as they broke into her apartment.

            “We should have learned from Breonna Taylor,” Storms said at the news conference. “We had a chance to not make the mistake ourselves. We had the notice as a city. ... So we don't learn from our mistakes and we don't learn from the well-publicized mistakes of others.”

            Locke's cousin, Mekhi Camden Speed, who was 17 at the time of the raid, pleaded guilty last May to aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder while committing the felony of aggravated robbery for the Jan. 10, 2022, killing of Otis Elder, 38.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799835,6th officer fired after beating death of Tyre Nichols,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A sixth Memphis officer was fired Friday after an internal police investigation showed he violated multiple department policies in the violent arrest of Tyre Nichols, including rules surrounding the deployment of a stun gun, officials said.

            Preston Hemphill had been suspended as he was investigated for his role in the Jan. 7 arrest of Nichols, who died in a hospital three days later. Five Memphis officers have already been fired and charged with second-degree murder in Nichols' death.

            Nichols was beaten after police stopped him for what they said was a traffic violation. Video released after pressure from Nichols’ family shows officers holding him down and repeatedly punching, kicking and striking him with a baton as he screamed for his mother. 











            The officers who have been fired and charged are Black, as was Nichols. Hemphill is white. One other officer has been suspended, but has not been identified.

            Hemphill was the third officer at the traffic stop that preceded the arrest but was not at the location where Nichols was beaten after he ran away.

            On body camera footage from the initial stop, Hemphill is heard saying that he used a stun gun against Nichols and declaring, “I hope they stomp his ass.”

            Along with breaking rules regarding the use of a stun gun, Hemphill was also fired for violations of personal conduct and truthfulness, police said in a statement. 

            Police announced Hemphill’s suspension on Jan. 30, but they said Hemphill was actually suspended shortly after the arrest.

            Memphis police spokeswoman Karen Rudolph has said information about Hemphill’s suspension was not immediately released because Hemphill had not been fired. The department generally gives out information about an officer’s punishment only after a department investigation into misconduct ends, Rudolph said.

            After the suspension was announced, lawyers for Nichols’ family questioned why the department did not disclose Hemphill’s discipline earlier.

            “We have asked from the beginning that the Memphis Police Department be transparent with the family and the community — this news seems to indicate that they haven’t risen to the occasion,” attorneys Ben Crump and Anthony Romanucci said in a statement. “It certainly begs the question why the white officer involved in this brutal attack was shielded and protected from the public eye, and to date, from sufficient discipline and accountability.”

            Also Friday, a Tennessee board suspended the emergency medical technician licenses of two former Memphis Fire Department employees for failing to render critical care.

            The suspensions of EMT Robert Long and advanced EMT JaMichael Sandridge build on efforts by authorities to hold officers and other first responders accountable for the violence against Nichols. The Justice Department has opened a civil rights probe into the attack that was captured on video.

            
                Three fire department employees were fired after Nichols died. Former fire department Lt. Michelle Whitaker was the third employee let go, but her license was not considered for suspension Friday. The department has said she remained in the engine with the driver during the response to Nichols' beating.

            Emergency Medical Services Board member Jeff Beaman said during Friday's emergency meeting that there may have been other licensed personnel on scene — including a supervisor — who could have prevented the situation that led to the death of Nichols. Beaman said he hopes the board addresses those in the future.

            Matt Gibbs, an attorney for the state Department of Health, said the two suspensions were “not final disposition of this entire matter.”

            Board members watched 19 minutes of surveillance video that showed Long and Sandridge as they failed to care for Nichols, who couldn't stay seated upright against the side of the vehicle, laying prone on the ground multiple times. They also considered an affidavit by the Memphis Fire Department's EMS deputy chief.

            “The (state) Department (of Health) alleges that neither Mr. Sandridge nor Mr. Long engaged in emergency care and treatment to patient T.N., who was clearly in distress during the 19 minute period,” Gibbs said.

            Board member Sullivan Smith said it was ""obvious to even a lay person"" that Nichols “was in terrible distress and needed help.”

            “And they failed to provide that help,” Smith said. ""They were his best shot, and they failed to help.”

            Fire Chief Gina Sweat has said the department received a call from police after someone was pepper-sprayed. When the workers arrived at 8:41 p.m., Nichols was handcuffed on the ground and slumped against a squad car, the statement said.

            Long and Sandridge, based on the nature of the call and information they were told by police, “failed to conduct an adequate patient assessment of Mr. Nichols,” the statement said.

            There was no immediate response to a voicemail seeking comment left at a number listed for Long. A person who answered a phone call to a number listed for Sandridge declined to comment on the board’s decision.

            An ambulance was called, and it arrived at 8:55 p.m., the statement said. An emergency unit cared for Nichols and left for a hospital with him at 9:08 p.m., which was 27 minutes after Long, Sandridge and Whitaker arrived, officials said.

            An investigation determined that all three violated multiple policies and protocols, the statement said, adding that “their actions or inactions on the scene that night do not meet the expectations of the Memphis Fire Department.” 

            The fired officers involved were part of the so-called Scorpion unit, which targeted violent criminals in high-crime areas. Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said after the video’s release that the unit has been disbanded.

            Mayor Jim Strickland said Friday that the city has ordered up a review of its police department – including special units and use-of-force policies – through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, through the Collaborative Reform Initial Technical Assistant Center program, and the International Association of Police Chiefs. The COPS group is also aiding a review of the law enforcement response to the Uvalde, Texas, elementary school shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.

            The killing led to renewed public discussion of how police forces can treat Black residents with excessive violence, regardless of the race of both the police officers and those being policed. 

            At Nichols' funeral on Wednesday, calls for reform and justice were interwoven with grief over the loss of a man remembered as a son, a sibling, a father and a passionate photographer and skateboarder.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799836,Skull found in '97 in remote Alaska belongs to New York man,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — A skull found in 1997 in a remote part of Alaska's Interior belongs to a New York man whose death was likely caused by a bear mauling, according to the Alaska State Troopers.

            Investigators used genetic genealogy to help identify the remains as those of Gary Frank Sotherden, according to a statement Thursday from the troopers. 

            “Based on the shape, size and locations of tooth penetrations to the skull, it appears the person was a victim of bear predation,” Tim DeSpain, an agency spokesperson, said in an email Friday. “It is not known if the bear was the cause of the death.”











            Sotherden was reported missing in the late 1970s, DeSpain said. The location in which the skull was found was the general area of Sotherden's last known whereabouts, he said.

            DeSpain did not provide a hometown for Sotherden but said he was from upstate New York.

            In July 1997, a hunter contacted troopers in Fairbanks and reported finding a human skull along the Porcupine River, around 8 miles (13 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Troopers who went to the area did not find any other remains, the agency said, and the skull was sent to the state medical examiner’s office as unidentified. The suspected cause of death was a bear mauling, according to the troopers' statement. 

            DeSpain said “relatively recent successes in the department using genetic genealogy to identify unknown perpetrators and victims” prompted a cold case unit last April to ask the medical examiner’s office to submit bone segments from a number of remains.

            “These bone samples then went through various laboratory processes to generate DNA profiles, which were then uploaded into public DNA databases,” he said.

            Investigators used genetic genealogy to make a tentative identification, and troopers contacted a relative of Sotherden who provided a DNA sample, the agency said. 

            That relative told troopers Sotherden had been dropped off in the area where the skull was found “sometime in the early- to mid-1970s to go hunting.”

            The relative was notified of the DNA match in late December, troopers said.JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — A skull found in 1997 in a remote part of Alaska's Interior belongs to a New York man whose death was likely caused by a bear mauling, according to the Alaska State Troopers.Investigators used genetic genealogy to help identify the remains as those of Gary Frank Sotherden, according to a statement Thursday from the troopers.“Based on the shape, size and locations of tooth penetrations to the skull, it appears the person was a victim of bear predation,” Tim DeSpain, an agency spokesperson, said in an email Friday. “It is not known if the bear was the cause of the death.”Sotherden was reported missing in the late 1970s, DeSpain said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799837,Treasury makes more electric SUVs eligible for tax credits,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Treasury Department said Friday it is making more electric vehicles — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions.

            The revised standards for EV tax credits follow lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify for a maximum tax credit. Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with top aides to President Joe Biden last week to discuss the EV industry and the broader goals of electrification. 

            Under the sweeping climate law approved last summer, pickup trucks, SUVs and vans with a sticker price up to $80,000 qualify for EV tax credits, while new electric cars, sedans and wagons can only be priced up to $55,000. The rule had disqualified some higher-priced EVs, such as GM’s Cadillac Lyriq, prompting complaints from Tesla and other automakers.











            Ford and market leader Tesla both said in recent weeks that they are cutting prices on some EV models, including the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y and the Ford Mustang Mach-E, in part to qualify for the new federal tax credit and spur buyer interest.

            The EV tax credits are among a host of changes enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress approved in August with only Democratic votes. The law is designed to spur EV sales as part of a broader effort to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

            But a complex web of requirements, including where vehicles and batteries must be manufactured to qualify, has cast doubt on whether buyers can receive the full $7,500 credit.

            The Treasury Department said Friday that it hopes to make it easier for consumers to know which vehicles qualify for the credit. Under the revised rule, vehicle classifications will be determined by a consumer-facing fuel economy labeling standard, rather than a more complicated formula set by the Environmental Protection Agency, Treasury said.

            The change ""will allow crossover vehicles that share similar features to be treated consistently,'' Treasury said, and also will align vehicle classifications under the clean vehicle credit with the classification displayed on the vehicle label and on the consumer-facing website, FuelEconomy.gov. 

            The adjustment is retroactive to Jan. 1; motorists who bought vehicles under the new definition can get the credit, Treasury said. 

            The decision raises the retail price cap for tax credits to $80,000 for GM’s Cadillac Lyriq, Tesla’s five-seat Model Y, Volkswagen’s ID.4 and Ford's Mustang Mach-E and Escape plug-in hybrid. 

            GM had publicly asked Treasury to reconsider classification of the Lyriq — which starts at about $63,000 — to allow it to qualify for federal tax credits. Musk tweeted last month that the earlier Treasury rules were “Messed up!” 

            Musk and Biden, who have had a rocky relationship, did not meet in Washington last week. But White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Jan. 27 sit-down between Musk and White House aides Mitch Landrieu and John Podesta “says a lot” about how Biden sees the importance of the climate law and the broader goal of electrification.

            Landrieu oversees federal spending on infrastructure, which includes financial help for the EV industry, while Podesta is Biden's point man on implementing the climate law.

            “I think it’s important that his team, senior members of his team, had a meeting with Elon Musk,” Jean-Pierre said last week.

            John Bozzella, president and CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a key industry group, hailed the revised Treasury guidelines.

            “A very good decision that clears up some EV tax credit confusion and instantly helps customers shopping today and tomorrow for an electric crossover or SUV,” Bozzella said Friday.

            Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity, said he welcomed the administration’s goal to make more crossover EVs eligible for the maximum tax credit.

            But he said environmental groups are “counting” on the Biden administration to reject automaker pleas to allow crossover SUVs to count as light-duty trucks in upcoming fuel-economy regulations for gas-powered vehicles. Such a classification ""would permit the companies to increase air pollution by making more gas-guzzling pickups and SUVs.''WASHINGTON (AP) — The Treasury Department said Friday it is making more electric vehicles — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions.The revised standards for EV tax credits follow lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify for a maximum tax credit.

            Oats will average $5 million plus incentives over the deal running through the 2028-29 season under a deal approved Friday by the University of Alabama System Board of Trustees Compensation Committee.

            It makes him the fourth-highest paid basketball coach in the Southeastern Conference and among the Top 10 nationally, athletic director Greg Byrne said.











            Oats, who is in his fourth season, will make $4.5 million for the first year with $200,000 annual raises. The fourth-ranked Crimson Tide (19-3, 9-0 SEC) has the team's highest ranking this deep into a season since 1976-77.

            “I am honored and humbled to receive a contract extension from the University of Alabama,” Oats said in a statement. ""As I have said many times, my family and I love this community, the city of Tuscaloosa and the university.

            “I am incredibly proud of what we have been able to build during our time at UA which is a direct reflection of the student-athletes, coaches and staff who have all played a big part in our success. I am excited for what’s happening in the future of our program and the direction we are heading.”

            Alabama has gone 80-39 under Oats, winning the 2021 SEC regular season and tournament championships.

            “Coach Oats has done an outstanding job leading our men’s basketball program, and we want him to continue doing so for many years to come,” Byrne said in a statement. “He and his staff have lifted the program back to national prominence and built a product that is exciting to be a part of for our team and for our fans. 

            “We were confident Nate was going to be an outstanding coach for us when we hired him, and he is not only that, but also a great leader of our young men.”

            The new contract comes nearly three weeks after Alabama basketball player Darius Miles and another man were charged with capital murder following a fatal shooting near campus. Miles, a reserve forward, was removed from the team and suspended from the university following his arrest.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799841,Law takes share of golf lead in UAE after strong finish,"RAS AL KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) — David Law’s strong finish gave the Scot a share of the lead with Adrian Meronk and Rasmus Højgaard at the halfway point of the Ras Al Khaimah Championship on Friday.

            Law's bogey-free 8-under 64 included an eagle and three birdies over the last five holes at Al Hamra Golf Club to reach 11-under overall.

            “The last six holes I putted really well, which made a big difference,” Law said. “The fairways are so tight and firm, everyone is missing fairways. It plays into the hands of the bigger hitters a bit I would say, but at the same time there is still a bit of skill and control of the ball.”











            Polish golfer Meronk made seven birdies in his 65 including four straight from the 11th hole.

            Højgaard's 67 included six birdies and a costly bogey on the 16th when he was briefly in the lead at 12 under. The Dane is the twin brother of defending champion Nicolai.

            “I didn’t drive the ball well, I put myself in the rough and the sand a lot,” Rasmus Højgaard said. “Managed to putt well today and saved some good pars.”

            England’s Dale Whitnell recorded nine birdies in a flawless 63 to sit one shot off the lead alongside Daniel Gavins (66), Wil Besseling (66) and overnight leader Ryo Hisatsune (70).

            Nicolai Højgaard (66) is four shots behind the leaders.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799853,New bloods changing college hoops landscape,"Perennial powers frontloaded the final poll of the 2012-13 college basketball season.

            The top 10 included Louisville, Kansas, Duke, Indiana and Georgetown. Gonzaga was No. 1, at the start of its rise to the sport's upper echelon.

            Flash forward 10 years and the AP Top 25 has a different look and feel. 











            New programs have risen to the top tier. Upsets have turned up the madness in March even more. A few bluebloods have lost a bit of their shine. 

            “When you look at college basketball, there are some new bloods,” said ESPN college basketball analyst and former coach Seth Greenberg. “The bluebloods have an opportunity to reemerge as the season goes along, but we've got some new bloods that are stepping up and making a statement.”

            Changes in the sport have led to the shuffling at the top.

            Elite recruits have become more willing to eschew the traditional powers for smaller schools, spreading talent across the country. NIL deals have helped facilitate the shift, offering players opportunities they had never had before at those schools. 

            The transfer portal has allowed schools to replenish rosters quickly, pull in players who have experience and maturity that can fit in quickly. Some schools have invested more in facilities and coaches, adding to the allure of their programs.

            The lasting effects of the pandemic — namely the extra year of eligibility — has also made teams older, adding cohesiveness and coachability.

            “Because of the COVID year, you have older, more experienced teams that have grown or been put together that have the maturity and understanding of what it takes to be successful,” Greenberg said. “But the big thing is new coaches in certain leagues have done a really good job of evaluating and recruiting.” 

            The evidence is in the rankings.

            Purdue has continued its rise under coach Matt Painter, spending six weeks atop the poll this season after earning the program's first No. 1 ranking a year ago. Tennessee has become a defensive menace, steadily rising until reaching No. 2 this week.

            Kelvin Sampson has molded Houston into one of the nation's toughest teams to play. The Cougars went to the Final Four in 2021 and had two stints at No. 1 this season. No. 4 Alabama has shown it can play some basketball, too, reaching the Sweet 16 two years ago, climbing to No. 2 last week.

            No. 7 Kansas State, picked to finish last in the Big 12, has made a quick rise under first-year coach Jerome Tang, a former long-time assistant at Baylor. No. 15 TCU is no longer known as just a football school, while schools like Florida Atlantic and Charleston have risen through the ranks.

            No. 20 Clemson leads the ACC and Pittsburgh is just a game back. No. 18 Saint Mary's is ahead of No. 12 Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference. 

            On the flip side, North Carolina fell off quickly. A national finalist last season, the Tar Heels went from preseason No. 1 to out of the AP Top 25 in less than a month. 

            Kentucky struggled so much earlier in the season, fans were calling for coach John Calipari to be fired. Villanova dropped off precipitously in its first season since Jay Wright retired.

            Of course there's still a month left in the regular season, so the middling bluebloods can still turn it around.

            And once it gets to March Madness, the final chapter has still tended to be written by established powers. 

            Kansas won last year's national championship after an all-blueblood Final Four. ACC schools won three titles between 2015-19, wrapped around two Villanova championships.

            But with those big-name champions, chaos has reigned with some of the biggest upsets and unexpected deep March runs the past few years.

            Loyola Chicago reached the 2018 Final Four after Maryland-Baltimore County beat Virginia to become the first No. 16 seed to topple a No. 1 in NCAA Tournament history. Oral Roberts reached the Sweet 16 in 2021, Saint Peter's the Elite Eight a year ago.

            The way this season has gone so far, college basketball fans could be in for the maddest March yet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799854,Colorado considers using public land for affordable housing,"DENVER (AP) — Police officer Andy Sandoval lives in one the most beautiful places in the world near Vail, Colorado, where world-famous ski resorts are nestled between Rocky Mountain peaks. His living situation for years, though, was far less dreamy.

            Until last month, the 26-year-old, his wife and their two small children were squeezed into one bedroom in a three-bedroom house that held nine other tenants — the best they could afford because of bloated housing prices fueled in part by sky-high land costs.

            “Seeing my kids who wanted to run around, and my kids who wanted to stay up and watch a movie, who just didn’t have the space to do a lot of things ... was heartbreaking,"" said Sandoval. “I feel like I was failing them.” 











            Sandoval and his family were able to move into a home of their own last month thanks to Habitat for Humanity, but their all-to-common plight was an impetus for Colorado lawmakers to wade into the housing crisis. 

            The legislature is considering a new proposal to free up vacant parcels of state-owned land that could be leased or sold at a discount for affordable housing projects. If passed, one project near Vail would build 80 units of affordable housing in the first phase, and potentially hundreds more.

            The proposal is part of a snowballing trend kicked off locally by cities such as Boston, New York and San Francisco that has since been adopted by California lawmakers in 2019 and spawned requests to the federal government to open up land for residential development.

            “The cost of land in Colorado is one of — if not the — highest barrier to building affordable housing,” said Democratic state Sen. Dylan Roberts, one of the bill's sponsors. “By eliminating that barrier, we’re hopefully going to see projects happen that would have never happened before.”

            The bill was the first of several housing affordability measures the state's Democratic-controlled Legislature is considering this year as they prioritize what has become a vital issue after the state's median home price rose by 40% since the beginning of 2020, nearing $600,000, according to the rental platform Zillow. 

            “This is unaffordable if you are a teacher, nurse, restaurant manager, or city employee, the very workforce that help our Colorado communities thrive,” said Karen Kallenberg, executive director of Colorado's Habitat for Humanity, in a committee hearing on the bill. 

            Colorado's Habitat for Humanity chapter develops affordable dwellings across the state, and Kallenberg noted land has become one of the organization's largest expenses, rising by as much as 286% in recent years.

            The bill would authorize state officials to identify underused, state-owned land and organize deals with local municipalities, nonprofits and private companies to build affordable housing. 

            Colorado owns about 55 vacant parcels, including about a dozen in and around Denver, that could potentially be used for affordable housing. The bill proposes allocating $13 million to help kick-start projects. 

            It's yet to be determined which parcels would work for affordable housing, and how many units could be built on the ones that do. But, if passed, the legislation would launch one project in a place called Dowds Junction at the confluence of highways near Vail, west of Denver.

            In Vail alone, the median home prices has grown by $600,000 to over $1.7 million since the beginning of the pandemic, according to Zillow. Prices rose as wealthy newcomers — freed from their office desks with pandemic, work-from-home protocols — descended on resort towns in a buying frenzy. It's left local police officers and teachers scrambling to find an affordable abode. 

            “We simply cannot succeed without homes for our vital workforce,"" said George Ruther, Vail's housing director. 

            Single mother Tanya Solis, 33, a school social worker who had long dreamed of owning her own home, bounced around apartments in the region, fleeing steep rent hikes with each lease renewal during her daughter's first years.

            “I would just melt down thinking, ‘Would I ever be able to afford something?’” said Solis. “Will I ever be able to offer something stable to my daughter?”

            Like Sandoval, Solis recently was able to buy a home in the area through Habitat for Humanity. For Solis, being accepted for a home “was just all these great emotions,” she said. “Having programs like them available is just so huge ... (giving) individuals like us opportunities to be homeowners.”

            The parcel in Dowds Junction is currently used by the Colorado Department of Transportation, and the proposal would shift trailers on the property to another lot to make way for 80 units of affordable housing.

            In Colorado's statehouse, the bill has garnered Democratic and tentative GOP support, passing through committee last month in a 6-1 vote after supportive testimony from interest groups including the Colorado Chamber of Commerce.

            Republican Sen. Rod Pelton, the lone committee member to oppose the proposal, said he's concerned about the state potentially outcompeting adjacent landowners. Pelton caveated his vote by saying, “No, for now.""

            “We just need to be mindful of private enterprise, that we don't harm that process,” he said.

            The idea to utilize public land has made its way all the up to the federal government, where, in Colorado alone, the Bureau of Land Management owns 8.3 million acres of public land, according to the agency.

            A spokesperson for Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said the land some federal agencies own, oftentimes in town centers, have “great promise for housing opportunities.” The Western Governors’ Association, which Polis chairs, urged Congress to make the transfer of land to states, cities and counties easier as a solution to housing shortages. 

            Forfeiting federal land to states, however, has garnered more opposition.

            In a statement, Kate Groetzinger, a spokesperson for the left-leaning Center for Western Priorities, said: “It’s important to remember that people choose to live in the West because of our abundant public lands... now is the time to invest in making our public lands more accessible, not sell them off.”

            Groetzinger said the environmental organization doesn't have a stance on Colorado's proposal, which does not include federal land. 

            Roberts said his bill is not the sole solution to the housing crisis, but argued it would be a significant step in tackling numerous challenges facing Colorado. 

            “(Housing) is an economic issue because it’s hurting small businesses. It’s an educational issue because we can’t hire teachers in Colorado. It’s a health care issue because we can’t hire healthcare workers,” said Roberts. “If we can make a big dent in it, we are going to see it resonate through a lot of other challenges.”

Jared Polis said the land some federal agencies own, oftentimes in town centers, have “great promise for housing opportunities.” The Western Governors’ Association, which Polis chairs, urged Congress to make the transfer of land to states, cities and counties easier as a solution to housing shortages.Forfeiting federal land to states, however, has garnered more opposition.In a statement, Kate Groetzinger, a spokesperson for the left-leaning Center for Western Priorities, said: “It’s important to remember that people choose to live in the West because of our abundant public lands... now is the time to invest in making our public lands more accessible, not sell them off.”Groetzinger said the environmental organization doesn't have a stance on Colorado's proposal, which does not include federal land.Roberts said his bill is not the sole solution to the housing crisis, but argued it would be a significant step in tackling numerous challenges facing Colorado.“(Housing) is an economic issue because it’s hurting small businesses. It’s an educational issue because we can’t hire teachers in Colorado. It’s a health care issue because we can’t hire healthcare workers,” said Roberts. “If we can make a big dent in it, we are going to see it resonate through a lot of other challenges.”___This story was updated to correct Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799856,"G-7, Europe reach deal for price cap on Russian diesel","BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday that industrialized countries in the Group of Seven are imposing a price cap on refined Russian oil products such as diesel and kerosene, as part of a coalition that includes Australia and a tentative agreement from the European Union.

            The cap follows similar price limits put on Russian oil exports, with the goal of reducing the financial resources Russian President Vladimir Putin has to wage the nearly year-long war in Ukraine.

            “Today’s agreement builds on the price cap on Russian crude oil exports that we set in December and helps advance our goals of limiting Russia’s key revenue generator in funding its illegal war while promoting stable global energy markets,” Yellen said in a statement.











            On Friday, EU governments tentatively agreed to set a $100-per-barrel price cap on sales of Russian diesel to coincide with an EU embargo on the fuel. Diplomats representing the 27 EU governments set the cap on Russian diesel fuel, jet fuel and gasoline ahead of a ban taking effect Sunday. It aims to reduce Russia’s income while keeping its diesel flowing to non-Western countries to avoid a global shortage that would send prices and inflation higher. 

            Details about the cap were provided by a G-7 statement and diplomats from three different EU member nations, who agreed to discuss the cap on the condition of anonymity.

            The $100-per-barrel cap applies to Russian diesel and other fuels that sell for more than the crude oil used to make them. Officials agreed on a $45-per-barrel limit on Russian oil products that sell for less than the price of crude.

            The deal follows a similar G-7 agreement to limit the price of Russian crude oil to $60 a barrel. All the price ceilings are enforced by a requirement for the world's largely Western-based shippers and insurers to abide by sanctions and handle oil products only priced at or below the limits.

            Russia has said it will not sell to countries obeying the oil cap, but because its oil is selling for less than $60 per barrel, it has kept flowing to the global market. The price caps encourage non-Western customers that have not banned Russian oil to press for discounts, while outright evasion — though possible — carries additional costs such as organizing off-the-books tankers.

            The ambassadors of the 27 EU nations put forward the decision, and national governments have until early Saturday to react with a written objection. No changes to the deal were expected. 

            Europe has been steadily reducing its diesel supplies from Russia from around half of all imports. Diesel is key for the economy because it is used to power cars, trucks carrying goods, farm equipment and factory machinery. Prices have spiked since Russia invaded Ukraine on rebounding demand and limited refinery capacity in some places. 

            If the price cap works as intended and Russian diesel keeps flowing, fuel prices should not skyrocket, analysts say. Europe could get alternate supplies of diesel from the U.S., India and the Middle East, while Russia could seek new customers outside Europe. 

            However, the impact of the cap will be unpredictable as shippers reroute flows of the fuel to new destinations, and longer sea journeys could strain tanker capacity. 

            Fossil fuel sales are a key pillar of Russia's budget, but European governments previously hesitated to cut off their purchases because the economy was heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, oil and diesel. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, that has changed. 

            Europe cut off Russian coal and later banned its crude oil on Dec. 5. Meanwhile, Moscow has halted most supplies of natural gas to Europe, citing technical issues and a refusal by customers to pay in Russian currency. European officials say it is retaliation for sanctions and an attempt to undermine their support for Ukraine.

            The Eurasian eagle-owl named Flaco was discovered missing at 8:30 p.m. Thursday and remained on the loose Friday, zoo spokesperson Max Pulsinelli said.

            New York Police Department officers tried to catch the bird after it was spotted on Fifth Avenue Thursday night, but it flew off.











            The owl returned to Central Park at sunrise Friday and spent the day high up in a tree there.

            “Our focus and effort at this time is on the safe recovery of the owl,” zoo officials said in a news release. “We will issue updates as needed.”

            Eurasian eagle-owls are one of the larger owl species with a wingspan greater than 6 feet (180 centimeters), and have mottled brown and black feathers with distinctive ear tufts. They are not native to North America.

            This one might do fine in Central Park — if it knew how to hunt, said David Barrett, an avid birder who chronicles the city's avian population via Twitter accounts including Manhattan Bird Alert and Brooklyn Bird Alert.

            Cleotha Henderson, who has also used the name Cleotha Abston, was indicted last week on charges that include first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping, The Daily Memphian reported. The first-degree murder charge carries a sentence of life in prison or 60 calendar years. However, the Shelby County District Attorney’s Office has indicated it may seek an enhanced sentence of life without parole or the death penalty.

            Police have said Eliza Fletcher, 34, was running on the University of Memphis campus when she was forced into a vehicle after a struggle about 4 a.m. on Sept 2. Her body was found three days later behind a vacant home after a massive police search.











            The killing of Fletcher, a mother of two, shocked the Memphis community led to a flood of support for her family. Runners in Memphis and several other U.S. cities held an early-morning running event in her honor a week after she was kidnapped.

            At his arraignment in Shelby County Criminal Court on Friday, Henderson pleaded not guilty to all charges related to Fletcher’s death.

            Criminal Court Division Judge Lee Coffee warned members of Fletcher’s family who were present in the courtroom that the path to trial could be a long one.

            Henderson is also charged with raping a woman in September 2021 — about a year before Fletcher was killed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799861,"New England knows winter, but why so dangerously cold?","PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — New Englanders are used to cold temperatures, but a combination of extreme cold accompanied by powerful winds is downright dangerous, and enough to send even bundled-up skiers scampering indoors.

            It’s that potentially deadly combination that sparked worries as weather forecasters talked about “once-in-a-generation” wind chills in parts of New England.

            WHAT'S CAUSING THE COLD?











            New England's temperature swing is being caused by two things: The blast of Arctic air has reached the region just as a rapid cyclogenesis is developing over Labrador and Newfoundland, churning up powerful winds, said meteorologist Donald Dumont at the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.

            A cyclogenesis refers to an intensification of a cyclone or low-pressure storm system. Those winds mean cold air dipping to nearly 30 below could feel much colder, with wind chills of minus 50 (minus 45 Celsius) in some spots of the Northeast.

            “Those things are leading to this extreme wind chill weather pattern that’s going to be impacting us,” Dumont said.

            WHY THE HOOPLA?

            Maine is known for its cold weather, but a popular pond hockey tournament was postponed, some ski resorts curtailed operations and organizers even put the kibosh on Saturday's events at the National Toboggan Championships.

            The reality is, this sort of extreme cold doesn't happen all that often, even in the Northeast. 

            In Portland, Maine, the wind chill was expected to dip to 40 below Fahrenheit (which is also minus 40 Celsius). It'll be the coldest since at least 2016 and could be the coldest since 1981, so it's possible the wind chills will be the coldest in more than four decades, Dumont said.

            The extremes increase with elevation. On Friday, winds were topping 100 mph (160 kph) and wind chills could reach minus 100 (minus 73 Celsius) atop New Hampshire's Mount Washington, where a handful of weather observers are stationed.

            IS IT REALLY DANGEROUS?

            Yes, it is. And, Dumont added, “it's painful.” 

            The wind chills forecast for late Friday and early Saturday can cause frostbite on exposed skin in just 10 minutes. 

            Even if bundled up, the extreme cold can be dangerous for someone who's outside for an extended period.

            That's why people are encouraged to remain indoors. If people have to go outside, then they should dress like their lives depend on it.

            Just wait until the weather warms up a bit before enjoying the great outdoors, Dumont said. “The best thing to suggest to people is don’t travel. You know, just be safe,"" Dumont said. ""Don’t go snowmobiling. Don’t go skiing.”

            WHAT ABOUT FROST QUAKES?

            Extreme temperature changes can be associated with a rare phenomenon called frost quakes, which also are possible as temperatures plummet across the region.

            Technically called cryoseisms, they can happen when water underground freezes quickly and expands during a cold snap, said Sarah Thunberg, another meteorologist.

            “It can feel like an earthquake. You can feel a little shake from it,” she said. But it's nothing to get worked up over. It's more of a novelty than a danger, she added.

            THERE ONE MINUTE, GONE THE NEXT

            Mark Twain once opined on how fast the weather changes in New England. That'll be the case for this wintry agony.

            The worst of the arctic blast will be departing the region within 36 hours, so Dumont advised to save your snowmobiling, skiing or tobogganing until Sunday, when the temperatures in Portland are expected to reach an ice-melting high of 37 degrees (3 Celsius).

            The existence of the committee was disclosed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity because no announcement had been made. 

            The committee also will examine revenue disparity among MLB clubs. 











            Los Angeles Dodgers chairman Mark Walter and Detroit Tigers chairman Chris Ilitch are among the committee members, the person said.

            Baseball executives have said in recent weeks that the sport needs to prepare in the event that rights-fee payments are not made by Diamond Sports Group, the subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group that operates networks under the name Bally Sports. Cable networks have lost subscribers and revenue in recent years due to cord-cutting.

            Diamond owns rights to the broadcasts for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Guardians, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins, Milwaukee Brewers, Minnesota Twins, St. Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays and Texas Rangers.

            Billy Chambers, who had been Sinclair’s chief financial offer, started work this week with MLB in a new position as executive vice president for local media.

            The Walt Disney Company acquired the regional sports networks in its purchase of 21st Century Fox in March 2019. 

            In August, Sinclair said it had bought 21 regional sports networks and Fox College Sports from Disney in a deal that valued those assets for $10.6 billion.

            At the time, Disney sold the equity it acquired from Fox in the Yankees’ YES Network to a newly formed investor group that includes Yankee Global Enterprises and Sinclair, a group that held the 80% of YES not previously held by the Yankees, for a total enterprise value of $3.47 billion. 

            Sinclair also holds rights to many NBA and NHL teams and has a joint venture interest in Marquee Sports Network, which broadcasts the Chicago Cubs.

            This offseason, salaries have risen following last year’s agreement on a five-year labor contract with the players’ association. And payrolls rose 12.6% to a $4.56 billion last year, breaking the previous record set in 2017, and are set to go even higher this year. The New York Mets, entering their third season under owner Steve Cohen, currently project a payroll of about $370 million — which would smash the previous high of $291 million by the 2015 Los Angeles Dodgers.

            MLB’s newest study committee follows a pair in the past quarter-century. One was a joint management-union committee that began after the 1990 lockout and recommended in 1992 to eliminate salary arbitration and make players be eligible for free agency after three years instead of six while rejecting management’s suggestion of a salary cap.

            The other was a committee that met in 1999 and 2000, recommending higher luxury tax rates, sharing 40-50% of local revenues after ballpark expenses and unequal distribution of new national broadcasting, licensing and internet revenue to assist low-revenue clubs that met a payroll minimum.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799864,WNBA free agent Azurá Stevens signs with Los Angeles,"Azurá Stevens is heading west, signing with the Los Angeles Sparks, the team announced Friday.

            The 6-foot-6 free agent forward won a WNBA title with the Chicago Sky in 2021 and has averaged 9.0 points and 4.4 rebounds in her career. 

            “I am beyond excited to be joining the Los Angeles Sparks,” she said. “The plan that (general manager Karen Bryant and coach Curt Miller) are putting together for this team & organization is special and I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of it. I can’t wait to get to LA (and) get to work!”











            Stevens was drafted by Dallas in 2018 and she played 34 games in her first season, earning All-WNBA rookie team honors.

            “Azurá was our number one free agent target,” Bryant said. “She is already a WNBA champion and is just entering the prime of her career. We are thrilled that she chose the Sparks as her new team and LA as her new home.”

            The Sparks already added Dearica Hamby in a trade with Las Vegas last month and Jasmine Thomas in a separate deal. Los Angeles also re-signed Lexie Brown.

            Chicago now has lost Stevens, Courtney Vandersloot and Candace Parker to free agency, though the team did sign center Elizabeth Williams, who is a dominant defensive player. 

            “We are so excited to have Elizabeth in a Chicago Sky uniform,” Sky GM and coach James Wade said. “For as long as she’s been in the league, she’s been the epitome of a player that is a hard worker, a great leader and embodies the values of the WNBA.” 

            Also on Friday, Seattle, which lost Breanna Stewart to New York as a free agent earlier this week, signed Sami Whitcomb and Kia Nurse.

            “Kia is a talented, versatile guard and a proven impact player and competitor in our league,” Storm general manager Talisa Rhea said. “She brings valuable experience as a leader of Team Canada on the international stage, and we look forward to the positive impact she will have on our team here in Seattle.”

            Nurse missed all of last season recovering from an ACL injury, but returned to lead Canada to the semifinals of the World Cup in September. 

            Other free-agent moves included Connecticut re-signing Natisha Heideman, and Indiana signing Maya Caldwell and Erica Wheeler.

            But there are big-name free agents still out there: Brittney Griner, who said she was returning to Phoenix; and Diana Taurasi, who also is expected to continue her career with the Mercury. Nneka Ogwumike and sister Chiney also are free agents and both are expected to go back to Los Angeles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799870,13 dead in Chile amid struggle to contain raging wildfires,"SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — At least 13 people were reported dead as of Friday night as a result of the more than 150 wildfires burning across Chile that have destroyed homes and thousands of acres of forest while the South American country is in the midst of a scorching heat wave. 

            Four of the deaths involved two separate vehicles in the Biobío region, around 560 kilometers (348 miles) south of the capital of Santiago. 

            “In one case they were burned because they were hit by the fire,” Interior Minister Carolina Tohá said. In the other case, she said, the victims died in a crash, “probably trying to escape the fire.”











            The fifth victim was a firefighter who was run over by a fire truck while combatting a blaze in the area. 

            Later in the afternoon, a helicopter that was helping combat the flames crashed in the Araucanía region, killing the pilot, a Bolivian national, and a mechanic, who was Chilean.

            At nightfall, the national agency responsible for emergencies raised the death toll to 13 without giving details on the latest deaths. 

            As of midday Friday, 151 wildfires were burning throughout Chile, including 65 declared under control. The fires had blazed through more than 14,000 hectares (34,595 acres).

            Most of the wildfires are in Biobío and neighboring Ñuble, where the government has declared states of catastrophe that allows greater coordination with the military and the suspension of certain constitutional rights.

            The heat wave hitting Chile is set to continue with high temperatures and strong winds that could make the wildfires more challenging.

            President Gabriel Boric suspended his vacation to travel to the affected areas on Friday and said there is “evidence” that some of the wildfires were sparked by unauthorized burnings.

            “The full force of the state will be deployed to, first of all, fight the fires and to accompany all the victims,” Boric said.

            It remained unclear how many homes and other structures had been burned.

            “Families are having a very difficult time,” Ivonne Rivas, the mayor of Tomé in Biobío, told local radio. “It’s hell what they are living through, the fire got away from us.”

            The wildfires caused the suspension of a highly anticipated announcement by forensic experts who were expected to give the cause of death of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, winner of a Nobel Prize for literature.

            The experts were set to give their view on whether Neruda died of complications from prostate cancer or whether he was poisoned, potentially settling one of the great mysteries of post-coup Chile.

            The doctor in charge of delivering the report’s findings was unable to connect to the internet because he is in a region affected by the wildfires, a spokesman for the country’s judiciary said.SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — At least 13 people were reported dead as of Friday night as a result of the more than 150 wildfires burning across Chile that have destroyed homes and thousands of acres of forest while the South American country is in the midst of a scorching heat wave.Four of the deaths involved two separate vehicles in the Biobío region, around 560 kilometers (348 miles) south of the capital of Santiago.“In one case they were burned because they were hit by the fire,” Interior Minister Carolina Tohá said.

The fires had blazed through more than 14,000 hectares (34,595 acres).Most of the wildfires are in Biobío and neighboring Ñuble, where the government has declared states of catastrophe that allows greater coordination with the military and the suspension of certain constitutional rights.The heat wave hitting Chile is set to continue with high temperatures and strong winds that could make the wildfires more challenging.President Gabriel Boric suspended his vacation to travel to the affected areas on Friday and said there is “evidence” that some of the wildfires were sparked by unauthorized burnings.“The full force of the state will be deployed to, first of all, fight the fires and to accompany all the victims,” Boric said.It remained unclear how many homes and other structures had been burned.“Families are having a very difficult time,” Ivonne Rivas, the mayor of Tomé in Biobío, told local radio. “It’s hell what they are living through, the fire got away from us.”The wildfires caused the suspension of a highly anticipated announcement by forensic experts who were expected to give the cause of death of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, winner of a Nobel Prize for literature.The experts were set to give their view on whether Neruda died of complications from prostate cancer or whether he was poisoned, potentially settling one of the great mysteries of post-coup Chile.The doctor in charge of delivering the report’s findings was unable to connect to the internet because he is in a region affected by the wildfires, a spokesman for the country’s judiciary said.",2023/02/04,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799871,El Salvador bets safety on incarceration; unveils new prison,"TECOLUCA, El Salvador (AP) — When El Salvador began making mass arrests of people with suspected gang affiliations last year, President Nayib Bukele ordered the construction of what would be the largest prison in Latin America.

            This week, Bukele rolled out the completed project, a sprawling campus 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of the capital, that could eventually house 40,000 inmates.

            Dubbed the Terrorism Confinement Center, the prison will hold many of the more than 62,000 people authorities have arrested since the government suspended some constitutional rights and pushed an all-out offensive against the gangs last March.











            The effort enjoys broad support in El Salvador, but has been strongly criticized by human rights organizations and some foreign governments for its lack of due process and other abuses.

            Bukele put it in simple terms in a tweet Thursday: “El Salvador has managed to go from being the world’s most dangerous country, to the safest country in the Americas. How did we do it? By putting criminals in jail. Is there space? There is now.”

            It has been a few years since El Salvador held that unenviable distinction – there were 6,656 homicides in 2015 – but the country lowered that total to 3,495 homicides last year, the lowest in decades. The government does not include some 120 killings of alleged gang members by authorities in that figure.

            The last time the government provided the prison population, it was nearly 36,000 in April 2021. The country’s 29 prisons were then at 120% of their capacity. In the past 10 months, the government has nearly tripled the population. 

            During a tour of the new prison Thursday night, Public Works Minister Romeo Rodríguez said each cell could hold more than 100 inmates. The government has not said when it will begin transferring prisoners.

            Critics of Bukele’s strongarm tactics say that in the long term El Salvador will not be able to arrest and jail its way out of its security problems.

            “With this prison, the administration of Nayib Bukele in El Salvador shows that it doesn’t have clear plans to prevent crime,” Carolina Jimenez, president of the Latin America-focused non-governmental organization WOLA, tweeted. “His main choice is a permanent state of ‘exception’ in which they commit human rights violations.” 

            Rev. Andreu Oliva, rector of the Jesuit-founded Central American University in San Salvador, said the focus on punishment was worrisome. 

            “It shook me to see punishment cells where the people are going to be in total darkness, total isolation, sleeping on a concrete slab,” he said. With no library or rooms for education or training, he saw little that could help prisoners who wanted to leave criminal life.

            With no talk of rehabilitation, critics like Oliva question what there will await inmates when they are released other than a return to the gangs. 

            Bukele has dismissed critics as defenders of gangsters. His popular support remains high. Days pass without a murder. Neighborhoods that spent years under total control of gangs are drawing back some of the residents who fled them.

            Month after month, El Salvador’s congress renews the state of exception imposed in late March after gangsters killed 62 people in a single day. The right of association, the right to be informed of the reason for an arrest and access to a lawyer remain suspended.

            There is little sympathy for gang members. For years, they’ve terrorized swaths of El Salvador’s territory, extorting and killing at will. 

            In 2015, the Supreme Court declared the Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18 terrorist groups.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799872,The Emperor's Last: MMA pioneer Fedor Emelianenko retiring,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fedor Emelianenko became a near-mythical martial arts figure two decades ago at the grey dawn of the social media age, so his earliest exploits had a tantalizing touch of mystery.

            His vicious knockouts and submissions weren't broadcast worldwide or posted on YouTube and Twitter for immediate viewing. They had to be excavated from the internet's dark recesses, or watched on grainy VHS tapes and sketchy DVDs by devotees of a sketchy sport called mixed martial arts.

            Bellator CEO Scott Coker was working for a kickboxing promotion in Japan when he first heard about the slightly pudgy, slightly undersized former Russian soldier who destroyed almost every man he touched.











            “I’m like, ‘Hmm, how good is this guy, really?’” Coker said. “So then I started watching his fights, and I was like, ‘Oh my God.’ He was the guy with the piercing eyes that could look right through you, that lived in Russia, and they called him the Sharpshooter at that time. So you started watching him, and you’re like, ‘Oh, this guy is really good. He’s amazing.’”

            The unassuming heavyweight with the lupine stare became a combat sports legend while forging a unique path through the MMA jungle. The fighter known as The Last Emperor famously never agreed to fight for the UFC, instead taking on seemingly everyone outside the dominant American promotion, but always on his own terms.

            Now 46 and weary of the training grind, Emelianenko said he is retiring after he fights Ryan Bader on Saturday night. Their bout for the Bellator heavyweight title will be the final trip to the cage for the trailblazing fighter who drew untold millions of fans to an upstart sport at his competitive peak.

            ""My family has been waiting for me way too long,” Emelianenko said through an interpreter. “My mom asked me to stop. She is always worried. But it’s mostly my age. ... I’ll be very happy to finish it. I’m not sad at all. It’s time.”

            Bader, Bellator's 39-year-old heavyweight champ, has always been impressed by his humble opponent's virtuosity. Emelianenko's success fed into a beloved corner of martial arts mythology, stoking the dream that anyone can be a champion if they worked hard and learned the proper skills.

            “He’s a legend of the sport, and he’s a good human being,” Bader said. “He deserves it. I know people are going to be rooting for him (Saturday night), and I understand it. We all want to see legends go out on top.”

            This 23-year journey that began in the pre-social media shadows will end on the brightest stage: Bellator will make its debut on CBS with Emelianenko's final bout, which also will be shown around the world from the historic Forum in Inglewood, California.

            Emelianenko insisted his final fight should be against Bader, who famously wrecked Fedor with a two-punch combination knockout only 35 seconds into their first meeting, which was four years ago last weekend at the Forum. Emelianenko admits he isn't sure what will happen when he is tested one last time, but he wants to find out.

            “The pressure that I used to be able to handle, I can’t handle that anymore,” he said. “If you want to compete at the highest level with the younger fighters, you have to be 100%.”

            Emelianenko's candid admission about pressure is remarkable, since nothing in this world has ever seemed to intimidate him.

            He fought largely in Japan for the late Pride promotion during the first seven years of his MMA career, building his legend with a series of vicious wins. He has fought regularly in the U.S. for Coker in the Strikeforce and Bellator promotions since 2009, but he remained a revered, mysterious figure by training and living in his hometown, 300 miles south of Moscow — and also by retiring from 2012 to 2015.

            Emelianenko insists he is done with competition with this retirement, even while acknowledging he will have other opportunities. Most notably, he has thought about joining the ranks of mixed martial artists who take up boxing for big paychecks.

            “I did think about it, if I can do it as they do or not,” he said with a grin. “I had those kinds of thoughts. But I want to be done with it completely.”

            Emelianenko would have loved to stage his farewell bout in Moscow — perhaps even in Red Square, as Coker once dreamed — but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made it impossible. While his exploits will live online for decades, Emelianenko said it's time to devote himself to his family, his MMA team and his responsibilities in the larger Russian MMA infrastructure.

            “We spend so much time outside of our families because of sport,” Emelianenko said. “Sometimes you just call it quits and that’s it, especially when you have young kids and they’re waiting for you.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799873,Dominion-backed rates bill whittled down in House committee,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Dominion Energy's ongoing push for yet another year of legislative tinkering with the way its rates are regulated took a surprise turn this week, when a Virginia House committee whittled down a company-backed bill ratepayer advocates have fiercely opposed. 

            The vote Thursday afternoon came after Gov. Glenn Youngkin's administration and the House speaker's office got involved behind the scenes and then the administration weighed in publicly for the first time on the dispute, which has simmered since before this year's legislative session officially kicked off. 

            Del. Terry Kilgore, the sponsor of the House version of the legislation, put forward a new, stripped-down substitute on Thursday, which no longer included a provision that would have increased Dominion's return on equity, a measure of profitability. 











            “It’s a simple bill — a lot simpler than it started,” said Kilgore, a longtime ally of Dominion, the parent company of the state's largest electric utility and Virginia's largest corporate donor.

            Kilgore told the House Commerce and Energy Committee his bill would increase the frequency of Dominion's rate cases before the State Corporation Commission, moving them from every three years to every two, and would give the commission additional discretion to adjust rates as they see fit.

            Kilgore's bill, like a companion Senate version, initially contained provisions that effectively would have bumped up the return on equity, which is set by the SCC. Dominion has said the change it was seeking was reasonable and would help keep the company competitive as it seeks to raise money for the billions worth of renewable energy projects it has committed to building. 

            But that proposal drew a backlash from ratepayer advocates and others, who said the legislation was just the latest example of the company trying to use the legislature to meddle with the job of regulators. 

            The way rates are set for the utility, Dominion Energy Virginia, as well as the authority regulators have to adjust them is a perennial issue at the General Assembly. In recent years, the company has pushed through legislation that minimized the chances that it would have to lower its rates. That’s despite regulators having routinely found that the utility's rates provide excessive profit.

            “We have monopolies in Virginia. The role of monopoly regulators is to make sure that power prices are fair. And when the monopoly utility gets to dictate its own profit margins, that takes away the regulators' power to ensure that customers are treated fairly,” Will Cleveland, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said in an interview earlier this week. 

            The law center is among a coalition of environmental groups, big businesses and ratemaking reform groups have been opposing the legislation. A council of the AFL-CIO has joined Dominion in backing the bill. 

            Also gone from Kilgore's latest bill is a provision that involved rolling $300 million worth of charges in what are called rate adjustment clauses, or riders, into base rates. The company had pitched doing so as a way to lower customers' monthly bills. 

            Travis Voyles, Youngkin's acting secretary for natural and historic resources, said Kilgore's amended measure and two separate rate-related measures intended to shore up the State Corporation Commission's authority that advanced Thursday were priorities for the governor. 

            Altogether, the bills “present straightforward, foundational and commonsense ways to move the conversation on energy forward and target processes to improve predictability, accountability and the restoration of the SCC's independent authority. An appropriate balance is needed,” Voyles said.

            A representative of Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office represents the interests of consumers in SCC proceedings, also backed Kilgore's amended bill. 

            A Dominion lobbyist, Katharine Bond, said of the amended Kilgore bill that the company was “supportive of it moving through this process” and urged its passage. 

            “We continue to support comprehensive legislation that provides immediate relief for our customers, stronger SCC authority and a simpler regulatory process. We appreciate the process moving forward and will continue working with all the stakeholders,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said Friday. 

            Longtime observers of energy policy said the moment marked a stark departure for a committee where Dominion-backed measures typically sail through. 

            “From what Dominion asked for at the beginning to what it appears they’re going to get, I'm not sure we’ve ever seen a move like that, certainly not in my time in energy policy or in the General Assembly,” said Greg Habeeb, a former Republican House member and now a lobbyist whose firm represents a variety of clients who opposed the legislation as it was introduced. 

            The focus now turns to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where that chamber's version cleared a committee last week after about 15 minutes of discussion but has been stalling on the floor for several days rather than being advanced to a final vote. That could now could happen early next week. 

            Another powerful Dominion ally, Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, is carrying his chamber's version. 

            Saslaw's bill has been through some amendments but is closer to the versions he and Kilgore introduced than the current House bill. 

            His version also would also allow the company to issue bonds to spread out upcoming fuel cost increases — which the company says are attributable largely to the war in Ukraine — over a 10-year period, adding interest but averting customers from bearing the spike all at once. 

            “The goal is to have more affordable rates while enabling investments that are needed to be made to the electric grid with the new sources of power that they’re currently working on,” Saslaw said of his version as a whole earlier this week in a committee hearing. 

            Dominion has long been a powerhouse at the state Capitol, where it currently employs or retains more than two dozen lobbyists. 

            In the month of January before the session began, the company donated over $300,000 to lawmakers, leadership caucuses and political action committees, according to records maintained by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.

            “We contribute equally to candidates from both parties in support of public policy that promotes affordable, reliable and clean energy,” Ruby said.RICHMOND, Va.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799877,Chinese balloon high over US stirs unease down below,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The Chinese balloon drifting high above the U.S. and first revealed over Montana has created a buzz down below among residents who initially wondered what it was — and now wonder what its arrival means amid a chorus of alarm raised by elected officials.

            The balloon roiled diplomatic tensions as it continued to move over the central U.S. on Friday at 60,000 feet (18,300 meters). Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly canceled an upcoming trip to China.

            Curiosity about the bobbling sky orb that's the size of three school buses swept the nation and the internet, with search terms like “where is the spy balloon now?” and “spy balloon tracker” surging on Google. There is no such tracker just yet, but a couple St. Louis TV stations offered grainy live feeds of the balloon.











            Internet users posted wobbly videos and photos of white splotches in comments sections and speculative feeds. And online storm chasers, more accustomed to tracking raging systems and funnel clouds, offered updates on the balloon’s path through cloudless skies.

            It crossed into U.S. airspace over Alaska early this week, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic.

            In Montana — home to Malmstrom Air Force base and dozens of nuclear missile silos — people doubted Beijing's claim that it was a weather balloon gone off course. And the governor and members of Congress pressed the Biden administration over why the military did not immediately bring it down from the sky.

            “I question whether or not we would even found out about this if people hadn't spotted it in Billings,” said Chase Doak, a resident of the southern Montana city who appears to have captured some of the first known video footage and photographs of the balloon.

            A white balloon with what appeared to be a solar array hanging beneath it was seen over Billings Wednesday afternoon, around the same time the local airport was temporarily shut down and a day before the Pentagon said it was tracking a Chinese spy balloon over the state.

            Initial speculation over its origins ranged from the foreign to the extra-terrestrial.

            When Todd Hewett's 10-year-old son saw it over Billings he thought it was a comet. Hewett got some shaky footage, using a cellphone to take video through a telescope, and was skeptical of the Chinese claim it was a civilian balloon.

            “Shoot it down,” he said. ""If we could somehow pierce the bottom of it to allow some of the gas to escape to allow for a more controlled descent (that) would be nice .. but if we can’t do that ... blow it up.”

            Montana has some experience with balloons launched by adversaries: Japan in World War II targeted the western U.S. with incendiary “balloon bombs” that were floated over North America with plans to harm people and start forest fires. More than 30 of the bombs made of rice paper landed in Montana, according to the Montana Historical Society.

            In Oregon, five children and a pregnant woman on a church picnic were killed in 1945 when they found one of the bombs and it exploded.

            On Friday in Kansas City, Missouri, the National Weather Service said it received reports of a large balloon in the Kansas City metro area and posted two images of white orbs taken from the weather station office in Pleasant Hill, Missouri. The service confirmed it was not a National Weather Service balloon.

            A graphic generated by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration online tool was eagerly shared on Facebook, showing the balloon’s trajectory sweep into the U.S. South. Local National Weather Service offices were asked on Twitter whether the balloon was theirs. No, was their answer.

            Tami Hansen, 44, saw the balloon overhead in Columbia, Missouri, and said she was not terribly concerned about the object flying over her city.

            “I’ve heard all kinds of thoughts. Is it a spy balloon, is it a weather balloon? Who knows right now? It is what it is,"" she said. “We really try not to get too political out here,” she said.

            Montana U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, who chairs the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said he would hold a hearing to get answers from the Biden administration. He called China's actions “a clear threat.""

            Rep. Ryan Zinke sent a poll to constituents early Friday saying the balloon was still over the state and asking if should be shot down. When the Pentagon said the balloon had since drifted over the central U.S., Zinke raised the possibility China had more than one balloon over the U.S..

            “I don't know if that's the only balloon. We've asked for those answers,” he told The Associated Press. He said the balloon should have been shot down. “The message that it gives to our allies is, we’re not capable of dealing with a balloon,"" he said.

            The Pentagon late Friday acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America but officials did not specify where it was spotted.

            Republicans in Montana have grown increasingly outspoken in recent years about China posing a threat to U.S. national security. 

            A bill pending before the state Legislature would ban “foreign adversaries” from owning, leasing or renting critical infrastructure or farmland. The measure's sponsor singled out China as being interested in acquiring U.S. lands and resources to “help them with spying efforts.""

            The heavy anti-China sentiment marks a shift from a just a few years ago, when Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines visited China, hosted the Chinese ambassador on a visit to a Montana ranch and helped secure a deal to export more beef to China.

            The beef deal later fell through, and the Republican has transformed into a strong critic of China.

            Daines on Friday rejected the Pentagon's contention that it was too dangerous to bring the balloon down over Montana. He told reporters there would have been “no better place” than his sparsely populated home state.

            “You've got higher odds of hitting a cow or a prairie dog or an antelope than you would of hitting any kind of a structure or a person,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799878,Legal recreational pot sales begin for Missouri adults,"COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Recreational marijuana sales in Missouri officially began Friday after the state health department unexpectedly began approving dispensary permits early. 

            
                Medical marijuana has been legal in the state since a ballot measure passed in 2018, but voters went a step further this November by approving a constitutional amendment legalizing the drug for anyone 21 or older. The new law made Missouri the 21st state to allow recreational use.

            Under the amendment, non-medicinal pot use became legal in the state in December. But sales were stalled because the health department had until Friday to issue business licenses. 











            Forrest Wilson, a 23-year-old Columbia resident, said he found out that stores began selling marijuana recreationally and “wanted to give it a shot.” He bought a pre-rolled joint filled with a strain called biscotti.

            “It's nice to be able to go out and do this stuff and not get looked at like you're a dirty stoner,” Wilson said. “I smoke weed most of the time because I'm a pretty anxious person.”

            Almost all of the state's medical marijuana dispensaries applied to sell recreational pot, according to Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Senior Services.

            Of the medical marijuana facilities that applied to sell cannabis recreationally, 335 were approved as of Friday. That includes 207 dispensaries, 72 manufacturers and 56 cultivation facilities, according to the agency.

            Close to 200 dispensaries were inspected Friday and given the go-ahead to sell to consumers.

            Ryan Herget, CEO of Good Day Farm, said the company expects sales at its 19 Missouri stores, which previously only sold cannabis for medical use, to double or triple. He said the company hired about 200 new employees in anticipation of increased demand.

            One of the company's first customers Friday was Gregory Williams, 55, of St. Louis, who welcomed the legalization of marijuana.

            “It means a little liberation, a little less red tape,” along with revenue for the city and for business people, Williams said. He plans to buy weekly.

            Teresa Gooch, 62, of Troy, Missouri, said she recently had a medical procedure and uses marijuana for pain relief. She said it's “amazing” to be able to go to a store and try different strains to see what works best.

            Adults who want to grow their own cannabis can now apply for a permit through the health department.

            If the agency does not approve or deny licenses by Friday, dispensaries that previously only sold medical marijuana will automatically be permitted to sell recreational pot as well. 

            Missouri's constitutional amendment to legalize recreational pot use also called for the expungement of records of past arrests and convictions for nonviolent marijuana offenses, except for selling to minors or driving under the influence. 

            More than 5,200 past crimes had been wiped from Missourians’ records as of Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799880,AP source: Kyrie Irving requests trade from Nets,"NEW YORK (AP) — Unable to get a new contract, Kyrie Irving is looking for a new address.

            The All-Star guard has asked the Brooklyn Nets for a trade, a person with knowledge of the details said Friday.

            The request comes less than a week before the trade deadline and possibly signals an ending to his tenure with the franchise, either then or after this season ends. 











            Irving made the request after talks about a new contract did not go to his liking, the person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because talks were to remain private. It was first reported by ESPN and The Athletic.

            Irving is eligible for a contract extension, but the Nets refused to give him one last summer. Irving’s agent and stepmother, Shetellia Irving, told Bleacher Report last week that she had reached out to the Nets regarding a new deal. Kyrie Irving — whose current deal with the Nets expires after this season — is eligible for a four-year contract worth as much as $200 million.

            “I have reached out to the Nets regarding this,” Shetellia Irving told Bleacher Report. “We have had no significant conversations to date. The desire is to make Brooklyn home, with the right type of extension, which means the ball is in the Nets’ court to communicate now if their desire is the same.”

            Irving and the Nets were thought to be moving toward a long-term extension in 2021, when Kevin Durant signed one. Instead, Irving proved himself to be unreliable, missing games for reasons unrelated to basketball, and the Nets changed their thoughts about locking into a lengthy future with the point guard.

            The Nets — coming off a 43-point loss at Boston on Wednesday — open a five-game homestand Saturday against Washington. Irving isn't listed on their injury report, meaning he is available to play. They play six of their last seven games before the All-Star break at home; the only “road” game in that stretch is at the New York Knicks.

            But whether Irving will be part of any of that is unclear now.

            
                A tweet was posted to Irving’s account shortly before the first reports of the trade request came out; as often is the case with Irving when it comes to social media posts, it was not certain what exactly he was referring to in that post.

            “To my Peers: JUST BE YOURSelf and GROW! Keep people around who CELEBRATE YOU unconditionally and appreciates all of the hard work that gets put in. Distance yourself from the folks who manipulate, hate, and hurt,” read the tweet.

            Brooklyn is 31-20 this season, fourth in the Eastern Conference standings entering Friday, and has gone 4-7 since fellow All-Star Durant hurt his knee in a game at Miami on Jan. 8. Durant could return during this homestand, since he’s on record saying he wants to play in the All-Star Game on Feb. 19 — so, presumably, he’ll be back with the Nets before then.

            Irving is playing well in Durant's absence, averaging 30.3 points in the last 10 games. Perhaps that would interest teams who were reluctant to make a deal for Irving last summer, when he acknowledged he didn't find much of a market because of his perceived unreliability. 

            Durant also had asked the Nets for a trade this past summer, before cooler heads prevailed. And it was at this time last year that Brooklyn traded James Harden — who was part of what the Nets thought would be a Big Three of him, Durant and Irving — to the Philadelphia 76ers in a deal that brought Ben Simmons to Brooklyn.

            Whatever happens between now and Thursday, this is officially the start of yet another new saga surrounding Irving, who signed with his hometown team along with Durant in the summer of 2019.

            He was suspended by the Nets for what became eight games earlier this season after the team said it was dismayed by his repeated failure to “unequivocally say he has no antisemitic beliefs.” That came shortly after Irving refused to issue the apology that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sought for posting a link to an antisemitic work on his Twitter feed. Irving also wound up losing his long relationship with Nike as part of the massive fallout from what he tweeted and the reactions that followed.

            “I don’t stand for anything close to hate speech or antisemitism or anything that is going against the human race,” Irving said on the day the Nets reinstated him in November.

            Irving also missed much of the 2021-22 season because of his refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19, which left him essentially ineligible to play in Brooklyn’s home games for much of the season because of New York City rules put in place in response to the pandemic.

            He has also expressed no shortage of controversial opinions during his career — including repeated questioning whether the Earth was round before eventually apologizing to science teachers.

            Irving also took a leave of absence during the 20-21 season, and general manager Sean Marks said this past summer that being available to play was going to be something the organization considered as it weighed an extension for Irving.

Irving also wound up losing his long relationship with Nike as part of the massive fallout from what he tweeted and the reactions that followed.“I don’t stand for anything close to hate speech or antisemitism or anything that is going against the human race,” Irving said on the day the Nets reinstated him in November.Irving also missed much of the 2021-22 season because of his refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19, which left him essentially ineligible to play in Brooklyn’s home games for much of the season because of New York City rules put in place in response to the pandemic.He has also expressed no shortage of controversial opinions during his career — including repeated questioning whether the Earth was round before eventually apologizing to science teachers.Irving also took a leave of absence during the 20-21 season, and general manager Sean Marks said this past summer that being available to play was going to be something the organization considered as it weighed an extension for Irving.___AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this report.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/04,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799881,Valencia's Paulista suspended 2 games for foul on Vinícius,"MADRID (AP) — Valencia defender Gabriel Paulista will miss two games for his dangerous foul of Vinícius Júnior after the Spanish soccer federation’s disciplinary committee added another game to his suspension on Friday.

            Paulista kicked at Vinícius’ legs after the Brazil forward got past him with the ball in the 72nd minute of Madrid’s 2-0 win over Valencia on Thursday. The kick sent Vinicius hard to the ground and earned the center back a direct red card. A scuffle between the teams followed.

            Vinícius scored on a breakaway earlier.











            Valencia coach Voro González said Paulista’s hard foul “wasn’t correct.”

            Paulista will miss Sunday’s game versus Girona in La Liga and the following round’s match against Athletic Bilbao.

            The 14th-placed Valencia fired coach Gennaro Gattuso on Monday.

            Paulista apologized in a message posted on his Instagram account.

            “I accept the criticism and the red card,” Paulista wrote. “I am a physical player, but also a noble one. I respect Vinícius and it was never my intention to harm him. We are struggling a lot in this great club, going through a difficult period and emotions are running high.

            “Sometimes it is impossible to control one’s emotions. I lost control and I sincerely ask for forgiveness.”

            Vinícius was not injured and practiced on Friday for his team's game at Mallorca on Sunday. 

            Madrid is in second place, five points behind leader Barcelona.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799884,"Jupiter's moon count jumps to 92, most in solar system","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Astronomers have discovered 12 new moons around Jupiter, putting the total count at a record-breaking 92. 

            That's more than any other planet in our solar system. Saturn, the one-time leader, comes in a close second with 83 confirmed moons. 

            The Jupiter moons were added recently to a list kept by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center, said Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution, who was part of the team. 











            They were discovered using telescopes in Hawaii and Chile in 2021 and 2022, and their orbits were confirmed with follow-up observations. 

            These newest moons range in size from 0.6 miles to 2 miles (1 kilometer to 3 kilometers), according to Sheppard.

            ""I hope we can image one of these outer moons close-up in the near future to better determine their origins,"" he said in an email Friday. 

            In April, the European Space Agency is sending a spacecraft to Jupiter to study the planet and some of its biggest, icy moons. And next year, NASA will launch the Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon of the same name, which could harbor an ocean beneath its frozen crust.

            Sheppard — who discovered a slew of moons around Saturn a few years ago and has taken part in 70 moon discoveries so far around Jupiter — expects to keep adding to the lunar tally of both gas giants. 

            Jupiter and Saturn are loaded with small moons, believed to be fragments of once bigger moons that collided with one another or with comets or asteroids, Sheppard said. The same goes for Uranus and Neptune, but they're so distant that it makes moon-spotting even harder.

            For the record, Uranus has 27 confirmed moons, Neptune 14, Mars two and Earth one. Venus and Mercury come up empty.

            Jupiter's newly discovered moons have yet to be named. Sheppard said only half of them are big enough — at least 1 mile (1.5 kilometers) or so — to warrant a name.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799885,"Krzyzewskiville, rowdy Duke fans part of Coach K's legacy","DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Emma Smith never forgot the discomfort of camping out on Duke's campus during a rainstorm, her tent filling with water and mud. Didac Garcia-Grau's freshman year saw two tents lost to wind damage.

            And for JT Galla, there was nothing quite like seeing sub-freezing temperatures in the forecast for that night's campout in “Krzyzewskiville.”

            “I think everybody has a moment where they think to themselves: ‘Why am I doing this?’” Galla said. “But I don’t think anybody has a moment where they think to themselves: ‘I wish that I didn’t do this.’”











            For decades, the reward was securing a coveted spot inside Cameron Indoor Stadium to cheer Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski's Blue Devils against hated North Carolina. This Saturday, rivalry renewal and all, it's different. Krzyzewski retired after last season as the winningest coach in the history of college basketball and a five-time NCAA champion. 

            Yet the annual pop-up community of up to 130 tents and more than 1,500 students remained until this week next to the sign bearing his name. Both Krzyzewskiville and the famed rowdiness in those courtside bleachers are part of Coach K's legacy, one successor Jon Scheyer and the “Cameron Crazies” aim to preserve as one of the sport’s most fearsome homecourt advantages.

            “It's kind of like a bucket-list item that you want to be able to look back on with your kids one day and be like, ‘I slept in a tent in K-ville and went to the coolest game in college sports,’” said Smith, now a senior who, with Garcia-Grau, were this year's co-head line monitors for Krzyzewskiville.

            Duke's 83-year-old arena is a cramped-confines throwback. It holds 9,314 fans in a time of bigger and glitzier venues. 

            It also was a critical piece to Krzyzewski's 42-year run, with his teams winning 88% of games here — including an Atlantic Coast Conference-record 46-game streak from 1997-2000 — and carrying a sellout streak from November 1990 that recently pushed past 500 games.

            A few years into his tenure, student demand for the UNC game led to Krzyzewskiville campouts. And the already-rowdy students gained broader fame in nationally televised games with their body paint, costumes, homemade signs and coordinated jeers. The Crazies sit along an entire sideline teeming with sweat, wit, spite and chaos. 

            Galla, a senior neuroscience major who first camped out during the 2019-20 season, put it simply: “I leave with my ears ringing every time.”

            The intensity is there any time the Tar Heels visit from nearby Chapel Hill. And it was particularly true for Krzyzewski's emotional Cameron finale in March that ended with UNC spoiling his sendoff before the Tar Heels won again in the Final Four — the first-ever NCAA Tournament meeting between the rivals — and ended Krzyzewski's career.

            It's easy to see how much the Cameron vibe matters for the Blue Devils: The only time Duke lost as many as five home games in 27 seasons came in 2020-21 with no fans due to COVID-19 restrictions.

            Jon Scheyer knows it well after a playing career that included being the leading scorer on Krzyzewski's 2010 title winner. The 35-year-old is counting on it as Duke's first-year head coach.

            “What I want Duke fans to feel is they’re right alongside us in this journey,” Scheyer said, adding, “When we're home, we're all scrapping, clawing, fighting together.”

            Students who camp outside of Cameron in the weeks leading up to the UNC game follow a Krzyzewskiville policy manual checking in at 44 pages. 

            They could register for one of 70 priority “black” tents representing up to 12 people. If more than 70 registered — Garcia-Grau said this year's number was 140 — tents were awarded based on scores for each group on a trivia test about that year's Blue Devils.

            The first groups were allowed to set up tents in early January this year, and other tents followed with lower priority. Groups had to keep a minimum number of people in tents at all times for line checks (other than during grace periods for students to leave, such as inclement weather).

            Krzyzewskiville was taken down in recent days after the admission order had been determined for Saturday.

            Along the way, students had decorations such as a photo of player Jacob Grandison and the Grand Canyon — dubbed the “Grandison Canyon"" — or a mocking photo of UNC center Armando Bacot from last year's Final Four weekend in New Orleans.

            Some do homework in a study tent with tables and charging areas for electronics. Some stream movies or TV shows. Others play games or chat with fellow campers. 

            The smell of alcohol typically lingers — along with the buzz — as groups made their way into Cameron for games. And there has long been the sense of community that can only come passing on a perfectly acceptable dorm room to sleep in a tent on a cot on a chilly night.

            It’s all part of the experience, one that feels unchanged after Krzyzewski's handoff to Scheyer.

            “Our whole lives, people are going to ask, 'Oh did you go to a basketball game? If they know anything about college basketball, they'll ask, ‘Oh did you go to the UNC game or did you tent?’"" Garcia-Grau said.

            ""Everyone wants to do it. ... So I think it's like, a crucial part of being a Duke student is being a Cameron Crazie at some point in your career.""

            AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Emma Smith never forgot the discomfort of camping out on Duke's campus during a rainstorm, her tent filling with water and mud. Didac Garcia-Grau's freshman year saw two tents lost to wind damage.And for JT Galla, there was nothing quite like seeing sub-freezing temperatures in the forecast for that night's campout in “Krzyzewskiville.”“I think everybody has a moment where they think to themselves: ‘Why am I doing this?’” Galla said. “But I don’t think anybody has a moment where they think to themselves: ‘I wish that I didn’t do this.’”For decades, the reward was securing a coveted spot inside Cameron Indoor Stadium to cheer Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski's Blue Devils against hated North Carolina. This Saturday, rivalry renewal and all, it's different. Krzyzewski retired after last season as the winningest coach in the history of college basketball and a five-time NCAA champion.Yet the annual pop-up community of up to 130 tents and more than 1,500 students remained until this week next to the sign bearing his name. Both Krzyzewskiville and the famed rowdiness in those courtside bleachers are part of Coach K's legacy, one successor Jon Scheyer and the “Cameron Crazies” aim to preserve as one of the sport’s most fearsome homecourt advantages.“It's kind of like a bucket-list item that you want to be able to look back on with your kids one day and be like, ‘I slept in a tent in K-ville and went to the coolest game in college sports,’” said Smith, now a senior who, with Garcia-Grau, were this year's co-head line monitors for Krzyzewskiville.Duke's 83-year-old arena is a cramped-confines throwback. It holds 9,314 fans in a time of bigger and glitzier venues.It also was a critical piece to Krzyzewski's 42-year run, with his teams winning 88% of games here — including an Atlantic Coast Conference-record 46-game streak from 1997-2000 — and carrying a sellout streak from November 1990 that recently pushed past 500 games.A few years into his tenure, student demand for the UNC game led to Krzyzewskiville campouts. And the already-rowdy students gained broader fame in nationally televised games with their body paint, costumes, homemade signs and coordinated jeers. The Crazies sit along an entire sideline teeming with sweat, wit, spite and chaos.Galla, a senior neuroscience major who first camped out during the 2019-20 season, put it simply: “I leave with my ears ringing every time.”The intensity is there any time the Tar Heels visit from nearby Chapel Hill. And it was particularly true for Krzyzewski's emotional Cameron finale in March that ended with UNC spoiling his sendoff before the Tar Heels won again in the Final Four — the first-ever NCAA Tournament meeting between the rivals — and ended Krzyzewski's career.It's easy to see how much the Cameron vibe matters for the Blue Devils: The only time Duke lost as many as five home games in 27 seasons came in 2020-21 with no fans due to COVID-19 restrictions.Jon Scheyer knows it well after a playing career that included being the leading scorer on Krzyzewski's 2010 title winner. The 35-year-old is counting on it as Duke's first-year head coach.“What I want Duke fans to feel is they’re right alongside us in this journey,” Scheyer said, adding, “When we're home, we're all scrapping, clawing, fighting together.”Students who camp outside of Cameron in the weeks leading up to the UNC game follow a Krzyzewskiville policy manual checking in at 44 pages.They could register for one of 70 priority “black” tents representing up to 12 people.

            The Spanish foreign ministry rejected Gibraltar’s description of events, “as well as the claims of alleged British sovereignty over the territory and waters of Gibraltar contained therein.”

            It also said the agents were injured while pursuing the smugglers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799901,"Biden, Cabinet visiting 20 states after State of the Union","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and his Cabinet will embark on a post-State of the Union “blitz” to at least 20 states next week to discuss his economic agenda after his Tuesday night address to Congress, the White House announced Friday.

            Biden is expected to devote much of his second State of the Union address to highlighting his efforts over the past two years to create jobs, fight inflation and improve the nation's infrastructure as he gears up for an expected run for reelection. After the speech, the president, vice president, and members of the Cabinet will hold over 30 events in two days to drive the message home to the American people in their communities.

            “During the State of the Union, President Biden will outline how the past two years has seen historic job growth, falling inflation, higher wages, and record investments coming back to America,” the White House said. “The economic travel blitz showcases how the president’s vision is creating jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure, lowering costs for families, tackling climate change, investing in our future and delivering for families too often left behind.”











            On Wednesday, Biden will visit Wisconsin to discuss job creation, while Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Atlanta to promote the administration’s clean energy initiatives. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will visit a Tennessee battery manufacturing facility, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack will be in North Carolina to discuss grants for climate-smart production practices, and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will tour an Omaha, Nebraska, high school and discuss lowering higher education costs with students.

            On Thursday, the president will travel to Tampa, Florida, to talk about his efforts to lower prescription drug costs and protect Social Security and Medicare. Harris will highlight electric vehicle investments in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will visit Carson City, Nevada, to announce an investment in battery manufacturing and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will celebrate the award of a $150 million grant to replace a highway bridge in Lake Charles, Louisiana. 

            Other Cabinet-level visits will focus on Veterans Affairs programs in Texas, economic opportunity for Black Americans in Oklahoma, plans to plug orphan wells in Pennsylvania and efforts by farmers and ranchers in Kansas to address climate change. Officials will also visit Arizona, California, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Utah.

            With Republicans now in control of the House, the Biden administration's focus is shifting from legislating to implementing the massive infrastructure and climate bills passed in the last Congress — and to trying to make sure Americans credit the president for the improvements.

            The travel follows Biden's stops this week in Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia focused on rail and water infrastructure projects funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and his Cabinet will embark on a post-State of the Union “blitz” to at least 20 states next week to discuss his economic agenda after his Tuesday night address to Congress, the White House announced Friday.Biden is expected to devote much of his second State of the Union address to highlighting his efforts over the past two years to create jobs, fight inflation and improve the nation's infrastructure as he gears up for an expected run for reelection.

Harris will highlight electric vehicle investments in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will visit Carson City, Nevada, to announce an investment in battery manufacturing and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will celebrate the award of a $150 million grant to replace a highway bridge in Lake Charles, Louisiana.Other Cabinet-level visits will focus on Veterans Affairs programs in Texas, economic opportunity for Black Americans in Oklahoma, plans to plug orphan wells in Pennsylvania and efforts by farmers and ranchers in Kansas to address climate change. Officials will also visit Arizona, California, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Utah.With Republicans now in control of the House, the Biden administration's focus is shifting from legislating to implementing the massive infrastructure and climate bills passed in the last Congress — and to trying to make sure Americans credit the president for the improvements.The travel follows Biden's stops this week in Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia focused on rail and water infrastructure projects funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.",2023/02/04,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799902,Super Bowl prop betting increasing in popularity,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Jay Kornegay was behind the counter in 2004 when someone approached with $5,000 to bet on the Super Bowl but had no idea how to decide.

            The man, not a regular sports bettor, thought for a few moments and decided to put it all on the Carolina Panthers to score exactly 29 points at 30-1 odds.

            Kornegay couldn't believe it, but took the man's money — and later returned it plus the winnings. The bet cashed when the Panthers scored that amount in a three-point loss to the New England Patriots.











            The Super Bowl draws a larger portion of casual bettors than other American sporting events, and the numerous proposition options each year underscore how the game's mass appeal goes well beyond professional gamblers and hardcore fans.

            “We’re certainly going to write a lot more tickets on the propositions than the game,” said Kornegay, vice president of race and sports operations at Westgate Las Vegas. “They’ve become so popular.”

            This year's Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles is Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the first time the championship will be played inside a venue with a sportsbook.

            Next year's Super Bowl will be in Las Vegas, the nation's sports betting capital.

            Sportsbooks have taken advantage of the increasing popularity of prop bets, which could range from whether there will be a safety to whether the Chiefs or Eagles will score more points than LeBron James or Steph Curry when their teams meet the day before the big game. 

            Most props will be made available next week, but Caesars Sportsbook already has its 2,000-option menu available. Among the choices is whether the first turnover will be an interception or fumble. The interception is minus-170, meaning someone would need to bet $170 to win $100. The fumble is listed at plus-140, which means a $100 bet would pay $140.

            Jason Scott, BetMGM vice president of trading, said he expects to put out 700 or 800 such bets by next week for its properties in 20 states plus Washington, D.C. Kornegay said Westgate will have about 500 bets with roughly 1,000 options. Jeff Benson, Circa Sports operations manager, said his casino's booklet will be 12 or 13 pages front and back.

            “I think you have a ton of people that want just to bet the props,” Benson said. “They don’t really care who wins. That’s really a way for them to enjoy the game."" 

            The number of bets on props is considerably higher than traditional wagers such as which team will cover the point spread and whether the total number of points with be higher or lower than the posted figure. The Eagles are 1 1/2-point favorites at FanDuel Sportsbook, and the total is 50 1/2 points.

            Kornegay estimated that for every traditional Super Bowl bet, there are six or seven prop wagers.

            Scott said that while some of the more unusual prop bets draw much of the attention, more than 99% of the money tends to go to about 30 high-profile bets such as which player will score the first touchdown.

            The popularity of props is a fairly recent phenomenon.

            Caesars is believed to have published the first prop bet when it posted at 20-1 odds that defensive lineman and goal-line running back William “the Refrigerator” Perry would score a touchdown for the Chicago Bears in the 1986 Super Bowl. The odds plummeted to 2-1 by kickoff, and Perry rewarded bettors by reaching the end zone late in the third quarter.

            That Super Bowl was the second of a 13-game winning streak for the NFC in the title game, many of them blowouts. Kornegay was at the now-closed Imperial Palace at the time, and he wanted to find a new way to attract bettors and keep their interest throughout the one-sided games.

            Before the 1995 championship between the San Francisco 49ers and San Diego Chargers, prop bets were still limited, so Kornegay and his team decided to change that. They developed about 150 prop bets for the anticipated blowout that became a 49-26 victory by the 49ers.

            “It stirred up quite a bit of interest,” Kornegay said. “And ever since then, the propositions have been part of the Super Bowl weekend.”

            The games have usually been much closer since the turn of the century, many coming down to the final minutes.

            Professional sports bettors tend to make the more traditional wagers and look for value in the props if they believe they can find a betting number to exploit. For the most part, the props belong to the general public.

            And with the lack of betting experience come some unusual choices.

            Kornegay said a bettor drove to Las Vegas from California unsure of what to do with $50,000. He put is all on the coin toss.

            And it came in.

            In the Chiefs' 31-20 victory over the 49ers three years ago, Benson said someone correctly bet the exact score for each team.

            “It didn’t turn out great for us,” Benson said. “It turned out awfully good for him. But obviously in this business, you definitely see some longshots hit once you book enough Super Bowls.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799904,Elias welcomes expectations fueled by Orioles' potential,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Orioles general manager Mike Elias is happy to accept some of the blame if expectations are a little harder to manage this season.

            “I believe our rebuild is behind us and we've got an incredible chance now to be a very, very competitive team for years,” Elias said. “I think that the front office and the manager, when we talk to the media, we feed those expectations.”

            The Orioles went 83-79 last year, a 31-win improvement that nearly landed Baltimore in the playoffs. Even after a relatively quiet offseason, there's still a lot to like in 2023. The Orioles have eight of the game's top 100 prospects in MLB Pipeline's latest ranking, including infielder Gunnar Henderson, who is No. 1 on the list after reaching the big leagues at the end of last season.











            And that group doesn't include catcher Adley Rutschman, who began last year as a top prospect and finished it by earning a handful of down-ballot MVP votes in the American League.

            Elias and manager Brandon Hyde took questions from reporters Friday as part of the team's Birdland Caravan. At the end of the 2022 season, Elias said he thought the team would have a chance to invest in the major league payroll in a different way than previously — but the Orioles weren't particularly aggressive. 

            They added Kyle Gibson and Cole Irvin to the rotation and signed second baseman Adam Frazier, but there wasn't the type of big splash that was in theory possible given the team's low payroll — and the number of inexpensive young contributors under team control. Elias said Friday the Orioles still ""live in the reality of our business”

            “We approach things very carefully,"" Elias said. ""We have a lot of really smart and experienced people in our front office working on our plan, and that includes growing the team over the next few years, managing our payroll, trying to get into contracts that make sense for the long haul.”

            The lack of spending — and a lease at Camden Yards that expires at the end of this year — has brought more scrutiny on ownership, but Orioles fans have a lot of reasons to be happy with Elias and Hyde. Elias said the team remains open to exploring more acquisitions via free agency or the trade market. There are certainly fewer glaring weaknesses than in the past.

            The starting rotation may be the biggest area of uncertainty, but Elias says there are a dozen players who can compete for a spot. The next big debut for Baltimore could be from Grayson Rodriguez, a 6-foot-5 right-hander ranked as baseball's No. 7 prospect — and No. 2 pitcher — by MLB Pipeline.

            The bullpen was a surprising strength last year, and now the Orioles will hope to avoid a significant regression there.

            “We'll see. This time last year, if you had asked me who our bullpen was, I would have no idea,"" Hyde said. ""We had a lot of great stories in our bullpen last year. ... Those guys were so inexperienced that I hope that they can build off it, and not try to repeat what they did last year — just continue to be consistent.”

            Baltimore's non-roster invitees for spring training include shortstop Jackson Holliday, the No. 1 pick in last year's amateur draft and son of seven-time All-Star Matt. It's easy to look at a future with Rutschman, Henderson, Rodriguez and Holliday — plus established major leaguers like Cedric Mullins, Anthony Santander, Ryan Mountcastle and Austin Hays — and see all sorts of potential.

            If that puts more pressure on the Orioles going forward, that's a nice problem to have.

            “This is honestly the first spring training I’ve been standing here openly talking about the playoffs,” Elias said. “I think that’s a big deal.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799905,Menacing charge against Bengals' Joe Mixon is dismissed,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Bengals running back Joe Mixon no longer faces a misdemeanor charge of aggravated menacing over allegations that he threatened and pointed a gun at a woman in Cincinnati.

            A Friday order dismissing the case in Hamilton County Municipal Court said only that the city prosecutor’s office requested the dismissal “in the interest of justice.”

            A warrant for Mixon was issued Thursday. A police officer’s accompanying affidavit alleged that the 26-year-old pointed a firearm and told the victim: “You should be popped in the face. I should shoot you, the police (can’t) get me.”











            It said the altercation happened a few blocks from the Bengals’ stadium on Jan. 21 — the day before Cincinnati beat the Buffalo Bills in a divisional-round playoff game — but included no other details about the circumstances. 

            “I really feel that police have an obligation before they file charges — because of the damage that can be done to the person’s reputation — to do their work,"" said Mixon's agent, Peter Schaffer. 

            A statement from the Bengals said the team was investigating the situation and not commenting further on the charge or its dismissal. 

            Mixon rushed for 814 yards and seven touchdowns this season, his sixth. He also had 60 receptions for 441 yards, both career highs, and two touchdowns.

            In 2021, he had rushed for career highs of 1,205 yards and 13 touchdowns for Cincinnati, where he has spent his entire career. 

            Mixon was a second-round draft pick out of Oklahoma in 2017. Several teams said they passed on him because of concerns about his character after Mixon punched a female Oklahoma student in the face in 2014. 

            He was suspended from the football team for a year and entered an Alford plea, in which a defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges there is enough evidence for a conviction. He received a deferred sentence and was ordered to perform community service and undergo counseling.

            Berisha capitalized on some poor Leverkusen defending to head in Arne Engels’ corner for what proved to be the winning goal in the 55th minute.

            Leverkusen’s second straight defeat after last Sunday’s 2-0 loss at Borussia Dortmund dented the club’s hopes of European qualification. That defeat in Dortmund was the team’s first after five straight wins.











            Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso sent on young star Florian Wirtz for the last half hour, then more attacking players as the time dwindled, but none were able to force an equalizer against the home team’s tightly packed defense.

            Moussa Diaby went closest for Leverkusen when he struck the post in a scrappy first half.

            Augsburg climbed five points above the relegation zone while Leverkusen remained stuck in ninth place ahead of the rest of the 19th round.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799912,All-Star exclusion no sweat for Edwards: 'I kind of knew',"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Timberwolves were predictably irked when Anthony Edwards was not picked for the NBA All-Star Game, a belief in his worthiness that had plenty of backing around the league.

            As for Edwards, well, he said he wasn't surprised or disappointed. His laid-back, aw-shucks vibe — one of many reasons why the third-year guard has endeared himself to the Timberwolves and their fans — was in full effect after the reserves were announced Thursday night.

            “I'm just happy for the guys that got in,” Edwards said Friday at the team's shootaround prior to playing Orlando. “I didn't even watch it. I knew I wasn't going to get in.”











            With only 12 spots per conference in this increasingly star-driven league, there will never not be an All-Star team without a list of legitimate snubs. 

            Edwards name-dropped Sacramento guard De'Aaron Fox as one peer he thought should've made it. Phoenix's Devin Booker, Anthony Davis of the Los Angeles Lakers and Denver’s Aaron Gordon were among the strong Western Conference candidates for the reserve pool selected by the coaches.

            “I’m just never the one that’s selected for things like that, I feel like,” Edwards said. “I’ve got to go above and beyond. I will next year, so I ain’t tripping.”

            Averaging 24.9 points entering the matchup with the Magic, Edwards is a top-20 scorer in the league. But his value to the Timberwolves has been immeasurable this winter, with three-time All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns sidelined since late November with a severe calf strain and the entire team still adjusting to newcomer Rudy Gobert's unique skill set.

            Edwards has emerged as the unquestionable go-to playmaker in clutch situations. He has made significant strides with his confidence and wisdom toward when to drive hard to the basket, when to catch and shoot from deep and when to keep the ball moving to a teammate. 

            “Just being able to see them get going is pretty awesome to watch,” said Edwards, who’s averaging a career-best 4.6 assists.

            Defensively, Edwards has improved his awareness, anticipation and communication. He's averaging 1.7 steals, another high as a pro. 

            He's also remarkably durable in the age of load management, one of only two top-25 scorers in the league along with New York's Julius Randle who has played in every game.

            “I just love playing basketball, so anytime I can go out there and play at 7, I’m ready,” he said.

            Then there's his leadership, the trait that transcends his age-21 experience and the rest of the Timberwolves quickly mention when asked about his biggest impact.

            “We follow him. By example, physically, emotionally, however you can in the league, it’s easy for our guys to jump on the train and ride it,” said guard D'Angelo Russell, from whom Edwards has overtaken the primary ballhandling responsibilities.

            
                His high-road reaction to the All-Star exclusion might be the best example of all of this maturity. His teammates were clearly bothered by it a lot more than he was.

            “I started the season off bad, so I kind of knew I wasn’t going to be an All-Star,” Edwards said, later adding: ""As long as we go to the playoffs, I don’t care.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799915,US board clears path for mini-union vote at big Nissan plant,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Fewer than 100 employees out of the thousands who work at Nissan's auto assembly plant in Tennessee can hold a vote on whether to form a small union, the federal labor board has decided.

            The ruling Thursday by the National Labor Relations Board overturns a June 2021 decision by one of its regional officials that has long blocked the vote. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers sought to limit the push to about 86 tool and die technicians at Nissan’s Smyrna plant, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) outside Nashville.

            The union said it is discussing the ruling with the employees at the Nissan facility “to determine the best path forward.”











            The board's three Democrats, who now hold a majority under President Joe Biden, signed off on the decision. The last remaining GOP member did not join the majority's ruling.

            The ruling offers a dash of hope for unions in their struggle to get a foothold in foreign-owned auto assembly plants in the traditionally anti-union South.

            Previously, the regional official ruled against the smaller bloc vote after finding the few dozen workers share an “overwhelming community of interest” with the rest of the facility’s production and maintenance workers. She found that the only appropriate unionized group would be one representing about 4,300 plantwide production and maintenance workers. The union did not want the larger vote and didn’t pursue it.

            The board, under a newly installed Democratic majority, announced in December 2021 that it would review that decision. 

            The board reasoned this week that the group of workers qualifies for the carved-out vote as a “craft unit,” saying those workers are “highly trained, highly paid employees working in a trade that the Board has frequently recognized as a craft.”

            Nissan had contended that the employees are not sufficiently distinct from other plant workers to be eligible for their own small unionized subgroup. The company has about 7,000 employees at the Smyrna facility.

            “While we do not agree with the Board’s position, our history reflects that we respect the right of employees to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace,” Nissan spokesperson Lloryn Love-Carter said in a statement. 

            The union, meanwhile, said the decision “sets a strong precedent going forward that appropriately classifies standalone craft units.”

            “It is unfortunate that a broken and painstakingly long NLRB process has again allowed a company to put the brakes on workers obtaining a voice on the job without delay,"" Machinists union spokesperson DeLane Adams said in a statement.

            Nissan does work with organized labor in the rest of the world, but votes to unionize broadly at the U.S. two plants have not been close. Workers in Smyrna rejected a plantwide union under the United Auto Workers in 2001 and 1989. The Japan-based automaker’s other U.S. assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi, rejected facility-wide representation by the UAW during a 2017 vote.

            The margin was much closer in 2014 and 2019 votes at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where workers twice rejected a factory-wide union under the UAW. 

            The year after the 2014 vote failed, a group of 160 Chattanooga maintenance workers won a vote to form a smaller union, but Volkswagen refused to bargain. The German automaker had argued the bargaining unit needed to include production workers as well. The dust-up led to the 2019 factory-wide vote.

            Unions also have run into opposition from Republican politicians when they attempt to organize at foreign automakers in the South, including in Tennessee.

            Tennessee does have a big union presence at an American automaker: the General Motors plant in Spring Hill has thousands of production and skilled trades workers represented by UAW.

            There is also an open question about whether workers will unionize at four sprawling new factories planned by Ford in Kentucky and Tennessee by 2025, with an aim of hiring nearly 11,000 workers. Three of the plants — two in Kentucky, one in Tennessee — will be built with Ford’s South Korean corporate partner, SK Innovation, to produce electric vehicle batteries. A fourth, in Tennessee, will make electric F-Series pickup trucks.NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799917,Raiders hire former Commanders OC Scott Turner,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Former Washington Commanders offensive coordinator Scott Turner is joining the Las Vegas Raiders' staff, likely helping oversee the passing game.

            “I’m just happy to be a part of the staff and it’s obviously coach (Josh) McDaniels' deal, and I’m just going to be ready to contribute and help the best I can,” Turner said Friday. “I’ll get out there and get a feel for the team. It’s just everything’s so new right now.”

            The 40-year-old Turner was the Commanders' offensive coordinator the last three seasons before he was fired Jan. 10. Washington ranked 20th in total offense, 21st in passing and 24th in scoring this season.











            Turner, the son of longtime former NFL offensive coordinator and head coach Norv, oversaw eight quarterbacks during his time with the Commanders. Their offense was ranked in the bottom half of the league all three seasons.

            Joining the Raiders represents a little bit of a homecoming for Turner, who was a backup quarterback at UNLV in 2003 and 2004 and still has a Las Vegas area code for his phone number.

            “I just came out there and met with the staff earlier this week, and it obviously brings back some memories,"" Turner said. “A little bit different situation now. I’ll be coming out with my wife and kids. But it'll be good to be back.”

Washington ranked 20th in total offense, 21st in passing and 24th in scoring this season.Turner, the son of longtime former NFL offensive coordinator and head coach Norv, oversaw eight quarterbacks during his time with the Commanders. Their offense was ranked in the bottom half of the league all three seasons.Joining the Raiders represents a little bit of a homecoming for Turner, who was a backup quarterback at UNLV in 2003 and 2004 and still has a Las Vegas area code for his phone number.“I just came out there and met with the staff earlier this week, and it obviously brings back some memories,"" Turner said. “A little bit different situation now. I’ll be coming out with my wife and kids. But it'll be good to be back.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/04,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799918,Sancet hat trick leads 10-man Bilbao to 4-1 win over Cadiz,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Oihan Sancet scored his second career hat trick to lead 10-man Athletic Bilbao to a 4-1 victory at home over Cadiz in the Spanish league on Friday.

            Bilbao lost defender Yuri Berchiche to a second yellow card in the 58th minute while leading 3-1. Cadiz was never able to take advantage of the extra man – or stop Sancet from completing his treble.

            Sancet grabbed the 10th-minute opener with a fierce strike from an angle that found the top corner.











            New signing Gonzalo Escalante equalized for Cadiz at San Mames Stadium in the 25th.

            But Sancet struck again 10 minutes later by firing in a pass by Raúl García after Cadiz gave up the ball near its area while under pressure. Defender Yeray Álvarez headed in a free kick to add to the lead just before halftime.

            Despite losing Berchiche, Bilbao hit on the break in the 75th. García booted a long ball forward, Iñaki Williams nicely headed it onto the path of Sancet, and the forward fired home for his third goal of the evening.

            “I can’t explain how this feels,” Sancet said while he was soaking up applause from more than 40,000 Bilbao supporters. “All my thanks to our fans for the support they are showing. I am happy that my goals helped the team get the win.”

            Sancet leads Bilbao with seven goals, all in the league. He scored his other hat trick in January 2022 in a 3-1 win at Osasuna.

            Ernesto Valverde’s Bilbao, which has advanced to the Copa del Rey semifinals, moved into seventh place in the league standings after ending a run of three losses in the competition.

            Cadiz remained in the relegation zone.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799919,Man admits seeking to have his child porn victim killed,"CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey man who exchanged sexually explicit videos and images with a 13-year-old New York girl has admitted paying $20,000 in bitcoin to have the child victim murdered before eventually calling it off.

            John Michael Musbach, 31, of Haddonfield, pleaded guilty Thursday to using interstate commerce facilities in the commission of a murder-for-hire plot, according to federal prosecutors. He now faces up to 10 years in prison when he's sentenced June 13.

            Musbach began communicating online with the victim in the summer of 2015. Musbach eventually began using those chats to request and receive sexually explicit videos and photographs of the girl and to send her similar videos and images of himself, but the girl’s parents discovered the nature of the chats and notified local law enforcement officers in New York state, where they lived. 











            He was arrested on child pornography charges in March 2016 and eventually pleaded guilty to child endangerment in October 2017. He received a two-year suspended prison sentence and was placed on lifetime parole.

            In May 2016, Musbach started communicating with the administrator of a murder-for-hire site on the dark web, while his criminal case was pending, officials have said. After asking if the girl was too young to target and being told the age wasn’t a problem, prosecutors said Musbach paid approximately $20,000 in bitcoin for the hit. 

            When pressed for an additional $5,000 to secure the hit, Musbach eventually sought to cancel and asked for a refund of his $20,000. The website’s administrator then revealed that the site was a scam and threatened to reveal Musbach’s information to law enforcement.

            Federal prosecutors didn’t specify Thursday how the plot was uncovered. But during his indictment in 2020, prosecutors said an informant gave the Department of Homeland Security messages between Musbach and the fake website for contract killings.CAMDEN, N.J.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799921,AP source: Alabama hiring Notre Dame OC Tommy Rees,"Alabama is hiring Notre Dame assistant coach Tommy Rees to be its offensive coordinator, a person with direct knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Friday.

            The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was being finalized and still needed university approval.

            The South Bend Tribune was first to report Rees was leaving his alma mater to join coach Nick Saban’s Crimson Tide.











            Rees interviewed with Saban earlier in the week and then visited Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on Thursday.

            The 30-year-old Rees is replacing Bill O'Brien, who left to take the offensive coordinator position with the Patriots. The former Houston Texans coach was an assistant with New England before becoming Penn State's head coach in 2012.

            Alabama offensive coordinator has been a launching pad position in recent years. Mississippi coach Lane Kiffin, Maryland coach Mike Locksley and Texas coach Steve Sarkisian have all served as Saban’s OC, along with Giants coach Brian Daboll.

            Daboll returned to the NFL as an offensive coordinator after his one season in Tuscaloosa and then landed his first head coaching job last year.

            Rees, a former Notre Dame quarterback, has been an assistant there since 2017 and offensive coordinator since 2020. He also spent a year with the San Diego Chargers in 2016 before returning to South Bend, Indiana. 

            Rees was wooed by Brian Kelly when he left Notre Dame for LSU, and by Miami last year, but decided to stay and work for first-year coach Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame finished 9-4 last season.

            Notre Dame’s offense has been solid statistically under Rees, ranking 45th (last season), 43rd (2021) and 39th (2020) nationally in yards per play.

            Alabama will be breaking in a new starting quarterback next season after Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young declared for the NFL draft.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799922,"MATCHDAY: Everton hosts Arsenal, Newcastle welcomes West Ham","A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Saturday:

            ENGLAND

            Everton and new manager Sean Dyche host Premier League leader Arsenal in the first of seven league games. Everton is second from last and turned to the former Burnley boss to get it out of the relegation zone. Arsenal wants to put more distance between itself and second-placed Manchester City. The Gunners lead by five points. Behind them is Newcastle, which hosts West Ham in the nightcap. Crystal Palace visits Old Trafford with fourth-placed Manchester United looking to bolster its Champions League prospects. Liverpool travels to Wolverhampton as Jurgen Klopp's mid-table team tries to revive top-four hopes. Sixth-placed Brighton hosts struggler Bournemouth. Last-placed Southampton is at Brentford, and Aston Villa hosts Leicester.











            SPAIN

            Atlético Madrid hosts Getafe aiming for a third win in a row in the league for the first time since October. A victory would lift Diego Simeone’s fourth-placed side to within two points of Real Sociedad in third. Quique Sánchez Flores is under pressure after Getafe has fallen into the relegation zone following four consecutive losses. Villarreal and Real Betis are on the heels of Atletico at just three points back as they joust for a top-four finish and a Champions League berth. Villarreal visits last-placed Elche, which is still winless after 19 rounds. Betis has just one win in its last five games overall before it hosts Celta Vigo. Osasuna will also visit an Espanyol that has reinforced its squad during the winter market.

            ITALY

            Cremonese will be looking to repeat its cup exploits in the league to give itself hope of avoiding relegation. Cremonese is on the bottom of Serie A and without a win but it has seen off Napoli and Roma in the Italian Cup to reach the semifinals for the first time in 36 years. It is 10 points from safety and needs a win at home to Lecce, which is only seven points above the bottom three. Roma will be looking to bounce back from its midweek cup defeat when it hosts Empoli as the capital side looks to move into the top four. Roma is sixth but just three points below second-placed Inter Milan and one behind Lazio, Atalanta and AC Milan. Atalanta visits relegation-threatened Sassuolo, which will be full of confidence after a surprising 5-2 victory at Milan last weekend.

            FRANCE

            League leader Paris Saint-Germain is without injured star forwards Kylian Mbappé and Neymar for the home game against Toulouse. Mbappé is out for at least three weeks after sustaining a left thigh tear in a match on Wednesday. Neymar is having treatment for a sore adductor and misses his second straight game. Elsewhere, fifth-placed Rennes is at home to sixth-placed Lille and Lyon needs to find form as it travels to play lowly Troyes.

            GERMANY

            Union Berlin and Leipzig have a chance to move into first place — for a day anyway — in the Bundesliga. Second-placed Union trails league leader Bayern Munich by one point and hosts mid-table Mainz. Leipzig is a further point behind and takes an 11-match unbeaten league run to Cologne. Bayern doesn’t play until Sunday. Borussia Dortmund hosts Freiburg with both clubs three points back of Bayern but trailing by wide margins on goal difference. Eintracht Frankfurt hosts struggler Hertha Berlin, and Hoffenheim travels to Bochum.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799924,Bucks have regained peak form now that they're healthier,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo is scoring at an unprecedented rate in his extraordinary career, and he also has most of his top teammates playing alongside him again.

            That combination has helped the Milwaukee Bucks regain their title-contending form.

            The Bucks have won six straight and will try to complete a four-game homestand unbeaten Saturday against the Miami Heat. Antetokounmpo has scored at least 50 points in two of his last three games, including a 54-point performance Thursday as the Bucks rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 106-105.











            “Have I ever had 50 and lost the game? Yeah, I have,” said Antetokounmpo, indirectly referring to a 2019 game in which he scored 52 points, but the Bucks lost to Philadelphia. “You can have 50 and still lose the game. At the end of the day, you’ve just got to win the game. I’d rather have 22 and win the game. It’s all about winning.”

            The Bucks are doing plenty of that.

            Milwaukee has gone 6-0 since Khris Middleton came back from a sore right knee, though the Bucks remain two games behind the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference standings. 

            
                The Bucks’ three biggest stars – Antetokounmpo, Middleton and Jrue Holiday – played together in just five of Milwaukee’s first 45 games. Middleton missed the Bucks’ first 20 games while recovering from offseason wrist surgery, returned to play in seven games, then missed 18 more due to his knee issue.

            That resulted in some disjointed play from the Bucks earlier this season. They won their first nine games, but went 20-17 over their next 37 contests. 

            Middleton has been coming off the bench since his return, so he hasn’t spent much time on the floor with Antetokounmpo and Holiday. Even so, the difference has been apparent.

            The Bucks hadn’t scored as many as 135 points in any non-overtime game this season before Middleton came back on Jan. 23. Their winning streak includes a 150-130 victory at Detroit, a 141-131 triumph at Indiana and a 135-110 win over New Orleans.

            “We opened things up a bit more offensively for us in transition, just to play quicker and things like that,” Bucks center Brook Lopez said. “It’s been good for us.”

            The Bucks still aren’t at full strength. Bobby Portis, who is averaging 14.4 points and 10.1 rebounds, sprained his right ankle and the medial collateral ligament in his right knee at Detroit on Jan. 23. 

            In their first game without Portis, the Bucks beat the Denver Nuggets 107-99 despite getting outrebounded 51-49. But they have outrebounded their last four opponents by an average margin of 9.8 boards.

            The Bucks already had been playing quality defense for much of the season. 

            
                They rank second in the league in defensive rating, third in field goal percentage defense and fifth in scoring defense. The Bucks beat the Clippers, in part, because Holiday and Wesley Matthews led a perimeter defense that caused Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to shoot a combined 2 of 13 in the fourth quarter.

            Holiday’s an elite defender who also emerged as a go-to scorer when Antetokounmpo missed five games last month with a sore left knee. He’s heading to the All-Star Game for the first time since 2013, which represents the longest gap between All-Star selections by an individual in league history. 

            “While both Khris and Giannis were out, he carried us there for a while,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said.

            Now, it’s Antetokounmpo once again filling that role.

            Antetokounmpo’s three 50-point performances over his last 11 games matched his previous regular-season career total. He has averaged 40.2 points and 14 rebounds and has shot 59.5% during the Bucks’ current winning streak.

            “It’s been impressive, his kind of competitive fire, his attack mode, getting to the free-throw line, mixing in some made jumpers, mixing in some made 3’s,” Budenholzer said. “He’s just doing a little bit of everything.”

            With Antetokounmpo at the peak of his powers, Holiday performing at an All-Star level and Middleton working his way back into peak form, the Bucks once again are showing they can play as well as anyone in the league.

            “They’re getting their guys back and they’re getting healthier and you can tell they have an urgency to get going,” Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford said after his team’s 124-115 loss at Milwaukee on Tuesday. “I saw that in the Indiana game and the New Orleans game. Obviously they’ll be right there.”

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsMILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo is scoring at an unprecedented rate in his extraordinary career, and he also has most of his top teammates playing alongside him again.That combination has helped the Milwaukee Bucks regain their title-contending form.The Bucks have won six straight and will try to complete a four-game homestand unbeaten Saturday against the Miami Heat. Antetokounmpo has scored at least 50 points in two of his last three games, including a 54-point performance Thursday as the Bucks rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 106-105.“Have I ever had 50 and lost the game? Yeah, I have,” said Antetokounmpo, indirectly referring to a 2019 game in which he scored 52 points, but the Bucks lost to Philadelphia. “You can have 50 and still lose the game. At the end of the day, you’ve just got to win the game. I’d rather have 22 and win the game. It’s all about winning.”The Bucks are doing plenty of that.Milwaukee has gone 6-0 since Khris Middleton came back from a sore right knee, though the Bucks remain two games behind the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference standings.The Bucks’ three biggest stars – Antetokounmpo, Middleton and Jrue Holiday – played together in just five of Milwaukee’s first 45 games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799925,Ex-prosecutor's new book details fight over indicting Trump,"NEW YORK (AP) — As the Manhattan district attorney's office ramps up its yearslong investigation of Donald Trump, a new book by a former prosecutor details just how close the former president came to getting indicted — and laments friction with the new D.A. that put that plan on ice.

            Mark Pomerantz, who oversaw the investigation until early last year, writes in “People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account” that then-District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. authorized him in December 2021 to seek Trump's indictment.

            After scouring Trump's life and business, Pomerantz writes that prosecutors agreed on a case involving allegations that Trump falsified records by inflating the value of assets on financial statements he provided lenders.











            Vance was leaving office within weeks, but he expressed confidence that his successor, Alvin Bragg, would agree with his assessment, Pomerantz writes. But Bragg and his team had other ideas — expressing trepidation about the strength of evidence and the credibility of a key witness.

            They decided not to proceed, at least not with the speed Pomerantz and co-lead prosecutor Carey Dunne wanted. Pomerantz writes. The stagnation compelled both men to leave the office.

            “Once again, Donald Trump had managed to dance between the raindrops of accountability,"" Pomerantz writes in the book, which is set to be published Tuesday by Simon & Schuster.

            The Associated Press and other news outlets received copies of the book Friday.

            Trump has threatened legal action against Pomerantz and Simon & Schuster for what he contends are “defamatory statements” and “groundless falsehoods” about his alleged criminal conduct.

            Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said the New York investigations are attempts by Democrats to keep him out of the White House.

            In a post to his Trump Social platform, Trump said Pomerantz's book “is turning out to be a hit on the District Attorney and the ‘weak’ case ‘with many fatal flaws.’”

            Pomerantz’s 304-page volume weaves his behind-the-scenes account of the spirited battle over whether to charge Trump with anecdotes from his decades-long career as a mafia prosecutor and white-collar litigator. Those experiences contrast with Bragg's work as a former federal prosecutor, law professor and, in the years prior to his election, pursuing civil cases against Trump as a top official in the state attorney general's office. 

            The book also works to temper the drama surrounding Pomerantz’s split from Bragg, which spilled into the public last year when his resignation letter appeared in The New York Times.

            Pomerantz portrays the dispute not as a brawl, but as a legitimate difference of opinion shaped by lengthy Zoom calls and telephone conversations. During the sessions, Pomerantz writes that he and Dunne would detail the pros and cons of pursuing a Trump indictment, while Bragg or members of his team pushed back with questions and concerns. 

            At first, Pomerantz writes, Bragg seemed overwhelmed by other matters — managing the massive D.A.'s office and dealing with blowback from his approach to prosecuting certain crimes. He writes that Bragg showed up late to an initial meeting where he laid out the case and that Bragg ended up looking at his phone most of the time. The D.A. was more attentive at subsequent sessions, Pomerantz said.

            At one point, he writes, Bragg said that he “could not see a world” in which he would indict Trump and call Trump's long-estranged former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen as a witness.

            Cohen, who claims to have intimate knowledge of Trump's financial dealings, was convicted in a parallel federal case of lying to Congress.

            Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, said in a statement Friday: “We were treated respectfully and professionally by Mr. Mark Pomerantz and his team. We appreciated their integrity and hard work. Despite the denied allegations concerning Mr. Cohen’s credibility, I can confirm that Mr. Cohen will continue to cooperate with DA Bragg and his team, speaking truth to power -- as he has always done.”

            Aside from a few blunt emails he wrote criticizing Bragg's deliberateness, Pomerantz said his rift with the D.A. was civil.

            ""There was never any yelling or screaming,"" he writes of their final conversation in February 2022. He defended Bragg against people suggesting he had an ulterior motive not to indict, saying that they ""had no clue about how these prosecutorial decisions are made or were bloodthirsty for some action against Trump,"" Pomerantz writes.

            Bragg’s office sought last month to delay the book's publication, saying in a letter to Pomerantz and Simon & Schuster that he was violating a confidentiality agreement he signed upon joining the D.A.'s office and that the book could “materially prejudice"" the investigation. Pomerantz said nothing in the book jeopardizes the probe. Simon & Schuster said it will release the book as scheduled.

            In a statement Friday, Bragg said he hasn't read the book, and “won’t comment on any ongoing investigation because of the harm it could cause to the case.” He defended his decision to refrain from charging Trump. 

            “After closely reviewing all the evidence from Mr. Pomerantz’s investigation, I came to the same conclusion as several senior prosecutors involved in the case, and also those I brought on: more work was needed. Put another way, Mr. Pomerantz’s plane wasn’t ready for takeoff,"" Bragg said. “Our skilled and professional legal team continues to follow the facts of this case wherever they may lead, without fear or favor. Mr. Pomerantz decided to quit a year ago and sign a book deal.""

            The District Attorneys Association of the State of New York also expressed concerns, writing in a statement Friday that it was “unfortunate and unprecedented” for a former prosecutor to speak out during an ongoing investigation.

            Pomerantz joined the D.A.'s office in 2021 as a special assistant district attorney to lead the Trump probe. He writes that early in his involvement they weighed charging Trump and his company under the state's version of the federal racketeering law, given the array of tax, fraud and other potential crimes they were investigating.

            Pomerantz likened Trump's cunning, charisma and ability to “stay one step ahead of the law” to that of late Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, whose son, John A. Gotti, he prosecuted while an assistant U.S. attorney.

            When he arrived at the D.A.'s office, Pomerantz writes, the investigation was so broad “it seemed unfocused and sprawling.”

            In 2021, Pomerantz's team charged Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, and its longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, with evading taxes on fringe benefits given to company executives, but it was Bragg and his team who saw the cases through, securing Weisselberg's guilty plea in August and the Trump Organization's conviction in December. Weisselberg is serving a five-month jail sentence and the company was fined $1.6 million.

            Under Bragg's direction, the district attorney's office recently returned to a part of the investigation that had long-ago stalled: payments made to two women on Trump's behalf in 2016 to keep them quiet about alleged affairs.

            Pomerantz portrays the hush-money payments — made or arranged by Cohen — as perhaps the most challenging, legally fraught of the potential cases against Trump.

            He writes that while a case could be made that Trump falsified business records by logging Cohen’s reimbursement for one of the payoffs as legal fees, he could only be charged with a misdemeanor under New York law — unless prosecutors could prove he falsified records to conceal another crime.

            Vance abandoned the hush-money angle in 2019, pivoting the investigation’s focus to other matters, but Pomerantz said he revisited it when he joined the office in January 2021, looking for a way to make more serious felony charges stick. He considered whether Trump could be charged with money laundering and explored if one of the women who got money, Stormy Daniels, had demanded payment to remain quiet, thereby extorting him.

            Pomerantz said the hush-money matter became known around the office as the “zombie” case.

            Still, Pomerantz wrote, “Over the months that I and others worked on the case, we developed evidence convincing us that Donald Trump had committed serious crimes,"" Pomerantz writes.

            Even if a conviction wasn't a certainty, Pomerantz said he thought they owed it the public to bring the case to trial. 

            “Losing it would be better than not even trying,” he wrote.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799931,Fernandez debut fizzles as Chelsea held by Fulham to 0-0,"LONDON (AP) — Enzo Fernandez's debut for Chelsea fizzled out as Fulham earned a worthy 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge in the English Premier League on Friday.

            Fernandez, the most expensive player in British soccer history, was largely kept subdued. Chelsea was left stranded in ninth and its indifferent form was extended to one win in six in the league.

            Fulham proved it was not necessary to spend 315 million pounds ($380 million) in the January transfer window to sit in the upper reaches of the top-flight. Marco Silva's well-drilled team made the host look toothless at times at the end of a week in which it spent 106.5 million pounds to land World Cup winner Fernandez.











            Chelsea hit the post on halftime. Hakim Ziyech, fresh from his failed move to Paris Saint-Germain on transfer deadline day, clipped a searching ball in behind Fulham for Kai Havertz to run onto, but the makeshift No. 9 saw his lobbed effort drift over Bernd Leno and back off the post.

            The second half continued in a vein in which Fulham more than held its own against the host's expensive assemble.

            Fernandez had his moment 20 minutes from the end when he whipped a spectacular first-time effort shot beyond Leno’s dive and fractionally past the post. The crowd rallied, and Chelsea started to take control.

            Substitute David Fofana came closest to winning it for Chelsea, going through one-on-one against Leno before slipping beyond the goalkeeper and seeing his effort cleared off the line by the covering Tim Ream.

            ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLONDON (AP) — Enzo Fernandez's debut for Chelsea fizzled out as Fulham earned a worthy 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge in the English Premier League on Friday.Fernandez, the most expensive player in British soccer history, was largely kept subdued. Chelsea was left stranded in ninth and its indifferent form was extended to one win in six in the league.Fulham proved it was not necessary to spend 315 million pounds ($380 million) in the January transfer window to sit in the upper reaches of the top-flight. Marco Silva's well-drilled team made the host look toothless at times at the end of a week in which it spent 106.5 million pounds to land World Cup winner Fernandez.Chelsea hit the post on halftime. Hakim Ziyech, fresh from his failed move to Paris Saint-Germain on transfer deadline day, clipped a searching ball in behind Fulham for Kai Havertz to run onto, but the makeshift No. 9 saw his lobbed effort drift over Bernd Leno and back off the post.The second half continued in a vein in which Fulham more than held its own against the host's expensive assemble.Fernandez had his moment 20 minutes from the end when he whipped a spectacular first-time effort shot beyond Leno’s dive and fractionally past the post. The crowd rallied, and Chelsea started to take control.Substitute David Fofana came closest to winning it for Chelsea, going through one-on-one against Leno before slipping beyond the goalkeeper and seeing his effort cleared off the line by the covering Tim Ream.___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/04,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799935,Caddie for amateur at Pebble Beach collapses during tourney,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — The caddie for an amateur in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am collapsed on the 11th fairway Friday, and CPR was performed on him until an ambulance arrived to take him to the hospital.

            In a tournament known for its easy vibe with celebrities and scenery, the final three hours at Pebble Beach took on a somber tone, particularly those on and around the 11th hole when the caddie fell over.

            The PGA Tour did not release his name. Early reports were the caddie's condition was improving. He was working for Pebble Beach businessman Geoff Couch, who did not return to finish the round.











            “I turn around and he's on the ground and I ran over to him and turned him over,” said country singer Lukas Nelson, the other amateur in the group. “And he didn't have a lot of color in him. Luckily, there was a police officer on the sideline. He knew CPR so he came in and effectively saved his life.”

            Gary Young, the PGA Tour's chief referee, said a spectator began the CPR and an officer from Cal Fire took over from there.

            PGA Tour players Beau Hossler and Max McGreevy, after consultation with PGA Tour officials, chose not to speak to reporters out of respect to the caddie's family.

            “It was especially jarring, the weirdest thing that can happen on a golf course,” Nelson said. “The good news is he's at the moment doing better. From my perspective, it seemed like we lost him. And he's still with us, so that's important.”

            After consulting with a PGA Tour rules official, Hossler and McGreevy marked their golf balls on the 11th hole and returned to the clubhouse. They were able to warm up and returned to the 11th hole after every group had come through to finish the round.

            Harry Higgs was playing two groups behind and saw it all unfold. It brought back memories of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who suffered a cardiac arrest during a Monday Night Football game against Cincinnati and had to be resuscitated on the field.

            “It had some shades of that,” Higgs said. “I was standing on the tee. They looked like they were 250 yards away, maybe even less, and they were hammering away CPR on the gentleman. It was weird.”

            The groups behind, which included retired All-Pro receiver Larry Fitzgerald, played through as the tour figured out what the players wanted to do.

            “We teed off on 11 and once I got up there and saw the group that the caddie was in, they were off to the side and they were obviously very emotional, hugging each other,” Higgs said. “I called a rules official over and just wanted to like, ‘Is this OK? I don’t want to be rude and keep going.’ It’s like golf doesn’t matter at all now, right?”

            Nelson wasn't sure he wanted to return, a feeling shared by others, except for getting good reports on the caddie's improved condition.

            “I think everybody on property knew what had happened and everybody was flat,” Higgs said. “There was no energy, no juice on any of the holes coming in. ... Fortunately, we got some good news and kept going. I hope there’s more good news in the coming hours and days. Just very difficult and kind of a first — hopefully, a last.""

            Two years, caddie Alberto Olguin collapsed on the ninth tee during a PGA Tour Latinoamerica event and died an hour later at a hosptial in Mexico.

            In 2016, the first round of a Ladies European Tour event in Dubai was suspended when caddie Max Zechmann collapsed on the 13th fairway and died at a nearby hospital.

            At the 2014 Madeira Island Open on the European Tour, caddie Ian MacGregor collapsed and died on the ninth hole while working for Alastair Forsyth. The tournament continued when Forsyth said that's what his caddie would have wanted. One player, Peter Lawrie, withdrew out of respect.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799936,Husband and wife get decade in prison for terror support,"NEW YORK (AP) — A husband-wife militant duo will spend about a decade in prison after each of them pleaded guilty to trying to provide material support to a terrorist organization.

            Prosecutors say the man told a law enforcement officer posing as a terrorism sympathizer that he wanted to carry out a terror attack in the United States. Potential targets included the U.S. Military Academy at West Point or against a university in New York State where he frequently saw Reserve Officer Training Corps or ROTC cadets training.

            James Bradley, 21, of the Bronx was sentenced to 11 years in prison Thursday in a federal court in Manhattan. His wife, Arwa Muthana, 30, of Hoover, Alabama, was sentenced Friday to nine years in prison during proceedings before Judge Paul A. Engelmayer.











            The sentencings came after they pleaded guilty in September, admitting that they were Islamic State group supporters who tried to go to the Middle East to fight for the organization. They were married in an Islamic marriage ceremony in January 2021, authorities said.

            The couple was arrested on March 31, 2021, on the gangplank at Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey and held without bail. At the time, authorities said they were planning to board a cargo ship that an undercover law enforcement officer told them would go to Yemen.

            Bradley sought transit to the Middle East by cargo ship because he feared he might have been on a terrorist watch list, prosecutors said.

            Authorities said that prior to their arrest, the couple distributed extremist online content, including images of IS fighters, Osama bin Laden and terrorist attacks.

            After Muthana was arrested, she told investigators that she was willing to fight and kill Americans if it was for God, prosecutors said.

            Her lawyers had asked Engelmayer to sentence her to time served, saying she was a woman with “no passport, little money and no real plan.” They said her actions were the result of an “abused and traumatized young woman who was trying to get as far away from home as possible.”

            Bradley's lawyers also sought a sentence of time served.

            Prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence each of them to at least 15 years in prison, saying it was necessary “to deter and prevent the defendants from resuming their activities in support of radical Islamic terrorist ideology, and to deter others who, like the defendants, seek to join and serve brutal terrorist organizations.”

            The U.S. Probation Office had recommended that each serve six years in prison. The office cited Bradley's age, his family support and his engagement in deradicalization counseling.NEW YORK (AP) — A husband-wife militant duo will spend about a decade in prison after each of them pleaded guilty to trying to provide material support to a terrorist organization.Prosecutors say the man told a law enforcement officer posing as a terrorism sympathizer that he wanted to carry out a terror attack in the United States.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799939,Baffert: 2-year Churchill Downs suspension hurt reputation,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Churchill Downs never gave advance notice nor reached out to explain its two-year suspension, Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert said Friday in federal court, and reiterated that the penalty has caused irreparable harm to his business and reputation.

            Baffert has sued the historic track and is seeking a temporary injunction to stop his suspension following a failed drug test by the now-deceased Medina Spirit after the colt came in first in the 2021 Kentucky Derby. 

            The suspension for a series of failed tests by his horses runs through the end of the upcoming spring meet and could exclude Baffert from the Derby for a second consecutive spring.











            Almost a year ago, Kentucky racing officials disqualified Medina Spirit and suspended Baffert for 90 days for those failed tests. Churchill Downs elevated Derby runner-up Mandaloun to winner.

            “They’ve hurt my reputation,” Baffert said during nearly two hours of testimony in U.S. District Court. “My horses should’ve made much more money. I didn’t run for 90 days, and I had to let people go.”

            Churchill Downs wants the case dismissed, citing nine failed tests by Baffert-trained horses as justification for disciplining horse racing's most visible figure. The list of violators includes 2020 Kentucky Oaks third-place finisher Gamine, who was ultimately disqualified.

            Medina Spirit failed his test for having in his system the corticosteroid betamethasone, which Baffert and attorney Clark Brewster have argued came from an ointment rather than an injection. 

            Track president Mike Anderson said the decision by Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen stemmed from Baffert’s “refusal to take responsibility for repeat violations” during a news conference at his backside barn after Medina Spirit's failed test was revealed.

            “We wanted to make a statement that this was a consequence of not doing the right thing,” Anderson said.

            Attorneys Matt Benjamin and Christine Demana, who are representing Churchill Downs, also disputed Baffert’s contention that business has suffered by noting his latest crop of promising 3-year-old colts on this year's Derby trail.

            One of them, Arabian Knight, won last week’s Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn by 5½ lengths to give Baffert his record sixth win in the race. The horse is ineligible to earn Kentucky Derby qualifying points as the winner because of Baffert's suspension.

            A slide presented also showed that Baffert horses made 477 starts from May 10, 2021, through December 2022 and won marquee races such as the 2021 Breeders' Cup Juvenile (Corniche, the Eclipse winner) along with Grade 1 wins in the Pennsylvania Derby and Malibu Stakes (Taiba).

            Friday's 3 1/2-hour hearing followed four hours of testimony on Thursday. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings gave no indication when she would rule. But Brewster said he expects a decision “within several days.”

            Baffert testified that he had had a good relationship with Churchill Downs, though he noted that he was paying for his seats at the track and having to “grovel” to get them. He also insisted that he tried to be a good ambassador for horse racing, especially after American Pharoah and Justify won the Triple Crown in 2015 and 2018, respectively. 

            “I think today was great because I finally got to tell my story in a nonbiased atmosphere,"" he said. ""I hope for the best, and hopefully we’ll be here.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799940,Sudan demands United Nations immediately lift arms embargo,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Sudan is demanding the U.N. Security Council immediately lift an arms embargo and other sanctions imposed during violence in the western Darfur region in 2005, saying the punishment did not include conditions or require the military government to meet U.N. benchmarks.

            Sudan’s U.N. ambassador, Al-Harith Idriss Mohamed, said in a letter to the council circulated Friday that the sanctions “are no longer relevant to the magnificent reality on the ground in Darfur today compared to the situation in 2005.” 

            “Darfur has, for the most part, overcome the state of war, as well as previous security and political challenges,” he said.











            Mohamed said Sudan’s transitional government is committed to addressing the remaining social and security issues in Darfur, including sporadic tribal clashes. He added that efforts are being made to form and deploy a Joint Security-Keeping Force to protect civilians.

            The Sudanese government has repeatedly urged the Security Council to lift sanctions but this letter was much stronger. It said that “Sudan will accept nothing less than the immediate lifting of these sanctions without conditions or benchmarks.”

            The Darfur conflict began in 2003 when rebels took up arms against the authoritarian government in Khartoum then led by Omar al-Bashir, accusing it of discrimination and neglect. The U.N. previously estimated 00,000 people died in the conflict and 2.7 million fled their homes. 

            Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged atrocities in Darfur. The court issued an arrest warrant for him in 2009 for crimes against humanity and war crimes and added genocide to the charges in 2010. 

            In April 2019, Al-Bashir was ousted after three decades in power. He is incarcerated in Khartoum, where he is facing corruption charges and charges related to the overthrow of the former elected government.

            In October 2021, Sudan was plunged into turmoil following a coup led by the country's leading military figure, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, that derailed the short-run democratic transition following al-Bashir’s ouster.

            Sudan's ambassador told the Security Council that the contined sanctions have had “a detrimental impact and negative consequences that extend beyond the arms embargo in Darfur and the targeted sanctions on some individuals,” including asset freezes and travel bans. 

            Sanctions discourage investors and “encourage the rogue armed transboundary bands to disrupt peace and order in Darfur, owing to the imbalance of hard power,” Mohamed said. Lifting sanctions would enable Sudan “to further play an active regional role,” he said.

            In July 2021, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recommended four benchmarks to guide the Security Council in reviewing sanctions: progress on political and economic governance issues; transitional security arrangements in Darfur; the National Plan for Civilian Protection; and transitional justice and accountability.

            Mohamed said some of the benchmarks and targets “are completely unrealistic and cannot be met, neither in the Sudan nor elsewhere in the majority of developing nations.” He not not single out any of the benchmarks.

            The ambassador aslo accused some council members of refraining from engaging with Sudan's government “to achieve realistic, applicable and measurable benchmarks.”UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Sudan is demanding the U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799941,Detainee's death adds to scrutiny of South Carolina jail,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A detainee's body was found dead about 18 hours after five men beat him in a South Carolina jail where the sheriff said many cell doors don't lock — the latest troubling incident in a detention center described as a “death trap” by the lawyer for a different man found dead last year with fresh rat bites on his body.

            Five other detainees have been charged with the murder after officers found Antonius Randolph dead in a pool of blood on the afternoon of Jan. 27. The 29-year-old accused serial rapist's death at Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center comes after several federal lawsuits, a troubling audit and a hiring scandal that have left the interim director promising what the Post and Courier reported as “a series of sweeping changes.”

            The incident — six days after Randolph's arrest on charges of sexual assault and robbery — has added to mounting concerns over the conditions at the jail in South Carolina’s capital city.











            The most recent South Carolina Department of Corrections audit found over a dozen violations of state standards at the embattled facility. According to the annual report for 2022, the jail is beset by overcrowded housing units, inadequate staffing and lagging pest control. The audit revealed that some detainees were kept in fire-damaged cells, while another handicapped person was housed in a cell that was noncompliant with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Some cells reportedly had malfunctioning locks in need of repair.

            Indeed, an investigation into Randolph’s death also found that many cell doors do not lock, Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said at a Friday news conference. Richland County Coroner Naida Rutherford told reporters that Randolph would not have recovered had he been found earlier. Neither official would share details surrounding what Lott called a “very brutal"" attack by five other detainees.

            ""It’s an outrageous example of the failure of the jail administrators to protect individuals within their care,” Burnette Shutt & McDaniel attorney Stuart Andrews said of the latest death. Andrews represents Disability Rights South Carolina in a federal lawsuit filed in April that alleged detainees with disabilities were held in unsafe and unsanitary cells for up to 24 hours a day.

            The Richland County Sheriff's Department said the investigation is ongoing and more charges are expected. In a statement Friday, Richland County committed to prosecuting all involved parties “to the fullest extent of law.” The press release said unlocked cell doors are not a practice of the detention center but the result of detainees' criminal activity. The county said it is committed to improving the facility.

            “A loss of life in this manner is not only disheartening but alarming, and we continue to express our deepest sympathy to the family of Mr. Randolph,” the statement said.

            Three people have died in the correctional facility’s custody over the past 12 months. 

            A separate federal lawsuit filed this past summer alleged deliberate indifference in the death of Lason Butler. Officials found the 27-year-old man dead on Feb. 12, 2022, with fresh rat bites and no running water, according to the lawsuit. The Richland County coroner ruled the death a homicide and noted a “lack of action” by the jail staff. 

            Butler lost more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms) over a two-week period spent in a room where he frequently lay naked and was placed on suicide watch despite officials’ knowledge that the unit was unfit to serve people with mental health issues, according to the lawsuit. Police had arrested Butler last January for reckless driving, failure to stop for blue lights and a suspended license.

            In the wake of Randolph's death, Butler's lawyers called for a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center. In a Friday press release, attorney Bakari Sellers called the facility a “death trap.”

            Attorneys with the Columbia-based Strom Law Firm also referenced a series of January TikTok videos reported by the Post and Courier that claim to show unsanitary conditions like clogged toilets and undercooked food inside the center.

            The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control gave the jail a “C” food grade in January after an inspection revealed meat cooked to poor temperatures, food stored on the floor and dishes kept outside. A Feb. 1 follow-up inspection resulted in an “A” rating.

            The jail has been without a permanent leader since its director, Tyrell Cato, was fired in September after The State reported he had lost his previous job over accusations of sexual harassment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799942,Mexican actor Pablo Lyle gets prison for road rage death,"MIAMI (AP) — Mexican actor Pablo Lyle was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for involuntary manslaughter after fatally punching a man during a road rage confrontation in Miami in 2019.

            The sentence came almost four years after Lyle was charged with murder in the death of a man he struck during a traffic incident. 

            Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez announced the sentence two months after rejecting the actor's request for a new trial and upholding the guilty verdict reached by a jury in October.











            The 36-year-old Mexican telenovela star, who appeared in the Netflix crime series “Yankee,” had faced a maximum sentence of up to 15 years in prison. The judge also ordered eight years of probation, conflict resolution management and 500 hours of community service for the actor. 

            The actor has 30 days to appeal the sentence. 

            Dressed in a red jail uniform, Lyle looked calm and expressed repentance during the more than three-hour hearing. He has been detained since his Oct. 4 conviction.

            “I am very sorry,” Lyle said in Spanish, looking at some of the members of Hernández family who were in the court room, among them his son. “I always pray for him and for you, with all my heart.”

            After a week-long trial, a six-member jury convicted Lyle of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Juan Ricardo Hernández, 63. 

            Hernández, who was unarmed, suffered a traumatic brain injury and died four days later while hospitalized.

            Lyle's lawyers argued that he acted in self-defense. They also said that there were inconsistencies in the evidence during the trial. 

            When handing down her sentence, the judge, however, said that Lyle made a “poor decision” and acted “out of anger.”

            “The evidence shows that the action of Mr. Lyle was an act of violence,” Tinkler said. “Mr. Lyle has to be held responsible for those actions.” 

            The road confrontation was captured by security cameras.

            Lyle’s brother-in-law was taking the actor, his wife and two children to the airport. Their car passed that of Hernández, who stopped at a red light, got out and approached the driver's window of Lyle’s vehicle to claim that they had blocked his way.

            According to security video footage, Lyle and Hernández got into an argument, and the actor punched Hernández in the face. Lyle claimed he was defending himself. He said that his children were terrified and that he feared Hernández had a weapon.

            At the hearing, Lyle's wife, his brother-in-law and his sister offered testimony before the judge made her decision public.

            On Hernández’s side, his son described him as a very happy, attentive person, with good health and principles. Juan Ricardo Hernández Jr. asked the judge to sentence Lyle to the maximum of 15 years. 

            He said that the day before the altercation, he had been with his father.

            “I didn’t want to believe it was him,” Hernández’s son said of going to the hospital to see his father after receiving news of the incident.MIAMI (AP) — Mexican actor Pablo Lyle was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for involuntary manslaughter after fatally punching a man during a road rage confrontation in Miami in 2019.The sentence came almost four years after Lyle was charged with murder in the death of a man he struck during a traffic incident.Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez announced the sentence two months after rejecting the actor's request for a new trial and upholding the guilty verdict reached by a jury in October.The 36-year-old Mexican telenovela star, who appeared in the Netflix crime series “Yankee,” had faced a maximum sentence of up to 15 years in prison.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799948,Man rescued by Coast Guard wanted in 'Goonies' fish incident,"SEATTLE (AP) — A man who was saved by a Coast Guard rescue swimmer at the mouth of the Columbia River as a massive wave rolled the yacht he was piloting Friday was wanted for a bizarre incident in which police said he left a dead fish at the Astoria, Oregon, home featured in the classic 1985 film, “The Goonies.”

            Officers had been looking for the man since Wednesday, when an acquaintance alerted them to a video he posted on social media of himself leaving the fish at the house and then dancing around the property, Astoria Police Chief Stacy Kelly said.

            Kelly identified the man as Jericho Labonte, 35, of Victoria, British Columbia. Labonte is also wanted in British Columbia on criminal harassment, mischief and failure to comply cases from last fall, Kelly said.











            Early Friday afternoon, the Coast Guard shared stunning video of a rescue made a few hours earlier in which a newly minted rescue swimmer lowered by cable from a helicopter swam to a 35-foot (11-meter) yacht that was struggling in heavy surf. As the swimmer approached the vessel, a large wave slammed into it, rolling the boat over and throwing a man, later identified as Labonte, into the water.

            The swimmer, Petty Officer 1st Class Branch Walton, of Greenville, South Carolina, reached Labonte and pulled him to safety. The helicopter crew flew him to Coast Guard Base Astoria, where medics treated him for mild hypothermia and transported him to a hospital.

            The yacht's owner, who lives in nearby Warrenton, Oregon, reported the vessel stolen later Friday, the police chief said.

            The hospital had already released Labonte when police saw the Coast Guard photos and video and realized it was the same person who they said covered over security cameras at the Goonies house and left the dead fish on the porch.

            Police were still looking for Labonte Friday evening.

            Kelly didn't know what kind of fish it was, but said police believed it was caught locally because after the video started circulating another person reported having taken Labonte fishing.

            “It's been a really odd 48 hours,” Kelly said. 

            The mouth of the Columbia, the largest North American river flowing into the Pacific Ocean, is known as “the graveyard of the Pacific"" for its notoriously rough seas. The Coast Guard received the yacht's mayday call around 10 a.m. Friday while conducting trainings nearby, Petty Officer Michael Clark said.

            The mayday contained no information about location or the specific problem, but the agency roughly triangulated the vessel's location and nearby boat crews and a helicopter responded. 

            They found the P/C Sandpiper yacht taking on water in 20-foot (6-meter) seas, meaning the height of a wave from the previous trough could be as much as 40 feet (12 meters), Clark said. 

            Walton, who only recently graduated from the Coast Guard's rescue swimmer program, was lowered from the helicopter by a cable. Labonte climbed onto the stern and prepared to enter the water just as a huge wave slammed the craft, throwing him into the surf. The wave struck so violently that the vessel rolled completely over and wound up floating upright.

            Walton said in an interview Friday that he planned to reach the man, get him in the water and hook him to a cable attached to the helicopter. Instead, the wave hit.

            “I kind of got thrown around a little bit by the wave. When I came up I noticed the boat was pretty much in shambles,"" Walton said.

            He directed the helicopter to bring him to Labonte after spotting him in the surf a short distance away. The force of the wave had mostly knocked off his life jacket, Walton said.SEATTLE (AP) — A man who was saved by a Coast Guard rescue swimmer at the mouth of the Columbia River as a massive wave rolled the yacht he was piloting Friday was wanted for a bizarre incident in which police said he left a dead fish at the Astoria, Oregon, home featured in the classic 1985 film, “The Goonies.”Officers had been looking for the man since Wednesday, when an acquaintance alerted them to a video he posted on social media of himself leaving the fish at the house and then dancing around the property, Astoria Police Chief Stacy Kelly said.Kelly identified the man as Jericho Labonte, 35, of Victoria, British Columbia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799949,Feds say cyberattack caused suicide helpline's outage,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A cyberattack caused a nearly daylong outage of the nation's new 988 mental health helpline late last year, federal officials told The Associated Press Friday. Lawmakers are now calling for the federal agency that oversees the program to prevent future attacks. 

            “On December 1, the voice calling functionality of the 988 Lifeline was rendered unavailable as a result of a cybersecurity incident,” Danielle Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said in an email. 

            The attack occurred on the network for Intrado, the company that provides telecommunications services for the helpline. The agency did not disclose details about who it believes launched the attack or what kind of cyberattack occurred. Intrado is working with a third-party assessor to investigate the incident and law enforcement agencies have been notified of the breach, SAMHSA said. 











            The national 988 phone number, which can be reached by text, chat or voice calling, has become a lifeline for millions of Americans seeking help during a mental crisis, with millions of calls pouring in during the first six months since its launch in July. The system is designed to work similarly to 911 — it's a universal, easy-to-remember number that people can call in an emergency to reach a human who is working around the clock in a local call center. 

            Those who tried on Dec. 1 to reach the line for help with suicidal or depressive thoughts were instead greeted with a message that said the line is “experiencing a service outage.” Text and chat services, however, remained available to those who needed help. 

            The Federal Communications Commission said in December it was investigating the outage. Intrado said at the time that the company was “experiencing an incident that is impacting production across numerous systems” and is “working diligently to restore service.” Intrado could not immediately be reached for comment Friday. 

            Last week, Democrat Rep. Tony Cárdenas and Republican Rep. Jay Obernolte, both of California, introduced a bill calling for better coordination and reporting around cyberattacks on the 988 system. 

            “Even a few hours’ outage of the national suicide hotline can cost American lives,” Obernolte said in a press release introducing the bill. “It’s critical that we mitigate the risks of future disruptions to the service and take steps to resolve cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could put the hotline at risk.""WASHINGTON (AP) — A cyberattack caused a nearly daylong outage of the nation's new 988 mental health helpline late last year, federal officials told The Associated Press Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799967,China balloon soaring over U.S. deflates hopes for diplomatic thaw,"WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The political uproar over a suspected Chinese spy balloon drifting over the United States did not just derail a planned visit to Beijing by the top U.S. diplomat, it also threatens to upset attempts by both countries to steady an increasingly rocky relationship.The reaction in the United States to what appears to be an ill-timed spying mission will have lingering consequences for efforts to stabilize ties – already near historic lows. Some U.S. lawmakers are demanding that President Joe Biden, a Democrat, hold China to account for what officials are calling an unacceptable violation of U.S. sovereignty.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who postponed a trip that was to begin on Friday, said he would be prepared to visit Beijing ""when conditions allow,"" but the administration could be hard pressed to quickly revive the trip short of China offering up serious gestures of goodwill, policy analysts said.Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia under then-President Barack Obama, said China's ""laughable alibi"" that the aircraft was an errant weather balloon, didn't help.""This incident has soured the atmosphere and hardened positions and there's no guarantee the two sides can successfully resurrect the 'Bali' momentum,"" Russel said, referring to the November meeting between Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Indonesia where they agreed to increase communications.Ties between the superpowers have frayed over the past few years and sank to their worst in decades last August, when then U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, prompting Beijing to conduct military drills near the Chinese-claimed island.Since then, the Biden administration has said it hopes to build a ""floor"" for the relationship and ensure that rivalry does not spiral into conflict.But Republicans who control the House are already working on ways to investigate potential threats from the United States' top geopolitical rival and have been quick to put heat on Biden about the balloon, questioning how it was allowed into U.S. airspace.CALLS TO SHOOT DOWN BALLOONMichael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Friday demanded to know why the administration had not shot the balloon down, accusing the president of allowing it to pose ""a direct and ongoing national security threat to the U.S. homeland.""China has often complained about surveillance of its growing military by U.S. ships and aircraft, though such operations in recent years have been conducted from widely recognized international waters and airspace.The mood in China over the balloon was also glum. The government expressed regret that an ""airship"" used for civilian meteorological and other scientific purposes had strayed. Some Chinese domestic commentators were scathing, however, about the U.S. response.""If Blinken were to cancel his trip to Beijing because of the balloon, I'd see it as him using that as an excuse to do what he had wanted to do anyway - not visit China,"" said Zhu Feng, executive dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University, speaking before the State Department announced the trip's cancellation.Had Blinken gone ahead with the visit, it likely would have opened the administration to more strident criticism that its approach toward was China weak and poor optics in Congress where there is bipartisan support for a hard line on Beijing, some analysts said.MISSED OPPORTUNITIESExpectations for Blinken's trip had been low, but he had intended to raise by name the cases of American citizens the United States says are wrongfully detained in China, and push Beijing to cooperate on stemming the flow of fentanyl, both areas where any progress would have built momentum that could carry into other discussions.Ivan Kanapathy, a former White House National Security Council deputy senior director for Asia, said he anticipated a string of hearings in Congress about China that would make it difficult for Blinken to justify a trip to Beijing unless he can win the release of detained Americans or return with another major prize.China, too, wants a stable U.S. relationship so it can focus on its economy, battered by the now abandoned zero-COVID policy.Blinken's visit - what would have been the first by a secretary of state to China since 2018 - was seen largely as an effort to develop ways to navigate future crises. With a trip to Taiwan by new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy likely this year, the next crisis might not be far off.""Overall, I do think the Biden administration would like to reschedule, as there are many issues on the table and a real chance for a thaw. But the balloon incident probably means the thaw is postponed indefinitely,"" said RAND Corporation Indo-Pacific analyst Derek Grossman.But Ryan Hass, a China expert at the Brookings Institution, said on Twitter that China's balloon operation had at least given the United States and China a chance to work out rules of engagement in space and at high altitudes, where the two countries' militaries will come into increasingly close contact.""We should not squander this opportunity to materially reduce risk and also prevent future violations of U.S. airspace by PRC spy balloons,"" Hass said.",2023/02/04,404,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799968,Half Moon Bay farmworkers processing shooting as jobs resume,"HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) — Barely a week after their colleagues were fatally shot, workers were back picking mushrooms at a farm in northern California. They say they have practical and emotional reasons for such a quick return -- they need to earn a living and find strength being with people who have experienced the same trauma.

            “We all feel like we need each other; we feel like the people at the farm are the ones who really understand you right now,"" said one worker at the farm in Half Moon Bay who asked that her name not be used.

            She and two other workers spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they are traumatized and do not want the attention that would come if their names are publicized.











            The woman recently started working at Concord Farms, one of two farms where seven people were fatally shot on Jan. 23 by a man officials said was a disgruntled worker. The woman recalled how she had nicknamed two of her older Chinese coworkers abuela and abuelo — Spanish for grandmother and grandfather — and developed a kinship with them despite language barriers. 

            The couple, Aixiang Zhang, 74, and Zhishen Liu, 73, were two of the three people killed at Concord Farms along with the farm’s manager, Marciano Martinez Jimenez. The couple lived on the farm, the workers said.

            The young woman wondered why the two were engaged in such hard labor at their age. Though they struggled to communicate through language, with the woman speaking Spanish and the couple speaking Mandarin, they got to know each other by pointing, signing and laughing and felt like a big family, she said. She credited them with helping her learn the ropes of harvesting mushrooms through gestures and a translation app on her phone.

            The woman was away from the farm's greenhouses when the shooting occurred but returned shortly after to find their bodies on the ground.

            Prosecutors say the suspect in the case, Chunli Zhao, began the shooting rampage at California Terra Garden, located 2 miles (1.5 kilometers) from Concord Farms, after his supervisor there demanded he pay a $100 repair bill for his forklift after he was involved in a crash with a co-worker's bulldozer.

            They say Zhao caught up with his supervisor talking to the co-worker who had operated the bulldozer and shot and killed them both. They say he then fatally shot the supervisor’s wife and shot and killed another co-worker and shot and wounded that co-worker’s brother.

            Those killed were Qizhong Cheng, Yetao Bing, Jingzhi Lu and Jose Romero Perez.

            Authorities say Zhao then drove to Concord Farms, where he worked until 2015, and began shooting there.

            Zhao, 66, has been charged with seven counts of murder and one of attempted murder. He is set to be arraigned on Feb. 16. Eric Hove, Zhao's attorney, did not immediately return an email Friday seeking comment.

            Half Moon Bay is a small coastal community in San Mateo County, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of San Francisco, made up of rolling hills dotted with farms and beaches that attract troves of weekend visitors. Most of the farmworkers in the area are Latino and the two mushrooms farms are among the few that employ Chinese workers, advocates have said. 

            The workers at Concord Farms said Zhao worked there for about four years until he was fired eight years ago. Aaron Tung, the farm's owner, did not immediately respond to an email Friday seeking comment. 

            The young woman said that the slain Chinese couple would often give her eggs, chickens or vegetables to take home. 

            “Grandma, and also grandpa, were so patient with me; they would teach me,” the young woman said, tears filling her eyes. “They always helped me and were very good to me.”

            She said that before tragedy struck at the small farm that employs about 15 workers, the work atmosphere was so collegial that it felt like a family. The workers said they like working there because the owner gives them the flexibility to leave during the workday if they have to. 

            “It was a really joyous place,"" she said.

            The workers who spoke to AP said they have been working two or three hours a day since Tuesday harvesting mushrooms, cleaning them, weighing them and packaging them because they need money to pay rent. They said they have received a bit of financial help and offers of psychological support from local farmworker advocacy organizations.

            Another farmworker who spoke to AP had called out sick the day of the shooting and did not witness it. But he recalled previously working with Zhao and said he remains fearful that he could be released from jail and return to the farm.

            “I try to forget what happened, but it’s like I’m always carrying this fear in me,"" he said.

            The killings came shortly after San Mateo County was pummeled by heavy rains that put farmworkers out of work for days, exacerbating the hard lives of many who live in crowded conditions and make only enough to pay bills and rent. 

            The third farmworker who spoke to AP said he and his wife have been trying to get therapy to process witnessing the shooting. 

            “Being there is not easy,"" he said of the farm. “My wife doesn’t feel well. We have mixed feelings. I don’t know how to explain it, how to process what happened.”

            The man has worked on farms in Half Moon Bay for the past decade and described the struggle that he and others face doing grueling work with pay that barely covers their living expenses. 

            He said he makes $16 an hour and pays $1,300 for a room for himself, his wife and two children in a four-bedroom home they share with eight other people. 

            “We do the work so others can eat when there are times that we don’t eat and we have to struggle to complete the work,” he said. 

            Last week, San Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller visited the housing at California Terra Garden, where some of its workers lived along with their families, and described it as “deplorable"" and ""heartbreaking.” Muller, who represents Half Moon Bay and other agricultural towns, posted photos on Twitter showing a shipping container and sheds used as homes. 

            David Oates, a spokesperson for California Terra Garden, said Friday the employees there returned to work on Monday and have been given access to grief counseling.

            “They will have that access as long as need be,” he said, adding that they will also receive payment for last week when the farm was not in operation. 

            The farm owners have agreed to build new permanent homes on a separate area of the farm for its employees and their families and provide them affordable housing during the year it will take to construct them, Oates said. 

            Officials have not said anything about whether the housing at Concord Farms was up to code. 

            Belinda Hernandez, founder and executive director of the farmworker advocacy group ALAS, said she hopes this time officials take the plight of farmworkers seriously and make a change. 

            “We have been talking to a lot of people for a long time about this. It shouldn’t take a tragedy for people to stand up and listen,” she said.

            Associated Press writer Janie Har contributed from San Francisco.HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) — Barely a week after their colleagues were fatally shot, workers were back picking mushrooms at a farm in northern California. They say they have practical and emotional reasons for such a quick return -- they need to earn a living and find strength being with people who have experienced the same trauma.“We all feel like we need each other; we feel like the people at the farm are the ones who really understand you right now,"" said one worker at the farm in Half Moon Bay who asked that her name not be used.She and two other workers spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they are traumatized and do not want the attention that would come if their names are publicized.The woman recently started working at Concord Farms, one of two farms where seven people were fatally shot on Jan. 23 by a man officials said was a disgruntled worker. The woman recalled how she had nicknamed two of her older Chinese coworkers abuela and abuelo — Spanish for grandmother and grandfather — and developed a kinship with them despite language barriers.The couple, Aixiang Zhang, 74, and Zhishen Liu, 73, were two of the three people killed at Concord Farms along with the farm’s manager, Marciano Martinez Jimenez. The couple lived on the farm, the workers said.The young woman wondered why the two were engaged in such hard labor at their age. Though they struggled to communicate through language, with the woman speaking Spanish and the couple speaking Mandarin, they got to know each other by pointing, signing and laughing and felt like a big family, she said. She credited them with helping her learn the ropes of harvesting mushrooms through gestures and a translation app on her phone.The woman was away from the farm's greenhouses when the shooting occurred but returned shortly after to find their bodies on the ground.Prosecutors say the suspect in the case, Chunli Zhao, began the shooting rampage at California Terra Garden, located 2 miles (1.5 kilometers) from Concord Farms, after his supervisor there demanded he pay a $100 repair bill for his forklift after he was involved in a crash with a co-worker's bulldozer.They say Zhao caught up with his supervisor talking to the co-worker who had operated the bulldozer and shot and killed them both. They say he then fatally shot the supervisor’s wife and shot and killed another co-worker and shot and wounded that co-worker’s brother.Those killed were Qizhong Cheng, Yetao Bing, Jingzhi Lu and Jose Romero Perez.Authorities say Zhao then drove to Concord Farms, where he worked until 2015, and began shooting there.Zhao, 66, has been charged with seven counts of murder and one of attempted murder. He is set to be arraigned on Feb. 16. Eric Hove, Zhao's attorney, did not immediately return an email Friday seeking comment.Half Moon Bay is a small coastal community in San Mateo County, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of San Francisco, made up of rolling hills dotted with farms and beaches that attract troves of weekend visitors. Most of the farmworkers in the area are Latino and the two mushrooms farms are among the few that employ Chinese workers, advocates have said.The workers at Concord Farms said Zhao worked there for about four years until he was fired eight years ago. Aaron Tung, the farm's owner, did not immediately respond to an email Friday seeking comment.The young woman said that the slain Chinese couple would often give her eggs, chickens or vegetables to take home.“Grandma, and also grandpa, were so patient with me; they would teach me,” the young woman said, tears filling her eyes. “They always helped me and were very good to me.”She said that before tragedy struck at the small farm that employs about 15 workers, the work atmosphere was so collegial that it felt like a family. The workers said they like working there because the owner gives them the flexibility to leave during the workday if they have to.“It was a really joyous place,"" she said.The workers who spoke to AP said they have been working two or three hours a day since Tuesday harvesting mushrooms, cleaning them, weighing them and packaging them because they need money to pay rent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799971,California won't require COVID vaccine to attend schools,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Children in California won't have to get the coronavirus vaccine to attend schools, state public health officials confirmed Friday, ending one of the last major restrictions of the pandemic in the nation's most populous state.

            Gov. Gavin Newsom first announced the policy in 2021, saying it would eventually apply to all of California's 6.7 million public and private schoolchildren. 

            But since then, the crisis first caused by a mysterious virus in late 2019 has mostly receded from public consciousness. COVID-19 is still widespread, but the availability of multiple vaccines has lessened the viruses' effects for many — offering relief to what had been an overwhelmed public health system.











            Nearly all of the pandemic restrictions put in place by Newsom have been lifted, and he won't be able to issue any new ones after Feb. 28 when the state's coronavirus emergency declaration officially ends.

            One of the last remaining questions was what would happen to the state's vaccine mandate for schoolchildren, a policy that came from the California Department of Public Health and was not impacted by the lifting of the emergency declaration.

            Friday, the Department of Public Health confirmed it was backing off its original plan.

            “CDPH is not currently exploring emergency rulemaking to add COVID-19 to the list of required school vaccinations, but we continue to strongly recommend COVID-19 immunization for students and staff to keep everyone safer in the classroom,” the department said in a statement. “Any changes to required K-12 immunizations are properly addressed through the legislative process.”

            The announcement was welcome news for Jonathan Zachreson, a father of three who lives in Roseville. Zachreson founded the group Reopen California Schools to oppose many of the state's coronavirus policies. His activism led to him being elected to the Roseville City School District board in November.

            “This is long overdue. ... A lot of families have been stressed from this decision and worried about it for quite some time,"" he said. “I wish CDPH would make a bigger statement publicly or Newsom would make a public statement ... to let families know and school districts know that this is no longer going to be an issue for them.”

            Representatives for Newsom did not respond to an email requesting comment.

            California has had lots of influence over the country's pandemic policies. It was the first state to issue a statewide stay-at-home order — and other states were swift to follow. 

            But most states did not follow California's lead when it came to the vaccine mandate for public schools. Officials in Louisiana announced a similar mandate, but later backed off. Schools in the District of Columbia plan to require the COVID-19 vaccine starting in the fall.

            Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a former member of the state Assembly who challenged Newsom in a failed recall attempt in 2021 over his pandemic policies, published a blog post declaring: “We won. To Gavin Newsom: You lost.”

            Kevin Gordon, a lobbyist representing most of the state's school districts, said he did not think the policy change was the result of political pressure by Republicans, but instead a reflection of the virus's slowing transmission rates.

            “The public's appetite for these kinds of mandates is definitely not what it used to be,” he said. “If you started to now impose a heavy mandate when the amount of transmission is significantly lower than it was statewide, a one-size-fits-all solution doesn't work right now.”SACRAMENTO, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799973,"Florida lawmakers to meet next week on Disney, immigration","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida lawmakers will meet next week to complete a state takeover of Walt Disney World's self-governing district and debate proposals on immigration and election crimes, as Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to leverage national political fissures ahead of an expected White House run. 

            Republican leaders of the Legislature, in coordination with DeSantis, on Friday ordered lawmakers to convene for a special session next week to deal with the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the Disney government is known. 

            In addition, the Statehouse will also consider legislation creating a program to relocate migrants and make clear the statewide prosecutor has authority to prosecute election crimes in federal and state races. 











            The agenda marks a sustained focus from DeSantis on issues such as immigration, election fraud, gender and sexuality, with the ascendant Republican eager to lean into political divides as he positions himself for a 2024 presidential run and further brandishes his reputation as a conservative firebrand. 

            The meeting will represent the latest development in a high-profile feud between DeSantis and Disney over the company's criticism over a law dubbed by critics as “Don't Say Gay,"" which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age appropriate.

            The governor, in pushing lawmakers to strip the company of its self-governing status, displayed a willingness to go after one of the state's biggest employers and political donors, reinforcing the combative leadership style that has propelled him to national political stardom. 

            The special session had been rumored to focus on Disney but Friday's announcement detailing the additional subjects also ensures heavy attention on the governor's approach to voter fraud and immigration, key issues of conservative Republican primary voters. 

            The memo issued Friday does not offer much detail on the proposals and bills have not yet been introduced. 

            The election crimes prosecution measure comes after some charges linked to the governor's new election police unit were dropped because of jurisdiction issues. The memo characterizes the measure as a clarification of state law. 

            Lawmakers will also create a program to transport immigrants in the country illegally to another state if they’ve already been processed by the federal government and the migrants volunteer. DeSantis has already used part of a $12 million fund, paid for by taxpayers, to fly about 50 South American migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, in protest of federal immigration policy.

            The squabble between DeSantis and Disney began last year, when the entertainment giant publicly opposed the education legislation and said it would pause political donations in the state and that it would support organizations working to oppose the law. 

            DeSantis moved quickly to criticize the company, calling it a purveyor of woke ideologies that are inappropriate for children, and gave lawmakers the ability to eliminate the Disney government as the Legislature was meeting for a special session on redistricting. 

            The GOP-controlled Statehouse in April approved legislation to dissolve Reedy Creek by June 2023, beginning a closely watched process that would determine the structure of government that controls the company's sprawling property. 

            The memo does not offer much detail on the future of the district, only that the bill will “revise the governance and powers of Reedy Creek Improvement District, while protecting local taxpayers from the District’s debts.”

            The creation of the Reedy Creek district was instrumental in Disney’s decision to build near Orlando in the 1960s. Having a separate government allows the company to provide zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure services on its land. 

            The special session will also adjust language in current laws addressing endorsement deals for college athletes. 

            Florida was one of the first states to pass a law allowing college athletes to profit off their name, image or likeness, but it doesn’t allow people affiliated with universities to help secure endorsement deals. The proposal would lift that provision to make Florida more competitive with other states that don’t have the restriction.

            Lawmakers will also consider a bill to provide more relief money for Hurricane Ian and Nicole recovery efforts, according to the memo. ___

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799975,"NBA suspends Brooks, fines Mitchell for Grizz-Cavs scuffle","Memphis Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks has been suspended one game without pay by the NBA, and Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell fined $20,000 for their roles in an on-court incident on Thursday night.

            The league announced the punishments on Friday.

            Brooks swung and struck Mitchell in the groin area during the third quarter after the Grizzlies guard had fallen to the floor. Mitchell retaliated by throwing the ball at Brooks and then shoving him.











            Both players were ejected in Cleveland's 128-113 win.

            Afterward, Mitchell accused Brooks of being a dirty player.

            ""That’s just who he is,″ Mitchell said. “We’ve seen it a bunch in this league with him. Him and I have had our personal battles for years. There’s no place for that in the game. This has been brewing for years with me and other guys in the league. This isn’t new.”

            The league said Brooks will serve his suspension on Sunday, when the Grizzlies host the Toronto Raptors.

            Initially, Mitchell was scheduled to speak with reporters in Cleveland's locker room. But the All-Star guard opted for the team's larger interview room so he could address the incident with Brooks.

            “I'm losing money,” Mitchell said before answering questions.

            Mitchell said he and Brooks have been feuding for years. He also noted that Brooks has had similar altercations with other players.

            “I’m not typically someone who gets ejected for stuff like that,” Mitchell said. ""But at the end of the day, I think my reaction was reacting to a cheap shot. If punishment doesn’t come from that, he’s just going to keep doing it.

            ""It’s just dumb to be honest with you and I’m going to appeal it because I don’t think I should’ve gotten ejected for defending myself.”

            Before his ejection, Mitchell was having a rough night. He scored just six points on 2-of -1 shooting in 22 minutes while being guarded by Brooks. The two had matched up regularly when Mitchell played for Utah.

            ""That was cool when we were just talking, but that right there, a line has to be drawn,” Mitchell said. “The NBA has to do something about it. I’m not the only person this has happened to and there’s no place for that in this game.

            ""I took matters into my own hands. When you have a cheap shot like that, there was no need to do that.”

Mitchell retaliated by throwing the ball at Brooks and then shoving him.Both players were ejected in Cleveland's 128-113 win.Afterward, Mitchell accused Brooks of being a dirty player.""That’s just who he is,″ Mitchell said. “We’ve seen it a bunch in this league with him. Him and I have had our personal battles for years. There’s no place for that in the game. This has been brewing for years with me and other guys in the league. This isn’t new.”The league said Brooks will serve his suspension on Sunday, when the Grizzlies host the Toronto Raptors.Initially, Mitchell was scheduled to speak with reporters in Cleveland's locker room. But the All-Star guard opted for the team's larger interview room so he could address the incident with Brooks.“I'm losing money,” Mitchell said before answering questions.Mitchell said he and Brooks have been feuding for years. He also noted that Brooks has had similar altercations with other players.“I’m not typically someone who gets ejected for stuff like that,” Mitchell said. ""But at the end of the day, I think my reaction was reacting to a cheap shot. If punishment doesn’t come from that, he’s just going to keep doing it.""It’s just dumb to be honest with you and I’m going to appeal it because I don’t think I should’ve gotten ejected for defending myself.”Before his ejection, Mitchell was having a rough night. He scored just six points on 2-of -1 shooting in 22 minutes while being guarded by Brooks. The two had matched up regularly when Mitchell played for Utah.""That was cool when we were just talking, but that right there, a line has to be drawn,” Mitchell said. “The NBA has to do something about it. I’m not the only person this has happened to and there’s no place for that in this game.""I took matters into my own hands. When you have a cheap shot like that, there was no need to do that.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/04,,World

However, before his apology the aide said he believes same-sex marriage would cause “quite a few people” to abandon Japan.It seems the aide will be abandoned first though, as Kishida said on Saturday (Feb. 4) that he had no choice but to fire him over the discriminatory remarks.Kishida has approached the issue of same-sex marriage hesitantly in the past. “We need to be extremely careful in considering the matter as it could affect the structure of family life in Japan,” he said to the Japanese parliament in January.In November 2022 Reuters reported that a Tokyo court upheld Japan’s ban on same-sex marriage, but that the lack of legal protections for same-sex couples violated their human rights. Same-sex couples in Japan cannot inherit each other’s assets and have no parental rights over each other’s children.Japan is the only G7 country that does not allow same-sex civil partnerships. However, it is not unusual in Asia, with Taiwan being the only country in the region to legalize same-sex marriage.Senior aide to the prime minister Masayoshi Arai, left, walks next to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the Prime Minister's official residence in Tokyo, Dec. 12, 2022.

            A surprising burst of US hiring in January: 517,000 jobs

            WASHINGTON (AP) — For nearly a year, the Federal Reserve has been on a mission to cool down the job market to help curb the nation’s worst inflation bout in four decades. The job market hasn’t been cooperating. Consider what happened in January: The government reported Friday that employers added a sizzling 517,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, the lowest level since 1969. The job gain was so large it left economists scratching their heads and wondering why the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes haven’t slowed hiring at a time when many foresee a recession nearing.

            An unexpected job surge confounds the Fed’s economic models

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Does the Federal Reserve have it wrong? For months, the Fed has been warily watching the economy’s robust job gains out of concern that employers, desperate to hire, will keep boosting pay and, in turn, keep inflation elevated. But January’s blowout job growth coincided with an actual slowdown in wage growth. And it followed an easing of numerous inflation measures in recent months. The past year’s consistently robust hiring gains have defied the fastest increase in the Fed’s benchmark interest rate in four decades — an aggressive effort by the central bank to cool hiring, economic growth and spiking prices. Instead, economists were astonished when the government reported Friday that employers added an explosive 517,000 jobs last month.

            Wall Street rally hits wall of hot jobs, cold earnings data

            NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s rally hit a wall after a surprisingly strong jobs report fueled worries about inflation and higher interest rates. The S&P 500 fell 1% Friday for its first drop in four days, though it took an up-and-down route to get there. The bond market was more decisive in thinking the strong jobs data could push the Federal Reserve to stay firm on high interest rates, which hurt the economy and markets. Treasury yields zoomed higher. Tech stocks also weighed on the market following profit reports that were weaker than expected. The Nasdaq gave back 1.6% and the Dow lost 0.4%.

            Jury: Musk didn’t deceive investors with 2018 Tesla tweets

            SAN FRANCISO (AP) — A jury has decided Elon Musk didn’t deceive investors with tweets in 2018. The verdict by the nine jurors was reached after less that two hours of deliberation following a three-week trial. The trial pitted Tesla investors represented in a class-action lawsuit against Musk, who is CEO of both the electric automaker and the Twitter service he bought for for $44 billion a few months ago. In 2018, Musk tweeted that he had the financing to take Tesla private even though it turned out he hadn’t gotten an iron-clad commitment for an aborted deal that would have cost $20 billion to $70 billion to pull off. The verdict is a major vindication for Musk.

            G-7, Europe reach deal for price cap on Russian diesel

            BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says industrialized countries in the Group of Seven are imposing a price cap on refined Russian oil products such as diesel and kerosene, as part of a coalition that includes Australia and a tentative agreement from the European Union. The cap follows similar price limits put on Russian oil exports, with the goal of reducing the financial resources Russian President Vladimir Putin has to wage the war in Ukraine. On Friday, EU governments tentatively agreed to set a $100-per-barrel price cap on sales of Russian diesel to coincide with an EU embargo on the fuel.

            Treasury makes more electric SUVs eligible for tax credits

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The Treasury Department said Friday it is making more electric vehicles — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions. The revised standards for EV tax credits follow lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify. Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with top aides to President Joe Biden last week to discuss the EV industry. Under the sweeping climate law approved last year, pickup trucks, SUVs and vans with a sticker price up to $80,000 qualify for EV tax credits, while new electric cars and sedans can only be priced up to $55,000.

On Thursday several businesses announced their quarterly results, including Apple Inc. The company posted its first quarterly revenue drop in nearly four years after pandemic-driven restrictions on its China factories curtailed sales of the latest iPhone during the holiday season.

            Indian tycoon Adani hit by more losses, calls for probe

            NEW DELHI (AP) — Shares in troubled Adani Enterprises have tumbled 30% and then rebounded after more than a week of heavy losses that have cost it tens of billions of dollars in market value. The company is the flagship of India’s second-largest conglomerate. It canceled a share offering meant to raise $2.5 billion earlier this week after U.S. short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused it of market manipulation and other fraudulent practices. Adani denies the allegations. Opposition lawmakers blocked Parliament proceedings for a second day Friday. They chanted slogans and demanding a probe into the business dealings of coal tycoon Gautam Adani.

            Spanish court: Amazon violated labor law with delivery app

            MADRID (AP) — A Spanish court says Amazon broke labor laws by forcing more than 2,000 delivery drivers to use an app that the company controlled for scheduling work and payments as well as requiring them to use their own cars and cellphones on the job. In a decision released Friday, the court declared that Amazon couldn’t treat workers using its Flex app as self-employed. It follows a lawsuit from Spain’s social security body, which is seeking to recoup payments that it says Amazon should have made on behalf of the drivers. Amazon says it disagrees with the ruling and will appeal. It’s the latest legal measure in Spain designed to stop delivery apps and e-commerce companies from incorrectly designating workers as self-employed.

            US tells owners to park old Hondas until air bags are fixed

            DETROIT (AP) — Honda and the U.S. government are urging owners of about 8,200 older vehicles not to drive them until dangerous air bag inflators are replaced. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday issued a “Do Not Drive” advisory for the 2001 through 2003 vehicles with Takata inflators that have a high possibility of exploding in a crash. The safety agency says the risk to drivers and passengers is dire because the so-called “Alpha” inflators have a 50% chance of exploding in a crash. They can shoot shrapnel toward a driver’s face that could kill them or cause serious injuries. The agency says the Honda and Acura vehicles were recalled previously but records show that repairs have not been made. Honda already has replaced 99% of the dangerous inflators.

            You said everything went well during the trip. He pointed out that being invited to deliver a speech at the International Religious Freedom (IRF) Summit was unprecedented, CNA reported.

            The legislative speaker said that even with his tight schedule, he did not meet with members of Congress including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, adding that it is not clear whether McCarthy will visit Taiwan. However, You revealed that he met with American Institute in Taiwan Chairman James Moriarty.

            In his speech titled “Born to be free; striving for human freedom,” You lauded Taiwan’s democracy, saying the nation has proven the Western system of government “can indeed flourish in Chinese-speaking regions.” He said Taiwan has fiercely protected religious freedom and allowed religions to flourish.











            Meanwhile, he blasted China for its suppression of Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Hong Kong. “The Chinese Communist Party’s attempts to extinguish the mother tongues, cultures, and faiths of different groups cannot be enumerated,” he said.

            You also pointed to China’s wolf-warrior diplomacy, the Belt and Road Initiative, militarization of the South China Sea, and abolishing the “one country, two systems” framework of Hong Kong as Beijing’s attempts to realize its expansionist goals.

            In addition to the IRF Summit, You also attended the National Prayer Breakfast, during which he prayed with all of those present for the Ukrainians to find peace, and for the people of Taiwan to have happiness.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Legislative Speaker You Si-kun (游錫堃) called his two-day trip to the U.S. a success upon returning home Saturday morning (Feb. 4).You said everything went well during the trip.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800003,"Ovechkin, and Ovi Jr., take the ice at All-Star skills night","SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — When you’ve got the second-most goals in NHL history, you’re evidently permitted to bring a guest onto the ice for the All-Star Skills competition.

            That’s why there were two No. 8 Washington jerseys out there Friday night.

            Capitals star Alex Ovechkin took the ice with his Metropolitan Division teammates — and his oldest child, 4-year-old Sergei.











            Sergei, named for Ovechkin’s late brother, was wearing an Ovi Jr. jersey. The kid has built a bit of a following in recent weeks, after scoring a goal at a Caps practice in December and playing a role in helping the Washington crowd celebrate his dad’s 800th goal.

            It was Ovi Jr.’s first chance at being part of an All-Star weekend. His father hasn’t participated at All-Star since 2018, either because of COVID-19 or injuries. The last time his dad played in an All-Star event, Sergei hadn’t been born.

            Alex Ovechkin has 812 goals. He only trails Wayne Gretzky's 894 in NHL history.

            And later in the night, Ovi Jr. got to center a line alongside his dad and Pittsburgh great Sidney Crosby. They each got an assist on a goal that Sergei scored — beating Roberto Luongo, the Florida great who came out of retirement for All-Star weekend.

            Said Ovechkin after his son scored: “I think he's really enjoying it.""

            WELCOME HOME, LU

            Luongo got to be part of one more All-Star competition.

            In a building where a banner bearing his No. 1 jersey hangs — he’s the only former Panthers player to have that distinction – Luongo was a celebrity goaltender during the Breakaway Challenge during the Skills Competition on Friday night.

            He stopped his lone shot in the breakaway, off the stick of Toronto’s Mitch Marner. On one hand, Marner is the Maple Leafs’ leading scorer this season. On the other hand, he was also wearing a white suit, sunglasses and a light blue T-shirt to keep with a “Miami Vice” theme.

            Luongo, who was regaled by “Luuuuu"" chants from the Florida fans all night, was up to the challenge. Marner tried to beat him to the glove side, but Luongo got enough of it to make the save — then flopped forward to cover up the rebound, the smile clearly seen through his mask.

            “You got too close,” Luongo told Marner.

            Later, Luongo told ESPN during the telecast of the event that “this is my house. This is my home right here. The crease is my home.”

            Luongo’s pads paid tribute to his career — the design depicted his time both as a member of the Panthers and the Vancouver Canucks. They were a gift from CCM for his making the Hockey Hall of Fame.

            “I'd never put the pads on since I retired,"" Luongo said. “First time I put them on was this week. Felt pretty good.""

            He also took part, and scored a goal, in a Florida alumni game on Wednesday night. But if there's more alumni games, Luongo suggested he might jump back into the net.

            “It back some good memories tonight to be in the blue paint, hearing the chants,"" Luongo said. “Maybe one day we'll hear them again.""

            REMEMBERING JIMMY

            Sergei Ovechkin — who knocked a shot into an open net during a stoppage of the skills events — wasn’t the only child who got a great view of the night. 

            Philadelphia forward Kevin Hayes has his 3-year-old nephew Beau with him for All-Star weekend. Beau’s father was Jimmy Hayes, Kevin Hayes’ brother.

            Jimmy Hayes was 31 when he died in 2021 with fentanyl and cocaine in his system. He played for four NHL teams, including Florida.

            Kevin Hayes is part of an All-Star weekend for the first time.

            ANTHEM POISE

            “The Star-Spangled Banner” was performed by the South Florida Gay Men’s Chorus, and group crushed it — never minding that the crowd, representing several different fan bases, was going to shout some term specific to their team at various points in the lyrics.

            Florida fans shout along with “red” and “Knight,” one a nod to one of the team’s primary colors, the other for goaltender Spencer Knight. There also were some shouts from other fan bases; some St. Louis fans, for example, could be heard singing “home of the Blues"" instead of “home of the brave"" to close the song.

            And “O Canada” performer Hannah Walpole had some shouting as she sang as well, particularly when she reached the “true North” portion of those lyrics — something typically heard at Winnipeg games.

            SLAP SHOTS

            Cale Makar, the reigning Conn Smythe Trophy winner from the Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche, was the first participant in the Fastest Skater event – the opening competition of the night. He fell coming around the second turn. ... Tampa Bay’s Pat Maroon, one of the broadcasters on the event, reported that he was “freezing” by working at ice level. “I’m used to the gear,” said Maroon, who was in a blazer and open shirt Friday night. ... A big hit for those used to the regular colors of FLA Live Arena — and basically all other hockey arenas — was the ocean-water-shade of blue used for the blue lines and the creases. The faceoff dots at the circles on either end of the ice aren’t the standard solid red this weekend, but depict an image of the sun instead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800006,"Bolsonaro ponders election defeat, as crowd chants ‘fraud’","MIAMI (AP) — Only a few weeks after his supporters stormed the seat of his country's government, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday expressed bafflement at how he could have lost October's election, then smiled silently as a crowd of supporters cried, “Fraud!”

            He did not directly address the Jan. 8 assault on the buildings housing Brazil’s Congress and Supreme Court during his appearance in Miami before a conservative group tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump.

            Bolsonaro had mimicked Trump’s strategy during his own 2020 reelection campaign, for months sowing doubts about the reliability of Brazil's voting machines and then filing a petition to annul millions of votes. He is now under investigation for allegedly inciting the uprising.











            Like Trump, Bolsonaro has not conceded the election, though unlike the former U.S. president he also has never explicitly said he lost due to fraud. During a question-and-answer session with Charlie Kirk, head of the conservative Turning Point USA, the former Brazilian president rattled off his administration's accomplishments and then provided backers with an opening.

            “Brazil was doing very well,” Bolsonaro said. “I cannot understand the reasons why (the election) decided to go to the left.”

            After the cries of “fraud” died down, Kirk, who helped spread Trump's own election fraud lies after the former U.S. president's loss, replied, “All I can say is, that sounds very familiar.”

            The event took place at Trump's Miami hotel, underscoring the connection between two populist presidents who fanned suspicion of their democracies' elections, leading supporters to turn violent after their losses. The two were political allies who shared an overlapping set of advisers. Shortly before Bolsonaro's opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, took office, Bolsonaro moved to Florida, the state where Trump has based himself.

            Friday's appearance marked part of Bolsonaro's reemergence after spending several weeks in a central Florida suburb. He spoke to some supporters there earlier this week before taking the stage at Trump's hotel late Friday afternoon.

            Much of Bolsonaro's Friday speech amounted to a defense of his four years in power, touting job gains, what he said was a lack of corruption in his administration and, in a reference that drew loud cheers, “freedom” for those who opted out of COVID-19 vaccinations.

            After his 30-minute appearance, many in the several hundred-strong crowd, often clad in the national colors of yellow and green, swarmed around the 67-year-old former president.

            Some of Bolsonaro's backers in Brazil have expressed disappointment that he left the country before Jan. 8 and has remained circumspect about the attack. The former president faces legal jeopardy not only from a mushrooming number of investigations into the Jan. 8 uprising but from the country's supreme court, which has censored websites that have spread what it calls lies about Brazil's election.

            Reynaldo Rossi, a Brazilian farmer visiting Florida to explore a possible relocation there, said he is glad Bolsonaro is staying in the U.S. for now.

            “If he goes back, they are going to create a lot of trouble for him,” Rossi said. “He would spend a lot of his time down there defending himself instead of leading us.” 

            In his speech, Bolsonaro acknowledged Brazilians who have left the country for the U.S., seeming to include himself in that category.

            “As well as we feel here, we always worry about our friends and family that stayed there,” he said, referring to Brazil.

            He also reassured the crowd about the country's future.

            “I believe in Brazil, and I am certain that Brazil will not end with the current government,” Bolsonaro said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800007,Sean Payton is officially named Broncos head coach,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — The Denver Broncos named Sean Payton the 20th head coach in franchise history Friday, 40 days after firing rookie head coach Nathaniel Hackett.

            “Sean Payton is an outstanding leader and Super Bowl champion with a brilliant offensive mind. He shares our commitment to winning championships for Broncos Country and we’re excited to welcome him as our new head coach,” owner and CEO Greg Penner said in a statement.

            “Sean knows how to build a championship culture with high expectations. He coaches with intensity and attention to detail while setting and maintaining high standards. Sean pours his heart and soul into winning with preparation, creativity and a genuine love of the game.""











            The Broncos reached an agreement earlier this week to compensate the New Orleans Saints, who had Payton under contract for two more years. 

            A person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Saints would receive the Broncos' first-round selection, No. 29 overall, in this year's draft and a 2022 second-rounder and the Broncos would receive New Orleans' third-round selection next year.

            Payton, 59, will be formally introduced Monday at team headquarters. He has already been busy interviewing candidates for his coaching staff.

            Payton, who worked in broadcasting this season after stepping down from the Saints when Drew Brees retired, went 152-89 in 15 seasons with New Orleans and 9-8 in the playoffs. He led the Saints to a 31-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts in the Super Bowl following the 2009 season. 

            “It is rare in any sport to hire a head coach with Sean’s credentials and we appreciate the first-class manner in which the Saints approached this process,” Penner said. ""We also appreciated the opportunity to meet and learn from the other highly qualified, outstanding coaches we interviewed.

            “Our goal was to identify a strong leader for the Denver Broncos who is focused on winning, and we found him in Coach Payton.”

            Payton's first order of business after building his staff will be to help quarterback Russell Wilson navigate a comeback following the worst statistical season of his 11-year NFL career.

            The Broncos went 5-12 last season, extending their playoff drought to seven years. Hackett was fired on Dec. 26 with a 4-11 record, making him just the fifth head coach not to make it through his first season in NFL history. Interim head coach Jerry Rosburg went 1-1 to close out the Broncos' sixth consecutive losing season.

            The Broncos were arguably the league's biggest disappointment in 2022 given the blockbuster trade with Seattle for Wilson that cost Denver four premium draft picks and three players and the hiring of Hackett, who turned out to be the biggest flop of last year's hiring cycle, overseeing an offense that averaged fewer than 16 points per game. 

            Wilson signed a $245 million extension before the season, one that doesn't even kick in until next year. He has vowed to do everything in his power to bounce back in 2023.

            The Seahawks own the Broncos' No. 5 overall selection in the upcoming draft. The first-rounder they sent to New Orleans for Payton is No. 29 overall. They obtained that pick from the Miami Dolphins in the Bradley Chubb trade last year. The pick originally belonged to the San Francisco 49ers.

            Payton was the headliner during this year’s cycle of head coach openings. Just five teams were searching for new coaches: the Broncos, Texans, Panthers, Colts and Cardinals.

            The Broncos conducted an extensive search, beginning with a virtual visit with Jim Harbaugh, who decided to stay at the University of Michigan. Also considered were Dan Quinn, DeMeco Ryans, Raheem Morris, Ejiro Evero, Jim Caldwell and David Shaw. The Texans hired Ryans, who was a finalist in Denver, on Tuesday.

            Penner led the search with assistance from limited partner Condoleezza Rice and general manager George Paton.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800018,Former Twins scouting director Radcliff dies of cancer at 66,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Mike Radcliff, who was scouting director for 14 of his 35 years evaluating prospects for the Minnesota Twins, died Friday at age 66 after a nearly four-year bout with pancreatic cancer.

            The Twins said Radcliff died in suburban Kansas City, where he and his wife, Sherry, kept their home.

            He was hired by the club in 1987 and became scouting director in 1993. He was the longest-tenured scouting director in Major League Baseball in 2007, when he was promoted to vice president of player personnel. Radcliff received several scouting awards from his peers over his career and was credited within the Twins organization for his confidence in making Joe Mauer the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 draft over Mark Prior and Mark Teixeira.











            “He had a good idea of what he was looking for. He had a good idea of how to go about his business, with a total respect for the game and his coaches,” former Twins general manager Terry Ryan said. “There wasn’t any player or team or assignment that was too trivial for him.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800038,Japanese prime minister's aide leaving over LGBTQ remarks,"TOKYO (AP) — A senior aide to Japan’s prime minister is being dismissed after making discriminatory remarks about LGBTQ people.

            Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Saturday that Masayoshi Arai, a secretary at his office, was being dismissed after Arai recently told Japanese media he did not like seeing LGBTQ people. Arai had retracted his comments and apologized on Friday.

            Kishida said the remarks run counter to the administration’s position on promoting diversity. 











            “Taking strong action is inevitable,” Kishida said without providing further details, meaning Arai may leave voluntarily.

            Arai's remarks prompted an outburst of protest and were the latest in a string of gaffes by Japanese officials that have landed them in trouble.

            Saving face is important in conformist Japan, where prejudice against LGBTQ people, racial groups, women and other nationalities persist.

            Japan is the only Group of Seven country that does not recognize same-sex marriage, but the movement toward recognition has been growing. 

            Kishida’s administration has been hit by several scandals recently, and its popularity is shaky.

            Various Japanese officials have resigned over the years over comments they made. 

            A justice minister stepped down last year after joking about capital punishment. 

            In 2021, Yoshiro Mori resigned as head of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee after saying women talked too much. Mori had been gaffe-prone when he earlier served as prime minister, about 20 years ago. 

            A minister in charge of cybersecurity who acknowledged he had hardly ever used a computer resigned in 2019.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800040,Bey hits late 3-pointer to help Pistons beat Hornets 118-112,"DETROIT (AP) — Saddiq Bey scored 22 points, including a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 32.1 seconds left, and the Detroit Pistons rallied to beat the Charlotte Hornets 118-112 on Friday night.

            The Pistons were playing for the first time since a 111-105 loss in Dallas on Monday. The team was stuck in Texas until Thursday by a combination of airplane problems and weather, forcing the postponement of Wednesday’s home game against the Washington Wizards.

            “Winning this game is a testament to everyone involved in this team — the players, the coaches and the staff,” Bey said. “We were pretty much stuck on a plane for three days, but we found a way to stay ready and come back here to get the win.”











            Mason Plumlee missed five free throws in the last 6:04 as Detroit outscored Charlotte 26-18 in the fourth quarter.

            “The fourth quarter really killed us after we had done a good job for the first three,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. “We had five turnovers in the quarter, we went 1 for 7 on 3 — and six of those were good shots — and we missed five free throws. That's the game right there.”

            Jaden Ivey had 24 points for the Pistons, Jalen Duren had 13 points and 13 rebounds, and Isaiah Stewart had eight points and 16 rebounds as Detroit outrebounded Charlotte 51-37.

            “It wasn't pretty, but we did what we needed to do,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “Isaiah had 16 rebounds and six assists and (Duren) had 13. Even Saddiq had eight rebounds with the second unit.”

            LeMelo Ball had 23 points, eight assists and eight rebounds for the Hornets before fouling out. Terry Rozier added 23 points.

            “You have to have an offensive balance — you can't just score in transition and you can't just score in the halfcourt,” Clifford said. “We did a good job of scoring early in possessions, but we have to be better in halfcourt sets.”

            Bojan Bogdanovic's 3-pointer put the Pistons ahead 108-106 with 2:34 left, but Plumlee tied it with a short jumper.

            After Ivey made two free throws, Plumlee split a pair — his fifth miss in eight attempts in the quarter. Plumlee was the only Hornets player to score between P.J. Washington's 3-pointer with 7:12 to play and Ball's tying three-point play with 1:20 left.

            After both teams missed, Bey hit a baseline 3-pointer to put Detroit up 115-112. 

            “The building was electric in the last minute,” Bey said. “The rookies were making plays and I knew I needed to knock that one down.”

            After a timeout, the Hornets took a 5-second violation and Alec Burks made it a five-point game from the free-throw line.

            Charlotte led 94-92 going into the fourth, with the teams combining for 98 points in the paint.

            Detroit’s 23 turnovers for 30 points helped Charlotte build a 106-102 lead with 4:31 to play, but Plumlee missed four of six free throws to keep the Pistons in the game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800041,Blazers rally from 20 down to end Wizards' win streak,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Anfernee Simons scored 20 of his 33 points in the third quarter and the Portland Trail Blazers erased a 20-point deficit, snapping Washington's six-game winning streak Friday night with a 124-116 victory over the Wizards.

            Simons made six of Portland's nine 3-pointers in the third, and the Trail Blazers finally caught and passed the Wizards in the fourth. Simons finished 9 of 12 from beyond the arc.

            Damian Lillard added 29 points for Portland, which has won five of six.











            “Our team is just so much better when our backs are against the wall,” Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. “I've been on teams like that before, so I understand it, but it's a dangerous place to live.”

            Bradley Beal scored 34 points for the Wizards, and Kristaps Porzingis had 32.

            Washington led 69-51 at halftime, but an advantage like that isn't totally safe against a backcourt that can shoot 3s like Portland's. After a layup by Josh Hart to start the third quarter, the Trail Blazers' next nine field goals came from long distance. The first five were by Simons, then Lillard made a couple and Jerami Grant hit one.

            Another 3 by Simons cut the deficit to 88-81.

            “We ran plays for him. We started off the third quarter kind of running his play,” Billups said. “He came off and got a couple looks, and then I thought Dame and Josh and those guys, they all just did a really good job of continuing to keep the ball in his hands.”

            It was 94-90 after three, and Portland finally tied it at 99 on a 3 by Shaedon Sharpe. A 3 by Hart gave the Trail Blazers their first lead, 102-101. Portland was up by two before breaking the game open with a 13-4 run. A dunk by Simons made it 120-111 with 1:25 to play.

            Portland played without center Jusuf Nurkic, sidelined because of a left calf strain. He's expected back after the All-Star break.

            The Wizards jumped out to an early 15-2 lead, and they led 34-14 after a 3-pointer by Porzingis. He scored 16 points in the opening quarter.

            SUPPORTING PLAYERS

            Hart and Trendon Watford scored 21 points apiece for Portland.

            Watford's point total was a season high. He hadn't been playing much before this past week. This was his first time scoring in double figures since Dec. 16.

            “Staying ready, that's my job,"" Watford said. ""I think that's where a lot of young players mess up — just not being ready when the opportunity comes.”

(AP) — California's new law banning new oil and gas wells near homes, schools and other community sites has been put on hold until after voters decide next year whether to throw it out, officials announced Friday.

            Opponents of Senate Bill 1137 gathered more than 623,000 valid voter signatures to put a referendum on the Nov. 5, 2024, general election ballot, California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber announced.

            The challenge means the law, which took effect in January, will be on hold until after voters decide.











            The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last September, bans new wells within 3,200 feet (975 meters) of locations including schools, homes, day care and health care centers, parks, jails and businesses open to the public.

            It was celebrated by environmental justice advocates who had been pushing for the regulation for years to lower air pollution in poor neighborhoods and communities of color.

            But days after the bill passed, Nielsen Merksamer, a law firm that specializes in ballot measures, filed a referendum to overturn SB 1137 on behalf of Jerome Reedy, a board member of the California Independent Petroleum Association.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800046,"Arctic blast grips U.S. Northeast, bringing frostbite-threatening temperatures","WORCESTER, Mass., Feb 3 (Reuters) - A powerful arctic blast swept into the U.S. Northeast on Friday, pushing temperatures to perilously low levels across the region, including New Hampshire's Mount Washington, where the wind chill dropped to 105 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (-79 Celsius), forecasters said.Wind-child warnings were posted for most of New York state and all six New England states - Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine - a region home to some 16 million people.The National Weather Service (NWS) said the deep freeze would be relatively short-lived, but the combination of numbing cold and biting winds gripping the Northeast would pose life-threatening conditions well into Saturday.Schools in Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts, New England's two largest cities, were among those closed on Friday over concerns about the risk of hypothermia and frostbite for children walking to school or waiting for buses.Boston Mayor Michelle Wu declared a state of emergency through Sunday and opened warming centers to help the city's 650,000-plus residents cope with what the NWS has warned was shaping up to be a ""once-in-a-generation"" cold front.The bitter cold forced a rare closing of a floating museum that presents a daily re-enactment of the 1773 Boston Tea Party, when a band of colonists disguised as Native Americans tossed crates of tea taxed by the king into Boston Harbor in protest.""It's too cold for that, we're closed,"" a receptionist at the museum said on Friday.Early on Friday, the arctic surge flowing into the United States from eastern Canada was centered over the U.S. Plains, weather service forecaster Bob Oravec said. Kabetogama, Minnesota, near the Ontario border, was America's coldest spot at 1 p.m. EST, with a temperature of minus 39 F (-39.5 C).Sub-freezing, blustery conditions spread eastward through the day, sending wind-chill factors - measuring the combined effect of wind and cold on the body - plunging into the -40s across much of Maine, NWS meteorologist Brian Hurley said.In Mount Washington State Park, atop the Northeast's highest peak, temperatures fell to minus 45 F (-46 C) Friday evening, with sustained winds of 90 miles per hour driving wind chill to 105 below zero F (-76 C), according to Hurley.By comparison, air temperatures in Eureka, Canada's northernmost Arctic weather station, were hovering at -41 F (-41 C) on Friday morning.Boston was at 8 degrees F (-13 C) on Friday evening, while in Worcester, Massachusetts, 40 miles (64 km) to the west, the mercury hit 3 F (-16 C), with temperatures expected to fall even lower, Hurley said.Record cold was expected in both cities on Saturday. Forecasts called for a low of -6 F in Boston, exceeding an 1886 record -2 for the date. Worcester was headed for a low of -11 on Saturday, which would break its previous 1934 record of -4 for the date.""BEFORE THE REAL COLD HITS""Despite the extreme cold, Nhon Ma, a Belgium native, was out on Friday with his Zinneken's food truck near Boston University selling Belgian waffles made from homemade dough, and keeping warm with three or four waffle irons going at once.""Those create heat, but of course it's cold, it's going to be cold, but we're here,"" Ma said.In a frigid Biddeford, Maine, about 95 miles (150 km) north of Boston, Katie Pinard, owner of a coffee and book shop, said business was brisk as customers came in from the cold, with some opting to work from her shop, Elements: Books Coffee Beer, rather than commute.""Yeah, Mainers are pretty hardy, but talk to me tomorrow and we'll see if we're busy or not,"" she said, looking ahead to Saturday morning, when temperatures were expected to drop to -18 F (-28 C). ""I think people are out and doing what they need to get done before the real cold hits.""While the Northeast was hunkering down, Texas and parts of the South were starting to warm up in the aftermath of a deadly winter ice storm that brought days of freezing rain, sleet and ice, causing massive power outages and dangerously icy roads.But the weather was warming up, with temperatures in Austin, Texas, expected to hit 52 F (11 C) on Friday and 71 F (22 C) by Monday, forecasts say.Meanwhile, a Pacific storm was expected to bring another round of heavy snow to California's Sierra Nevada mountains on Saturday night. Periods of moderate rainfall were forecast in lower elevations of central and northern California and the Pacific Northwest through the weekend.",2023/02/04,152,World

            This will be her first time to report on her progress after arriving in Washington D.C. in July 2020, CNA reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800055,Kitayama leads Pebble Beach as the worst of the wind looms,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Kurt Kitayama is starting to feel more comfortable each time he gets in contention on the PGA Tour, and the Californian can only hope that's the case going into the weekend at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.

            Kitayama opened with 10 straight pars before getting on track and finished birdie-par on two of the tougher holes at Pebble Beach for a 2-under 70 that gave him a one-shot lead Friday.

            Kitayama was at 9-under 134 and led by one over Keith Mitchell, Brandon Wu, Joseph Bramlett and Hank Lebioda.











            The way the forecast looks, getting comfortable on the Monterey Peninsula takes on a different meaning.

            Katayama's last shot at his first PGA Tour win was in the fall in the CJ Cup of South Carolina at Congaree. He was tied for the lead going into the weekend with Jon Rahm, and he was in the final group and one shot behind Rory McIlroy going to the final round.

            He also finished runner-up to Rahm in Mexico last year, and to Xander Schauffele in the Scottish Open.

            “I think the more you put yourself in that position the more you can get comfortable feeling uncomfortable,” Kitayama said. “It’s definitely good experiences to fall back on and use coming Sunday, hopefully.”

            The contenders at Pebble don't have that kind of star power. Of the leading 10 players, only four have won on the PGA Tour and Scott Stallings is the only multiple winner.

            Far more daunting is the fickle weather at this tournament.

            Starting times for Saturday were moved up one hour because of strong wind, and it doesn't take much in these parts for it to be a problem.

            Lebioda felt it coming down the stretch Friday at Pebble Beach. He was leading most of the day until a double bogey on the par-3 fifth hole when he went well left of the green, dumped the next shot in a bunker and took three to get down.

            He finished with a bogey and had to settle for a 72.

            “It was definitely more difficult,” Lebioda said. “I thought there was a little bit more wind during my round than I had yesterday out at Monterey. Course is probably a little bit more difficult, as well. So a combination of those two things made it a challenging round.”

            Lebioda moves over to Spyglass Hill and become a unique footnote in history. Saturday will be his 11th consecutive PGA Tour round on his 11th different course. That's partially a produce of missing his last five cuts on tour.

            He played Port Royal in the Bermuda Championship. He played the Plantation and Seaside courses at Sea Island in the RSM Classic. He started this year playing three courses in The American Express. From there he was off to Torrey Pines on the North and South Course. And this week he's been at Monterey Peninsula, Pebble and Spyglass Hill.

            “We do our best to try to approach each round as its own event,” he said.

            Mitchell (68), Wu (66) and Bramlett (67) all played at Monterey Peninsula.

            Seamus Power of Ireland delivered the low round of a day that began with rain before giving way to steady wind and occasionally chilly weather when the shifting clouds kept the sun away. He had a 64 at Monterey Peninsula to get within two of the lead.

            “The first five, six holes kind of rainy and the ball just wasn’t going anywhere. Not much wind,” Power said. ""Then we got to the turn and then for like an hour, hour-and-a-half, it really blew like pretty strongly there for awhile. The last few holes was very pleasant.

            “It was one of those days kind of like back home in Ireland where you get a lot of seasons in one day.”

            Viktor Hovland, who won a U.S. Amateur and was low amateur in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, is playing this tournament for the first time. He shot 67 at Monterey Peninsula and was three shots to par behind.

            Jordan Spieth had a 68 at Monterey Peninsula and was five behind.

            They next face Pebble Beach, the toughest of the three courses in the wind because so many holes are exposed along the ocean.

            Spieth was hoping for a little better Friday, but he was mildly pleased that the lead didn't get too far away from him.

            “Still in it,” he said. “But we got what looks like a tough couple days coming up.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800056,"Bridges scores 25, leads Suns to 106-94 win over Celtics","BOSTON (AP) — Devin Booker wore a hockey toque to deal with the sub-zero temperatures in Boston and pulled out a baseball metaphor to describe his possible return to the basketball court.

            “Rounding third,” Booker said after watching from the bench as his Phoenix Suns teammates beat the Celtics 106-94 on Friday night. 

            Mikal Bridges scored 25 points and Dario Saric had 14 with 13 rebounds Friday night to lead the Phoenix Suns to a 106-94 victory over Boston and send the NBA-leading Celtics to their fourth loss in six games. 











            Chris Paul added 15 points, eight assists and six rebounds for Phoenix, which had a 20-point, second-quarter lead trimmed to one by the end of the third. The Suns opened the fourth with eight straight points to turn back Boston’s rally. 

            Booker, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, wore a Detroit Red Wings knit cap as he sat on the bench in the same building where he scored 70 points in 2017. He hasn't played since sustaining a groin injury on Christmas; it was just the second time he has joined the team on a road trip since.

            “I'm mindful of what I say because I don't want to get everybody excited about it, or depress everybody, either. It's just where he is,” Suns coach Monty Williams said before the game. “We do feel like he’s getting closer and closer to coming back.""

            The Suns lost nine of their first 11 games after the three-time All-Star went out, but have won seven of the last nine while they wait for his return, which could come during current the five-game road trip.

            “For us to win it without Book is big for everyone’s confidence, because he will be back shortly,” center Jock Landale said. “We would have liked to win a few more games, but now that we’re winning a lot of games and he’s on the verge of coming back, it’s big for us.” 

            Jaylen Brown scored 27 points and Jayson Tatum had 20 for the Celtics, who beat the Brooklyn Nets by 43 points on Wednesday and beat the Suns by 27 in December. But the two Boston All-Stars shot a combined 12 for 36 from the floor and 6 for 22 from 3-point range.

            The Suns led 74-73 to start the fourth quarter before running off the next eight points, prompting Boston coach Joe Mazzulla to call a timeout. Derrick White drove for a layup to snap the slump, but Damion Lee and Saric hit back-to-back 3s, and the Celtics never got closer than six from there. 

            The Celtics scored the first seven points of the game, but quickly gave it all back. Phoenix scored the next 12, with Ayton putting in three straight baskets to start the run. 

            The Suns started the second quarter with back-to-back 3-pointers by Ish Wainright and Lee — sparking another 8-0 run that helped them open a 32-20 lead. It was up to 20 points with four minutes left in the second before Tatum hit his first basket of the game — a 3-pointer — as Boston scored 11 in a row before going into the half trailing 57-44.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800057,Nurse's goal electrifies crowd during NHL skills challenge,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — The cheers at FLA Live Arena were the loudest when Sarah Nurse of Canada’s women’s team scored during the NHL All-Star skills competition Friday night.

            Nurse used a breakaway move made popular by Swedish player Peter Forsberg to fool New York Rangers goalie Igor Shesterkin in a goaltender shooting event, electrifying the crowd.

            “One of my friends, we were talking about this event, and they were like, ‘You should try this,’” Nurse said. She added that it didn't even cross her mind that she was trying the move against the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.











            “I didn't even think about it until afterwards,” she said with a laugh. “I was just like attack the day. Seize the moment.”

            Nurse was joined by fellow Canadian team members Emily Clark and Rebecca Johnston and American players Hilary Knight and Alex Carpenter as female hockey players returned to the ice to participate in several events during skills night.

            “The best part of being a part of All-Star weekend is the kind of visibility it gives our sport,” Clark said. “We’re having a lot of fun, but we’re super glad we’re able to represent women’s hockey and to be on the same ice as some of the best men in the world.”

            Nurse, who is an Olympic gold medalist, wore custom skates highlighting Black History month and the Black Girl Hockey Club, a nonprofit focused on getting more Black girls and women into the sport.

            Women's players spent the week bringing awareness to the women's game through different activities, including an esports gaming event, and Knight, an eight-time world champion and 2018 Olympic gold medalist, said they would love to participate in more events in future All-Star skills challenges. 

            “Whenever there's an opportunity to integrate both men and women together and have the best players on the ice, you're gonna see some great skill and outstanding play,” Knight said. ""Hopefully the future's really bright for the sport to combine at these types of events.

            The players have been involved in the skills competition since 2019, when Americans Kendall Coyne Schofield and Brianna Decker, in addition to Johnston and Canada’s Renata Fast, made appearances. 

            Coyne Schofield became the first woman to compete in the NHL All-Star skills competition, racing around the rink in 14.346 seconds in the fastest skater competition in a barrier-breaking moment for women’s hockey. 

            Friday night, players took shots in a new event the NHL called the “Tendy Tandem,"" which involved one goaltender from each of the four divisions as the shooting goalie and the other goalie from that division as the in-net goalie. 

            The tandem of Nashville Predators goalie Juuse Saros and Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets won the challenge for the Central Division.

            “I just love that we’re showcasing the fact that there are the best hockey players in the world here,” Nurse said, “Regardless of if they’re male or they’re female.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800060,Hield helps Pacers top Kings,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Buddy Hield scored 21 points against his former team and the Indiana Pacers beat the Sacramento Kings 107-104 on Friday night to stop a four-game losing streak.

            Hield shot 5 of 9 from 3-point range and grabbed 10 rebounds. Aaron Nesmith added 17 points for the Pacers, going 4 for 7 on 3s. Myles Turner had 14 points and 13 boards.

            “Especially against your old team, it’s always good to get the win,” Hield said.











            Hield and Tyrese Haliburton were traded to the Pacers a year ago in a six-player deal that sent Domantas Sabonis to the Kings.

            Turner said the Pacers had extra motivation to get the victory for Hield and Haliburton.

            “(Hield) made some big shots down the stretch,” Turner said.

            Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 23 points. Kevin Huerter scored 16, while Sabonis and Terence Davis each had 15.

            Sacramento was without leading scorer De’Aaron Fox, who sat out for personal reasons. 

            Davis sank a 3-pointer with two minutes left to slice the Pacers’ lead to 107-104, but neither team scored the rest of the way.

            Barnes missed a 3 with 9.1 seconds left, and Nesmith came up with the rebound.

            “We didn’t react trying to foul,” Kings coach Mike Brown said. “It’s on us as a staff to remind them to foul, if we’re down three and the clock is below 24 seconds and we're down three points or two or one. That’s just a teaching point.”

            Brown thought his team had several problems in the final quarter.

            “You've got to be able to box out,"" he said. “You can’t give up second shots. We didn’t do any of that down the stretch. Throughout the course of the game, our turnovers were terrible. It really hurt in a one-possession game to have 20 of them on the road. Our inability to communicate on defense against a team — and give up too many good looks — that can shoot like the Pacers, was not good.""

            The Pacers, who led by 12 at halftime, took a 19-point lead in the third quarter before the Kings ended the period with a 20-8 run to narrow the deficit to 87-80 after three.

            Indiana went 10 of 21 on 3s to take a 60-48 halftime lead. In contrast, the Kings were 6 for 23 from long range in the opening half.

            The Pacers scored 14 straight points to build a 51-39 advantage. Nesmith hit a trio of 3-pointers during the stretch.

            Haliburton, playing his second game after missing 10 with an elbow sprain and knee bruise, acknowledged he was tired after the game and struggled to make shots. He had 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting and nine assists.

            “We knew the way they play, you’re going to have to make it a gritty game, an ugly game,” Haliburton said. “You need to be able to play defense and get stops, and we were able to do that tonight.”

            TIP-INS

            Kings: The Pacers showed a pregame tribute to Sabonis on the scoreboard during his first game back in Indiana since the trade. Sabonis was inactive due to a knee injury when Sacramento played at Indiana last March. … Trey Lyles, the 2014 Indiana Mr. Basketball from Indianapolis Tech High School, scored seven points off the bench.

            Pacers: Daniel Theis, in his second game of the season, scored eight points off the bench. Theis, traded to the Pacers from Boston, returned Thursday after having knee surgery in November. … With the return of Theis, two other Pacers post players, Jalen Smith and Isaiah Jackson, didn’t play.

            BIG DUNK

            Hield isn't known for his dunking ability, but he had a big one to put the Pacers up 104-99.

            “That's number one,” Hield said. “I'm never the one cutting to the middle or baseline. I saw an opening and that's all she wrote. I trusted my legs. It was fun. My teammates were excited. They're always joking about me not dunking the ball. It was fun to see them laughing.”

            The brawl broke out in front of the Orlando bench late in the third quarter, when Minnesota guard Austin Rivers and Magic center Mo Bamba got into an altercation. Bamba came off the bench and Rivers threw punches at him in a tussle that spilled over to include several others on the court.

            As play initially continued at the far end, Jalen Suggs pulled Rivers away from Bamba and to the ground while other players joined in. Rivers, Jaden McDaniels and Taurean Prince were ejected for the Timberwolves, who had lost forward Kyle Anderson earlier in the game due to injury. Bamba and Suggs were tossed for Orlando.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800062,"N. Carolina Supreme Court to rehear voter ID, redistricting","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The new Republican majority on North Carolina's Supreme Court agreed on Friday to rehear redistricting and voter identification cases less than two months after the court's previous edition, led by Democrats, issued major opinions going against GOP legislators who had been sued. 

            The extraordinary decisions, granted in orders backed by five justices with the Republican voter registrations on the seven-member court, mean the issues will return to the court for oral arguments in mid-March. With hopes of getting new legal results, lawmakers led by House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger asked two weeks ago that the justices rehear the litigation. 

            The two Democratic justices lamented the orders and said they stood against more than 200 years of court history in which rehearings have been exceedingly rare. They said it appeared it was happening simply because the court's partisan makeup had changed. Two new Republican justices took office in early January after winning November elections for seats held by Democrats. 











            “The legal issues are the same; the evidence is the same; and the controlling law is the same,” Associate Justice Anita Earls wrote in the dissent of the order agreeing to rehear the redistricting case. “The only thing that has changed is the political composition of the Court.”

            The GOP lawmakers' attorneys contend the previous 4-3 Democratic majority got it wrong in December when they struck down a state Senate map the legislature drew and upheld congressional boundaries drawn by trial judges but opposed by Republicans. They said those same Democrats erred when upholding the invalidation of a 2018 law requiring photo identification to vote when they applied the wrong legal standard.

            The rehearings ultimately could lead to new opinions that reinstate the photo ID mandate and strike down precedent from the Supreme Court in February 2022 declaring the state constitution outlawed extensive partisan gerrymandering. That landmark redistricting ruling prevented maps drawn by Republican legislators that were expected to secure long-term Republican advantages in the General Assembly and within the state's congressional delegation. 

            The court's rehearing orders mentioned little about the topics to be reconsidered. Rather, the court said a case can be reheard “if the petitioner makes a satisfactory showing that the opinion may be erroneous."" The legislators' petition or arguments met the requirements, the orders said.

            But Earls wrote Friday's action marked a “radical break” from the court's history. Since 1993 alone, she said, rehearing had been allowed in only two cases out of 214 such requests. 

            “Respect for the institution and the integrity of its processes kept opportunities for rehearing narrow in scope and exceedingly rare,"" she wrote. ""Today, that tradition is abandoned.” Associate Justice Mike Morgan also dissented. 

            Moore and Berger had not offered public comment on the orders by late Friday. 

            The Republican majority on the court also threw out a petition filed earlier this week by redistricting lawsuit plaintiff Common Cause urging that the GOP requests be denied and the ruling remain intact. The advocacy group, which argued the rehearing request was improper, is ""disappointed the Court is giving legislators another bite at the apple,” said Hilary Klein, an attorney who filed the Common Cause motion. 

            “We will continue to fight for the rights of all people in North Carolina to vote freely and fairly and look forward to making that case again before the court,"" Jeff Loperfido, one of the lawyers who worked to overturn the voter ID law, said in a statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800073,Longtime AP country music chronicler Joe Edwards dies at 75,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Journalist Joe Edwards, who chronicled country music and helped “Rocky Top” become a Tennessee state song during his four-decade Associated Press career, has died. He was 75.

            Longtime AP colleague Randall Dickerson said Edwards’ wife called him to share the news that her husband died Friday after a lengthy illness in Nashville. 

            Edwards documented the ascent of country music through interviews with stars ranging from Dolly Parton to Taylor Swift. He wrote the AP’s Nashville Sound country music column from 1975 to 1992 and did commentary for The Nashville Network cable TV station in the 1980s.











            When Edwards retired in 2012, Reba McEntire said in a video tribute: “I’ll never forget the first time you interviewed me at the very beginning of my career, and I’ll never forget how sweet you were always to me.”

            In 1982, a story Edwards wrote about the popularity of the song ""Rocky Top"" led the General Assembly to declare it a state song.

            ""He got the ball rolling,"" Boudleaux Bryant, the song's co-writer, said at the time.

            He also covered sports and a variety of other topics during his AP career, which was spent entirely in Nashville. He worked most of the jobs in the Nashville bureau, including sports editor, broadcast editor and day and night supervisor. 

            Edwards was among those covering the death of Elvis Presley in 1977. He also reported about or edited stories from more than 20 Country Music Association awards shows.

            He was nominated for several AP writing awards in the 1970s and 1980s.

            ""I just show up on time and do what I'm told,"" he once said.

            He wrote often about the syndicated TV show ""Hee Haw,"" and he once appeared on camera with its cast members.

            Edwards began his AP career in 1970 after graduating from Eastern Kentucky University. Prior to that, he attended Vincennes University in Indiana.

            While in college, he worked for the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Crawfordsville, Indiana, Journal-Review. 

            Shortly after taking the job in Nashville, he periodically played basketball with Al Gore, then a reporter for The Nashville Tennessean. Gore later became vice president.

            ""He was a pretty good rebounder,"" Edwards recalled.

            Country music stars he interviewed also included Garth Brooks, Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers, Barbara Mandrell and Loretta Lynn. For several years, Edwards voted on nominees for the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

            He specialized in writing obituaries, including those for music stars Johnny Cash, Porter Wagoner, Roy Orbison, Bill Monroe and Carl Perkins.

            In 2010, he wrote extensively about the Nashville flooding that left much of the city submerged for several days. But he preferred reporting about more light-hearted topics, such as the taster at the Jack Daniel's distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee.

            Also, Edwards traditionally wrote a year-end story annually wrapping up Tennessee's offbeat happenings of the year.

            ""People call and ask if I'm going to do the weird story again,"" he said.

            In the early 1970s, as bureau sports editor, Edwards spearheaded an effort to include girls high school basketball scores on the AP wire and to have a girls poll join the one for boys.NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800076,VanVleet has 32 as Raptors get 117-111 win over Rockets,"HOUSTON (AP) — Fred VanVleet scored 32 points, Gary Trent Jr. added 29 and the Toronto Raptors snapped a two-game skid with a 117-111 win over the Houston Rockets on Friday night. 

            The Raptors took a commanding lead in the third quarter and were up by double-digits for most of the fourth. But five straight free throws by the Rockets cut the lead to 110-104 with about 30 seconds left. 

            Pascal Siakam, who had 23 points, made two free throws after that to pad the lead. 











            Both teams made two free throws before Daishen Nix made a basket to slice Houston's deficit to six again. VanVleet made one of two free throws before a 3 by Jabari Smith Jr. made it 115-111 with 1.2 seconds to go.

            Trent added two free throws to secure the victory. 

            Nearing the end of a long road trip, Toronto coach Nick Nurse could sense his team dragging a bit early in this one. But he liked how the Raptors responded after a sluggish first quarter.

            “There wasn't a lot of energy in the building or from us at the start,” he said. “But give our guys off the bench some credit to come in and get some energy going. They kind of righted the ship and got into some good, nice stretches there of playing at both ends.”

            Nurse was impressed with the performance of VanVleet, who has been playing well lately after a slow start to the season. 

            “He really looks good,” Nurse said. “He’s playing hard. He looks fast and athletic. ... He's shooting the ball with tremendous confidence. He’s been really good on defense, too.”

            Houston got a season-high 28 points from Eric Gordon and Alperen Sengun added 21 on night when Jalen Green missed a third straight game with a bruised right calf. 

            A 12-5 run, with five points from Martin, got the Rockets within 98-90 with about 5½ minutes to play. 

            Toronto scored five of the next seven points to make it 103-92 a couple of minutes later.

            Toronto had a seven-point lead at halftime and scored the first eight points of the third quarter, with 3s from Siakam and VanVleet, to make it 63-48.

            Silas was disappointed with the way his team opened the second half.

            “They come out and score 8 and then they're up by 15, like right away, and that’s unacceptable,” he said. “We've got to start the second halves much better.”

            Gordon agreed.

            “We have to have a better sense of urgency and we've got to come in with a lot of energy just like the first quarter,” he said. “It's about dictating the game from the start and once we do, it'll get us in a better groove.”

            Gordon made a basket for Houston after that, but VanVleet made 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to push the lead to 69-50 with about 9½ minutes left in the third. 

            An 11-3 run by the Rockets later in the third cut the lead to 74-65. But the Raptors used a 9-4 spurt to push their advantage to 83-69 with less than three minutes left in the period.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800077,Embiid's double-double keys 76ers as Spurs drop 8th straight,"SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Joel Embiid had 33 points and 10 rebounds and the Philadelphia 76ers beat San Antonio 137-125 on Friday night, sending the scuffling Spurs to their eighth straight loss.

            Tyrese Maxey had 25 points and James Harden added 16 for Philadelphia, which has the third-best record in the Eastern Conference.

            “Tonight was one of those games where it was difficult to get up,” Harden said. “But you’ve got to still be professional. You’ve got to be an elite team. That’s where we are trying to get to consistently. We weren’t consistent enough tonight. 











            ""We got a win, but we’ve got to try to be better overall.”

            San Antonio rookie Malaki Branham set a season high for the second straight game with 26 points, eclipsing his 22-point outing Wednesday in a loss to Sacramento. 

            Keldon Johnson added 18 points and Jakob Poeltl had 16 points and 10 rebounds in San Antonio’s final home game before embarking on a nine-game road trip that ends Feb. 28. 

            The Spurs are 9-37 since opening the season 5-2. 

            Embiid, Harden and Tobias Harris returned to the court with five minutes remaining after San Antonio trimmed Philadelphia's 22-point lead to just 10 at 122-112. Embiid and Harden combined for eight points and three rebounds in 3 1/2 minutes to seal the victory.

            “A couple of us older guys on the bench were happy for them when they brought it back all the way to like 10 or nine points,” Poeltl said. “Made them bring their starters back in. It was fun to watch them out there just playing free, playing aggressive.” 

            Embiid, who was listed as questionable with a sore left foot, was 10 for 18 from the field, 2 for 3 on 3-pointers and 11 for 13 on free throws in an efficient 29 minutes. Named an All-Star reserve Thursday, Embiid added four assists and two steals.

            The Spurs were without injured starters Devin Vassell, Jeremy Sochan and Tre Jones, as well as Romeo Langford, who has started 19 games.

            Their absence contributed to San Antonio committing 18 turnovers that led to 26 points for Philadelphia.

            “Giving up 26 points off turnovers makes it impossible (to win),” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “That was the most disappointing part of the game. Their grunt and their ability to just play the game is super, but taking care of the basketball is pretty important and we didn’t do that tonight. That was the bad part of the game.”

            Philadelphia started the game with three straight turnovers in falling behind 8-1. The 76ers rallied to end the first quarter tied at 26 and then outscored the Spurs 47-35 in the second quarter.

            The run included a one-handed alley-oop dunk by Embiid on a pass from Harden followed by a fastbreak dunk by Harris in building a 66-49 lead.

            The second unit then began a charge that ended in Philadelphia’s bench outscoring San Antonio’s 67-42.

            “That’s what we’re going to need from them,” Harden said. “Consistently they run their sets. With that unit, it’s about just getting stops. We get stops, we give ourselves a chance to get out in transition.”

            TIP-INS

            76ers: Harden said he was fine after exiting for the locker room with a second remaining in the first half after falling on his elbow late in the first half. Harden returned early for warmups and started the second half. ... Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers was honored before the game as part of the Spurs’ 50th anniversary celebration. Rivers played his final two seasons in the NBA with the Spurs, beginning in 1994. ... Play was stopped midway through the first quarter so the 76ers could tend to a minor cut near Embiid’s right thumb that was bleeding. Embiid drained a 3-pointer on the next play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800078,"Fight between Magic, Timberwolves leads to 5 players ejected","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A fight broke out and punches were thrown during the game between the Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night.

            Five players were ejected following the brawl, which started in front of the Orlando bench late in the third quarter. Minnesota guard Austin Rivers and Magic center Mo Bamba were the initial players involved, and it spilled over to include several others on the court.

            Rivers, Jaden McDaniels and Taurean Prince were ejected from the Timberwolves. Jalen Suggs was tossed along with Bamba for Orlando, which went on to win 127-120.











            “This isn’t like a cool moment for me,” Rivers said after the game. “I feel embarrassed. I’m the oldest on the team. I consider myself the leader of the team, or one of the leaders of the team. It was a weird game, and I don’t think that helped at all. If anything right now, I’m just (ticked off) that we lost, and that I had (something) to do with that. It doesn’t make me feel good.”

            Bamba and Suggs were not available for comment after the game.

            “You obviously want to have your teammate's back and at the same time, you’ve got to be a professional,"" said Orlando center Moritz Wagner, also involved in a skirmish with Detroit in December. 

            ""So, that’s a challenge for a young team like us. I think this time around we did a good job compared to last time. So, yeah, I don’t really know. It’s a weird dynamic. You don’t really want to be in those situations and it’s not really the best look. You want to be professional. At the same time, there is something in me that appreciates the team sticking together like that.”

            Wagner appeared to get knocked out in that fight with the Pistons in Detroit. Wagner and Detroit's Killian Hayes and Hamadou Diallo were all ejected.

            On this night, the fight began with Rivers right in front of the Magic bench as play was ongoing at the far end of the court. Bamba came off the bench and Rivers threw punches at him. Suggs later pulled Rivers away and swung him to the court. McDaniels and Prince joined the scrum.

            “Their guy came off the bench and threw a punch,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “Pretty egregious. Then it’s a melee, and somehow our guys get punished a lot worse. One guy got sent for not being a peacekeeper. I just looked at the film, and I didn’t see any difference between what their guys were doing and what our guys were doing.”

            The altercation seemed to stem from talk from the Magic bench, particularly Bamba. A few moments earlier, Rivers missed a 3-point attempt in front of the Orlando bench, and Bamba and Markelle Fultz could be seen reacting to the miss.

            Rivers said he approached the 7-foot, 231-pound Bamba about his comments.

            “I’m not gonna snitch on the dude or whatever, but I just didn’t like the way he was talking to me,” said Rivers, listed at 6-4 and 200 pounds. “For no reason, too. I don’t even know that dude. I don’t know anything about him. Obviously, I just know he’s a player for the Magic. And he proceeded to talk, so that next possession, when I went down there, I just said, pretty much, ‘Just keep it respectful, bro.’”

            Rivers later added: “I went up to him and I pressed him, and at that point, it can go one of two ways. I didn’t think we were going to get in a fight. But when you stand up that fast and put your hands up — he threw a punch and missed, thankfully. At that point, I've got to protect myself. Ain’t no one worried about him.""

            The fight came one night after an on-court altercation between Memphis Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks and Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell.

            Brooks swung and struck Mitchell in the groin area during the third quarter Thursday after the Grizzlies guard had fallen to the floor. Mitchell retaliated by throwing the ball at Brooks and then shoving him.

            Both players were ejected from Cleveland’s 128-113 win. Afterward, Mitchell accused Brooks of being a dirty player.

            
                The NBA announced punishments for both players Friday, with Brooks getting suspended one game without pay and Mitchell fined $20,000.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800098,"Mensah, No. 22 Aztecs beat Boise State 72-52 for MWC lead","SAN DIEGO (AP) — Nathan Mensah scored 17 points as No. 22 San Diego State raced past Boise State 72-52 Friday night in a showdown of the Mountain West Conference's top two teams despite an off night by Aztecs' leading scorers Matt Bradley and Darrion Trammell.

            Keshad Johnson added 10 for SDSU (18-5, 9-2), which regained sole possession of first place. Bradley came in leading the Aztecs at 13.2 points per game but didn't score until making a jumper with 9:16 to play, finishing with three points. Trammell came in averaging 11.1 and didn't score until making a shot earlier in the second half, finishing with four.

            Max Rice scored 16 for Boise State (18-6, 8-3), which was without its leading ballhandler, point guard Marcus Shaver Jr., who was out with a high ankle sprain. Shaver had a walking boot on his right foot. 











            BSU beat SDSU three times last year, including in championship game of the conference tournament. 

            The Aztecs raced to a 43-21 halftime lead despite getting zero points from Bradley and Trammell. Mensah led the way with 12 points and Adam Seiko had nine. 

            “I’m extremely pleased with our performance tonight. I thought we put 40 minutes together,” said coach Brian Dutcher, whose Aztecs were coming off a nine-point loss at Nevada in which they didn’t play well in the second half. “We’ve obviously played 20 minutes of great basketball most games, usually the first half, but the second half I thought we came out and competed at a higher level than we had. That said, we got outscored by two points. But we didn’t see the drastic give up 10, 12 extra points that we have in these other games.”

            Mensah had six points during a 14-0 run that carried the Aztecs to a 29-10 lead with 5:47 left before halftime. Seiko made two 3-pointers, including a 27-footer to cap the run just before a timeout. An SDSU team manager who goes to the scorer's table to get stats during timeouts was whistled for a technical for putting his thumb and pinkie up to his ear as if to say, “Dial up a 3,"" and BSU's Max Rice made both free throws.

            Dutcher said he didn't see it, but figured the ref probably thought the manager was taunting BSU.

            “I’m glad it wasn’t at the end of a two-point game and glad we had a cushion,” Dutcher said. “No technical is good, but I’m sure he’ll have a memory for the rest of his life.”

            The combination of SDSU's defense and the absence of Shaver was too much for the Broncos. BSU shot only 33.3% in the first half and was called for a 10-second violation late in the first half. The Aztecs blocked three shots in the first 20 minutes, two by Aguek Arop and one by Mensah.

            Mensah blocked a shot with three minutes left that set up a slam dunk by Johnson on an alley-oop pass from Seiko for a 70-50 lead.

            Mensah drew 10 fouls and made 9 of 12 free throws. 

            “It's because he was aggressive,” Dutcher said. “Some of them were because we threw it to him, and two or three of them were because he was going to the offensive glass and they had to push him to box him out. I thought he played as good a game as he's played all year tonight.”

            BSU shot only 36.5% from the field, while SDSU shot 51%.

            BIG PICTURE

            Boise State: The Broncos clearly missed Shaver, who besides being third on the team in scoring at 13.2 points was leading the Broncos with 6.3 rebounds and had a team-high 79 assists.

            San Diego State: It'll be touch-and-go whether the Aztecs remain in the AP Top 25. After popping back into the poll on Monday, the Aztecs lost 75-66 at Nevada on Tuesday night.

Bradley came in leading the Aztecs at 13.2 points per game but didn't score until making a jumper with 9:16 to play, finishing with three points. Trammell came in averaging 11.1 and didn't score until making a shot earlier in the second half, finishing with four.Max Rice scored 16 for Boise State (18-6, 8-3), which was without its leading ballhandler, point guard Marcus Shaver Jr., who was out with a high ankle sprain. Shaver had a walking boot on his right foot.BSU beat SDSU three times last year, including in championship game of the conference tournament.The Aztecs raced to a 43-21 halftime lead despite getting zero points from Bradley and Trammell. Mensah led the way with 12 points and Adam Seiko had nine.“I’m extremely pleased with our performance tonight. I thought we put 40 minutes together,” said coach Brian Dutcher, whose Aztecs were coming off a nine-point loss at Nevada in which they didn’t play well in the second half. “We’ve obviously played 20 minutes of great basketball most games, usually the first half, but the second half I thought we came out and competed at a higher level than we had. That said, we got outscored by two points. But we didn’t see the drastic give up 10, 12 extra points that we have in these other games.”Mensah had six points during a 14-0 run that carried the Aztecs to a 29-10 lead with 5:47 left before halftime. Seiko made two 3-pointers, including a 27-footer to cap the run just before a timeout.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800099,"Magic beat Wolves 127-120 after fight, 5 players ejected","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Cole Anthony had 20 points and fellow reserve Moritz Wagner scored 19 as Orlando’s bench propelled the Magic to a 127-120 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves that included a fight between the teams and five player ejections Friday night.

            The brawl broke out in front of the Orlando bench late in the third quarter, when Minnesota guard Austin Rivers and Magic center Mo Bamba got into an altercation. Bamba came off the bench and Rivers threw punches at him in a tussle that spilled over to include several others on the court.

            As play initially continued at the far end, Jalen Suggs pulled Rivers away from Bamba and to the ground while other players joined in.











            “You obviously want to have your teammate's back and at the same time, you’ve got to be a professional,” said Wagner, who was ejected after a fight with the Detroit Pistons in December. “So, that’s a challenge for a young team like us. I think this time around we did a good job compared to last time. So, yeah, I don’t really know. It’s a weird dynamic. You don’t really want to be in those situations and it’s not really the best look. You want to be professional. At the same time, there is something in me that appreciates the team sticking together like that.”

            Rivers, Jaden McDaniels and Taurean Prince were ejected for the Timberwolves, who had lost forward Kyle Anderson earlier in the game due to injury. Bamba and Suggs were tossed for Orlando.

            Reserve big man Bol Bol had 14 points for the Magic, who got 72 points from their bench. Orlando had lost three of four, but got a rare strong defensive performance that was aided by Suggs’ on-ball defense before he was ejected.

            “You've got to keep playing,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. “You have to win the game between the lines. It’s not about all the talking. It’s not about any of that. You've got to make sure you play the right way, do the right thing, continue to share the basketball and continue to defend.”

            D’Angelo Russell had 29 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota, which had won six of eight. Anthony Edwards added 19 points and Rudy Gobert scored 15.

            The Timberwolves shot 46% from the field and committed 20 turnovers, leading to 26 points for Orlando.

            “I don’t think our approach was wrong,” Minnesota coach Chris Finch said. “I think our execution was soft. And we wanted it to be a little easier than it was. Knew it would be a physical game. We had a hard time containing the ball. So yeah, felt like they were ready to play. They understood. When a little adversity hit, we really couldn’t stop it.”

            The Magic started the day 23rd in the NBA in defensive rating, but their youth and length challenged Minnesota — particularly Edwards. 

            The budding star had scored at least 25 points in seven straight games and had more than 30 in five of them. But he shot just 5 of 15 from the field and 1 for 7 from 3-point territory.

            HOT TEMPERS 

            The fight appeared to come on suddenly, with no previous sign of potential problems.

            A few moments earlier, Rivers missed a 3-pointer right in front of the Orlando bench and replays showed the 7-foot Bamba and Markelle Fultz reacting while watching Rivers run back up the court. The 6-foot-4 Rivers said he took issue with Bamba's comments. 

            “I’m just like, ‘Yo, what are you doing?’,” Rivers said. “I went up to him and I pressed him, and at that point, it can go one of two ways. I didn’t think we were going to get in a fight. But when you stand up that fast and put your hands up — he threw a punch and missed, thankfully. At that point I've got to protect myself. Ain’t no one worried about him.”

            TIP-INS

            Magic: Wendell Carter Jr. was held out due to a right plantar fascia strain. Bamba started in his place and had 11 points. … Suggs scored all 10 of his points in the second quarter. ... Orlando had 13 offensive rebounds and 28 second-chance points.

            Timberwolves: Anderson left early in the first quarter with back spasms and didn’t return. … Gobert returned after missing one game with right groin soreness.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800106,"Young scores 27 to lead Hawks past Jazz, 115-108","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Trae Young had 27 points and six assists to lead the Atlanta Hawks to a 115-108 victory over the Utah Jazz on Friday night. 

            De’Andre Hunter scored 26 points for the Hawks. Onyeka Okongwu had 15 points and 11 rebounds, and Dejounte Murray added 13 points and eight assists. 

            Atlanta won for the third time in its last four road games. 











            “I feel like winning on the road comes down to energy,” Hunter said. “You know the crowd is going to be behind the home team, so we just rally around each other to build that energy. Once we have energy, everything else just flows.”

            The Hawks went to the rim early and it paid off. They had 28 assists on 44 baskets and scored 56 points in the paint.

            “We have to be aggressive,” coach Nate McMillan said. “We don’t want to just sit out there and settle for the perimeter shots. I think we’re creating opportunities when we’re being aggressive, attacking the rim, attacking the paint.""

            Lauri Markkanen had 25 points and 10 rebounds to pace Utah. Jordan Clarkson scored 24, and Mike Conley finished with 20 points and eight assists.

            Utah struggled from the outside, going 13 of 44 from 3-point range. The Jazz had a three-game home winning streak snapped. 

            “We did a pretty good job on the shooters all night,” Young said. “I think that helped us.”

            Atlanta dominated on both ends of the court throughout the first half. The Hawks built a 60-38 lead late in the second quarter after Young bookended an 8-0 run with a 3-pointer and a pair of free throws. 

            Utah made only one 3-pointer in the first quarter and just five outside baskets by halftime. 

            “Those tough misses maybe affected us,” Markkanen said. “I felt like I forced (shots) up after I saw a couple roll, so I wanted to go try again.”

            Utah chipped away at the deficit in the second half and rallied late in the fourth quarter. Clarkson buried consecutive 3-pointers to punctuate a 10-0 run and cut Atlanta’s lead to 106-101 with 3:17 left. Young countered with a 3 to keep the Hawks in control. 

            Atlanta held off the Jazz in the end because Utah struggled to get stops even after making baskets. 

            “They have a lot of very good offensive players and if you’re not detailed in your defense, they can punish you,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said. 

            DOUBLE DUTY 

            Hunter turned in one of his most complete games of the season. The fourth-year forward made a season-high 10 field goals and set a season best for points. Defensively, he drew the assignment of guarding Markkanen. Hunter found a way to slow the Jazz All-Star long enough to help keep Utah’s offense off balance for much of the game.

            “He’s the All-Star on their team,” Hunter said. “Slowing him down definitely will slow the team down. That was my main thing, just trying to make it as tough as possible for him.”

            TIP-INS 

            Hawks: John Collins scored all 10 of his points in the first quarter. Collins started 3 of 5 from the field but went 0 for 5 over the final three quarters. … Clint Capela grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds. 

            Jazz: Conley played in his 1,000th career game. … Jarred Vanderbilt finished with a team-best 11 rebounds. … Clarkson started 1 of 9 from the field before making nine of his last 12 shots.

The number of deaths was down from the 105 reported Friday (Feb. 3), a high ascribed to a backlog created by slower recording and reporting during the Jan. 20-29 Lunar New Year holiday.Saturday’s new local cases included 10,464 males and 12,872 females ranging in age from under 5 to their 90s.

            Cameron Brink added 10 points and eight rebounds to help Stanford (22-2, 10-1 Pac-12) improve to 72-0 against Washington State (15-7, 5-6).

            ’They have a great team, they’re very talented and we had to play really hard,” Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said. “The last time we played them was really close and so we knew we had to bring it, and we did.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800124,Dems reshuffle primaries to stress diversity over tradition,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Democratic Party on Saturday approved reordering its 2024 presidential primary, replacing Iowa with South Carolina in the leadoff spot as part of a major shake-up meant to empower Black and other minority voters critical to its base of support.

            Although more changes are possible later this year, the formal endorsement by the Democratic National Committee during its meeting in Philadelphia is an acknowledgement that the start of the 2024 primary will look very different from the one in 2020. Hundreds of party stalwarts climbed to their feet and cheered after the easy passage by voice vote.

            States with early contests play a major role in determining the nominee because White House hopefuls struggling to raise money or gain political traction often drop out before visiting states outside the first five. Media attention and policy debates concentrate in those areas, too.











            
                The new plan was championed by President Joe Biden, who is expected to formally announce his reelection campaign in the coming months. The reconfiguring would have South Carolina hold its primary on Feb. 3, followed three days later by New Hampshire and Nevada, which is swapping the caucus it used to hold in favor of a primary.

            Georgia would vote fourth on Feb. 13, followed by Michigan on Feb. 27, with much of the rest of the nation set to vote on Super Tuesday in early March.

            “The Democratic Party looks like America and so does this proposal,” said DNC chair Jaime Harrison, a South Carolinian. The change “continues to make us stronger and elevates the backbone of our party,” he said. 

            Biden wrote the DNC rules committee in December, saying, “We must ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process and throughout the entire early window.” That committee approved the new lineup, setting up Saturday’s vote.

            The move remakes the current calendar, which saw Iowa start with its caucus, followed by New Hampshire and then Nevada and South Carolina. The Republican Party has voted not to change its 2024 primary order, meaning the campaign has already began in Iowa. 

            “The DNC has decided to break a half-century precedent and cause chaos by altering their primary process, and ultimately abandoning millions of Americans in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement Saturday. 

            Four of the first five new states under Democrats' new plan are battlegrounds, meaning the eventual party winner would be able to lay groundwork in important general election spots. That’s especially true for Michigan and Georgia, both of which voted for Republican Donald Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020. 

            The exception is South Carolina, which hasn’t backed a Democrat in a presidential race since 1976, leading some to argue that the party shouldn’t be concentrating so many early primary resources there. But the state’s population is nearly 27% Black, and African American voters represent Democrats’ most consistent base of support. Iowa and New Hampshire are each more than 90% white.

            The revamped calendar could be largely meaningless for 2024 because Biden is expected to run for a second term without a major primary challenge. Also, the DNC has already pledged to revisit the voting calendar before the 2028 presidential election.

            Still, this year’s changes could establish precedent, just as a new lineup that moved Nevada and South Carolina into the first states to vote did when the DNC approved a new primary calendar before the 2008 presidential election.

            “These things may be symbolic, but they’re realistic,” South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, assistant Democratic leader in the House and a close Biden ally, told The Associated Press. 

            The new order follows technical glitches that caused Iowa’s 2020 caucus to meltdown. It also gives Biden the chance to repay South Carolina, where he scored a decisive 2020 primary win that revived his presidential campaign after losses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.

            Democrats have worked on overhauling their primary lineup for months. On Saturday, nearly an hour of final debate turned raw at times.

            Some Black members of the DNC said those arguing to abide by tradition could be seen as implying that states with larger African American populations were incapable of handling the responsibility of going early in the primary. 

            “If we're really a family, it means some of y'all got to shift to make room at the table for others,” said Leah Daughtry, a DNC rules committee member from New York. 

            Iowa Democratic Party chair Rita Hart argued that Republicans in her state were already accusing Democrats of “have turned their back on Iowa and on rural America."" But Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, to sustained applause, countered: ""No one state should have a lock on going first.” 

            Despite the approval, the final slate is not yet set. South Carolina, Nevada and Michigan have met party requirements to join the party’s new top five. But in Georgia may not change its Democratic primary calendar date without the Republicans also doing so.

            Iowa argued that continued uncertainty could cause other states to try and jump ahead of the new DNC calendar, as happened before the 2008 presidential race. The new rules include penalties for states trying to move up without permission, including possibly losing delegates to the party’s national convention. 

            New Hampshire has a state law mandating that it hold the nation’s first presidential primary, which Iowa circumvented since 1972 by holding a caucus. New Hampshire Democrats have joined with top state Republicans in pledging to go forward with the nation’s first presidential primary next year regardless of the DNC calendar. 

            No major challenger has yet emerged from his own party to run against Biden for president next year. Still, top New Hampshire Democrats have warned that another Democrat could run in an unsanctioned primary the state stages and, if Biden skips it in accordance with party rules, could win and embarrass the president — prolonging a primary process that wasn’t supposed to be competitive. 

            “Respecting our state law and lifting up diverse voices need not be mutually exclusive,” said Joanne Dowdell, a DNC rules committee member from New Hampshire.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800125,China balloon: Many questions about suspected spy in the sky,"WASHINGTON (AP) — What in the world was that thing?

            The massive white orb that drifted across U.S. airspace this week and was shot down by the Air Force over the Atlantic on live television Saturday triggered a diplomatic maelstrom and blew up on social media.

            
                China insists the balloon was just an errant civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research that went off course due to winds and had only limited “self-steering” capabilities. It also issued a threat of “further actions.”











            In a statement after the craft was shot down, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the use of force by the U.S. was “an obvious overreaction and a serious violation of international practice. It added: ”China will resolutely uphold the relevant company’s legitimate rights and interests, and at the same time reserving the right to take further actions in response.” 

            The United States says it was a Chinese spy balloon without a doubt. Its presence prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a weekend trip to China that was aimed at dialing down tensions that were already high between the countries.

            The Pentagon says the balloon, which was carrying sensors and surveillance equipment, was maneuverable and showed it could change course. It loitered over sensitive areas of Montana where nuclear warheads are siloed, leading the military to take actions to prevent it from collecting intelligence.

            A U.S. Air Force fighter jet shot down the balloon Saturday afternoon off the Carolina coast. Television footage showed a small explosion, followed by the balloon slowly drifting toward the water. An operation is underway to recover the remnants.

            A look at what’s known about the balloon — and what isn’t:

            IT'S A BIRD, IT'S A PLANE, IT'S A ... SPY BALLOON

            The Pentagon and other U.S. officials say it was a Chinese spy balloon — about the size of three school buses — that moved east over America at an altitude of about 60,000 feet (18,600 meters). The U.S. says it was being used for surveillance and intelligence collection, but officials have provided few details. 

            U.S. defense and military officials said Saturday that the balloon entered the U.S. air defense zone north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved over land across Alaska and into Canadian airspace in the Northwest Territories on Jan. 30. The next day it crossed back into U.S. territory over northern Idaho. U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic.

            The White House said Biden was first briefed on the balloon on Tuesday. The State Department said Blinken and Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman spoke with China's senior Washington-based official on Wednesday evening about the matter.

            In the first public U.S. statement, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Thursday evening that the balloon was not a military or physical threat — an acknowledgement that it was not carrying weapons. He said that ""once the balloon was detected, the U.S. government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information.” 

            Even if the balloon was not armed, it posed a risk to the U.S., said retired Army Gen. John Ferrari, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The flight itself, he said, could be used to test America's ability to detect incoming threats and to find holes in the country's air defense warning system. It may also have allowed the Chinese to sense electromagnetic emissions that higher-altitude satellites cannot detect, such as low-power radio frequencies that could help them understand how different U.S. weapons systems communicate.

            ___

            IT JUST TOOK ONE SHOT

            On Wednesday as the balloon loitered over Montana, Biden authorized the military to shoot it down as soon as it was in a location where there would not be undue risk to civilians. Due to its massive size and altitude, the debris field of its sensors and the balloon itself was expected to stretch for miles. So, top military and defense leaders advised Biden not to take it down over land, even when it was over sparsely populated areas.

            At 2:39 p.m. Saturday, as the balloon flew in U.S. airspace about 6 nautical miles off the coast of South Carolina, a single F-22 fighter jet from Virginia’s Langley Air Force Base — flying at an altitude of 58,000 feet — fired an AIM-9X Sidewinder into it. The Sidewinder is a short-range missile used by the Navy and Air Force primarily for air-to-air engagements, the missile is about 10 feet long and weighs about 200 pounds.

            Live news feeds showed the moment of impact, as the balloon collapsed and began a lengthy fall into the Atlantic. 

            The F-22 was supported by an array of Air Force and Air National Guard fighter jets and tankers, including F-15s from Massachusetts and tanker aircraft from Oregon, Montana, Massachusetts, South Carolina and North Carolina. All pilots returned safely to base and there were no injuries or other damage on the ground, a senior military official told reporters in a Saturday briefing.

            ___

            PICKING UP THE PIECES

            As the deflated balloon was slowly drifting down, U.S. Navy vessels had already moved in, waiting to collect the debris.

            The Federal Aviation Administration had temporarily closed airspace over the Carolina coast, including the airports in Myrtle Beach and Charleston, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. And the FAA and Coast Guard worked to clear the airspace and water below the balloon.

            Once the balloon crashed into the water, U.S. officials said, the debris field stretched at least 7 miles, and was in water 47 feet deep. That depth is shallower than what they had planned, making it easier to retrieve pieces of the sensor package and other parts that may be salvageable.

            Officials said the USS Oscar Austin, a Navy destroyer, the USS Carter Hall, a dock landing ship, and the USS Philippine Sea, a guided missile cruiser, are all part of the recovery effort, and a salvage vessel will arrive in a few days. They said Navy divers will be on hand if needed, along with unmanned vessels that can recover debris and lift it back up to the ships. The FBI will also be present to categorize and assess anything recovered, officials said.

            As for intelligence value, the U.S. officials said the balloon's voyage across the U.S. gave experts several days to analyze it, gather technical data, and learn a lot about what it was doing, how it was doing it and why China may be using things like this. They declined to provide details, but said they expect to learn more as they gather and scrutinize the debris.

            SPY BALLOONS HAVE A HISTORY

            Spy balloons aren't new — primitive ones date back centuries, but they came into greater use in World War II. 

            U.S. officials said Saturday that similar Chinese balloons transited the continental United States briefly at least three times during the Trump administration and once that they know about earlier in the Biden administration. But none of those incidents lasted this length of time.

            During World War II, Japan launched thousands of hydrogen balloons carrying bombs, and hundreds ended up in the U.S. and Canada. Most were ineffective, but one was lethal. In May 1945, six civilians died when they found one of the balloons on the ground in Oregon, and it exploded.

            In the aftermath of the war, America's own balloon effort ignited the alien stories and lore linked to Roswell, New Mexico.

            According to military research documents and studies, the U.S. began using giant trains of balloons and sensors that were strung together and stretched more than 600 feet as part of an early effort to detect Soviet missile launches during the post-World War II era. They called it Project Mogul.

            One of the balloon trains crash-landed at the Roswell Army Airfield in 1947, and Air Force personnel who were not aware of the program found debris. The unusual experimental equipment made it difficult to identify, leaving the airmen with unanswered questions that over time — aided by UFO enthusiasts — took on a life of their own. The simple answer, according to the military reports, was just over the Sacramento Mountains at the Project Mogul launch site in Alamogordo.

They said Navy divers will be on hand if needed, along with unmanned vessels that can recover debris and lift it back up to the ships. The FBI will also be present to categorize and assess anything recovered, officials said.As for intelligence value, the U.S. officials said the balloon's voyage across the U.S. gave experts several days to analyze it, gather technical data, and learn a lot about what it was doing, how it was doing it and why China may be using things like this. They declined to provide details, but said they expect to learn more as they gather and scrutinize the debris.___SPY BALLOONS HAVE A HISTORYSpy balloons aren't new — primitive ones date back centuries, but they came into greater use in World War II.U.S. officials said Saturday that similar Chinese balloons transited the continental United States briefly at least three times during the Trump administration and once that they know about earlier in the Biden administration. But none of those incidents lasted this length of time.During World War II, Japan launched thousands of hydrogen balloons carrying bombs, and hundreds ended up in the U.S. and Canada. Most were ineffective, but one was lethal. In May 1945, six civilians died when they found one of the balloons on the ground in Oregon, and it exploded.In the aftermath of the war, America's own balloon effort ignited the alien stories and lore linked to Roswell, New Mexico.According to military research documents and studies, the U.S. began using giant trains of balloons and sensors that were strung together and stretched more than 600 feet as part of an early effort to detect Soviet missile launches during the post-World War II era. They called it Project Mogul.One of the balloon trains crash-landed at the Roswell Army Airfield in 1947, and Air Force personnel who were not aware of the program found debris. The unusual experimental equipment made it difficult to identify, leaving the airmen with unanswered questions that over time — aided by UFO enthusiasts — took on a life of their own. The simple answer, according to the military reports, was just over the Sacramento Mountains at the Project Mogul launch site in Alamogordo.____Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Ellen Knickmeyer, Matthew Lee, Aamer Madhani and Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.",2023/02/05,109,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800126,Biden makes progress on 'unity agenda' outlined in 2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A year ago, President Joe Biden used his first State of the Union address to push top Democratic priorities that were sure to face a battle in the narrowly divided Congress but he also laid out a four-pronged “unity agenda” that would be an easier sell.

            Biden's unity goals would be hard for anyone to argue against: improving mental health, supporting veterans, beating the opioid epidemic and fighting cancer. The president is still pushing for some of those big Democratic goals, like an assault weapons ban, but he's fared better on the unity goals. 

            Susan Rice, the president's domestic policy adviser, pointed to “very significant progress” on all four aspects even as she noted that issues like meeting the demand for mental health services or combating drug abuse won't be solved overnight. 











            ""We’re happy with the progress that’s been made and we’re determined to keep pushing forward and make more progress,"" Rice said in an interview. 

            A look at where things stand:

            OPIOIDS

            IN THE SPEECH: Biden asked Congress for increased funding for prevention, treatment, reducing harm and recovery. He also called for the elimination of rules that keep doctors from prescribing treatments, and he aimed to stop the flow of illicit drugs by having the federal government work with state and local law enforcement officials to go after drug traffickers.

            SINCE THEN: Biden sent his first national drug control strategy to Congress, focused on harm reduction or preventing death and illness in drug users while trying to engage them in care and treatment. The strategy calls for changes in state laws and policies to support expanding harm reduction.

            It also calls for targeting the financial activities of transnational criminal organizations that manufacture and traffic illicit drugs in the United States, reducing the supply of illegal drugs smuggled across U.S. borders, improving data systems and research that guide drug policy, and making sure the people most in danger of overdosing on drugs can get evidence-based treatments, including people experiencing homelessness and those in prison or jail.

            The Department of Health and Human Services awarded nearly $1.5 billion in grants to all states and U.S. territories to increase access to treatment for substance abuse, remove barriers to treatments like naloxone, which is used to reverse an opioid overdose, and expand access to support services and treatment programs. 

            The Food and Drug Administration approved several naloxone products in the past year, including a higher-dose injection as an additional option to treat opioid overdoses, a second generic naloxone nasal spray, and a naloxone auto-injector product for use by the military and for responding to chemical incidents.

            MENTAL HEALTH

            IN THE SPEECH: Biden emphasized mental health care for children, citing turmoil in their lives and in their schooling caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. He called for holding social media platforms accountable for their negative impact on children, strengthening privacy protections, banning advertising targeted at children and demanding that tech companies stop collecting children’s personal data. And he urged parents to make sure their kids’ schools use the $122 billion in pandemic relief funds they got from Washington to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.

            SINCE THEN: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the gun violence bill Biden signed into law last June, allocates more than $1 billion over five years to mental health support for schools, in line with the president's goal of doubling the number of school counselors, social workers and other mental health professionals. The Department of Education has begun releasing those funds. 

            A new “988” national suicide and crisis hotline opened in July and has been receiving vastly more calls and texts than the old system did during the same time period the previous year, according to the White House.

            Biden released a national strategy on mental health. But legislation to address children's tech privacy issues has not yet cleared Congress. 

            “This is an area where we still have more to get done,” Rice said.

            VETERANS

            IN THE SPEECH: Biden asked Congress for legislation guaranteeing health care for veterans who became ill from their exposure to toxic smoke on bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

            SINCE THEN: In August, he signed into law a major expansion of federal health care services for millions of veterans who breathed the toxic smoke emitted from huge “burn pits,"" which were used to dispose of chemicals, plastics, medical equipment, human waste and other substances on U.S. military installations in the two countries.

            More than two-thirds of disability claims that cited exposure to the pits were being denied by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 

            The new law, known in Washington and among veterans as the PACT Act, directs officials to assume that certain respiratory illnesses and cancers were related to burn pit exposure. The change helps veterans, and their survivors, collect disability payments without having to prove their illness was caused by their service. Up to 3.5 million veterans could benefit, according to estimates. 

            The issue is a personal one for Biden, who many times has suggested that the aggressive brain cancer that killed his son Beau may have been caused by his exposure to burn pits in Iraq. Beau Biden was stationed in Iraq for about a year as a major in the Delaware Army National Guard.

            Biden held a large White House bill-signing ceremony and gave the pen to the young daughter of Sgt. 1st Class Heath Robinson, who died of cancer and for whom the legislation is named. 

            Separately, veterans in need mental health care can now press 1 after dialing 988 to connect with the Veterans Crisis Line.

            CANCER

            IN THE SPEECH: Biden noted how personal the cancer issue is to him and his wife, Jill, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, along with millions of people like them who have lost friends and loved ones to various forms of the disease.

            Just before last year's State of the Union address, Biden announced that he was “reigniting” a federal cancer-fighting initiative that was first launched in 2016, when he was vice president and after his son Beau's death in 2015. As president, Biden set a new goal for the “cancer moonshot” initiative of cutting cancer death rates by at least half over the next 25 years. 

            He asked Congress in the speech to fund the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, describing it as based on a Defense Department research agency that led to creation of the internet, GPS and more. He said the new health research agency's “singular purpose” would be to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and more. 

            SINCE THEN: ARPA-H was created in March 2022 in the Department of Health and Human Services. 

            The $1.7 trillion government funding bill Biden signed in December included $1.5 billion for the new health agency.WASHINGTON (AP) — A year ago, President Joe Biden used his first State of the Union address to push top Democratic priorities that were sure to face a battle in the narrowly divided Congress but he also laid out a four-pronged “unity agenda” that would be an easier sell.Biden's unity goals would be hard for anyone to argue against: improving mental health, supporting veterans, beating the opioid epidemic and fighting cancer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800139,Taiwan's remote work solution provider finds success in Western and Asian markets,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Kdan Mobile co-founder Wang Wei-chung (王為中) joined the Startup Island TAIWAN podcast on Friday (Feb. 3) to discuss the success of Kdan, its unusual head office location, and how focusing on core functionality was key to the company’s success.Software as a service (SaaS) is a massive growth area, with predictions for total investment in the industry exceeding US$70 billion (NT$2 trillion) in 2022, more than four times the amount it was a decade ago. Despite this being a reduction in investment levels from the 2021 peak of US$98 billion, Wang said he believes the future is still in software.“The app market in my opinion has already tapped out ... When Kdan launched its first app there were fewer than 1,000 apps on the Appstore, so it was relatively easier to gain exposure,” he said. “We don’t call ourselves an app developer any more. We started off as an app developer to get our foot in the door. We are a software solution provider at this point.”Wang said the software solutions Kdan provides are about optimizing efficiency and cultivating creativity in the evolving digital workplace. They have done this by focusing on the core functionality of the software they provide.“Most of them have too many bells and whistles, and the majority of clients just want the core functionality,” Wang said. For one of their most successful products, their PDF software, this meant reducing the number of features, and putting more focus on one, the digital signature.Wang said the digital signature function has been very popular, especially during the pandemic, when users were seeking contactless ways to sign and send documents. He also said Kdan’s focusing on core functionality means the product is easier to use from the beginning, which also helps attract customers.“Many of our customers were attracted to the solution because they wanted to save money, but after a few months they realized that is all they needed,” Wang said.One of Kdan's most popular services has been digital signatures. (Kdan Facebook photo)Having a diverse team is important for Wang, and so is having a high level of English fluency. “I value diversity. I understand that you have got to have different ideas. You’ve got to be able to find a way to have that idea influx, and that influx is going to be better if you have people from different backgrounds,” he said.Wang said his business, and other Taiwanese in the SaaS space would benefit from more government help. “Not only capital influx, that’s obviously one important thing,” Wang said, “but how do we bridge the Taiwanese startups with the startup communities in the West.”He said the Taiwan government could support businesses to attend the Consumer Electronics Show in the U.S., the industry’s largest expo, helping them to make connections in the world’s largest consumer market.Unlike most tech startups in Taiwan, Kdan is headquartered in Tainan. “When (my other co-founders) told me they wanted to pick Tainan as a location, I was taken aback,” Wang said, but the choice has turned out to be a good one.“There were a lot of talents that were forced to go to Taipei, because they weren’t able to find any opportunities in the southern part of the country,” Wang said. He said that they offer staff an opportunity to work in their hometown, and be with their families and their communities.",2023/02/04,1168,Business

""We also discussed about the COC, the commitment of members to conclude the negotiation of the COC as soon as possible.""Negotiations on the COC - a proposed framework to help tackle territorial and maritime disputes in the waterway - have stalled for years as some members states prioritised bilateral ties with China over a regional consensus.Indonesia is preparing to host a round of negotiations on the COC this year, the first taking place in March, the foreign minister said.China claims jurisdiction over almost the entire South China Sea based on its U-shaped ""nine-dash line"", a boundary found to have no legal basis by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2016.Earlier this week, the Philippines granted the United States greater access to its military bases, in part due to Beijing's extensive claims in the resource-rich maritime area.ASEAN members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei all have overlapping claims with China in the strategic waterway.Indonesia is not an official claimant but has faced pushback from China over its exploration of oil and gas reserves in the North Natuna Sea. Last month the country sent a warship to the area to monitor a lingering Chinese coast guard vessel.""New approaches"" would be explored by all ASEAN member states and Chinese counterparts to make progress on the COC, Sidharto R.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800159,US Representative Michael McCaul announces possible trip to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Representative Michael McCaul revealed that he plans to visit Taiwan in April during an interview with Voice of America (VOA) on Thursday (Feb. 3).

            There is a two-week Easter recess in early April, which lawmakers can use to travel abroad, VOA reported. However, McCall did not specify a timetable for his visit.

            The congressman said that when China fired missiles near Taiwan and intruded in the country’s air defense identification zone, it was inappropriate and provocative behavior. He went on to say that any elected member of Congress has the right to visit an elected official of any country, including Taiwan.

            The congressman has proposed a number of pro-Taiwan bills and supported boosting cooperation and exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan, per VOA. He has also assisted Taiwan in expanding its international space.











            Last week, McCaul agreed with U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command head General Mike Minihan’s prediction of a 2025 Taiwan Strait conflict, saying, “I hope he’s wrong as well. I think he’s right, though, unfortunately,” according to Politico.

            In a memo obtained by NBC, Minihan said, “I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me we will fight in 2025.” Minihan speculated that because both Taiwan and the U.S. will have presidential elections in 2024, Washington will be “distracted,” giving Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) a chance to move on Taiwan.

            Meanwhile, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not yet shared any plans for a Taiwan trip. The Chinese foreign ministry on Monday (Jan. 30) opposed any such visit, saying, “We urge certain individuals in the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one-China principle.”

            In response, McCarthy told reporters at a press conference Thursday (Feb. 2) that “China’s never going to tell me where I can and can’t go.""

            President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has started to improve some but not all of the acute shortages, acknowledged the somber state of the nation, saying in a televised speech, “We have reached the point of destruction.” 

            ""Let’s seek to heal this wound though it’s difficult and painful. If we endure the suffering and pain for a short period of time, we can get the wound healed completely,” Wickremesinghe said, adding that the first six months of the year will be difficult. 











            Many Buddhists and Christian clergy had announced a boycott of the celebration in the capital, while activists and others expressed anger at what they see as a waste of money in a time of severe economic crisis.

            A group of activists began a silent protest on Friday in the capital, condemning the government’s independence celebration and failure to ease the economic burden. University students also attempted a protest march later Saturday but police blocked them. Troops with assault rifles were stationed every few meters (yards) surrounding the site of the independence ceremony and riot police stood ready to prevent anti-government demonstrations.

            Despite the criticism, armed troops paraded along the main esplanade in Colombo, showcasing military equipment as navy ships sailed nearby and helicopters and aircraft flew over the city.

            Catholic priest Rev. Cyril Gamini called this year's ceremony commemorating independence from British rule a “crime and waste” at a time when the country is experiencing such economic hardship. 

            “We ask the government what independence they are going to proudly celebrate by spending a sum of 200 million rupees ($548,000),” said Gamini, adding the Catholic Church does not condone spending public money on the celebration and that no priest would attend the ceremony.

            About 7% of Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka’s 22 million people are Christians, most of them Catholics. Despite being a minority, the church’s views are respected.

            Prominent Buddhist monk Omalpe Sobitha also said there was no reason to celebrate and that the ceremony was just an exhibition of weapons made in other countries.

            
                Sri Lanka is effectively bankrupt and has suspended repayment of nearly $7 billion in foreign debt due this year pending the outcome of talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package.

            The country’s total foreign debt exceeds $51 billion, of which $28 billion has to be repaid by 2027. Unsustainable debt and a severe balance of payment crisis, on top of lingering scars from the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a severe shortage of essentials such as fuel, medicine and food. Massive protests last year forced Wickremesinghe's predecessor, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, to flee the country and resign. 

            Despite some improvements, power cuts continue due to the fuel shortages, hospitals struggle with a lack of medicines, and the treasury cannot raise money to pay government employees. 

            To manage the country's expenses, the government has increased income taxes sharply and has announced a 6% cut in funds allocated to each ministry. Also, the military, which had swelled to more than 200,000 members amid a long civil war, will be downsized by nearly half by 2030.

            Wickremesinghe said that everyone, politicians and the citizens alike, were to blame for the country's woes. He said from the early days of independence, Sri Lankans were divided in terms of race, religion and region. 

            “We worked for political candidates expecting personal favours in return. Most of us contested not for the country, but for personal power, for greater perks and to earn a little more.”

            Wickremesinghe also said steps were being taken to restore ethnic amity in the country by releasing military-occupied land in the ethnic Tamil-majority north and releasing suspects detained for alleged connections with a now-defunct separatist rebel movement. He also promised to devolve maximum power to the Tamil regions.

            Tamil rebels fought for an independent state in the country's northeast for more than 25 years until they were crushed by the military in 2009. More than 100,000 people were killed in the conflict by conservative U.N estimates.

            Successive governments pledged maximum power-sharing with Tamils, short of a separate homeland, but have not followed up on them.COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka marked its 75th independence anniversary on Saturday as a bankrupt nation, with many citizens angry, anxious and in no mood to celebrate.President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has started to improve some but not all of the acute shortages, acknowledged the somber state of the nation, saying in a televised speech, “We have reached the point of destruction.”""Let’s seek to heal this wound though it’s difficult and painful.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800166,"Tribes, researchers debate final fate of P-22, famed LA puma","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The life of Los Angeles’ most famous mountain lion followed a path known only to the biggest of Hollywood stars: Discovered on-camera in 2012, the cougar adopted a stage name and enjoyed a decade of celebrity status before his tragic death late last year.

            The popular puma gained fame as P-22 and cast a spotlight on the troubled population of California’s endangered mountain lions and their decreasing genetic diversity. Now, with his remains stored in a freezer at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, wildlife officials and representatives from the region’s tribal communities are debating his next act. 

            Biologists and conservationists want to retain samples of P-22’s tissue, fur and whiskers for scientific testing to aid in future wildlife research. But some representatives of the Chumash, Tataviam and Gabrielino (Tongva) peoples say his body should be returned, untouched, to the ancestral lands where he spent his life so he can be honored with a traditional burial.











            In tribal communities here, mountain lions are regarded as relatives and considered teachers. P-22 is seen as an extraordinary animal, according to Alan Salazar, a tribal member of the Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians and a descendent of the Chumash tribe who said his death should be honored appropriately.

            “We want to bury him like he’s a ‘wot,’ like a ‘tomier,’ "" Salazar said, ""which are two of the words for chief or leader"" in the Chumash and Tataviam languages, respectively. ""Because that’s what he was.”

            Likely born about 12 years ago in the western Santa Monica Mountains, wildlife officials believe the aggression of P-22's father and his own struggle to find a mate amid a dwindling population drove the cougar to cross two heavily traveled freeways and migrate east.

            He made his debut in 2012, captured on a trail camera by biologist Miguel Ordeñana in Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign and part of ancestral Gabrielino (Tongva) land.

            Promptly tagged and christened P-22 — as the 22nd puma in a National Park Service study — he spawned a decade of devotion among Californians, who saw themselves mirrored in his bachelor status, his harrowing journey to the heart of Los Angeles and his prime real estate in Griffith Park amid the city's urban sprawl. Los Angeles and Mumbai are the world’s only major cities where large cats have been a regular presence for years — mountain lions in one, leopards in the other — though pumas began roaming the streets of Santiago, Chile, during pandemic lockdowns.

            Angelenos celebrated his life on Saturday at the Greek Theater in Griffith Park in a star-studded memorial that featured musical performances, tribal blessings, speeches about the importance of P-22's life and wildlife conservation, and a video message from Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

            Proceeds from merchandise sales of P-22 T-shirts, toys and prints went to the “Save the LA Cougars” campaign. The group was inspired by P-22 to advocate for a wildlife crossing over a Los Angeles-area freeway that will allow big cats and other animals safe passage between the mountains and wildlands to the north. The bridge broke ground in April.

            
                P-22′s star dimmed last November, when he killed a Chihuahua on a dogwalker’s leash i n the Hollywood Hills and likely attacked another weeks later. Wildlife officials said the puma seemed to be “exhibiting signs of distress,” in part due to aging.

            They captured P-22 on Dec. 12 in a residential backyard in the trendy Los Feliz neighborhood. Examinations revealed a skull fracture — the result of being hit by a car — and chronic illnesses including a skin infection and diseases of the kidneys and liver. 

            The city's cherished big cat was euthanized five days later. 

            Los Angeles mourned P-22 as one of its own, with songs, stories and murals crying “long live the king."" Post-It notes of remembrance blanketed an exhibit wall at the Natural History Museum and children's paw print messages covered a tableau outside the LA Zoo.

            While fame is fleeting for most celebrities, P-22's legacy lives on — though in what form is now up for debate. 

            The Natural History Museum took possession of the animal's remains, prompting swift condemnation by tribal leaders who feared P-22′s body could be taxidermized and put on display. Samples taken during the animal's necropsy also are causing concerns among the tribal communities about burying the cougar intact.

            “In order to continue on your journey into the afterlife, you have to be whole,” said Desireé Martinez, an archaeologist and member of the Gabrielino (Tongva) community. 

            A year before P-22's death, Ordeñana — the wildlife biologist whose camera first spotted the cougar and is now a senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum — had applied for a permit from the state for the museum to receive the mountain lion's remains when he died. Typically an animal carcass would be discarded.

            Ordeñana and the state Department of Fish and Wildlife have apologized, saying they should have spoken with the tribes from the start.

            Museum, state and other officials began talks with the tribes Monday in the hopes of reaching a compromise. Ordeñana and other scientists are advocating to retain at least some of P-22's tissue samples to preserve future research opportunities for the endangered animals as new technologies and techniques arise.

            “We’re trying to see what can we do differently — regarding outreach, regarding our process — that is feasible for us as an institution,"" Ordeñana said, ""but respectful of both the scientific and the cultural-historic legacy of these animals.”

            Salazar and Martinez, however, do not believe samples should be taken from the animal's remains and held by the museum in perpetuity. 

            “We’ve been studied like the mountain lion has been studied,"" Salazar said. “Those bones of my tribal ancestors are in boxes so they can be studied by future generations. We’re not a science project.”

            Beth Pratt, the California executive director for the National Wildlife Federation who emceed Saturday's memorial and a key player in developing the wildlife crossing, said it's important to balance the different arguments to ensure the diminishing LA cougar population has a future.

            “We do need data from these animals, even P-22, for science,"" said Pratt, who calls him “the Brad Pitt” of pumas. 

            Chuck Bonham, director of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, said the P-22 discussions have forced his agency and others to reckon with their outreach to California's tribes.

            “I think he'll live forever in this way,"" Bonham said.

            Martinez, of the Gabrielino (Tongva) community, said the beloved mountain lion's death also symbolizes how humans must take responsibility for respecting animals' lives.

            “We are wildlife. We are creatures of nature, just as all the animals and plants are,"" Martinez said. ""What can we do to make sure that the creatures that we are sharing this nature with have the ability to survive and live on — just like us?”LOS ANGELES (AP) — The life of Los Angeles’ most famous mountain lion followed a path known only to the biggest of Hollywood stars: Discovered on-camera in 2012, the cougar adopted a stage name and enjoyed a decade of celebrity status before his tragic death late last year.The popular puma gained fame as P-22 and cast a spotlight on the troubled population of California’s endangered mountain lions and their decreasing genetic diversity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800191,ASEAN vows to conclude pact with China on disputed territory,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Southeast Asian foreign ministers vowed to finalize negotiations with China over a proposed pact aimed at preventing conflicts in the disputed South China Sea in their annual retreat on Saturday in Indonesia’s capital.

            In the final session of their two-day meeting, the ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also agreed to unite in their approach to implement a five-step agreement made in 2021 between ASEAN leaders and Myanmar’s military leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, that seeks to end that country’s worsening crisis.

            China and the ASEAN member states, which include four rival claimants to territories in the South China Sea, have been holding sporadic talks for years on a “code of conduct,” a set of regional norms and rules aimed at preventing a clash the disputed waters.











            Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said that Indonesia, this year’s ASEAN chair, is ready to host more rounds of negotiations over the proposed pact, the first of which will be held in March. She said ASEAN members are committed to concluding the discussions “as soon as possible.""

            “Members are also committed to promote implementation of a declaration of conduct,” Marsudi added.

            Marsudi did not elaborate, but in the past, China has accused Washington of meddling in what it calls an Asian dispute. The U.S. has deployed ships and jets to patrol the waters to promote freedom of navigation and overflight. It has often raised alarm over China’s assertive actions, including its construction of islands where it has placed weapons including surface-to-air missiles.

            Sidharto Suryodipuro, head of ASEAN Cooperation at Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters in Jakarta that ASEAN member states will push negotiations this year and explore new approaches.

            “All of us agreed that it has to be an effective implementable in accordance with international law, and the code of conduct must fulfill this criteria,” Suryodipuro said. “It’s an exploratory stage. We don’t know what shape it will take, but as you know negotiation is a key process that is something we intend to intensify.” 

            China has come under intense criticism for its militarization of the strategic waterway but says it has the right to build on its territories and defend them at all costs.

            Vietnam, one of the four ASEAN claimant states, has been vocal in expressing concerns over China’s transformation of seven disputed reefs into man-made islands, including three with runways, which now resemble small cities armed with weapons systems.

            ASEAN members Cambodia and Laos, both Chinese allies, have opposed the use of strong language against Beijing in the disputes.

            Indonesia is not among the governments challenging China’s claim to virtually the entire South China Sea but expressed opposition after China claimed part of Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone in the northern region of the Natuna Islands.

            The edge of the exclusive economic zone overlaps with Beijing’s unilaterally declared “nine-dash line” demarking its claims in the South China Sea.

            On the Myanmar issue, Marsudi told a news conference Saturday that ASEAN foreign ministers reiterated the urgent need for Myanmar's military junta to implement the five-point consensus, saying it is “very important for ASEAN.”

            On Friday, the ministers urged Myanmar’s military rulers to reduce violence and allow unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to pave the way for a national dialogue aimed at ending the crisis.

            Myanmar is also an ASEAN member, but its foreign minister was excluded from Friday’s annual ministers’ retreat because of his country’s failure to implement the five-step consensus.

            Marsudi said the ministers agreed that an inclusive national dialogue “is key to finding a peaceful resolution to the situation in Myanmar,” and that reducing violence and providing humanitarian assistance are “paramount for building trust and confidence.”

            She said the lack of progress in Myanmar “tests our credibility” as a group, and that ASEAN’s efforts toward peace would be coordinated with those of other countries and the United Nations.

            Myanmar’s military leader promised in the five-point agreement to allow a special ASEAN envoy to meet with jailed ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others to foster a dialogue aimed at easing the crisis, set off by the military’s seizure of power two years ago. 

            But Myanmar refused to let an ASEAN envoy meet with Suu Kyi last year, resulting in Min Aung Hlaing’s exclusion from an ASEAN summit last November.

            ""The public should expect that Indonesia could provide fresh air for finding a political solution to the worsening conflict in Myanmar,” said Dinna Prapto Raharja, an international relations analyst from Synergy Policies, an independent think tank.

            “The fragmentation of power in Myanmar is worse and so managing the violence has become more complex,” she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800204,US security expert says Chinese balloon could be there by mistake,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A U.S. Indo-Pacific and Asian security expert said it's possible the Chinese balloon drifting over the U.S. got there by mistake.Tweeting on Friday (Feb. 3), the nonresident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Blake Herzinger said:“I think we need to at least consider the possibility that this was a mistake, and that the CCP govt hasn’t commented (because) they’re not sure how to extricate themselves without looking stupid.”Meanwhile, in an interview with CNA on Saturday (Feb. 4), Director of the Central Weather Bureau Cheng Ming-dean (鄭明典) said the bureau spotted a similar balloon over Taiwan about two years ago. Cheng said that in September 2021 and March 2022, the same balloon appeared over Taipei, staying there for about three hours.Washington and Beijing have clashed over the incident, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken responding by canceling a planned trip to Beijing. It was hoped this would ease tensions between the two countries.Other experts have also weighed in on the possibility the balloon ended up over the U.S. by accident. An atmospheric scientist said that westerly wind currents could have easily carried the balloon across the continental U.S. unintentionally. University of Washington professor Dan Jaffe said that it was “absolutely possible — not possible, likely” that the balloon had simply strayed off course.A professor of International Relations from Tokyo’s Takusoku University also said that controlling the flight of this kind of balloon with accuracy was a difficult task. The balloon ""was probably staying within a defined area trying to collect signal data,"" Professor Heigo Sato said, according to Nikkei.But I think we need to at least consider the possibility that this was a mistake, and that the CCP govt hasn’t commented bc they’re not sure how to extricate themselves without looking stupid.Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at National University of Singapore offered another explanation, saying the balloon could have been an act of sabotage from an unexpected actor.""It is also possible that the PLA is trying to torpedo Xi's effort to improve China's relations with the U.S. and its like-minded partners including Japan and Australia,"" said Thompson.",2023/02/04,2948,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800223,Longer-range rockets included in $2 bln U.S. pledge for Ukraine,"WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A new rocket that would double Ukraine's strike range in its war with Russia was included in a $2.175 billion U.S. military aid package, the Pentagon said on Friday.
The new weapon, the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), will allow Ukraine's military to hit targets at twice the distance reachable by the rockets it now fires from the U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).
The 151 km (94 mile) GLSDB will put all of Russia's supply lines in eastern Ukraine within reach, as well as part of Russian-occupied Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014.
""As part of the USAI package, we will be providing Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb to Ukraine,"" Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told a news briefing at the Pentagon. USAI stands for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI).
Friday's aid pledge opens the door to many more deliveries of the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB).
When the new rockets arrive, it will mark the first time Ukraine has seen its rocket range grow exponentially since U.S. furnished HIMARS in late-June 2022.
HIMARS have a 77 km (48 mile) range and were instrumental in Ukraine's counter offensive against Russian forces, which invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.
In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told RIA news agency that it was important not to forget what President Vladimir Putin had said in Volgograd on Thursday. In a speech, Putin said ""we have the means to respond, and it won't end with the use of armored vehicles, everyone must understand that.""
Reuters was first to report on a Boeing Co (BA.N) proposal to field GLSDB for Ukraine in November. At the time it was expected GLSDB could be in Ukraine by spring.
""This demonstrates Boeing's commitment to answer the nation's call for rapid, effective capabilities for the United States and its international partners,"" a Boeing spokesperson said. ""Our team and Saab continue to work closely with the U.S. Government to solve pressing security challenges with speed and agility."" GLSDB is made jointly with Sweden's SAAB AB (SAABb.ST).
INDUSTRY
A $1.725 billion portion of Friday's aid, comes from USAI funding, which allows President Joe Biden's administration to buy weapons from industry rather than from U.S. weapons stocks.
The USAI funds pledged would also be used to buy two HAWK air defense firing units, counter drone systems, counter artillery and air surveillance radars, communications equipment, PUMA drones, and medical supplies.
In addition to the USAI funds, $425 million worth of arms aid is coming from Presidential Drawdown Authority funds, which allows the president to take from current U.S. stocks in an emergency.
That aid includes more precision-guided munitions for HIMARS launchers, 190 heavy machine guns with thermal imagery sights and associated ammunition to counter drones, mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, claymore anti-personnel mines and Javelin anti-tank weapons.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800230,Vapers feel heat of change in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Vapers are feeling the heat of change in Taiwan as the government is set to deprive them of the electronic cigarettes that deliver flavorful doses of nicotine, up to 2,000 other chemicals, and optional infusions of the cannabinoid THC.Many of these individuals picked up the habit abroad, mostly in the U.S., which leads the vaping industry and exports its products all over the world. The global market for e-cigarettes has an estimated value of US$8.28 billion and the U.S. comprises approximately one-third of this, with annual growth of about 3.87%.In terms of “soft drugs” like tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis, the U.S. and some other Western countries have “progressed” to a point where the “war on drugs” is giving way to business as usual. They are just another avenue for tax revenue.As for e-cigarettes, the international lobbyists of a well-organized and funded vaping industry trumpet “healthy” outcomes, achieving a “smokeless” or “smoke-free” society, and greenwashed claims that vaping is good for the environment.Taiwan, it seems, is not falling for the hype and mid-January saw a third reading of the amended Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act (菸害防制法), which marks a ban on the import, sale, and manufacture of e-cigarettes. This means the bill should become law by mid-February.In addition, the advertising of vaping products will be stopped, while those under the age of 18 who use vapes will be forced to attend classes aimed at quitting. Individuals caught vaping illegally will be fined up to NT$10,000. Illegal manufacturers or importers will be hit harder and receive fines of up to NT$50 million.Vapers are aghast at this turn of events, thinking they were the future of smoking, since they were indulging in a less noxious, more technologically advanced, and cooler habit than cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. They roll up arguments claiming heated tobacco products (HTPs) — which must now be approved for use — are benign, rather than cancer-forming.They fire up scientific studies claiming smokers who switch to vaping have healthier lifestyles and reduce the risk of heart disease by up to 34%. They claim that vapes actually help people quit smoking.This is despite evidence from a recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that found 99% of all vaping products have nicotine — even those that claim to be nicotine-free. Nicotine is, actually, more addictive than cocaine or heroin.Michael Landl, the fiery and proactive director of the World Vapers’ Alliance, is of the opinion that the ban is the “result of a terrible misinformation campaign on harm reduction.”History shows bans and prohibitions do not work, he continues. Instead, thousands of people will be forced to go back to smoking tobacco or buying on the black market. A flurry of articles from an in-house reporter at the online Vaping Post decries Taiwan’s legislators for their shortsightedness.Vapers of my acquaintance are worried they will be left high and dry by the ban and are incensed at the injustice. They say it is unreasonable and illogical and point to the twin evils of alcohol and smoking being untouched by the legislation. “Why?” They ask rhetorically.Their answer is that money talks and the government has a monopoly on these products, mostly through the ubiquitous Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation (TTL). This is hypocritical, they suggest.The problem is the vape industry hasn’t lobbied hard enough or paid enough.Since Taiwan doesn’t have a chokehold on the revenue stream of vapes, then it has no incentive to allow the trade, they say. If you listen carefully, that is the sound of an argument against trade protectionism forming, and vaping will become a badge of freedom. It’s all a bit desperate.First off, it should be pointed out that the new bill does tackle tobacco use as well, not just vaping. Proposed changes include raising the legal smoking age from 18 to 20, reducing no-smoking areas, and increasing the warning messages on cigarette packets.Second, considering that more than 40 countries ranging from Antigua and Barbuda to Venezuela have already banned vaping, it would be a tall order for the vaping industry to make a case against Taiwan without meeting opposition from the rest of the world. This would also mean going against the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention for Tobacco Control on novel nicotine alternatives — an even taller order.To some observers, Taiwan is making a stand against vapes precisely because it wants to curry favor with the WHO and gain membership. For sure, the amended bill does ratify the WHO framework and follows its advice that HTPs should be banned or regulated.However, the idea that a cessation of vaping will gain Taiwan a seat at the table in international bodies is a little fanciful. After all, what would China say?Third, Taiwan has long banned smokeless nicotine such as Snus, or chewing tobacco, so it’s not that there is a conspiracy against vaping per se, just a belief that less tobacco and nicotine is more beneficial. Legislators are well aware of the health problems associated with these products and the burden they place on the health system.When covering the issue of vaping, local media tends to emphasize the rapid increase in e-cigarette use, not only among nicotine-addicted adults, but also children. My kids say classmates often vape. It’s mostly boys trying to impress girls, but the marketing is clever and the candy-flavored taste options are enticing.A Health Promotion Administration survey shows the number of e-cigarette users in junior high schools grew from 1.9% in 2018 to 3.9% in 2021, and in the same time-frame rose from 3.4% to 8.8% at senior high and vocational schools.Overall, e-cigarette use grew from 0.6% percent in 2018 to 1.7% in 2021, with teens being most likely to start vaping, and young women increasingly taking up the habit, too, because of the novelty value and influence of friends.“Traditional” cigarette use has remained about the same, with 13% of the population, or 3 million smokers. However, some health professionals report that young people are taking up smoking because of vaping and call it a “gateway drug.”Even “enlightened vapers” who agree that Taiwan should ban the enticing flavors and kids from vaping, but allow adults to choose vapes over cigarettes, are loath to address the bald fact that vaping in itself is not a good thing.Who really knows exactly what goes into a vape? It could potentially be much worse than the nicotine and ultrafine particles that are definitely inhaled deep into the lungs, causing COPD and other lung ailments. Then there are the heavy and toxic metals produced from the heating elements in HTPs, which include lead, arsenic, chromium, and nickel.Add to this the volatile organic compounds, and chemicals such as diacetyl used in flavorings that are linked to serious lung diseases. Then there’s the strong likelihood of vaping or its products being cancerous. It’s so new that we don’t even know how serious it is at the moment. But suffice it to say there is already enough evidence of harm for the WHO to want it banned.Personally, I would let everyone choose their own poison and do as they wish as long as they don’t harm others. Equally, if Taiwan wants to ban vaping, then it should be seen as a bold and potentially beneficial step forward.It doesn’t matter which way you cut it, vaping is not a positive, it’s a negative. And if the only way you can make it a positive is by comparing it to a negative (cigarette smoking), then you are only fooling people. And failing people.If vapers in Taiwan choose to find a silver lining, perhaps they will be inspired to quit the habit. Better than being persona non grata.When you get down to it, Taiwan has a fairly traditional outlook on issues like gambling, prostitution, and drugs. It is big on education and healthcare. It wants to avoid social and health problems. Moms rule and they don’t want their kids addicted. Politicians reflect their wishes.In this case, a conservative outlook appears to have seized the day. It might not be entirely logical, but it’s not bad. Taiwan can always change course later when it is found vaping is entirely beneficial and vapers live forever. Until then, perhaps Taiwan should be praised for its probity and not shamed for its caution.",2023/02/04,3069,Opinion

            Reina said that talks with China only concern loans for the hydroelectric dam and that relations with Taiwan will be maintained, Honduran newspaper La Tribuna reported. “What we are looking for, in this vision of creating more energy capacities for the country, is for (China) to finance Patuca II,” he said.

            Reina met with China’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xie Feng (謝峰) on Jan. 1 at the inauguration of Brazil’s President Lula de Silva, prompting Taiwan’s ambassador in Tegucigalpa, Vivia Chang (張俊菲), to express concern on behalf of Taipei to the Honduran Foreign Ministry.

            The conversation with Xie ""was a purely commercial issue, we maintain the relationship with Taiwan,"" he stressed. China previously provided a US$300 million loan for the Patuca III dam, which was inaugurated in January 2021 by then-president Juan Orlando Hernández, per La Tribuna.











            During the 2021 Honduran general election, there were concerns that then-candidate Xiomara Castro would follow through on her campaign promise to break off diplomatic relations with Taiwan and recognize Beijing. However, once Castro was elected, she maintained ties with Taipei.

            Over the past decade, Taiwan has slowly lost multiple Central American allies to China, including Costa Rica in 2007, Panama in 2017, Dominican Republic and El Salvador in 2018, and Nicaragua in 2021.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Honduran Minister of Foreign Affairs Enrique Reina on Thursday (Feb. 2) reaffirmed ties with Taiwan despite requesting aid from China to finance the Patuca II hydropower project.Reina said that talks with China only concern loans for the hydroelectric dam and that relations with Taiwan will be maintained, Honduran newspaper La Tribuna reported. “What we are looking for, in this vision of creating more energy capacities for the country, is for (China) to finance Patuca II,” he said.Reina met with China’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xie Feng (謝峰) on Jan. 1 at the inauguration of Brazil’s President Lula de Silva, prompting Taiwan’s ambassador in Tegucigalpa, Vivia Chang (張俊菲), to express concern on behalf of Taipei to the Honduran Foreign Ministry.The conversation with Xie ""was a purely commercial issue, we maintain the relationship with Taiwan,"" he stressed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800239,West Indies in control on rain-shortened 1st day vs Zimbabwe,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) — Captain Kraigg Brathwaite and fellow opener Tagenarine Chanderpaul both scored half centuries as the West Indies reached 112-0 before rain washed out play after lunch on day one of the first test against Zimbabwe on Saturday.

            Zimbabwe’s bowlers lacked penetration on a flat pitch at the Queens Sports Club but were able to keep the Windies batsmen in check with calm and composed bowling.

            The West Indies openers, who both finished the day undefeated on 55, looked comfortable at the crease and pounced on the bad ball when the Zimbabwe bowlers fluffed their lines.











            “The pitch looked good for batting, but obviously we knew rain would be a factor,” Brathwaite said. “Today is history, today is gone, we have to come back tomorrow and start setting the foundation again.”

            Zimbabwe fielded five debutants, including former England batter Gary Ballance, who completed his international switch during the African team's white-ball series with Ireland in January.

            “We kept the pressure on, but credit to the West Indies, I thought they batted nicely,” said Steve Kirby, Zimbabwe’s bowling coach. “It was a very good surface for test cricket. On a different day, we could have had two, three wickets. It was just a good day of old-fashioned test cricket.”

            Zimbabwe is missing frontline bowler Blessing Muzarabani though long-term injury as well as in-form batting all-rounders Sikandar Raza and Ryan Burl, who are playing Twenty20 franchise cricket in Dubai and Bangladesh, respectively.

            “We are always going to lose players to white-ball cricket,” Kirby said. ""But there is still a huge appetite for test cricket. Test cricket is a privilege. It’s a very emotional time for them (the debutants) and they will remember it for the rest of their lives.”

            Both games of the two-match series will be in Bulawayo.

            Ballance, returning to his country of birth, had represented England in 24 tests most recently in 2017.

            Zimbabwe is captained by Craig Ervine with regular test skipper Sean Williams out with injury.

            The West Indies lost 2-0 in Australia in its last series in December and interim coach Andre Coley is in charge of the team for the first time. 

            Zimbabwe hasn't played test cricket in 18 months since losing a one-off match at home to Bangladesh.

            Those arrested this week included more than 50 Hindu priests and Muslim clerics for allegedly performing marriages for underage girls in Assam, state police chief Gyanendra Pratap Singh said.

            ""We have so far arrested 2,169 men based on 4,074 registered police cases involving a total of about 8,000 men,” said Singh.











            Many cases of child marriage in Assam, a state of 35 million people, go unreported. 

            Only 155 cases of child marriages in the state were registered in 2021, and 138 in 2020, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

            In India, the legal marriageable age is 21 for men and 18 for women. Poverty, lack of education, and social norms and practices, particularly in rural areas, are considered reasons for child marriages across the country.

            Television images on Friday showed some young women with infants in their arms, crying and protesting the sudden arrests of their husbands.

            “We were struggling and somehow making ends meet. But we were happy together. Who will provide for our livelihood now that my husband has been arrested?” asked a young woman.

            Singh said child marriages were one reason for the state's high infant mortality and maternal mortality rates.

            “I have asked the Assam police to act with a spirit of zero tolerance against the unpardonable and heinous crime on women,” Himanta Biswa Sarma, the state's top elected official, tweeted.

            India’s Parliament is considering legislation to raise the age for marriage for women to 21 from 18, to bring it in line with men and promote gender equality.

            India’s Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani told Parliament on Friday that the move would enable girls to complete their education and achieve economic independence apart from achieving physical and psychological maturity.GUWAHATI, India (AP) — Indian police have arrested more than 2,000 men in a crackdown on illegal child marriages involving girls under the age of 18 in a northeastern state, officials said Saturday.Those arrested this week included more than 50 Hindu priests and Muslim clerics for allegedly performing marriages for underage girls in Assam, state police chief Gyanendra Pratap Singh said.""We have so far arrested 2,169 men based on 4,074 registered police cases involving a total of about 8,000 men,” said Singh.Many cases of child marriage in Assam, a state of 35 million people, go unreported.Only 155 cases of child marriages in the state were registered in 2021, and 138 in 2020, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.In India, the legal marriageable age is 21 for men and 18 for women.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800277,"50-car train derailment causes big fire, evacuations in Ohio","EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — A freight train derailment in Ohio near the Pennsylvania state line left a mangled and charred mass of boxcars and flames Saturday as authorities launched a federal investigation and monitored air quality from the various hazardous chemicals in the train.

            About 50 cars derailed in East Palestine at about 9 p.m. EST Friday as a train was carrying a variety of products from Madison, Illinois, to Conway, Pennsylvania, rail operator Norfolk Southern said Saturday. There was no immediate information about what caused the derailment. No injuries or damage to structures were reported.

            “The post-derailment fire spanned about the length of the derailed train cars,” Michael Graham, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters Saturday evening. “The fire has since reduced in intensity, but remains active and the two main tracks are still blocked.”











            Norfolk Southern said 20 of the more than 100 cars were classified as carrying hazardous materials — defined as cargo that could pose any kind of danger “including flammables, combustibles, or environmental risks.” Graham said 14 cars carrying vinyl chloride were involved in the derailment “and have been exposed to fire,” and at least one “is intermittently releasing the contents of the car through a pressure release device as designed.” 

            “At this time we are working to verify which hazardous materials cars, if any, have been breached,” he said. The Environmental Protection Agency and Norfolk Southern were continuing to monitor air quality, and investigators would begin their on-scene work “once the scene is safe and secure,” he said.

            Vinyl chloride, used to make the polyvinyl chloride hard plastic resin used in a variety of plastic products, is associated with increased risk of liver cancer and other cancers, according to the federal government’s National Cancer Institute. Federal officials said they were also concerned about other possibly hazardous materials.

            Mayor Trent Conaway, who earlier declared a state of emergency citing the “train derailment with hazardous materials,” said air quality monitors throughout a one-mile zone ordered evacuated had shown no dangerous readings. 

            Fire Chief Keith Drabick said officials were most concerned about the vinyl chloride and referenced one car containing that chemical but said safety features on that car were still functioning. Emergency crews would keep their distance until Norfolk Southern officials told them it was safe to approach, Drabick said. 

            “When they say it’s time to go in and put the fire out, my guys will go in and put the fire out,” he said. He said there were also other chemicals in the cars and officials would seek a list from Norfolk Southern and federal authorities.

            Graham said the safety board’s team would concentrate on gathering “perishable” information about the derailment of the train, which had 141 load cars, nine empty cars and three locomotives. State police had aerial footage and the locomotives had forward-facing image recorders as well as data recorders that could provide such information as train speed, throttle position and brake applications, he said. Train crew and other witnesses would also be interviewed, Graham said. 

            Firefighters were pulled from the immediate area and unmanned streams were used to protect some areas including businesses that might also have contained materials of concern, officials said. Freezing temperatures in the single digits complicated the response as trucks pumping water froze, Conaway said. 

            East Palestine officials said 68 agencies from three states and a number of counties responded to the derailment, which happened about 51 miles (82 kilometers) northwest of Pittsburgh and within 20 miles (32 kilometers) of the tip of West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle.

            Conaway said surveillance from the air showed “an entanglement of cars"" with fires still burning and heavy smoke continuing to billow from the scene as officials tried to determine what was in each car from the labels outside. The evacuation order and shelter-in-place warnings would remain in effect until further notice, officials said.

            Village officials warned residents that they might hear explosions due to the fire. They said drinking water was safe despite discoloration due to the volume being pumped the fight the blaze. Some runoff had been detected in streams but rail officials were working to stem that and prevent it from going downstream, officials said.

            Officials repeatedly urged people not to come to the scene, saying they were endangering not only themselves but emergency responders.

            The evacuation area covered 1,500 to 2,000 of the town's 4,800 to 4,900 residents, but it was unknown how many were actually affected, Conaway said. A high school and community center were opened, and the few dozen residents sheltering at the high school included Ann McAnlis, who said a neighbor had texted her about the crash.

            “She took a picture of the glow in the sky from the front porch,” McAnlis told WFMJ-TV. “That’s when I knew how substantial this was.”

            Norfolk Southern opened an assistance center in the village to take information from affected residents and also said it was ""supporting the efforts of the American Red Cross and their temporary community shelters through a $25,000 donation.

            Elizabeth Parker Sherry said her 19-year-old son was heading to Walmart to pick up a new TV in time for the Super Bowl when he called her outside to see the flames and black smoke billowing toward their home. She said she messaged her mother to get out of her home next to the tracks, but all three of them and her daughter then had to leave her own home as crews went door-to-door to tell people to leave the evacuation zone.EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — A freight train derailment in Ohio near the Pennsylvania state line left a mangled and charred mass of boxcars and flames Saturday as authorities launched a federal investigation and monitored air quality from the various hazardous chemicals in the train.About 50 cars derailed in East Palestine at about 9 p.m. EST Friday as a train was carrying a variety of products from Madison, Illinois, to Conway, Pennsylvania, rail operator Norfolk Southern said Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800278,Qatar boosts influence in Lebanon amid multiple crises,"BEIRUT (AP) — Most wealthy Gulf Arab nations followed Saudi Arabia’s lead in recent years and ostracized crisis-hit Lebanon because of the growing influence of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. The exception was Qatar.

            Doha has been silently expanding its influence in Lebanon. It continued receiving Lebanese leaders and pumped tens millions of dollars into helping the country’s armed forces amid a historic economic meltdown.

            The small, gas-rich nation in late January began seeing the fruits of its investment, when state-owned Qatar Energy replaced a Russian firm in an international consortium that will search for gas in the Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon’s coast.











            And on Monday, Qatar will for the first time join a meeting in Paris along with officials from France, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. for discussions focusing on Lebanon’s political and economic crises.

            Qatar portrays itself as a more neutral force in a country where for decades outside powers have used Lebanon’s sectarian divisions to fight their proxy battles. Saudi Arabia long backed Lebanon’s Sunni Muslim factions and tried to push out Iran’s influence through Shiite Hezbollah. The rivalry repeatedly pushed Lebanon to the brink of armed conflict. 

            Qatar, which has good ties with Iran, has been trying to advance negotiations between Tehran and Gulf nations. Its inclusion in the upcoming talks “is a signal that Iran will not be completely left out of that meeting and a recognition of the influence that Tehran has over Lebanon,” said Mohamad Bazzi, a professor and director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at New York University.

            “With Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states less heavily involved in Lebanon, Qatar is trying to revive its mediator role in the country,” he said. 

            Still, Qatar – one of the richest countries in the world with its natural gas wealth – so far “has shown little sign of being willing to bail out Lebanon on its own,” Bazzi said.

            Since late 2019, Lebanon’s economy has collapsed under the weight of widespread corruption and mismanagement. The currency has lost more than 90% of its value, throwing most of the population into poverty. International donors, including Qatar, have been demanding the government implement reforms to release some $11 billion in loans and grants. But Lebanon’s politicians have resisted because reforms would weaken their grip in the country. 

            Qatar’s involvement in Lebanon is not new. 

            After the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, Qatar helped rebuild several towns and villages that suffered major destruction in southern Lebanon. Giant billboards with signs reading “Thank You Qatar” popped up around Lebanon.

            In May 2008, after Hezbollah and its allies battled their Western-backed rivals in Beirut’s worst fighting since the 1975-90 civil war, Lebanese political leaders flew to Qatar, where they reached a deal known as the “Doha Agreement.” The deal ended an 18-month deadlock and brought the election of a new president and formation of a new government. In the calm that followed, massive foreign investment flowed in, and Lebanon’s economy grew at an average of 9% for three years.

            In December 2018, then-President Michel Aoun inaugurated the newly rehabilitated Lebanese National Library in Beirut, funded by Qatar at a cost of $25 million. The current emir’s mother, Sheikha Moza bint Nasser al-Missned, had laid the foundation stone for the project in the heart of Beirut in 2009. 

            Saudi Arabia pulled back from Lebanon in recent years as Hezbollah’s power grew. Last year, the main Saudi ally in Lebanon, former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a dual Lebanese-Saudi citizen, announced he is suspending his work in politics. 

            In 2020, Riyadh banned imports of Lebanese products after a Lebanese official derided the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. Several other Gulf countries followed suit, but Qatar did not. 

            Qatar doubled down on its investment as Lebanon’s economy melted down.

            Qatari investors bought the famous Beirut Le Vendome hotel overlooking the Mediterranean in 2020. There are reports that Doha plans to pump money into Lebanon’s struggling banking sector to buy one of the country’s lenders.

            In June, Qatar donated $60 million to support the salaries of members of the Lebanese army. It was already supporting the army with monthly supplies of food. Strengthening Lebanon’s military has long been a policy of the United States, which sees the force as a counterbalance to Hezbollah. 

            A week ago, three months after Lebanon and Israel signed a U.S.-mediated maritime border agreement, Qatari Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi joined Lebanese officials in Beirut for a ceremony inking an agreement for Qatar to take a 30% share in a consortium for oil and gas exploration in Lebanese waters.

            “For us in Qatar, this important agreement gives us an opportunity to support economic developments in Lebanon during this critical turn,” al-Kaabi said at the event. “Qatar is always present to support a better future for Lebanon and its people.”

            According to the agreement, Qatar Energy will take over the 20% stake vacated by Russia’s Novatek in addition to 5% each from Italy’s giant ENI and France’s TotalEnergies leaving the Arab company with a stake of 30%. Total and ENI will have 35% stakes each.

            “This is a win-win situation for Lebanon and Qatar,” said Lebanon’s former energy minister, Cesar Abi Khalil. Qatar gets a stake in the possible gas resources in Lebanese waters, while Lebanon gets the credibility of a Qatari company in the project. 

            In the political field, Qatar has not openly backed any party. But it reportedly supports the Lebanese Army commander, Gen. Joseph Aoun, to become the country’s next president. Aoun, who is not related to the outgoing president, was invited to visit Qatar in December and met with high-level officials. Hezbollah is believed to oppose him.

            As it often does, Qatar is advancing its economic and political interests together, said Lebanese economist Antoine Farah. It is ensuring income from its investments while gaining a political role in the country where it invests.

            But Ali Hamade, a journalist with the Lebanese daily An-Nahar, said Qatar, like other Gulf nations, will want to see Lebanon’s political leaders enact serious reforms. 

            “Lebanon should help itself in order for Arabs to help Lebanon.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800279,Pope says South Sudan's future depends on treatment of women,"JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — Pope Francis warned Saturday that South Sudan’s future depends on how it treats its women, as he highlighted their horrific plight in a country where sexual violence is rampant, child brides are common and the maternal mortality rate is the highest in the world.

            On his second and penultimate day in Africa, Francis called for women and girls to be respected, protected and honored during a meeting in the South Sudanese capital Juba with some of the 2 million people who have been forced by fighting and flooding to flee their homes. Women, girls and children make up the majority of those displaced.

            The encounter was one of the highlights of Francis’ three-day visit to the world’s youngest country and one of its poorest. Joined by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Presbyterian head of the Church of Scotland, Francis is on an historic ecumenical pilgrimage to draw global attention to the country's plight and encourage its stalled peace process.











            The aim of the three-way visit is to encourage South Sudan’s political leaders to implement a 2018 peace accord ending a civil war that erupted after the overwhelmingly Christian country gained independence from mostly Muslim Sudan in 2011. 

            Greeted by song and high-pitched ululation, Francis urged the hundreds of people gathered at Freedom Hall to be “seeds of hope,” that will soon bear fruit for the country of 12 million. 

            “You will be the trees that absorb the pollution of years of violence and restore the oxygen of fraternity,” he said.

            The head of the U.N. mission in South Sudan, Sara Beysolow Nyanti, told Francis that women and girls were “extremely vulnerable” to sexual and gender-based violence, with U.N. statistics estimating some four out of 10 have been victim to one or more forms of assault. She said women and girls were at risk for rape when they were just out doing their daily routines and chores.

            “If the women of South Sudan are given an opportunity to develop, to have space to be productive, South Sudan will be transformed,” she told Francis.

            The pope picked up her theme in his remarks, saying women were the key to South Sudan’s peaceful development.

            “Please, protect, respect, appreciate and honor every woman, every girl, young woman, mother and grandmother,” he said. “Otherwise, there will be no future.” 

            According to UNICEF, roughly 75% of girls in South Sudan don’t go to school because their parents prefer to keep them at home and set them up for a marriage that will bring a dowry for the family. 

            Half of South Sudan’s women are married before age 18, and they then face the world’s highest maternal mortality rate. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan said in a report last year that overall, women and girls here live a “hellish existence.” 

            “South Sudanese women are physically assaulted while being raped at gunpoint, typically held down by men while being abused by others. They are told not to resist in the slightest way, and not to report what happened, or they will be killed,” the report said.

            Maria Nyataba Wur, a displaced woman now living in Juba who attended Francis' event, told The Associated Press that one of her neighbors was raped in front of her children, so violently that she limped for days afterward.

            “According to what she told us as a survivor was that they tied her legs apart and then three people entered her, raped her,” Wur said, adding that she lost track of the neighbor during her own efforts to flee to safety in the capital.

            Mariam Nyantabo, another 36-year-old resident of a Juba protection camp, said women were grateful for Francis' visit.

            “The plight against women is shocking,” she said, noting the risk of rape comes from everyday chores like collecting firewood. “His visit is blessed to women of South Sudan, and I believe there will be a great change, the suffering of the women will be reduced.” 

            Welby, too, addressed the plight of women during his remarks at an ecumenical prayer service later Saturday. He praised their “incredible” strength when “on top of the grief of conflict and the responsibility to provide for your families, many of you live with the trauma of sexual violence and the daily fear of mistreatment in your own homes.”

            To the men in the audience, Welby was more blunt: “You will value and honor women, never raping, never violent, never cruel, never using them as if they were there to satisfy desire.” he said to applause from the crowd. 

            Francis began his day meeting with the priests and nuns who minister to South Sudan’s people, urging them to accompany their flocks by joining in their suffering.

            At the St. Theresa Cathedral, he heard of the sacrifice nuns have made over the years, including the 2021 ambush killings of Sisters Mary Daniel Abut and Regina Roba Luate of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart Sisters.

            Sister Regina Achan, from the same congregation, said Francis’ visit would encourage other sisters to keep serving the people of South Sudan. “We stand with them because we are their voices, we don’t run away at difficult times,” said Achan. 

            Sister Orla Treacy, an Irish Loreto nun who runs a secondary school for girls in the central town of Rumbek, walked for over a week with her students to see the pope in Juba. The school makes contracts with the girls’ extended families, with relatives committing to not remove the girls from school to get married. 

            “It is still a challenge for young women, but it is changing and the young women are now coming with a vision for what they also want for their country as well,” Treacy said at the cathedral event.

            Upon arrival Friday, Francis issued a blunt warning to President Salva Kiir and his onetime rival and now deputy Riek Machar that history will judge them harshly if they continue to drag their feet on implementing the peace accord.

            Kiir for his part committed the government to return to peace talks — suspended last year — with groups that didn’t sign onto the 2018 accord. And late Friday, the Catholic president granted presidential pardons to 71 inmates at Juba’s central prison in honor of the ecumenical pilgrimage, including 36 on death row.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800289,"US downs Chinese balloon, drawing a threat from China","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military on Saturday shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America. China insisted the flyover was an accident involving a civilian aircraft and threatened repercussions.

            President Joe Biden issued the order but had wanted the balloon downed even earlier, on Wednesday. He was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water, U.S. officials said. Military officials determined that bringing it down over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.

            China responded that it reserved the right to “take further actions” and criticized the U.S. for “an obvious overreaction and a serious violation of international practice.”











            In its statement Sunday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that “China will resolutely uphold the relevant company’s legitimate rights and interests, and at the same time reserving the right to take further actions in response.” China's Ministry of Defense echoed the statement later in the day, saying it “reserves the right to take necessary measures to deal with similar situations.”

            The presence of the balloon in the skies above the U.S. this week dealt a severe blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years. It prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing tensions. 

            “They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it,” Biden said after getting off Air Force One en route to Camp David. 

            The giant white orb was spotted Saturday morning over the Carolinas as it approached the Atlantic coast. About 2:39 p.m. EST, an F-22 fighter jet fired a missile at the balloon, puncturing it while it was about 6 nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, senior defense officials said. 

            The spectacle had Americans looking to the skies all week, wondering whether the mysterious balloon had floated over them. 

            On Saturday, Ashlyn Preaux, 33, went out to get her mail in Forestbrook, South Carolina, and noticed her neighbors looking up — and there it was, the balloon in the cloudless blue sky. Then she saw fighter jets circling and the balloon get hit. 

            “I did not anticipate waking up to be in a ‘Top Gun’ movie today,” she said. 

            The debris landed in 47 feet of water, shallower than officials had expected, and it spread out over roughly seven miles and the recovery operation included several ships. The officials estimated the recovery efforts would be completed in a short time, not weeks. A salvage vessel was en route. 

            U.S. defense and military officials said Saturday that the balloon entered the U.S. air defense zone north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved largely over land across Alaska and then into Canadian airspace in the Northwest Territories on Monday. It crossed back into U.S. territory over northern Idaho on Tuesday, the day the White House said Biden was first briefed on it.

            The balloon was spotted Wednesday over Montana, home to Malmstrom Air Force Base, which has fields of nuclear missile silos.

            The Americans were able to collect intelligence on the balloon as it flew over the U.S., giving them a number of days to analyze it and learn how it moved and what it was capable of surveilling, according to two senior defense officials said. The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. 

            The officials said the U.S. military was constantly assessing the threat, and concluded that the technology on the balloon didn’t give the Chinese significant intelligence beyond what it could already obtain from satellites, though the U.S. took steps to mitigate what information it could gather as it moved along. 

            Republicans were critical of Biden's response. 

            “Allowing a spy balloon from the Communist Party of China to travel across the entire continental United States before contesting its presence is a disastrous projection of weakness by the White House,” said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 

            Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., tweeted: “Now that this embarrassing episode is over, we need answers from the Biden Administration on the decision-making process. Communist China was allowed to violate American sovereignty unimpeded for days. We must be better prepared for future provocations and incursions by the CCP.”

            Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was more positive: “Thank you to the men and women of the United States military who were responsible for completing the mission to shoot down the Chinese surveillance balloon. The Biden Administration did the right thing in bringing it down.”

            China has claimed that the balloon was merely a weather research “airship” that had been blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand — as well as China’s contention that it was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability.

            The Chinese government on Saturday sought to play down the cancellation of Blinken's trip. “In actuality, the U.S. and China have never announced any visit, the U.S. making any such announcement is their own business, and we respect that,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. 

            The Pentagon also acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America. “We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement. Officials said the balloons are part of a fleet that China uses for surveillance, and they can be maneuvered remotely through small motors and propellers. One official said they carry equipment in the pod under the balloon that is not usually associated with standard meteorological activities or civilian research.

            China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a question about the second balloon. 

            This isn’t the first time Chinese spy balloons have crossed into U.S. airspace in recent years, one of the officials said. At least three times during the Trump administration and at least one other time during Biden’s time as president they’ve seen balloons cross, but not for this long, the official said. 

            Blinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was “an irresponsible act and that (China’s) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.”

            Uncensored reactions on the Chinese internet mirrored the official government stance that the U.S. was hyping the situation. Some used it as a chance to poke fun at U.S. defenses, saying it couldn’t even defend against a balloon, and nationalist influencers leaped to use the news to mock the U.S.

            China has denied any claims of spying and said it is a civilian-use balloon intended for meteorology research. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that the balloon’s journey was out of its control and urged the U.S. not to “smear” it because of the balloon.

            In preparation for the operation Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily closed airspace over the Carolina coast, including the airports in Myrtle Beach and Charleston, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. The FAA rerouted air traffic from the area and warned of delays as a result of the flight restrictions. The FAA and Coast Guard worked to clear the airspace and water below the balloon as it reached the ocean.

            Television footage showed a small explosion, followed by the giant deflated balloon descending like a ribbon toward the water. 

            Bill Swanson said he watched the balloon deflate instantly from his house in Myrtle Beach as fighter jets circled around.

            “When it deflated it was pretty close to instantaneous,” he said. “One second it’s there like a tiny moon and the next second it’s gone.” Swanson added that a trail of smoke followed the balloon as it dropped.

            An earlier version of this report incorrectly said the balloon was spotted over Montana on Thursday, instead of Wednesday.WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military on Saturday shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America. China insisted the flyover was an accident involving a civilian aircraft and threatened repercussions.President Joe Biden issued the order but had wanted the balloon downed even earlier, on Wednesday. He was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water, U.S. officials said. Military officials determined that bringing it down over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.China responded that it reserved the right to “take further actions” and criticized the U.S. for “an obvious overreaction and a serious violation of international practice.”In its statement Sunday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that “China will resolutely uphold the relevant company’s legitimate rights and interests, and at the same time reserving the right to take further actions in response.” China's Ministry of Defense echoed the statement later in the day, saying it “reserves the right to take necessary measures to deal with similar situations.”The presence of the balloon in the skies above the U.S. this week dealt a severe blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years. It prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing tensions.“They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it,” Biden said after getting off Air Force One en route to Camp David.The giant white orb was spotted Saturday morning over the Carolinas as it approached the Atlantic coast. About 2:39 p.m. EST, an F-22 fighter jet fired a missile at the balloon, puncturing it while it was about 6 nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, senior defense officials said.The spectacle had Americans looking to the skies all week, wondering whether the mysterious balloon had floated over them.On Saturday, Ashlyn Preaux, 33, went out to get her mail in Forestbrook, South Carolina, and noticed her neighbors looking up — and there it was, the balloon in the cloudless blue sky. Then she saw fighter jets circling and the balloon get hit.“I did not anticipate waking up to be in a ‘Top Gun’ movie today,” she said.The debris landed in 47 feet of water, shallower than officials had expected, and it spread out over roughly seven miles and the recovery operation included several ships. The officials estimated the recovery efforts would be completed in a short time, not weeks. A salvage vessel was en route.U.S. defense and military officials said Saturday that the balloon entered the U.S. air defense zone north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved largely over land across Alaska and then into Canadian airspace in the Northwest Territories on Monday. It crossed back into U.S. territory over northern Idaho on Tuesday, the day the White House said Biden was first briefed on it.The balloon was spotted Wednesday over Montana, home to Malmstrom Air Force Base, which has fields of nuclear missile silos.The Americans were able to collect intelligence on the balloon as it flew over the U.S., giving them a number of days to analyze it and learn how it moved and what it was capable of surveilling, according to two senior defense officials said. The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.The officials said the U.S. military was constantly assessing the threat, and concluded that the technology on the balloon didn’t give the Chinese significant intelligence beyond what it could already obtain from satellites, though the U.S. took steps to mitigate what information it could gather as it moved along.Republicans were critical of Biden's response.“Allowing a spy balloon from the Communist Party of China to travel across the entire continental United States before contesting its presence is a disastrous projection of weakness by the White House,” said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., tweeted: “Now that this embarrassing episode is over, we need answers from the Biden Administration on the decision-making process. Communist China was allowed to violate American sovereignty unimpeded for days. We must be better prepared for future provocations and incursions by the CCP.”Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was more positive: “Thank you to the men and women of the United States military who were responsible for completing the mission to shoot down the Chinese surveillance balloon. The Biden Administration did the right thing in bringing it down.”China has claimed that the balloon was merely a weather research “airship” that had been blown off course.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800290,"Gordy, Robinson honored at reunion of Motown stars","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Temptations, the Isley Brothers and the Four Tops turned back time, singing and dancing as if in their prime at a reunion of Motown stars.

            The occasion was to honor Motown Records founder Berry Gordy and singer-songwriter Smokey Robinson for their musical achievements and philanthropic efforts as MusiCares Persons of the Year on Friday night, the first time the charitable organization honored two individuals in the same year.

            The Detroit natives have been friends for more than 65 years.











            “When I first met this man it was the beginning of my dream come true,” Robinson told the crowd at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 

            “I wanted to be a singer, I wanted to be in show business, I wanted to write songs and make music,"" Robinson said. ""I never thought it would be possible for me from where I grew up. But then I got there because I met Berry Gordy. He took me under his wing. He is my mentor.”

            Gordy later took the stage with Robinson to accept their awards.

            “I'm happy to be here with my best friend. Damn,” Gordy said.

            Sheryl Crow, John Legend, Mumford & Sons, Dionne Warwick, Brandi Carlile, Michael McDonald, Lionel Richie and Stevie Wonder were among those honoring the 93-year-old Gordy and 82-year-old Robinson two days before the Grammy Awards ceremonies.

            “I wouldn't know music without Motown,” Legend told the crowd.

            Gordy and Robinson alternately stood and applauded and clapped along, sometimes singing as well, while the artists sampled the vast Motown catalog.

            The Temptations kicked off the 2 1/2-hour concert with a medley of “The Way You Do the Things You Do,” “Ain't Too Proud to Beg,” “I Can't Get Next to You” and “My Girl.” Resplendent in red suits and patent leather red shoes, the five-man group's distinct harmonies were as tight as their choreography.

            Gordy leaned over and put his arm around Robinson at their table as the group had the crowd singing along to “My Girl.”

            Warwick, who is 82, later sang “My Guy,” the Mary Wells hit written and produced by Robinson on Motown. She and Robinson blew kisses to each other.

            Ronald Isley, who is 81, and his 70-year-old guitarist-brother, Ernie, performed “This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),” a hit on Motown's Tamla label in 1966.

            The Four Tops recreated their run of 1960s hits with “I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch),"" “Reach Out I'll Be There” and “It's the Same Old Song.” The crowd was up on its feet singing and dancing. 

            Wonder had the crowd clapping along to his reggae-tinged version of “The Tears of a Clown,” a hit he co-wrote as a teenager with Robinson.

            “All of my appreciation, respect, love goes to you, Berry, who thought I couldn't sing,” Wonder said, drawing laughter. “Smokey, I want to thank you. I can never repay you.”

            Carlile was backed by twin brothers Phil and Tim Hanseroth on “Tracks of My Tears,” drawing a standing ovation for the 1965 hit written by Robinson. The trio wore matching silver metallic jackets and black bowties.

            Trombone Shorty tore it up on “Shotgun,” the Junior Walker and the All Stars song produced by Gordy in 1965. McDonald earned a standing ovation for his rendition of “Lonely Teardrops,” written by Gordy for Jackie Wilson.

            In a pairing of young (28-year-old Sebastián Yatra) and old (66-year-old Rita Wilson), they sang “It Takes Two,” a 1965 hit for Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston on the Tamla label.

            Valerie Simpson and Jimmie Allen teamed on “Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" while Lalah Hathaway was accompanied on piano and vocal by PJ Morton of Maroon 5 for “Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing.”

            In the oddest sighting of the night, Elton John and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi swayed next to each other in the crowd.

            The evening closed with sisters Chloe and Halle Bailey holding hands with Wonder while singing The Temptations' hit “Get Ready” along with McDonald, Wilson and the Four Tops, among others.

            Now in its 33rd year, the dinner and auction raised money for programs and services supporting musicians in need.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800311,Zenhaeusern beats Greek skier Ginnis to win World Cup slalom,"CHAMONIX, France (AP) — Ramon Zenhaeusern threw his ski poles in the air Saturday right after finishing the last men’s World Cup slalom before the world championships.

            The Swiss skier had just beaten unheralded AJ Ginnis, who was just as pleased with his second place. Zenhaeusern finished 1.02 seconds ahead of Ginnis, who became the first skier from Greece on a World Cup podium.

            “That was an emotional outburst,” Zenhaeusern said. “I had a long drought. That I finish with the green light and with such an advantage, that was a huge relief.”











            It was Zenhaeusern's sixth career win but first since December 2020. His Swiss teammate Daniel Yule was four-hundredths further back in third.

            “The world champs begin from zero, so I enjoy now the moment and world champs (slalom) is in two weeks,” Zenhaeusern said.

            Olympic champion Clement Noel, who led after the first run, and Norwegian favorite Henrik Kristoffersen both straddled gates and failed to finish their second run.

            Wearing bib 45, Ginnis was 21st after the opening leg before posting the fastest time in the second.

            “Really unbelievable, a dream,” said Ginnis, whose career has been marred by knee injuries. “Last year, I tore my ACL again so I had to come back again. Everything went well today, I had luck and I skied well.”

            Ginnis, who was born in Greece and whose wife is American, was 12 when he moved to Austria with his father, a ski instructor. He went to the United States three years later and competed for the U.S. ski team at the 2017 worlds.

            He was dropped from its program following several injuries, and has been starting for Greece since 2018. His previous best result was 11th from a slalom in Austria two years ago.

            American skier Jett Seymour finished seventh and the Steamboat Springs, Colorado native scored World Cup points for the first time in 27 World Cup starts.

            “I'm pretty stoked,” Seymour said. “I've been skiing well both the last two years, it just hadn't come together and I've had to push through a lot of mental struggles.”

            Seymour's teammate Luke Winters finished 12th to complete the strong showing by the U.S. team.

            Lucas Braathen, who leads the discipline standings, sat out the race after undergoing surgery for appendicitis this week. The Norwegian is doubtful for the worlds, where the men’s slalom is the closing event on Feb 19.

            Braathen had his lead in the slalom standings reduced to 36 points over Yule, while Kristofferen is 41 points behind in third.

            The World Cup season contains two more slaloms after the worlds, which start Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800312,Dozens of soldiers freed in Russia-Ukraine prisoner swap,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Dozens of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners of war have returned home following a prisoner swap, officials on both sides said Saturday.

            Top Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak said in a Telegram post that 116 Ukrainians were freed.

            He said the released POWs include troops who held out in Mariupol during Moscow’s monthslong siege that reduced the southern port city to ruins, as well as guerrilla fighters from the Kherson region and snipers captured during the ongoing fierce battles for the eastern city of Bakhmut.











            Russian defense officials, meanwhile, announced that 63 Russian troops had returned from Ukraine following the swap, including some “special category” prisoners whose release was secured following mediation by the United Arab Emirates. 

            A statement issued Saturday by the Russian Defense Ministry did not provide details about these “special category” captives.

            At least three civilians have been killed in Ukraine over the past 24 hours as Russian forces struck nine regions in the country’s south, north and east, according to reports on Ukrainian TV by regional governors on Saturday morning. 

            Two people were killed and 14 others wounded in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region by Russian shelling and missile strikes, local Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a Telegram update on Saturday morning.

            The casualty toll included a man who was killed and seven others who were wounded Friday after Russian missiles slammed into Toretsk, a town in the Donetsk region. Kyrylenko said that 34 houses, two kindergartens, an outpatient clinic, a library, a cultural centre and other buildings were damaged in the strike.

            Seven teenagers received shrapnel wounds after an anti-personnel mine exploded late on Friday in the northeastern city of Izium, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram. He said they were all hospitalized but their lives were not in danger.

            Elsewhere, regional Ukrainian officials reported overnight shelling by Russia of border settlements in the northern Sumy region, as well as the town of Marhanets, which neighbors the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Kyiv has long accused Moscow of using the plant, which Russian forces seized early in the war, as a base for launching attacks on Ukrainian-held territory across the Dnieper river.

            Elsewhere, Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa and surrounding areas were plunged into the dark following a large-scale network failure, the country’s grid operator reported.

            Ukrenergo said in a Telegram update that the failure involved equipment “repeatedly repaired” after Russia’s savage strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid, and that residents should brace themselves for lengthy blackouts.

            “Unfortunately, the scale of the accident is quite significant, and this time, the power supply restrictions will be longer. It is not yet possible to determine a specific time when (power) will be fully restored,” the company said.

            Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that the energy ministry was sending “all the powerful generators it has in stock” to Odesa “within 24 hours"" and that both the Ukrainian energy minister and the head of Ukrenergo were on their way to Odesa to oversee repair works.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800330,Ukraine updates: US sends Russian oligarch's money to Ukraine,"US Attorney General Merrick Garland authorized the United States to begin using seized Russian money to aid Ukraine, according to US media.The announcement came during a meeting between Garland and Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin in Washington on Friday.""I am announcing that I have authorized the first-ever transfer of forfeited Russian assets for use in Ukraine,"" Garland said, according to CNN.The money will come from assets confiscated from Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev after his indictment on sanctions evasions in April, Garland added. The money will go to the State Department ""to support the people of Ukraine,"" CNN reported Garland as saying.Kostin welcomed the move, which he said would see $5.4 million (€5 million) of confiscated assets go toward ""rebuilding Ukraine."" ""Delighted to see the new legislation aimed at seizing the Russian oligarchs' illicit assets in action,"" he posted on Twitter, along with a picture of himself and Garland during the meeting.""The inherent part of accountability is that the perpetrator pays for the harm inflicted,"" Kostin added at the end of his tweet thread.Russian millionaire Malofeyev is considered one of the main sources of funding for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. In April, the US Treasury blacklisted a network of some 40 individuals and entities led by Malofeyev that it said were used to facilitate sanctions evasion.Here are other updates on the war in Ukraine on Saturday, February 4:116 POWs returned to Ukraine as part of a prisoner exchange with Russia. According to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's presidential office, the released prisoners of war include defenders of Mariupol and captured partisans from the Kherson region.Yermak also added that Ukraine managed to recover the bodies of two foreign volunteers and a Ukrainian soldier.At the same time, 63 Russian prisoners of war were released, Russia's Defense Ministry said. The group of released soldiers includes people from the ""sensitive category"" whose exchange was made possible through the mediation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the ministry added.Portugal will send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said, without specifying how many will be shipped.""We are currently working to be able to dispense some of our tanks,"" Costa told the Lusa news agency during a trip to the Central African Republic. ""I know how many tanks will be (sent to Ukraine) but that will be announced at the appropriate time.""Admiral Antonio Silva Ribeiro, the head of the Portuguese armed forces, said last month Portugal had 37 Leopard 2 tanks but it has been widely reported by local media that most are inoperable.Portugal is working with Germany to get the parts needed to repair the tanks that are not operational, Costa said, adding he hoped to deliver them to Ukraine by the end of March.The United States warned Turkey in recent days about the export to Russia of chemicals, microchips and other products that could be used in Moscow's war effort in Ukraine, and Washington could move to enforce existing bans, according to a senior US official.Brian Nelson, the US Treasury Department's top sanctions official, visited Turkish government officials and representatives of the private sector on Thursday and Friday to urge more cooperation in disrupting the flow of such goods. In the meetings in Ankara and Istanbul, Nelson and a delegation highlighted tens of millions of dollars of exports to Russia that raised concerns, the official said.In talks with Turkish firms this week, Nelson ""urgently"" flagged the way Russia is believed to be dodging Western controls to resupply plastics, rubber and semi-conductors found in exported goods and used by the military, the official said.Nelson also visited the United Arab Emirates and Oman to reiterate that Washington will continue aggressively enforcing its sanctions, the Treasury said last week.Germany has collected evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, the country's prosecutor general said, adding that he saw a need for a judicial process at the international level.""Currently, for example, we are focusing on the mass killings in Bucha or attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure,"" Federal Prosecutor General Peter Frank told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper in comments released ahead of publication. So far, prosecutors have pieces of evidence in the ""three-digit range,"" he added, without elaborating.Germany began collecting evidence in March 2022 to prosecute possible war crimes, including by interviewing Ukrainian refugees and evaluating publicly available information, Frank said, adding that German prosecutors were not yet investigating specific individuals.""We are preparing ourselves for a possible later court case — be it with us in Germany, be it with our foreign partners, be it before an international court,"" he added. Asked who should be tried, Frank said Russian state leaders and those implementing decisions at the highest military level should be held accountable.German investigators have no evidence at this stage that Russia was behind the explosions on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines.""This cannot be proven at the moment; the investigations are ongoing,"" Federal Prosecutor General Peter Frank told the Welt am Sonntag.With the help of two research vessels, water and soil samples as well as remnants of the pipelines had been taken, and the crime scene had also been comprehensively documented, he said. ""We are currently evaluating all of this forensically,"" he added.At the end of September, a total of four leaks from the two pipelines had been discovered after explosions near the Danish Baltic Sea island of Bornholm. The Swedish safety authorities had stated in November that it had been a case of serious sabotage — without, however, naming a culprit.The G7 and EU price cap on Russian diesel follows a price cap on Russian crude oil.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800331,Japanese PM Kishida fires senior aide over homophobic comments,"A senior aide of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was dismissed on Saturday after making homophobic comments.Masayoshi Arai, a secretary of the prime minister's office, on Friday, said he ""doesn't even want to look at"" married same-sex couples.He added that he ""wouldn't even like it if they lived next door,"" according to public broadcaster NHK.The same day, Arai retracted his comments and apologized, saying his remarks were inappropriate, even if they were his personal opinion.Kishida rebuked Arai's comments and called them ""outrageous and completely incompatible with administration's policies.""On Saturday, Kishida told reporters that Japan is currently ""aiming for an inclusive society...that recognizes diversity.""Arai's comments are an embarrassment for Kishida, who is preparing to host world leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) nations in May.Japan is the only G7 nation that does not recognize same-sex unions.The Japanese constitution articulates that ""marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes"" and ""with equal rights of husband and wife.""Currently, same-sex couples in Japan cannot inherit each other's assets and are denied parental rights.This week, Kishida told the parliament that same-sex marriages would ""affect the society,"" and that lawmakers need to be ""extremely careful in considering the matter.""The movement toward legalizing same-sex marriage has been growing in Japan, and Aria's comments sparked protests.In a survey conducted by NHK in July 2021, two months before Kishida became prime minister, 57% of 1,508 respondents supported the legal recognition of same-sex unions.In November, a Tokyo court upheld the ban on same-sex marriage. However, it also pointed out that the lack of legislation on same-sex marriage violated their human rights.Arai's dismissal marks another blow to the Kishida government, which has faced plummeting approval ratings since last year.According to recent polls, public support has halved to around 30% after a series of resignations of senior officials.In the last three months, four ministers resigned over allegations of financial irregularities or links to the controversial unification church.In 2022, a justice minister stepped down after joking about capital punishment and internal affairs.The same year, a communications vice minister resigned over comments about LGBTQ people and Japan's indigenous Ainu community.In 2021, the head of the Tokyo Olympic Organizing Committee, Yoshiro Mori, resigned after saying women talked too much.ns/sms (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/02/04,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800332,What we know about Chinese 'spy' balloons,"A Chinese ""spy balloon"" has been sighted over Latin America, the Pentagon said on Friday, a day after a similar orb was sighted in US skies.The balloons have raised numerous questions and raised tensions between Washington and Beijing. DW takes a look at what we know and what the impact could be.China insists the balloon sighted over the United States is a misguided civilian airship with only limited ""self-piloting"" capability. It was reportedly used primarily for meteorological surveys until winds blew it off course.The United States, however, says it is undoubtedly a Chinese spy balloon about the size of three buses. According to the Pentagon, the balloon carries sensors and surveillance equipment, is maneuverable and has shown it can change course.No additional information has been made public (as of publication) about whether the balloon spotted over Latin America differs from that one seen in North America. The Pentagon did not initially provide information about the second balloon's exact location.International security expert Ian Chong told DW that while not much is known about the balloons, they could be used to gather a variety of data.""These high altitude balloons in general have a range of functions. They can do anything from imaging to collecting samples from the air to trying to collect signals intelligence,"" Chong said, adding that there was still not enough information at hand to determine its exact purpose.The first balloon is moving eastwards over the US at an altitude of about 18,600 meters (60,000 feet). It has loitered over sensitive areas of the northwestern state of Montana where nuclear warheads are siloed, and a Pentagon spokesman said it could remain aloft over the US for ""a few days.""US officials say the Biden administration was aware of the first balloon even before it crossed into US airspace in Alaska early this week. In the first public statement on Thursday evening, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the balloon was not a military or physical threat, implying it does not carry weapons.He also added that ""once the balloon was detected, the US government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information.''According to US officials, President Joe Biden initially wanted to shoot the balloon down, but top Pentagon leaders strongly advised Biden against that move because of risks to the safety of people on the ground, and the president agreed.The balloon has already prompted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to postpone his trip to Beijing. The visit will be rescheduled once circumstances permit, a senior State Department official said on Friday.Earlier, Blinken called China's actions ""irresponsible"" and ""unacceptable."" He said the world expects the US and China to manage their relationship responsibly. The US does so and expects the same from China, Blinken said.On Saturday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed that ""China ... never violated the territory and airspace of any sovereign country,"" adding that ""some politicians and media in the United States used the incident as a pretext to attack and smear China.""Both countries insisted on continuing to maintain open channels of communication.Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University, told DW that the incident shows ""how shaky"" relations are between China and the US.""If even such a relatively minor incident could derail a long-anticipated visit at this level, that shows they still find it difficult to trust each other as dependable long-term partners,"" he said.He added that China will also need to find ways to improve relations with US lawmakers, as the State Department statement noted that Blinken's postponement came following consultations with Congress.""This signals the major reason behind the US decision to postpone the trip has to do with Congressional pressure,"" he said, noting that President Joe Biden's administration would have likely faced criticism from Republican lawmakers.DW's William Yang contributed reporting from Taipehrs, dh/sms (AP, AFP, dpa)",2023/02/04,,

            The former Sex Pistols frontman entered the song “Hawaii” with his post-punk band Public Image Ltd. in the national runoff for May’s continent-wide contest.

            Jurors and viewers of a televised final on Friday chose the song “We Are One” by the band Wild Youth to represent Ireland at the contest in May. “Hawaii” came fourth of six finalists.











            The ex-punk firebrand once known as Johnny Rotten was born in London to Irish parents. He said “Hawaii” was a tribute to his wife, Nora, who is living with Alzheimer’s disease.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800348,Israeli army besieges homes of fugitives in West Bank raid,"AQABAT JABR REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) — The Israeli army raided a refugee camp near the Palestinian city of Jericho on Saturday, besieging houses it said were being used as hideouts for Palestinian attackers and shooting at residents who opened fire. The fighting wounded six Palestinians, two seriously, said the Palestinian Health Ministry, and jolted a generally quiet oasis town that has seen less violence than other West Bank cities.

            The army said it entered the Aqabat Jabr refugee camp southwest of Jericho in the occupied West Bank to search for suspects involved in a shooting attack last week at a nearby Israeli settlement.

            Last Saturday, with the West Bank on edge after the deadliest Israeli military raid in two decades and two subsequent Palestinian attacks in east Jerusalem that killed seven people, the army said a Palestinian gunman had opened fire in a restaurant at a settlement near Jericho. After firing one bullet, the gunman fled the scene, the army said. No one was wounded.











            The army said several Palestinians had holed up in their homes after the shooting with the help of family and were planning future attacks.

            To force the fugitives to surrender, a military bulldozer clawed at the walls of one of the homes as an Israeli commander shouted threats over a loudspeaker. Camp residents reported receiving text messages urging families to keep their children inside and avoid clashing with Israeli troops.

            The suspects and family members trickled out of one of the homes and turned themselves in, the military said. Security forces had leveled much of the house, leaving a pile of rubble and twisted metal. Palestinian protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at military jeeps as they rumbled down the camp streets, while some gunmen opened fire. The Israeli military fired back, wounding six, none critically, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.

            The incursion comes as violence rises in east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank under Israel's new far-right government, which has taken a combative stance against the Palestinians. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians seek those territories for their hoped-for independent state.

            The Israeli army has ramped up near-nightly raids in the occupied West Bank since a series of deadly Palestinian attacks within Israel last spring. Over the last year and a half of escalating raids, Jericho has remained a sort of sleepy desert town, spared much of the violence.

            Since last week's shooting at the nearby settlement, the Israeli military has blocked access to several roads into Jericho — a closure that has placed the city under a semi-blockade, disrupting business and creating hourslong bottlenecks at checkpoints that affected even Palestinian security forces, footage showed.

            The Palestinian Authority, in retaliation for last week's raid into the Jenin refugee camp that killed 10 Palestinians, declared a halt to security coordination with Israel.

            Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed last year in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, making it the deadliest in those areas since 2004, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Some 30 people were killed in Israel by Palestinians in 2022.

            The Israeli army says most of the Palestinians killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed.

            In the evening Saturday, the Israeli military said air defenses shot down a drone launched from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip into the country's south. No Palestinian group said it was behind launching the drone, which set off warning sirens on the Israeli side of the frontier.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800370,Police: 2 Pakistani Taliban commanders killed in northwest,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani police killed two commanders from a militant group in the country’s northwest, a local officer said Saturday.

            Pakistan has increased its operations against militants after a surge in violence by the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, particularly in the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. 

            The TTP ended its cease-fire with the government in November, ordering its fighters to carry out attacks across the country.











            Regional police officer Muhammad Ali Gandapur said the slain TTP fighters were wanted in connection with the killing of five police officers and were also involved in attacks on security checkpoints.

            The government had a bounty of $7,259 on the two men.

            Police arrested four fighters and recovered gunpowder, hand grenades, electronic detonators and Kalashnikov rifles in the same intelligence operation in Hund village, Swabi district.

            The operation came days after a suicide bomber attacked a mosque within a police and government compound in the city of Peshawar, the provincial capital, killing 101 people and wounding at least 225. The attack was one of the deadliest in years in the volatile region.PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani police killed two commanders from a militant group in the country’s northwest, a local officer said Saturday.Pakistan has increased its operations against militants after a surge in violence by the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, particularly in the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.The TTP ended its cease-fire with the government in November, ordering its fighters to carry out attacks across the country.Regional police officer Muhammad Ali Gandapur said the slain TTP fighters were wanted in connection with the killing of five police officers and were also involved in attacks on security checkpoints.The government had a bounty of $7,259 on the two men.Police arrested four fighters and recovered gunpowder, hand grenades, electronic detonators and Kalashnikov rifles in the same intelligence operation in Hund village, Swabi district.The operation came days after a suicide bomber attacked a mosque within a police and government compound in the city of Peshawar, the provincial capital, killing 101 people and wounding at least 225.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800393,"State of the Union: Biden sees economic glow, GOP sees gloom","WASHINGTON (AP) — Going into Tuesday's State of the Union address, President Joe Biden sees a nation with its future aglow.

            Republicans take a far bleaker view — that the country is beset by crushing debt and that Biden is largely responsible for inflation. And the GOP now holds a House majority intent on blocking the president. 

            The harder reality is that the United States is on a tight rope, trying to balance efforts to reduce inflation with the need to stay upright and avoid falling into a recession. That's with the seemingly inherent contradiction of the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases and the unemployment rate falling to a near 54-year low.











            Based on past speeches, Biden believes the policies adopted under his watch can fill the U.S. with new factories and protect against climate change. Roads, bridges, sewer systems, ports and internet service would be improved. The middle class would be more financially secure. So would America's place in the global economy's hierarchy.

            On Friday, the president said the proof was in the January employment report. It showed 517,000 jobs were added as the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, making it “crystal clear” that his “chorus of critics” were wrong.

            “Here's where we stand: The strongest job growth in history,” Biden said. “Put simply, I would argue the Biden economic plan is working.”

            Republicans are pushing back. They blamed Biden's trillion-dollar plus spending for high inflation and surging gas and food prices. GOP lawmakers want to repeal his tax increases and additional money for the IRS. They oppose his forgiveness of student debt and blame him for the migrants seeking to enter the country at the U.S.-Mexico border.

            Neither side captures the fullness of the actual state of the economy. 

            One group of experts can read the data and claim a recession is on the horizon. A different group can focus on a separate set of figures and see reason to rejoice. It's a disorienting moment. 

            Biden can celebrate the low jobless rate even as Republicans bemoan inflation that is still running dangerously hot.

            “It’s the best of times and the worst of times for the U.S. economy, to borrow a phrase,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. “The economy is full of contradictions as it struggles to get beyond the massive global shocks of the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”

            Zandi said he expects the U.S. economy will “skirt” a recession this year, though many economists believe a downturn will come.

            Gus Faucher, PNC Financial Services' chief economist, pegs the odds of a recession this year at 60%. But he said any downturn would be “mild” because “worker shortages will limit layoffs, consumer balance sheets are in great shape, the banking system is solid.”

            Most people in the U.S. assume the nation is already in a recession, even if they personally feel fine.

            Only 24% of adults call the national economy good and 76% say conditions are poor, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. At the same time, 57% say their personal financial situation is good. That’s unchanged since December, but it has eroded slightly since earlier last year when 62% felt positively about their finances.

            The key force shaping the economy right now is the Fed, which has the mission of keeping prices stable and inflation at around 2%. Consumer prices jumped 6.5% last year. 

            To bring down inflation, the Fed has tried to slow down hiring and growth by raising its benchmark rate over the past year. When Biden delivered the State of the Union Address in 2022, the Fed's benchmark rate was effectively near-zero. It's now over 4.5%, the fastest increase in four decades, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the rate will likely go higher.

            “Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone,” Powell told reporters after the Fed board's most recent meeting.

            The Fed rate increases mark a major reversal in how the economy operates. 

            Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. central bank had held its benchmark rate near historic lows to bring back growth. That made it easier for tech start-ups because cheap money meant investors expected them to focus on growth instead of profits. Consumers got use to historically cheap rates for mortgages and auto loans.

            The past year's rate jumps produced a sudden whiplash. The stock market fell. Prominent tech companies such as Google and Microsoft recently announced layoffs. Even as computer chip companies began building new plants and crediting Biden's policies, the world economy swung from a dearth of semiconductors to a glut. Mortgage rates initially doubled to over 7%, before falling back a bit to 6% last week. The big increase meant monthly payments became unaffordable for would-be homebuyers, forcing many to stay in rentals.

            Glenn Kelman, CEO of the real estate brokerage Redfin, said the housing market is stronger than many people expected. But the years of low rates worsened generational inequality. Baby boomers became wealthy as their homes increased in value, but then rates jumped at the time when more millennials wanted to buy and they found themselves priced out.

            “A generation ago, boomers owned 21% of U.S. wealth,” Kelman said. ""For millennials, that number is 7%. They’re still on the outside looking in.”

            Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust, said he is surprised that the rate increases have hit housing but not employment. Traditional models assumed that efforts to lower inflation would automatically include job losses. But when he talks to companies, most are reluctant to fire their workers because businesses had trouble finding skilled employees during the pandemic.

            “Because the supply of labor has been so starved for the past two years, firms are holding on to who they have,” Tannenbaum said. ""The prevailing wisdom is if we have a recession it’s going to be shallow. Firms are going to want to be ready to go.” 

            As much as Biden says his mission is about giving Americans a sense of confidence, his challenge might rest with an economy in which few things are certain.

            When the pandemic hit in 2020, the government aid was so overwhelming that a financial market crash turned into a rally. Biden tried to assure the country in 2021 that rising prices were a temporary inconvenience, only to find that inflation defined how many perceived his first two years as president. The expectation was that interest rate increases would ultimately lead to layoffs and higher unemployment, but hiring stayed robust in a sign that the economy is unmoored from traditional expectations.

            If Biden faces a challenge on the economy, it might just be that no one really knows what could happen next.

            “We’re in an environment where there is a lot of uncertainty,"" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. ""The conflicting signals we keep getting on the economy make it very hard to get an accurate pulse.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Going into Tuesday's State of the Union address, President Joe Biden sees a nation with its future aglow.Republicans take a far bleaker view — that the country is beset by crushing debt and that Biden is largely responsible for inflation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800394,Powerball jackpot grows to $747 million after no winner,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The Powerball jackpot grew to an estimated $747 million after no one beat the odds and won the top prize in Saturday night’s drawing.

            The numbers drawn were: 2, 8, 15, 19, 58 and Powerball 10.

            The $747 million Powerball jackpot up for grabs Monday night is the ninth largest in U.S. lottery history and the latest in a string of huge lottery prizes. Someone in Maine won a $1.35 billion Mega Millions prize less than three weeks ago and a California player won a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot last November.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800395,"Lombard shoots 63, 1 clear at Ras Al Khaimah Championship","RAS AL KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) — South African golfer Zander Lombard finished birdie-birdie to shoot a bogey-free round of 9-under 63 and take a one-stroke lead after the third round of the Ras Al Khaimah Championship on Saturday.

            The No. 333-ranked Lombard, who is looking to win his first title on the European tour, is 16 under overall after shooting the lowest round of the week — containing nine birdies — at Al Hamra Golf Club.

            Lombard chipped in from the fringe of the eighth green for his sixth birdie of the round and went out in 30. He rolled in a birdie putt from 21 feet at No. 12, chipped in from 14 yards for birdie at No. 17 and sent his second shot at the par-5 18th to 5 feet, giving him the chance of a closing eagle.











            He had to settle for a birdie and ended the round a shot clear of Rasmus Hojgaard, who shot 68 after starting the third round in a three-way share of the lead.

            Daniel Gavins (68) is a shot further back in third place.

            David Law and Adrian Meronk were the other co-leaders after the third round but fell away after shooting 72 and 75, respectively.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800402,Electronic pollbook security raises concerns going into 2024,"ATLANTA (AP) — They were blamed for long lines in Los Angeles during California’s 2020 presidential primary, triggered check-in delays in Columbus, Ohio, a few months later and were at the center of former President Donald Trump’s call for supporters to protest in Detroit during last November's midterms.

            High-profile problems involving electronic pollbooks have opened the door for those peddling election conspiracies and underscore the critical role the technology plays in whether voting runs smoothly. Russia and Iran already have demonstrated interest in accessing the systems.

            Despite their importance and potential vulnerabilities, national standards for the security and reliability of electronic pollbooks do not exist and efforts underway to develop them may not be ready or widely adopted in time for the 2024 presidential election.











            “We have a trust issue in elections. The more we can say there are standards that equipment must be tested to, the better,” said Larry Norden, an election security expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. “It’s like a seal of approval that really doesn’t exist right now.”

            Poll workers use electronic pollbooks to check in voters. They typically are a tablet or laptop computer that accesses an electronic list of registered voters with names, addresses and precinct information, with some doing so through an internet connection.

            Testing standards and a certification program for voting machines have been in effect for years, a process overseen by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. While compliance is voluntary, most states will use at least some aspect of the federal process to ensure their voting and ballot-counting machines are secure and functioning properly.

            But there is a much wider system of technology that supports U.S. elections beyond the devices used to scan and tally votes — from electronic pollbooks to voter registration databases and systems used to report unofficial election results to the public. Their use has been expanding rapidly in recent years.

            Nearly one-third of all voting jurisdictions in the U.S. used electronic pollbooks in 2020, compared with about 18% four years earlier, according to data collected by Election Assistance Commission.

            The systems come with unique security challenges.

            In 2016, Russian hackers scanned state voter registration systems looking for vulnerabilities and even accessed the voter registration database in Illinois, although an investigation later determined no voter data was manipulated. In 2020, Iranian hackers obtained confidential voter data and used it to send misleading emails to voters, seeking to spread misinformation and influence the election.

            Experts say the systems could be prime targets again for those seeking to disrupt the voting process and sow chaos around U.S. elections. Gaining access to a voter registration database, for example, could allow someone to delete voters from the rolls. When people show up to vote, they are told they are not on the list.

            Although those voters would be allowed to cast a provisional ballot that eventually could count, widespread problems with the voter registration database would trigger questions about a process that already has suffered a loss in public confidence following a sustained campaign by Trump and his allies to discredit the results of the 2020 presidential election. There is no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation of voting equipment in 2020, backed up by exhaustive reviews in states lost by Trump.

            In Detroit last November, a few polling locations had a brief issue checking in voters related to a data error that was quickly identified and resolved. Trump seized on the early reports, calling the situation in Detroit “REALLY BAD” in a social media post and urging people to “Protest, Protest, Protest!” 

            Unlike voting machines that are not directly connected to the internet, many electronic pollbook systems are connected by design. Some are quite sophisticated.

            In counties that have put in place a vote center model, where registered voters can cast a ballot at any polling place, electronic pollbooks must be able to communicate with each other and with a central system. That's to ensure voters are not able to cast ballots at multiple locations or vote in-person after returning a mail ballot.

            While that can present significant security challenges, scrutiny for the pollbook systems is not as consistent as with voting machines.

            The lack of national standards has left state and local election officials on their own. For the 2020 election, 15 states, including Arizona, Florida and Nevada, did not require any type of electronic pollbook testing or certification, according to federal data.

            States and even some counties are often testing their pollbook systems in isolation and results are not routinely shared — an information gap that could be addressed with a national testing program.

            ""Having that type of knowledge allows them to put compensating controls into place, but they are doing it on an individual basis — state by state, county by county,” said Ryan Macias, an election and security expert who advises federal, state and local officials.

            Aware of the risks, many election officials require back-up measures, such as paper copies of voter lists at polling locations. Election officials and experts note that one advantage of national testing standards for voting machines is the ability to assure voters that they have been properly scrutinized.

            Two efforts are underway that seek to address the lack of uniform testing standards for electronic pollbooks. The Election Assistance Commission partnered with the nonprofit Center for Internet Security to test pollbooks and other nonvoting machine technology. But the federal agency began working on its pilot testing program in late 2021, about the same time the center announced results of the first phase of its own project.

            It’s not clear why the two groups went their separate ways and what will happen next. A spokesman for the center, Jay Billington, said the group is “close to concluding the pilot” and expects to provide an update soon.

            Thomas Hicks, chair of the commission, said the agency is making progress on its own pilot program, but that it was unlikely testing standards could be in place before the 2024 election.

            “But this is why we move forward,"" he said. ""In 2026, there will be another federal election, and in 2028 another.”

            Hicks said he welcomed the work done by the center and thought having more than one testing program could allow states to pick the best option for them.

            Experts said having national testing standards would go a long way to reducing costs of the systems and lessen the burden on state and local election officials to navigate security on their own. Companies that make the equipment have expressed support for the effort.

            During a November 2021 panel hosted by the commission to discuss its pilot project, representatives from testing laboratories said they had evaluated 76 different pollbooks by about a dozen manufacturers over the past three years. Agency officials noted the stakes were high.

            “Real or perceived attacks on our voting systems can threaten voter confidence,” one commissioner, Don Palmer, said during the panel. “So that’s one reason why we think as much testing as possible is a good thing.”ATLANTA (AP) — They were blamed for long lines in Los Angeles during California’s 2020 presidential primary, triggered check-in delays in Columbus, Ohio, a few months later and were at the center of former President Donald Trump’s call for supporters to protest in Detroit during last November's midterms.High-profile problems involving electronic pollbooks have opened the door for those peddling election conspiracies and underscore the critical role the technology plays in whether voting runs smoothly.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800404,Why a new Alzheimer's drug is having a slow US debut,"The first drug to show that it slows Alzheimer’s is on sale, but treatment for most patients is still several months away. 

            Two big factors behind the slow debut, experts say, are scant insurance coverage and a long setup time needed by many health systems.

            Patients who surmount those challenges will step to the head of the line for a drug that delivers an uncertain benefit. Here’s a closer look. 











            THE SITUATION

            The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Leqembi, from Japanese drugmaker Eisai, in early January. It's for patients with mild or early cases of dementia tied to Alzheimer’s disease.

            Regulators used the FDA’s accelerated pathway, which allows drugs to launch before they’re confirmed to benefit patients. In studies, Leqembi modestly slowed the fatal disease, but doctors aren't sure yet how that translates into things like greater independence for patients.

            Patients get the drug by IV every two weeks. Eisai says the company has shipped Leqembi to U.S. specialty drug distribution centers. From there, it can be delivered overnight to hospitals or medical centers.

            Eisai spokeswoman Libby Holman said prescriptions for the drug have been written, and they expect patients to start receiving it “very soon.”

            COST AND COVERAGE

            A year’s treatment will run about $26,500. Patients who can afford that without insurance will be able to start the treatment if they are deemed a candidate for Leqembi and they find a doctor and health care system prepared to help them. 

            There are currently few options outside self-pay. Most of the patients who may be candidates for this drug are on Medicare, and the federal program's coverage is narrow so far. It has said it will cover treatments like Leqembi only for patients enrolled in certain research trials designed to test the drug. 

            There are no such studies currently accepting new patients.

            “There’s a theoretical door (to coverage) that’s completely slammed shut,” said Robert Egge, chief public policy officer for the nonprofit Alzheimer’s Association. 

            Medicare made that coverage decision last year when another Alzheimer's drug, Biogen’s Aduhelm, hit the market. 

            Health insurers, which run Medicare Advantage coverage, have been sticking to that decision, said a spokesman for the trade group America's Health Insurance Plans. 

            The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Medicare, said after Leqembi's approval that it may reconsider its coverage stance, something the Alzheimer’s Association has urged it to do. 

            Coverage also is likely to change if the drug receives full approval from the FDA. That could happen later this year. 

            In the meantime, Eisai has an assistance program that provides Leqembi for free to some patients, including those on Medicare. It’s based partly on financial need. 

            DIAGNOSING

            It can take anywhere from several months to more than a year for doctors to diagnose a patient and then figure out if that person is a candidate for Leqembi, according to Dr. Sarah Kremen, a neurologist with the Cedars-Sinai health system in Los Angeles.

            That can depend on where a patient lives and the physician's expertise.

            First, a doctor must determine whether a patient has mild dementia.

            Then the doctor has to decide what caused the condition. It could stem from Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, a stroke or a brain injury.

            If it’s related to Alzheimer’s disease, doctors must determine whether the patient's brain has an amyloid protein. The new drug aims to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s by removing that protein.

            After all that, some doctors may hesitate to prescribe Leqembi because they don’t have a good idea yet for how the drug will help the patient or affect their everyday life, Kremen said. They have to consider that uncertainty against the brain swelling and bleeding that can develop in patients taking it. 

            “I think this benefit versus harm issue is going to weigh heavily,” she said. 

            DELIVERING TREATMENT

            Health systems must first develop plans for delivering drugs like Leqembi before they start offering it. That can take months, although some may have started before regulators approved the drug. 

            This planning might include training nurses on how to give the drug and making sure prescribing doctors know how to recognize candidates for it. Care providers also need a plan for how patients will be monitored once they start taking it. 

            Patients need repeated brain scans to check for side effects. 

            Doctors may want to know that such a plan is in place before they feel comfortable writing a prescription, Kremen noted.

            Hospital systems also will have to figure out how many patients might come to them for this drug and be able to cover all the costs tied to it. Those might include clinic, nursing, radiologist and pharmacy fees.

            “Frankly, the hospital systems are going to have to decide if they want to offer it,” Kremen said. “Is it worth the cost?”

            Eisai estimates that about 100,000 people will be diagnosed and eligible to receive Leqembi in the United States by 2026. Representatives of the drugmaker declined to estimate how many people might receive it this year.

            The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group. The AP is solely responsible for all content.The first drug to show that it slows Alzheimer’s is on sale, but treatment for most patients is still several months away.Two big factors behind the slow debut, experts say, are scant insurance coverage and a long setup time needed by many health systems.Patients who surmount those challenges will step to the head of the line for a drug that delivers an uncertain benefit. Here’s a closer look.THE SITUATIONThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Leqembi, from Japanese drugmaker Eisai, in early January. It's for patients with mild or early cases of dementia tied to Alzheimer’s disease.Regulators used the FDA’s accelerated pathway, which allows drugs to launch before they’re confirmed to benefit patients. In studies, Leqembi modestly slowed the fatal disease, but doctors aren't sure yet how that translates into things like greater independence for patients.Patients get the drug by IV every two weeks. Eisai says the company has shipped Leqembi to U.S. specialty drug distribution centers. From there, it can be delivered overnight to hospitals or medical centers.Eisai spokeswoman Libby Holman said prescriptions for the drug have been written, and they expect patients to start receiving it “very soon.”COST AND COVERAGEA year’s treatment will run about $26,500. Patients who can afford that without insurance will be able to start the treatment if they are deemed a candidate for Leqembi and they find a doctor and health care system prepared to help them.There are currently few options outside self-pay. Most of the patients who may be candidates for this drug are on Medicare, and the federal program's coverage is narrow so far. It has said it will cover treatments like Leqembi only for patients enrolled in certain research trials designed to test the drug.There are no such studies currently accepting new patients.“There’s a theoretical door (to coverage) that’s completely slammed shut,” said Robert Egge, chief public policy officer for the nonprofit Alzheimer’s Association.Medicare made that coverage decision last year when another Alzheimer's drug, Biogen’s Aduhelm, hit the market.Health insurers, which run Medicare Advantage coverage, have been sticking to that decision, said a spokesman for the trade group America's Health Insurance Plans.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Medicare, said after Leqembi's approval that it may reconsider its coverage stance, something the Alzheimer’s Association has urged it to do.Coverage also is likely to change if the drug receives full approval from the FDA.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800421,'Died suddenly' posts twist tragedies to push vaccine lies,"Results from 6-year-old Anastasia Weaver’s autopsy may take weeks. But online anti-vaccine activists needed only hours after her funeral this week to baselessly blame the COVID-19 vaccine.

            A prolific Twitter account posted Anastasia’s name and smiling dance portrait in a tweet with a syringe emoji. A Facebook user messaged her mother, Jessica Day-Weaver, to call her a “murderer” for having her child vaccinated.

            In reality, the Ohio kindergartner had experienced lifelong health problems since her premature birth, including epilepsy, asthma and frequent hospitalizations with respiratory viruses. “The doctors haven’t given us any information other than it was due to all of her chronic conditions. ... There was never a thought that it could be from the vaccine,"" Day-Weaver said of her daughter's death.











            But those facts didn’t matter online, where Anastasia was swiftly added to a growing list of hundreds of children, teens, athletes and celebrities whose unexpected deaths and injuries have been incorrectly blamed on COVID-19 shots. Using the hashtag #diedsuddenly, online conspiracy theorists have flooded social media with news reports, obituaries and GoFundMe pages in recent months, leaving grieving families to wrestle with the lies.

            There’s the 37-year-old Brazilian television host who collapsed live on air because of a congenital heart problem. The 18-year-old unvaccinated bull rider who died from a rare disease. The 32-year-old actress who died from bacterial infection complications. 

            The use of “died suddenly” — or a misspelled version of it — has surged more than 740% in tweets about vaccines over the past two months compared with the two previous months, the media intelligence firm Zignal Labs found in an analysis conducted for The Associated Press. The phrase’s explosion began with the late November debut of an online “documentary” by the same name, giving power to what experts say is a new and damaging shorthand.

            “It’s kind of in-group language, kind of a wink wink, nudge nudge,” said Renee DiResta, technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory. “They’re taking something that is a relatively routine way of describing something — people do, in fact, die unexpectedly — and then by assigning a hashtag to it, they aggregate all of these incidents in one place.”

            The campaign causes harm beyond just the internet, epidemiologist Dr. Katelyn Jetelina said.

            “The real danger is that it ultimately leads to real world actions such as not vaccinating,” said Jetelina, who tracks and breaks down COVID data for her blog, “Your Local Epidemiologist.” 

            Rigorous study and real-world evidence from hundreds of millions of administered shots prove that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Deaths caused by vaccination are extremely rare and the risks associated with not getting vaccinated are far higher than the risks of vaccination. But that hasn't stopped conspiracy theorists from lobbing a variety of untrue accusations at the vaccines.

            The “Died Suddenly” film features a montage of headlines found on Google to falsely suggest they prove that sudden deaths have “never happened like this until now.” The film has amassed more than 20 million views on an alternative video sharing website, and its companion Twitter account posts about more deaths and injuries daily.

            An AP review of more than 100 tweets from the account in December and January found that claims about the cases being vaccine related were largely unsubstantiated and, in some cases, contradicted by public information. Some of the people featured died of genetic disorders, drug overdoses, flu complications or suicide. One died in a surfing accident. 

            The filmmakers did not respond to specific questions from the AP, but instead issued a statement that referenced a “surge in sudden deaths” and a “PROVEN rate of excess deaths,” without providing data.

            The number of overall deaths in the U.S. has been higher than what would be expected since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, in part because of the virus, overdoses and other causes. COVID-19 vaccines prevented nearly 2 million U.S. deaths in just their first year of use.

            Some deaths exploited in the film predate the pandemic. California writer Dolores Cruz published an essay in 2022 about grieving for her son, who died in a car crash in 2017. “Died Suddenly” used a screenshot of the headline in the film, portraying his death as vaccine related.

            “Without my permission, someone has taken his story to show one side, and I don’t appreciate that,” Cruz said in an interview. “His legacy and memory are being tarnished.”

            Others featured in the film survived — but have been forced to watch clips of their medical emergencies misrepresented around the world. For Brazilian TV presenter Rafael Silva, who collapsed while reporting on air because of a congenital heart abnormality, online disinformation prompted a wave of harassment even before the “Died Suddenly” film used the footage.

            “I received messages saying that I should have died to serve as an example for other people who were still thinking about getting the vaccine,” Silva said. 

            Many of the posts online cite no evidence except that the person who died had been vaccinated at some point in the past, using a common disinformation strategy known as post hoc fallacy, according to Jetelina.

            “People assume that one thing caused another merely because the first thing preceded the other,” she said. 

            Some claims about those who’ve suffered heart issues also weaponize a kernel of truth — that COVID-19 vaccines can cause rare heart inflammation issues, myocarditis or pericarditis, especially in young men. Medical experts say these cases are typically mild and the benefits of immunization far outweigh the risks. 

            The narrative also has leveraged high-profile moments like the collapse of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin as he suffered cardiac arrest during a game last month after a fierce blow to his chest. But sudden cardiac arrest has long been a prominent cause of death in the U.S. — and medical experts agree the vaccine didn’t cause Hamlin’s injury.

            For some families, the misinformation represents a sideshow to their real focus: understanding why their loved ones died and preventing similar tragedies. 

            Clint Erickson's son, Tyler, died in September just before his 18th birthday while golfing near their home in Florida. The family knows his heart stopped but still doesn't know exactly why. Tyler wasn't vaccinated, but his story appeared in the “Died Suddenly” film nonetheless.

            “It bothers me, him being used in that way,” Erickson said. But “the biggest personal issue I have is trying to find an answer or a closure to what caused this.”

            Day-Weaver said it was upsetting to see people exploiting her daughter's death when they knew nothing about her. They didn't know that she loved people so much she would hug strangers at Walmart, or that she had just learned how to snap. 

            Still, Day-Weaver said, “I wouldn't wish the loss of a child on anybody. Even them.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800431,Cocaine capital: Antwerp fears drug-related attacks may rise,"Teun Voeten lightly touches one of several round holes in a garage door on a quiet street on the northeast side of Antwerp. ""Looks like a Kalashnikov to me,"" he says, assessing what kind of gun killed an 11-year-old girl inside her home in early January.Though the death is believed to be the accidental outcome of a warning signal from a drug gang gone awry, Voeten, a Dutch cultural anthropologist who's researched Antwerp's drug culture, says there's a risk it may set off a ""cycle of revenge … a whole new level of violence with unpredictable dynamics.""The murder happened the same day Belgian authorities revealed a record seizure for 2022 of 110 tons of cocaine in Antwerp, estimated to be only about 10% of what passes through the port. This puts it far ahead of Rotterdam, where 52.5 tons were intercepted last year, a decline from 2021’s total of 77 tons.The European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction, together with Europol, estimated that the European Union's retail market for cocaine was worth a minimum of €12.8 billion ($13.9 billion) in 2020, a figure the agencies said was likely below the actual value given that seizures have grown dramatically since then.Until now, Voeten told DW, despite the ""incredible amount"" of cocaine flooding into Antwerp, the city has never seen the gang-related brutality of Rotterdam or Amsterdam, where he noted a severed head had been left outside a cafe in 2016. But the authorities' recent success in taking down some powerful players in the Netherlands means more unwelcome activities may be shifting to Antwerp.""It was basically the Dutch calling the shots and using the Belgians for the dirty work, to recuperate cocaine out of the containers,"" Voeten explained. ""But Belgians have jumped in position because many Dutch big shots were arrested. The whole organizational structures are shaken  up a little bit. So there will be a lot of more tough action from the authorities and I expect there will be more violence.""Antwerp's mayor, Bart de Wever, has called for the national army to be deployed at the port, and while that idea hasn't received wide political support, the government has announced there will be at least 100 additional police assigned to the port along with additional scanning equipment to increase inspections beyond the estimated 1% of cargo currently possible.While port workers will welcome the back-up, they're also bracing for its effects on traffickers' behavior. The situation is already bad enough, says Stephan Vanfraechem, managing director of Alfaport Voka, which represents some 300 companies involved in operating the facility.Vanfraechem told DW that in years past, dockworkers on-site were the main target for gang recruitment, but as scrutiny mounts, so does pressure on a wider range of employees. He waved his arm at the dock-front neighborhood, noting there are very specific cafes where drug-gang members physically shadow workers to gain personal information.""[Smugglers] are becoming more and more aggressive. They need information and they need guys who can physically help them,"" Vanfraechem explained. He said cartels are increasingly trying to draw in white-collar workers who may have access to logistics and other technical information, and trying to hook students who can be steered toward academic careers that would benefit the trafficking trade.""What they do now is they they approach you very directly to show pictures of your family, of your kids, of friends. And this is a not a very subtle way of working. It's a real threat,"" he added.Taking the gangs on publicly like this is a threat to himself as well, he acknowledged, but one he feels is necessary. ""I realize that this is a danger, maybe also for myself and my family, my wife and kids,"" he said. ""I think there's no alternative than being open about this problem. If you stay silent I consider us to be cooperating with these guys. I think we need to stop them.""Stopping them is not something Europe can do alone, which is why Europol, the EU police agency, is increasingly working with those countries where the drug originates and those outside EU jurisdiction where some of the key players have based themselves, aiming to avoid extradition.The criminals are so well connected, says Jan Op Gen Oorth, head of Europol's Corporate Communications, that ""we've seen messages with somebody ordering a contract killing from Europe to Latin America expecting that it will be carried out in the next hour.""Law enforcement is working on its own international dragnet. ""You have to have a network to crack a network,"" Op Gen Oorth said. ""But the global coalition of law enforcement also needs to be strategically smart because it's not good enough to just take out the small soldiers on the low level … the people who are getting the cocaine out of the container. You need to go after what we call 'high-value targets.'""Cooperation ranges from the highly-sophisticated utilization of a fake encrypted-communication platform which busted 800 criminals in 2021 to more legal agreements signed with countries such as Dubai, where key arrests have been made, to simply working to improve oversight at loading docks in Latin America where most of the cocaine originates. With more and more countries joining the effort, Op Gen Oorth says, ""I am confident that we will be able to take out the big players, but it will take time.""In the meantime, however, Belgium has another problem. Authorities have expressed concern that the massive piles of seized cocaine awaiting incineration create a lucrative lure for traffickers.Edited by: Rob Mudge",2023/02/04,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800434,Arsenal loses 1-0 at Everton for 2nd Premier League defeat,"LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Arsenal lost in the Premier League for just the second time this season as Everton pulled off a surprising 1-0 win over the leaders on Saturday in its first match under new manager Sean Dyche.

            A couple of Dyche’s former players at Burnley did the business for him at a lively Goodison Park.

            James Tarkowski headed in an inswinging corner to the far post from Dwight McNeil for the winning goal in the 60th minute, capping a performance of intensity and desire from a team that started the match in next-to-last place.











            While Everton climbed out of the relegation zone at least temporarily, Arsenal tasted defeat in the league for the first time since losing at Manchester United on Sept. 4.

            Second-place Manchester City can trim the gap to Arsenal to two points with a win at Tottenham on Sunday, though Arsenal would still have a game in hand.

            It will go down as one of Arsenal's worst performances of the season, at a time when Mikel Arteta's team was looking in prime shape to go on and win the league for the first time since 2004.

            “This is not going to be a rose pathway,"" Arteta said. ""This is going to be tricky and we will have to dig in and play much better than we did today.”

            Everton showed improved shape and organization under Dyche, characteristics he demanded of his well-drilled Burnley teams over the years and ones he sees as integral if his new club is to preserve its 69-year top-flight status.

            Dyche said he had crammed a lot of instructions to his players into his first week on the job and wanted to get them to “understand the basics of the game.” 

            “It’s not that they weren’t wearing the badge with pride, it just needed shining up a bit,” Dyche said. “There was commitment but it maybe got a bit softened.”

            Everton had the better of the first-half chances, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin unable to get enough on the ball from two yards out after Amadou Onana surged down the left and sent in a cross before Abdoulaye Doucoure headed wide from McNeil's cross.

            Bukayo Saka had a weak shot cleared off line and Arsenal teammate Eddie Nketiah blazed high and wide, but the visitors were often hounded out of possession in midfield and struggled to keep their composure.

            Indeed, frustrations boiled over in stoppage time as Arsenal left back Oleksandr Zinchenko clashed with Everton substitute Neal Maupay off the ball.

            Jorginho, signed on Tuesday from Chelsea, came on as a second-half substitute for his Arsenal debut but didn't make a significant impression.

            “We needed more composure and to control emotionally the game better. We gave away so many unnecessary free kicks and that’s what they want,” Arteta said.

            “Today I love them much better than the week before or a month ago. It is easy to be next to someone when they are winning well. I am still so proud of all of these players.""

            Everton, which claimed its first victory since Oct. 22, had lost every game since the restart after the World Cup except for a draw at second-place Man City.

            The 16-year-old was pulled from the Swan River with critical injuries. Emergency personnel provided medical assistance to her at the scene but she died, said Police Acting Inspector Paul Robinson. 

            He said the victim was with her friends on jet skis. ""There was possibly a pod of dolphins seen nearby and the young female jumped in the water to swim nearby the dolphins.











            ""The family weren’t there when this took place, however, her friends were and as you can imagine this is an extremely traumatic incident for anyone to witness so obviously we’re offering counselling services to anyone who did witness it or is affected by the incident,” he said. 

            He said the Department of Fisheries had advised him it was unusual for a shark to be so far down the river, which flows through Perth into the Indian Ocean.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800439,"In Tyre Nichols' neighborhood, Black residents fear police","MEMPHIS (AP) — In a terrible way, the death of Tyre Nichols brings vindication to members of the Black community in Memphis who live in constant fear of the police.

            Often, before, people didn't believe them when told how bad it is. 

            The fatal beating of Nichols, 29, by five police officers tells the story many residents know by heart: that any encounter, including traffic stops, can be deadly if you're Black.











            Examples abound of Black residents, primarily young men, targeted by police. Some are in official reports. Anyone you talk to has a story. Even casual discussions in a coffee shop net multiple examples. 

            A homeowner who called the police because a young man who had been shot was on his front porch. The responding officers ignored the gunshot victim and entered the caller’s home. The caller was slammed to the ground and a chemical agent used on him as he was subdued. The officers then lied about the circumstances, but there was video. 

            A woman who lives in a “safe” northeast Memphis neighborhood yet says her 18-year-old son was hogtied and pepper-sprayed by police several years ago –- while she was with him. He became agitated after police arrived on the scene while he picked up his child from a girlfriend, triggering a mental health crisis, she said. 

            In police sweeps, unmarked cars roll into neighborhoods and armed plainclothes officers jump out, rushing traffic violators and issuing commands. The result is a community in fear, where people text, call and use social media to caution each other to stay inside or avoid the area when police operations are underway. 

            “There’s one type of law enforcement that keeps people safe, and then there’s a type of law enforcement that keeps people in check,” said Joshua Adams, 29, who grew up in south Memphis' Whitehaven, home to Elvis Presley’s Graceland Mansion, now a mostly Black neighborhood.

            If you are in the wrong neighborhood “it really doesn’t matter whether you’re part of the violence or not,” said Adams. “I’m less likely to be shot in a gang conflict than I am to be shot by police.” 

            Chase Madkins was about a block from his mother’s Evergreen neighborhood home just east of downtown Memphis dropping off his 12-year-old nephew when the blue lights of an unmarked police car flashed behind him. 

            Within seconds the officer ordered him out of the car and told him he made an illegal turn, and his license plate was not properly displayed because it was bent at the corner. 

            Madkins said the officer, dressed in tactical gear with his face covered and no visible identification, refused to give his badge number, unless he consented to a weapon search of the car. 

            Madkins, 34, consented, but called an activist friend to get to the scene. 

            “I had to remind myself, `Chase, this is how people get murdered, in a traffic stop,’” he said. To this day he does not know who the officer was. 

            The random stops are meant to terrorize, said Hunter Demster, organizer for Decarcerate Memphis. He's the one Madkins called when he was stopped in November. 

            “They go into these poor Black communities and they do mass pullover operations, terrifying everybody in that community,” Demster said. Some people might think the officers are looking for murderers or people accused of heinous crimes, or have stacks of warrants for violent criminals, he said, but “that is not the case.” 

            People want more police, Demster said, but “what they’re really trying to say is we want more detectives looking for violent criminals.” 

            Marcus Hopson, 54, a longtime resident and barber in the neighborhood, said the sweeps remind him of how in the early 1990s New York focused on nuisance crimes and zero tolerance and that morphed into stop-and-frisk. 

            “It didn’t work then. It’s not going to work now,” said Hopson, who now splits time with a home in Mississippi. “You are terrorizing the neighborhoods.” 

            Black residents make up about 63% of the city’s population of 628,000. In many ways it is two cities: One is Beale Street and blues, barbecue and Elvis. The other is a spiritual center because of what happened here decades ago. There’s the Mason Temple where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous and prophetic speech proclaiming that Black people would eventually reach a world of equality. And there is the balcony at the Lorraine Motel, less than 2 miles away, where an assassin’s bullet killed King the next day and changed the future of Black life.

            What that left here is complicated, especially when it comes to policing and crime. In 2021, the year the SCORPION unit – a specialty squad that all five officers were part of -- was set up, homicides hit a record, breaking one set in 2020, the previous year. Homicides dropped in 2022 but high-profile cases kept crime in the news. Most of the victims those years were young Black men. In the cases where arrests have been made, the suspects were overwhelmingly Black. 

            “There are more officers in Black communities here because unfortunately we’ve seen a spike in crime in our communities,” said Memphis NAACP President Van Turner. 

            But adding police without addressing the underlying issues, including poverty, won’t help, he said. 

            “You have not resolved the systemic issues which create the crime in the first place,"" Turner said. 

            The data also shows a disparity between the city's population and who police target with force: Black men and women accounted for anywhere from 79% of use of force situations to 88%. The data doesn't show how many of those people were being sought on a warrant for violent crimes.

            The Memphis police chief has called Nichols’ death “heinous, reckless and inhumane.” The five officers, all of whom were Black, accused of beating him were all charged with second-degree murder, and other officers and fire department employees on scene also have been fired or disciplined and could be charged. The SCORPION unit has been disbanded. The chief has ordered a review of all the special units.

            Some people in the community are willing to give the police chief a chance to reform the department.

            Marcus Taylor, 48, who owns a janitorial business and lives in south Memphis, urged officers in the precincts to come into their communities and network, “talk to store owners, go to barbershops, come to basketball games, and do it regularly. Get to know the people you are supposed to be protecting.”

            “Come out without the lights flashing,” he said. “You’re out here to protect and serve, not beat up and whip. Everybody is not that hardened criminal.”

            Madkins, who was among hundreds of people attending Nichols’ funeral on Wednesday, said he wants to be hopeful. He heard the words of the Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered a eulogy: “I don’t know when. I don’t know how. But we won’t stop until we hold you accountable and change this system,” Sharpton said. 

            “I felt affirmed. I felt seen and heard in my own struggle,” Madkins said. 

            The vindication, if you can call it that, comes too late for Tyre Nichols. 

            At the place where he was fatally beaten grows an unofficial symbol of violence and tragedy –- a makeshift memorial with balloons and stuffed animals. It is around the corner from his mother’s home. 

            Nowhere seems safe for Black young men and boys. 

            When they start walking around the neighborhoods alone, or first start to drive, parents universally caution them on what to do when they encounter cops. 

            “This has to change,” said Erica Brown, 47, who described officers hogtying and pepper-spraying her son while she was with him. The memories of that day in 2014 kept her from watching all the video of Nichols being beaten. “Not just here in Memphis, but it needs to change nationwide.”

The result is a community in fear, where people text, call and use social media to caution each other to stay inside or avoid the area when police operations are underway.“There’s one type of law enforcement that keeps people safe, and then there’s a type of law enforcement that keeps people in check,” said Joshua Adams, 29, who grew up in south Memphis' Whitehaven, home to Elvis Presley’s Graceland Mansion, now a mostly Black neighborhood.If you are in the wrong neighborhood “it really doesn’t matter whether you’re part of the violence or not,” said Adams. “I’m less likely to be shot in a gang conflict than I am to be shot by police.”Chase Madkins was about a block from his mother’s Evergreen neighborhood home just east of downtown Memphis dropping off his 12-year-old nephew when the blue lights of an unmarked police car flashed behind him.Within seconds the officer ordered him out of the car and told him he made an illegal turn, and his license plate was not properly displayed because it was bent at the corner.Madkins said the officer, dressed in tactical gear with his face covered and no visible identification, refused to give his badge number, unless he consented to a weapon search of the car.Madkins, 34, consented, but called an activist friend to get to the scene.“I had to remind myself, `Chase, this is how people get murdered, in a traffic stop,’” he said. To this day he does not know who the officer was.The random stops are meant to terrorize, said Hunter Demster, organizer for Decarcerate Memphis. He's the one Madkins called when he was stopped in November.“They go into these poor Black communities and they do mass pullover operations, terrifying everybody in that community,” Demster said. Some people might think the officers are looking for murderers or people accused of heinous crimes, or have stacks of warrants for violent criminals, he said, but “that is not the case.”People want more police, Demster said, but “what they’re really trying to say is we want more detectives looking for violent criminals.”Marcus Hopson, 54, a longtime resident and barber in the neighborhood, said the sweeps remind him of how in the early 1990s New York focused on nuisance crimes and zero tolerance and that morphed into stop-and-frisk.“It didn’t work then. It’s not going to work now,” said Hopson, who now splits time with a home in Mississippi. “You are terrorizing the neighborhoods.”Black residents make up about 63% of the city’s population of 628,000. In many ways it is two cities: One is Beale Street and blues, barbecue and Elvis. The other is a spiritual center because of what happened here decades ago. There’s the Mason Temple where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous and prophetic speech proclaiming that Black people would eventually reach a world of equality. And there is the balcony at the Lorraine Motel, less than 2 miles away, where an assassin’s bullet killed King the next day and changed the future of Black life.What that left here is complicated, especially when it comes to policing and crime. In 2021, the year the SCORPION unit – a specialty squad that all five officers were part of -- was set up, homicides hit a record, breaking one set in 2020, the previous year. Homicides dropped in 2022 but high-profile cases kept crime in the news. Most of the victims those years were young Black men. In the cases where arrests have been made, the suspects were overwhelmingly Black.“There are more officers in Black communities here because unfortunately we’ve seen a spike in crime in our communities,” said Memphis NAACP President Van Turner.But adding police without addressing the underlying issues, including poverty, won’t help, he said.“You have not resolved the systemic issues which create the crime in the first place,"" Turner said.The data also shows a disparity between the city's population and who police target with force: Black men and women accounted for anywhere from 79% of use of force situations to 88%. The data doesn't show how many of those people were being sought on a warrant for violent crimes.The Memphis police chief has called Nichols’ death “heinous, reckless and inhumane.” The five officers, all of whom were Black, accused of beating him were all charged with second-degree murder, and other officers and fire department employees on scene also have been fired or disciplined and could be charged. The SCORPION unit has been disbanded. The chief has ordered a review of all the special units.Some people in the community are willing to give the police chief a chance to reform the department.Marcus Taylor, 48, who owns a janitorial business and lives in south Memphis, urged officers in the precincts to come into their communities and network, “talk to store owners, go to barbershops, come to basketball games, and do it regularly. Get to know the people you are supposed to be protecting.”“Come out without the lights flashing,” he said. “You’re out here to protect and serve, not beat up and whip. Everybody is not that hardened criminal.”Madkins, who was among hundreds of people attending Nichols’ funeral on Wednesday, said he wants to be hopeful. He heard the words of the Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered a eulogy: “I don’t know when. I don’t know how. But we won’t stop until we hold you accountable and change this system,” Sharpton said.“I felt affirmed. I felt seen and heard in my own struggle,” Madkins said.The vindication, if you can call it that, comes too late for Tyre Nichols.At the place where he was fatally beaten grows an unofficial symbol of violence and tragedy –- a makeshift memorial with balloons and stuffed animals. It is around the corner from his mother’s home.Nowhere seems safe for Black young men and boys.When they start walking around the neighborhoods alone, or first start to drive, parents universally caution them on what to do when they encounter cops.“This has to change,” said Erica Brown, 47, who described officers hogtying and pepper-spraying her son while she was with him. The memories of that day in 2014 kept her from watching all the video of Nichols being beaten. “Not just here in Memphis, but it needs to change nationwide.”___News researcher Rhonda Shafner contributed from New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800450,"Disney World unions vote down offer covering 45,000 workers","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Union members voted down a contract proposal covering tens of thousands of Walt Disney World service workers, saying it didn't go far enough toward helping employees face cost-of-living hikes in housing and other expenses in central Florida.

            The unions said that 13,650 out of 14,263 members who voted on the contract on Friday rejected the proposal from Disney, sending negotiators back to the bargaining table for another round of talks that have been ongoing since August. The contract covers around 45,000 service workers at the Disney theme park resort outside Orlando.

            Disney World service workers who are in the six unions that make up the Service Trades Council Union coalition had been demanding a starting minimum wage jump to at least $18 an hour in the first year of the contract, up from the starting minimum wage of $15 an hour won in the previous contract.











            The proposal rejected on Friday would have raised the starting minimum wage to $20 an hour for all service workers by the last year of the five-year contract, an increase of $1 each year for a majority of the workers it covered. Certain positions, like housekeepers, bus drivers and culinary jobs, would start immediately at a minimum of $20 under the proposal.

            “Housekeepers work extremely hard to bring the magic to Disney, but we can’t pay our bills with magic,"" said Vilane Raphael, who works as a housekeeper at the Disney Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa.

            The company said that the proposal had offered a quarter of those covered by the contract an hourly wage of $20 in its first year, eight weeks of paid time off for a new child, maintenance of a pension and the introduction of a 401K plan. 

            “Our strong offer provides more than 30,000 Cast Members a nearly 10% on average raise immediately, as well as retroactive increased pay in their paychecks, and we are disappointed that those increases are now delayed,"" Disney spokesperson Andrea Finger said in a statement.

            The contract stalemate comes as the Florida Legislature is prepared to convene next week to complete a state takeover of Disney World's self-governing district. With the support of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the GOP-controlled Statehouse last April approved legislation to dissolve the Reedy Creek Improvement District by June 2023, beginning a closely watched process that would determine the structure of government that controls Disney World's sprawling property.

            The contract with the service workers covers the costumed character performers who perform as Mickey Mouse, bus drivers, culinary workers, lifeguards, theatrical workers and hotel housekeepers, representing more than half of the 70,000-plus workforce at Disney World. The contract approved five years ago made Disney the first major employer in central Florida to agree to a minimum hourly wage of $15, setting the trend for other workers in the hospitality industry-heavy region.

            A report commissioned last year by one of the unions in the coalition, Unite Here Local 737, said that an adult worker with no dependents would need to earn $18.19 an hour to make a living wage in central Florida, while a family with two children would need both parents earning $23.91 an hour for a living wage.

            While a wage of $15 an hour was enough for the last contract, “with skyrocketing rent, food, and gas prices in the last three years, it’s no longer possible to survive with those wages,” the report said.

            Before the pandemic, workers with families in the $15 to $16.50 an hour wage bracket could pay their bills. But with inflation causing the price of food and gas to shoot up, an employee earning $15 an hour full time currently makes $530 less than the worker would need to pay for rent, food and gas each month, the report said.

            Last month, food service and concessions workers at the Orange County Convention Center voted to approve a contract that will increase all nontipped workers’ wages to $18 an hour by August, making them the first hospitality workers in Orlando to reach that pay rate.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800455,"Lesia Tsurenko reaches Thailand Open final, to face Zhu Lin","HUA HIN, Thailand (AP) — Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine reached her first final in four years after the top-seeded Bianca Andreescu retired with a shoulder injury during their semifinal match at the Thailand Open on Saturday.

            Tsurenko, in search of her fifth WTA title, was leading the 2019 U.S. Open champion 7-5, 4-0 when the Canadian stopped playing.

            The former world No. 23 fought from 3-5 down to take the first set and reeled off eight straight games before Andreescu retired with a right shoulder problem.











            “Bianca is such an amazing player. She is capable of hitting all kinds of shots and gave so much trouble today,” said the 33-year-old Tsurenko, now ranked 136th. “But I was just fighting and I told myself positive things that I can do it. Unfortunately, she had to retire.”

            The Ukrainian last lifted a WTA trophy in Acapulco in 2018 and hasn't been to a final since Brisbane in 2019.

            She will face Zhu Lin of China in the final on Sunday.

            “She had some good wins in the Australian Open,"" Tsurenko said. “She is one of the dangerous players in this tournament. She is going to give a good fight.”

            In the all-Chinese semifinal earlier, Zhu benefited from a barrage of unforced errors from Wang Xinyu and prevailed 6-2, 6-4 for her first WTA final.

            The world No. 54 player, who reached the last 16 at the Australian Open in January, relied on her solid baseline game to force errors.

            ""It was very windy, so I tried to be patient and keep my first serves in,” said the 29-year-old Zhu, who will team up with Wang in Sunday’s doubles final against Hao-Ching Chan and Fang-Hsien Wu of Taiwan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800470,Route to Super Bowl dangerous for Mexico's avocado haulers,"SANTA ANA ZIROSTO, Mexico (AP) — It is a long and sometimes dangerous journey for truckers transporting the avocados destined for guacamole on tables and tailgates in the United States during the Super Bowl.

            It starts in villages like Santa Ana Zirosto, high in the misty, pine-clad mountains of the western Mexico state of Michoacan. The roads are so dangerous — beset by drug cartels, common criminals, and extortion and kidnap gangs — that state police provide escorts for the trucks brave enough to face the 40-mile (60-kilometer) trip to packing and shipping plants in the city of Uruapan.

            Truck driver Jesús Quintero starts early in the morning, gathering crates of avocados picked the day before in orchards around Santa Ana, before he takes them to a weighing station. Then he joins up with other trucks waiting for a convoy of blue-and-white state police trucks — they recently changed their name to Civil Guard — to start out for Uruapan. 











            “It is more peaceful now with the patrol trucks accompanying us, because this is a very dangerous area,” Quintero said while waiting for the convoy to pull out.

            With hundreds of 22-pound (10-kilogram) crates of the dark green fruit aboard his 10-ton truck, Quintero’s load represents a small fortune in these parts. Avocados sell for as much as $2.50 apiece in the United States, so a single crate holding 40 is worth $100, while an average truck load is worth as much as $80,000 to $100,000.

            Mexico supplies about 92% of U.S. avocado imports, sending north over $3 billion worth of the fruit every year. 

            But it’s often not just the load that is stolen.

            “They would take away our trucks and the fruit, sometimes they’d take the truck as well,” Quintero said. “They would steal two or three trucks per day in this area.”

            It happened to him years ago. “We were coming down a dirt road and two young guys came out and they took our truck and tied us up.”

            Such thefts “have gone down a lot” since the police escorts started, Quintero said. “They have stolen one or two, one every week, but it’s not daily like it used to be.”

            State police officer Jorge González said the convoys escort about 40 trucks a day, ensuring that around 300 tons of avocados reach the packing plants each day.

            “These operations have managed to cut the (robbery) rate by about 90 to 95 percent,” González said. “We accompany them to the packing house, so they can enter with their trucks with no problem.”

            Grower José Evaristo Valencia is happy he doesn't have to worry if his carefully tended avocados will make it to the packing house. Packers depend on arrangements they have made with local orchards to fill promised shipments, and lost avocados can mean lost customers.

            “The main people affected are the producers,"" Valencia said. “People were losing three or four trucks every day. There were a lot of robberies between the orchard and the packing house.”

            The police escorts “have helped us a lot,” he said.

            Once the avocados reach Uruapan or the neighboring city of Tancitaro — the self-proclaimed avocado capital of the world that greets visitors with a giant cement avocado — the path to the north is somewhat safer. 

            The shipment north of avocados for Super Bowl season jhas become an annual event, this year celebrated in Uruapan. It is a welcome diversion from the drumbeat of crimes in the city, which is being fought over by the Viagras and Jalisco cartels. 

            On Jan. 17, Michoacan Gov. Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla “kicked off” the first Super Bowl avocado shipments, literally, kicking a football through tiny goalposts on an imitation football field.

            Behind him, a big tractor trailer bore a huge sign reading “Let’s Go! Super Bowl 2023.” 

            It was an attempt by Michoacan growers to put behind them last year’s debacle, when the U.S. government suspended inspections of the fruit in February, right before the 2022 Super Bowl.

            The inspections were halted for about 10 days after a U.S. inspector was threatened in Michoacan, where growers are routinely subject to extortion by drug cartels. Some Michoacan packers were reportedly buying avocados from other, non-certified states and trying to pass them off as being from Michoacan and were angry the U.S. inspector wouldn’t go along with that.

            U.S. agricultural inspectors have to certify that Mexican avocados don’t carry diseases or pests that would harm U.S. orchards. The Mexican harvest is January through March, while avocado production in the U.S. runs from April to September.

            Exports resumed after Mexico and the United States agreed to enact ""measures that ensure the safety” of the inspectors.

            “This season we are going to recover the confidence of the producers, growers and consumers. By increasing the export production, we hope to send 130,000 tons this season,” the governor said.SANTA ANA ZIROSTO, Mexico (AP) — It is a long and sometimes dangerous journey for truckers transporting the avocados destined for guacamole on tables and tailgates in the United States during the Super Bowl.It starts in villages like Santa Ana Zirosto, high in the misty, pine-clad mountains of the western Mexico state of Michoacan.

It is a welcome diversion from the drumbeat of crimes in the city, which is being fought over by the Viagras and Jalisco cartels.On Jan. 17, Michoacan Gov. Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla “kicked off” the first Super Bowl avocado shipments, literally, kicking a football through tiny goalposts on an imitation football field.Behind him, a big tractor trailer bore a huge sign reading “Let’s Go! Super Bowl 2023.”It was an attempt by Michoacan growers to put behind them last year’s debacle, when the U.S. government suspended inspections of the fruit in February, right before the 2022 Super Bowl.The inspections were halted for about 10 days after a U.S. inspector was threatened in Michoacan, where growers are routinely subject to extortion by drug cartels. Some Michoacan packers were reportedly buying avocados from other, non-certified states and trying to pass them off as being from Michoacan and were angry the U.S. inspector wouldn’t go along with that.U.S. agricultural inspectors have to certify that Mexican avocados don’t carry diseases or pests that would harm U.S. orchards. The Mexican harvest is January through March, while avocado production in the U.S. runs from April to September.Exports resumed after Mexico and the United States agreed to enact ""measures that ensure the safety” of the inspectors.“This season we are going to recover the confidence of the producers, growers and consumers. By increasing the export production, we hope to send 130,000 tons this season,” the governor said.",2023/02/06,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800473,Early goals send Roma to 2-0 win over Empoli in Serie A,"MILAN (AP) — Two almost identical goals in the opening six minutes set Roma on the way to a comfortable 2-0 win over Empoli in Serie A on Saturday.

            Roma moved level on points with second-placed Inter Milan, which hosts defending champion AC Milan in the derby on Sunday.

            Roma was two points ahead of Lazio, Atalanta and AC Milan. Atalanta lost at Sassuolo 1-0 and ended the match with nine men.











            “In the first 25-30 minutes, we looked like a team who could win the league,” Roma scorer Tammy Abraham said. ""We just need to continue like this and keep winning.

            ""Paulo (Dybala) is a very special and talented player. We work well together. Today, he assisted me, and it’s nice to keep sharing the assists and goals. He’s brought that experience that we needed.”

            José Mourinho’s team was looking to bounce back from a humiliating cup exit to Cremonese midweek.

            And it got off to the perfect start when Roger Ibañez headed in a corner from Dybala less than two minutes in.

            Roma doubled its lead four minutes later when Dybala floated in another corner from the left for Abraham to head home.

            Matters almost got worse for Empoli immediately after the break but goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario pulled off a fantastic triple save.

            He first parried Dybala’s volley and then got up quickly to keep out Gianluca Mancini’s follow-up. With Vicario still on the ground, Abraham seemed certain to head in the rebound from point-blank range but the goalkeeper stuck up his leg to incredibly stop that, too.

            RED CARDS

            Atalanta had to play an hour with 10 men at Sassuolo after defender Joakim Mæhle was sent off.

            Mæhle was originally shown a yellow card following a two-footed challenge on Sassuolo forward Domenico Berardi but the referee changed the color to red after being told by VAR to review the incident.

            Armand Laurienté broke the deadlock 10 minutes into the second half.

            Atalanta forward Luis Muriel was also sent off in stoppage time for dissent.

            It was a second straight impressive result for Sassuolo after last week's 5-2 victory at Milan. It moved 10 points above the drop zone.

            BLEAK FUTURE

            Cremonese’s Serie A future grew ever more bleak when it failed to continue its cup exploits in the league.

            Cremonese lost at home to Lecce 2-0 to leave it rock bottom of Serie A, 10 points from safety.

            Lecce inched 10 points above the relegation zone.

            Cremonese was without a Serie A win this season but had beaten Napoli and Roma to reach the Italian Cup semifinals for the first time in 36 years and only the second time ever.

            However, its league woes deepened when Lecce scored twice in the second half.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800474,"6 Nations: Ireland tops Wales 34-10, spoils Gatland's return","CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — Ireland justified its status as rugby’s top-ranked country and the team to beat in the Six Nations by using a strong start to run over Wales with a 34-10 bonus-point victory on Saturday, spoiling Warren Gatland’s first match since his return as coach.

            The 2023 tournament’s first game was virtually over as a contest inside 30 minutes, by which time Ireland had crossed for almost-identical tries by forwards Caelan Doris and James Ryan — through close-range carries — and a breakaway score by winger James Lowe after he intercepted Dan Biggar's pass out wide just outside the Irish 22.

            It gave the Irish a commanding 27-3 lead, the most points they'd ever put on Wales before halftime in championship history. 











            They never looked like relinquishing the lead under the roof at Principality Stadium, even as they dropped their intensity and a Welsh second-half rally contained a converted 46th-minute try from Liam Williams.

            Any chance of a close finish was ended by Williams getting a yellow card for an illegal tackle on Ireland captain Jonathan Sexton in the 65th. It was during the fullback’s absence that flanker Josh van der Flier, the world's best player in 2022, went over for a fourth try to secure a bonus point.

            Ireland coach Andy Farrell wanted his players to experience — and savor — the white-hot occasion of a test match in Cardiff to prepare his team for what is to come in a Rugby World Cup year.

            They passed the test with flying colors, their first championship win in Cardiff in 10 years. It befit a battle-hardened team that won a test series in New Zealand last year and followed that up with a clean sweep of autumn victories over South Africa, Fiji and Australia.

            “These are the occasions you want to be part of, in this stadium against a tough side,"" Ireland fullback Hugo Keenan said. “They’re in transition but are always a serious team, especially here.

            “We're only taking things one game at a time. We won’t get caught up with anything.”

            The Welsh fans were quietened early by the flurry of soft Irish tries but were at least roused by a fightback that will have pleased Gatland, even if his team was ultimately outclassed.

            Wales had 14 turnovers — double the number of Ireland — and was blown away by the visitors' fast start.

            “We lacked discipline and accuracy in that first half and that put us under pressure,” Wales captain Ken Owens said. “We also left a couple of scores out there which would have tightened the game up.

            “We showed character in the second half, we kept pushing but mistakes at key moments let us down against the best team in the world.""

            Asking Gatland to quickly turn around the fortunes of a team that has lost at home to Italy and Georgia in the past year was always asking a lot, even if Ireland hadn't won on Welsh soil since 2013.

            The Welsh play Scotland away and England at home in the next two rounds, a tough start for a team looking to regain its identity under the stewardship of Gatland.

            Ireland, alternatively, heads confidently into a match next weekend against reigning champion France that could shape the destiny of the trophy.

            Winning a forwards battle against Wales was a “great platform” to build on, said Ireland flanker Peter O'Mahony, whose team is seeking a first Six Nations title since 2018.

            “The first 40 minutes, we were flowing nicely,"" he said. ""We started well, we were very calm, attacked well, defense was good.

            “We had some big moments to deny them probably two tries on our own line, with guys showing up for each other when it matters.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800476,Mount Washington experiences record-setting wind chill,"BOSTON (AP) — The Arctic air that descended on the Northeast on Saturday brought dangerously cold sub-zero temperatures and wind chills to the region, including a record-setting wind chill of minus 108 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 78 C) on the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire.

            Temperatures got so low that authorities in Massachusetts took the unusual step of keeping the South Station transit hub open overnight so homeless people had a safe place to sleep. Several cities in the Northeast set or tied record low temperatures for the date, while the high winds brought down a tree branch on a car in western Massachusetts killing an infant.

            “I can’t remember it being this cold, not since 2015,” said Gin Koo, 36, wrapped up in three shirts and a down jacket, as well as a hat and a hood, as he walked his Boston terrier, Bee, in Boston on Saturday morning. Even Bee, wrapped in a doggie coat, shivered. “I wouldn’t go out if I didn’t have to.”











            Paul Butler, 45, who has been homeless since he was evicted in December 2021, took shelter in South Station.

            “This is the coldest I ever, ever remember, and I worked the door at a bunch of clubs for 15 years,” said the former Marine.

            The Arctic air reached the region just as a rapid cyclogenesis developed over Labrador and Newfoundland, churning up powerful winds, meteorologist Donald Dumont at the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, said Friday, explaining the temperature plunge.

            A cyclogenesis refers to an intensification of a cyclone or low-pressure storm system.

            The Mount Washington Observatory at the peak of the Northeast’s highest mountain, famous for its extreme weather conditions, also recorded an actual temperature of minus 47 (minus 44 C), tying an observatory record set in 1934 and a wind gust of 127 mph (204 kmh).

            Across the rest of the region, wind chills — the combined effect of wind and cold air on exposed skin — dropped to as low as minus 45 to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 43 to minus 45 C), the National Weather Service reported.

            The current method to measure wind chill has been used since 2001.

            In Southwick, Massachusetts on Friday the winds brought a tree branch down on a vehicle driven by a 23-year-old Winsted, Connecticut woman, according to the Hampden district attorney's office. The driver was taken to the hospital with serious injuries, but the infant died, authorities said.

            Boston's Pine Street Inn, the largest provider of homeless services in New England, ramped up outreach to those on the streets, doubling the number of vehicles that could transport people to shelters and opening their lobby to provide extra space. 

            “On a night like last night, the biggest concern is the people who have compromised judgment,” President and CEO Lyndia Downie said Saturday of people who have substance use disorder or mental illness. “On these cold nights, they are not thinking at 100% of their capacity. Those are the people we are most worried about.”

            The emergency room at Massachusetts General Hospital treated several people for hypothermia overnight and a couple were admitted for frostbite.

            “The reason that people unfortunately end up with severe frostbite in most cases is just because they don’t have anywhere warm and safe to go,” said Dr. Ali Raja, deputy chair of the emergency department.

            Boston; Providence, Rhode Island; Hartford, Connecticut; Worcester, Massachusetts; Albany, New York; and Glens Falls, New York set or matched record low temperatures for Feb. 4, according to the National Weather Service.

            The cold curtailed some traditional winter activities. Organizers of an annual ice castle attraction in North Woodstock, New Hampshire shortened the evening visitor schedule for Saturday night.

            Erin Trotta of Massachusetts, who had already booked a visit still planned to go, but was taking extra steps to stay warm.

            “We are prepared to take on the polar vortex ice castles. ... Snow pants, thick winter coats, hand and foot warmers, face masks, the kind where only your eyes are exposed, and good gloves and winter boots. Plan to drink some hot cocoa to keep warm.""

            In New York’s Adirondack Mountains, Old Forge recorded a temperature early Saturday of minus 36 degrees (minus 38 C) degrees. Temperatures plunged into the negative teens in dozens of other cities and towns.

            Mackenzie Glasser, owner of Ozzie’s Coffee Bar in Old Forge, said frigid temperatures are just part of living in the Adirondacks.

            “I even had customers for the first hour that I was open, and I wasn’t expecting that at 7 a.m. So I don’t think it’s keeping too many people away,” she said.

            The good news is that the cold air is expected to move out of much of the region by Sunday, when temperatures could rise to the 40s.

The driver was taken to the hospital with serious injuries, but the infant died, authorities said.Boston's Pine Street Inn, the largest provider of homeless services in New England, ramped up outreach to those on the streets, doubling the number of vehicles that could transport people to shelters and opening their lobby to provide extra space.“On a night like last night, the biggest concern is the people who have compromised judgment,” President and CEO Lyndia Downie said Saturday of people who have substance use disorder or mental illness. “On these cold nights, they are not thinking at 100% of their capacity. Those are the people we are most worried about.”The emergency room at Massachusetts General Hospital treated several people for hypothermia overnight and a couple were admitted for frostbite.“The reason that people unfortunately end up with severe frostbite in most cases is just because they don’t have anywhere warm and safe to go,” said Dr. Ali Raja, deputy chair of the emergency department.Boston; Providence, Rhode Island; Hartford, Connecticut; Worcester, Massachusetts; Albany, New York; and Glens Falls, New York set or matched record low temperatures for Feb. 4, according to the National Weather Service.The cold curtailed some traditional winter activities. Organizers of an annual ice castle attraction in North Woodstock, New Hampshire shortened the evening visitor schedule for Saturday night.Erin Trotta of Massachusetts, who had already booked a visit still planned to go, but was taking extra steps to stay warm.“We are prepared to take on the polar vortex ice castles. ... Snow pants, thick winter coats, hand and foot warmers, face masks, the kind where only your eyes are exposed, and good gloves and winter boots. Plan to drink some hot cocoa to keep warm.""In New York’s Adirondack Mountains, Old Forge recorded a temperature early Saturday of minus 36 degrees (minus 38 C) degrees. Temperatures plunged into the negative teens in dozens of other cities and towns.Mackenzie Glasser, owner of Ozzie’s Coffee Bar in Old Forge, said frigid temperatures are just part of living in the Adirondacks.“I even had customers for the first hour that I was open, and I wasn’t expecting that at 7 a.m. So I don’t think it’s keeping too many people away,” she said.The good news is that the cold air is expected to move out of much of the region by Sunday, when temperatures could rise to the 40s.___Michael Hill in Albany, New York, Michael Casey in Boston, and Kathy McCormack in Concord, New Hampshire contributed to this story.",2023/02/05,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800477,Funeral held for Belarusian activist killed in Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A funeral for a Belarusian military volunteer and activist who died fighting on the frontlines in eastern Ukraine was held in Kyiv on Saturday. 

            Eduard Lobau was killed in fierce artillery battles in Vuhledar against Russian troops as part of a small but dynamic regiment of Belarusian dissidents fighting alongside the Ukrainian armed forces. His body will be taken to Warsaw for burial. 

            Russian troops have ramped up attacks in the east of Ukraine, particularly in the industrial towns of Bakhmut and Vuhledar. Moscow has said its main goal is to capture the eastern Donetsk province which it considers a part of Russia. 











            Lobau is the latest casualty of the Kalinowsky Regiment, the unit named after a prominent Belarusian revolutionary who initiated an uprising against imperial Russia in the late 1800s. Volunteers oppose Belarusian authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia. They believe Ukraine’s victory over Russia will spur regime change in Minsk. 

            “This is a very special regiment, consisting only of Belarusians. This is not their country, this is not their nation, but it’s their war,” said Bohdan Yaremenko, a lawmaker in Ukraine’s parliament who attended the funeral. “I am here as a sign of my support, and of my solidarity from my heart to theirs.” 

            Olena Kharkhel, held a portrait of Lobau in the church as his comrades paid their last respects. Her husband, also a Belarusian dissident, died fighting in the east with the regiment in June. He and Lobau had been good friends. 

            “By fighting against Russia, we can liberate Belarus from Lukashenko’s regime,” she said. 

            One by one, the volunteers walked to Lobau’s coffin, draped with the Belarusian flag to pay their last respects in Kyiv’s Cathedral of St. Alexander. Most covered their faces to conceal their identities. 

            Lobau served four years of jail time for acts of disobedience in his native Belarus in 2010. Following his release in 2014 he fled to Ukraine and joined the armed forces as a military volunteer. 

            Belarusians make up a prominent contingent of foreign fighters in Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine propelled them to mobilize. The regiment itself was formalized in March 2022 and has been active in numerous key battles from the early days of the war, including in Mykolaiv, Kherson and the defense of Bucha and Irpin. Lobau participated in the latter. 

            “We can say he spent his entire life defending high ideals and sacrificing for others,” said friend and fellow volunteer Jan Melnikov.KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A funeral for a Belarusian military volunteer and activist who died fighting on the frontlines in eastern Ukraine was held in Kyiv on Saturday.Eduard Lobau was killed in fierce artillery battles in Vuhledar against Russian troops as part of a small but dynamic regiment of Belarusian dissidents fighting alongside the Ukrainian armed forces.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800481,Sex Pistols star loses Eurovision bid to represent Ireland,"Seventies punk rock icon John Lydon, better known to Sex Pistols fans as Johnny Rotten, lost out in his effort to represent Ireland at this year's Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool.His song, ""Hawaii,"" about his wife's struggles with Alzheimer's disease, did not make the cut and instead Ireland's Eurovision spot went to the rock band Wild Youth and their song, ""We Are One"" during the televized competition Friday.Lydon's punk band Public Image Ltd. had hoped to bring attention to the struggles of Lydon's wife Nora. The band formed after the Sex Pistols split up in 1978.""It's going to be difficult for me tonight,"" Lydon said following the results with his band falling short.Lydon was born in London of Irish parents. His mother's family is from Cork while his father is from Galway.This year's Eurovision Song Contest final is to take place in Liverpool, England on May 13. Organizers in the UK say the contest this year will celebrate Ukrainian heritage and the music traditions of Liverpool, including the Beatles.The contest was founded in 1956 as part of European reconciliation efforts in the postwar period. Nowadays, more than 40 countries compete in the annual song competition.The previous year's winner traditionally hosts the contest the following year. Ukraine won in 2022 with the song, ""Stefania"" by Kalush Orchestra. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), however, determined it would not be safe to hold the contest in a country undergoing an active invasion by Russian forces.The role of 2023 host nation therefore went to the UK after its act Sam Ryder finished second.ar/msh (AFP, AP, dpa)",2023/02/04,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800482,Austria: One killed amid 'dangerous' avalanches in Alps,"At least one person has been killed and two others were buried in avalanches in the Austrian Alps, local authorities said on Saturday.Officials in the Austrian state of Tyrol have urgently cautioned tourists, skiers and other winter sports athletes to avoid the slopes amid a very high avalanche risk.A man was found dead under an avalanche in the valley of Kleinwalsertal. He'd been missing since Friday evening after skiing off-piste. Austrian media reported that the deceased person was a teenage tourist, but authorities have yet to confirm.Search and rescue operations were also underway on Saturday in the village of St. Anton where two people are believed to be buried under snow.Rescuers were forced to pause operations until later in the afternoon, as winds and the high risk of avalanches in the region posed a growing risk to emergency crews.Authorities were able to locate their locations using signals from their emergency locater transceivers.By Saturday afternoon, authorities at the control center in Tyrol said they had logged 17 avalanches. Nine of them were said to involve people.On Friday, a 32-year-old Chinese national was killed in an avalanche in the area. A 15-year-old boy was also severely injured after being dragged by an avalanche.Regions of the Alps in Austria and Germany have experienced heavy snowfall in recent days.The fresh snow, along with high winds, has heightened the risk of spontaneous avalanches to dangerous levels.In Austria, many areas are currently under a level 4 avalanche warning on the country's five-level scale.""The danger exists in particular in [the] alpine snow sports terrain,"" the Avalanche Warning Service in Tyrol said in a statement, saying spontaneous mid-sized and large-scale avalanches are to be expected.Officials have urged tourists and athletes to avoid any unsecured pistes, especially inexperienced skiers.""The warning is very clear — inexperienced people should stay on the secured pistes over the next few days,"" Patrick Nairz, an official with the Tyrol avalanche alert service, told Austrian public broadcaster ORF.He said he understood the disappointment of tourists who wanted to take advantage of the snow, especially after the region's ski season started late due to unseasonably warm weather.""The guests are coming. Lots of people are traveling and now there is finally snow — but the situation is really dangerous,"" he said.rs/msh (dpa)",2023/02/04,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800483,Sri Lanka marks 75 years of independence amid bankruptcy,"Sri Lanka marked 75 years of independence Saturday in bankruptcy, with many citizens somber, reflective and disappointed rather than feeling festive.President Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a televised speech, ""We have reached the point of destruction.""""Let's seek to heal this wound though it's difficult and painful. If we endure the suffering and pain for a short period of time, we can get the wound healed completely,"" Wickremesinghe said.He added that everyone in the country was to blame for the nation's woes, from politicians to regular citizens as the country had long been divided by race, religion and region since the nation's inception.Sri Lanka faces its worst financial crisis since it declared independence from Britain in 1948. A severe shortage of dollars has added to inflation woes, a drop in the currency and the country's slide into an economic recession.Some relief has appeared in the form of fewer acute shortages. Wickremesinghe said the first half of 2023 would be met with challenging economic times.Religious leaders of the Buddhist and Christian faiths announced they would boycott the festivities in Colombo, the capital. Citizens and activists alike expressed outrage over the costs of the ceremony at a time when the country is in dire straits.On Friday, several activists began a silent protest in Colombo over the cost of the independence celebrations and the failure to ease the country's economic burden. Police later blocked a protest organized by students at the university.Soldiers armed with assault rifles stood every few meters around the grounds of the independence ceremony festivities.Riot police were on stand-by to prevent any protests. President Wickremesinghe's predecessor, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was forced out of office and fled the country last year following mass protests over the country's debt burden and its pile-on effects on quality of life on the island nation.Armed forces paraded along Colombo's esplanade and were accompanied by an air and water show.Rev. Cyril Gamini, a Catholic priest, told AP that it was a ""waste and a crime"" to hold celebrations rich with military pageantry at a time when the country was suffering extreme economic hardship.""We ask the government what independence they are going to proudly celebrate by spending a sum of 200 million rupees (roughly $550,000),"" Gamini said, noting the Church's disapproval and the absence of members of the clergy.Seven percent of Sri Lanka's population of 22 million is Catholic. Despite the small numbers, the influence of the Church is greater as its views are highly regarded by the people of Sri Lanka.Omalpe Sobitha, a Buddhist monk, told AP the celebrations were a showcase of weapons manufactured elsewhere.Sri Lanka was forced to suspend repayment of nearly $7 billion (€6.46 billion) in foreign debt due this year as talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout package drag on.In his speech, Wickremesinghe said the country was completing talks for a $2.9 billion bailout with the IMF.""We expect to get their consent without delay,"" he said.In total, Sri Lanka owes in excess of $51 billion. Of that, $28 billion must be repaid by the end of 2027.  Unsustainable debt coupled with a severe balance of payment crisis, in addition to the economic complications brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in serious shortages of food, medicine and fuel, particularly last year.To manage the country's balance of payments, income taxes have been increased sharply and every ministry has seen its budget cut by 6%. The military is to be downsized by half by 2030 after it had grown to more than 200,000 during the country's long civil war.Wickremesinghe acknoweldged in his speech on Saturday that many of the changes he said he had been forced to undertake were unpopular, but said he would continue with the reforms.Sri Lanka's central bank is rooting for an economic turnaround in the second half of the year and for inflation to dip into the single digits.In his speech, Wickremesinghe noted measures were in place to bring the country together again by releasing military land in the ethnic Tamil-majority north. Wickremesinghe said suspects connected to the now defunct Tamil Tigers, who fought for an independent state in the north of the country, would be released.ar/msh (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/04,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800484,Ancer keeps his distance over Young in Saudi Arabia,"KING ABDULLAH ECONOMIC CITY, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Abraham Ancer had a 6-under 64 to bump his lead to two shots over Cameron Young on Saturday going into the final round of the Saudi International.

            Ancer and Young, the PGA Tour rookie of the year who had a 65, have separated themselves from the field in the $5 million Asian Tour event.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800486,Pefok fires Union Berlin back to first in the Bundesliga,"BERLIN (AP) — No Isco, no problem.

            Union Berlin moved back to the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday after beating Mainz 2-1, days after its bold move to sign former Real Madrid star Isco Alarcón fell apart.

            American forward Jordan Pefok scored late to fire Union two points clear of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.











            Union supporters and the team jumped up and down as the fans chanted “Take Bayern’s lederhosen off,” and sung about leading the league.

            Union, which is playing only its fourth season in Germany’s top-flight, led the Bundesliga for seven weeks earlier this season.

            Few expected the club to reclaim first place – even if it is only for one night – once Bayern took over in the 13th round. But Bayern has drawn its last three league games since the winter break while Union keeps winning.

            “Four or five years ago we were in the second division, middle of the table, and now we’re at the very top of the first division. Crazy,” Union fan Ben Schulz told The Associated Press.

            Pefok came on as a substitute for opening goal-scorer Kevin Behrens in the 79th minute. Five minutes later he scored his first goal since September to end his 14-match scoreless streak and set off wild celebrations around Stadion An der Alten Försterei.

            Dortmund routed 10-man Freiburg 5-1 to move to third behind Bayern on goal difference after its fourth straight win in 2023.

            Bayern visits Wolfsburg on Sunday when the 10-time defending champion can reclaim first place.

            UNION FLYING

            Union has racked up five wins across all competitions in 2023, including its German Cup win over Wolfsburg on Tuesday.

            That came hours after the move to sign Isco broke down – a disagreement that seemed to linger for Mainz’s visit as the game became mired in midfield with few highlights. It was arguably crying out for a creative player like Isco.

            Union emerged with more intent after the break.

            Mainz was given a lifeline when Paul Seguin was penalized through VAR for handball. Former Union forward Marcus Ingvartsen equalized from the spot in the 78th.

            Pefok and Morten Thorsby came on a minute later and combined to lift Union to the top.

            HALLER’S TIMELY GOAL

            Forward Sébastien Haller scored his first goal for Dortmund in his fourth appearance since returning from treatment for testicular cancer.

            “Much too late,” Dortmund coach Edin Terzić said. ”We would have liked for him to score in July or August, that’s what we all wanted when we signed him in the summer.”

            Haller needed two operations and chemotherapy following his diagnosis in July, two weeks after he joined from Ajax. He made his first appearance for Dortmund on Jan. 22.

            Dortmund was helped on Saturday by the early dismissal of Freiburg’s Kiliann Sildillia, sent off for his second yellow card after just 16 minutes.

            Nico Schlotterbeck scored against his former team from a narrow angle after a corner in the 26th.

            But Dortmund missed further chances and Lucas Höler equalized with Freiburg’s first real attack just before the break.

            Karim Adeyemi restored Dortmund’s lead after the break, then Haller’s moment came when Raphaël Guerreiro crossed for his first Dortmund goal.

            Julian Brandt added another on a counterattack, and Gio Reyna wrapped it up by scoring in his third straight match.

            Freiburg coach Christian Streich was sent off in the 77th for complaining about the referee’s decisions.

            Also, Eintracht Frankfurt defeated Hertha Berlin 3-0, Cologne drew with Leipzig 0-0, Bochum defeated Hoffenheim 5-2, and Borussia Mönchengladbach drew with last-placed Schalke 0-0.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800488,Arrest made in shooting at San Francisco synagogue,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Police have arrested a man suspected of firing a gun loaded with blanks inside a San Francisco synagogue.

            The man was arrested Friday evening in the Richmond District on suspicion of disturbing a religious assembly, brandishing an imitation firearm and causing another to refrain from engaging in a religious service, police said in a statement.

            Dmitri Mishin, 51, of San Francisco was booked into jail shortly before 12:30 a.m. Saturday and was being held without bail, according to a San Francisco Sheriff's Office website.











            It wasn't immediately know whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf.

            Shortly before 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Mishin is suspected of walking into the Schneerson Center on Balboa Street, which holds religious services and classes along with social activities for the local Russian Jewish community, 

            Surveillance video posted without sound by KTVU-TV showed a man wearing a baseball cap, jacket and sneakers entering a room with more than a dozen people at a table. The man made hand gestures before taking out a gun and firing. As an elderly man approached him, he headed to the door, saluted and left.

            Mattie Pil, the president of synagogue, told the San Francisco Chronicle that her husband, Rabbi Bentzion Pil, was sitting at a table with about 25 senior citizens who were at a study session when a man entered.

            Asked where he was from, the man said he was from Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency. He then pulled out the gun, Mattie Pil said.

            The people at the table seemed to remain calm but the rabbi said they were stunned.

            “We were shocked,” he said. “No one was expecting it. I was about to go to the kitchen to get a knife... but the whole thing took like 20 seconds.”

            A day before that shooting, Mishin is believed to have entered a theater several blocks away on Balboa Street, brandished a gun and fled, police said.

            No shots were fired.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Police have arrested a man suspected of firing a gun loaded with blanks inside a San Francisco synagogue.The man was arrested Friday evening in the Richmond District on suspicion of disturbing a religious assembly, brandishing an imitation firearm and causing another to refrain from engaging in a religious service, police said in a statement.Dmitri Mishin, 51, of San Francisco was booked into jail shortly before 12:30 a.m. Saturday and was being held without bail, according to a San Francisco Sheriff's Office website.It wasn't immediately know whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf.Shortly before 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Mishin is suspected of walking into the Schneerson Center on Balboa Street, which holds religious services and classes along with social activities for the local Russian Jewish community,Surveillance video posted without sound by KTVU-TV showed a man wearing a baseball cap, jacket and sneakers entering a room with more than a dozen people at a table. The man made hand gestures before taking out a gun and firing. As an elderly man approached him, he headed to the door, saluted and left.Mattie Pil, the president of synagogue, told the San Francisco Chronicle that her husband, Rabbi Bentzion Pil, was sitting at a table with about 25 senior citizens who were at a study session when a man entered.Asked where he was from, the man said he was from Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency. He then pulled out the gun, Mattie Pil said.The people at the table seemed to remain calm but the rabbi said they were stunned.“We were shocked,” he said. “No one was expecting it. I was about to go to the kitchen to get a knife... but the whole thing took like 20 seconds.”No injuries or damage were reported and investigators believe the man used blanks.A day before that shooting, Mishin is believed to have entered a theater several blocks away on Balboa Street, brandished a gun and fled, police said.No shots were fired.",2023/02/05,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800489,Tesla hikes price of Model Y after US alters tax credit rule,"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla has raised prices on its Model Y in the U.S., apparently due to rising demand and changes in U.S. government rules that make more versions of the small SUV eligible for tax credits.

            The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle company bumped up the price of the Model Y Long Range version by about 2% to $54,990 and the Performance version by about 2.7% to $57,990, according to its website. The prices exclude shipping and an order fee.

            The moves, made Friday, come three weeks after Tesla cut prices nearly 20% on some versions of the Model Y, the company's top-selling vehicle. The price cuts were made to boost sagging demand, and also to make more versions of the Model Y eligible for the $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act. The full tax credits will be available at least into March.











            On Friday, The Treasury Department revised vehicle classification definitions to make more EVs — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible the full $7,500.

            The change came after lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify for a maximum credit. Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with top aides to President Joe Biden last week to discuss the EV industry and the broader goals of electrification. 

            Under the sweeping law approved last summer, pickup trucks, SUVs and vans with a sticker price up to $80,000 qualify for EV tax credits, while new electric cars, sedans and wagons can only be priced up to $55,000. The rule had disqualified some higher-priced SUVs, such as GM’s Cadillac Lyriq and some versions of the Model Y, prompting complaints from Tesla and other automakers.

            The January price cuts apparently worked. On Tesla's earnings conference call last week, CEO Elon Musk said that so far in January the company had seen the strongest number of orders year-to-date in company history. He also said the company had raised the Model Y price “a little bit in response to that.”

            After Tesla's price cuts, Ford responded by reducing the price of its Mustang Mach-E, in part to qualify for the tax credit and also to spur buyer interest. But crosstown rival General Motors said it had no plans to cut EV prices.

            The EV tax credits are among a host of changes enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress approved in August with only Democratic votes. The law is designed to spur EV sales as part of a broader effort to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

            But a complex web of requirements, including where vehicles and batteries must be manufactured to qualify, has cast doubt on whether buyers can receive the full $7,500 credit.

            The Treasury Department said Friday that it hopes to make it easier for consumers to know which vehicles qualify for the credit. Under the revised rule, vehicle classifications will be determined by a consumer-facing fuel economy labeling standard, rather than a more complicated formula set by the Environmental Protection Agency, Treasury said.

            A message was left Saturday seeking comment from Tesla on the price increases.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800490,Elche gets first win in Spanish league at 20th try,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Elche ended its excruciatingly long wait for a win in the Spanish league on Saturday when Villarreal was beaten 3-1 after Pere Milla scored a hat trick before he was carried off on a stretcher.

            Last-placed Elche, a modest club from southern Spain, endured the entire first half of the league without a single win.

            The victory finally came in Round 20 against a Villarreal side that beat Real Madrid last month and is fighting for a Champions League berth.











            Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid conceded a late penalty and was held by relegation-threatened Getafe to 1-1.

            Elche, playing under its third coach of the campaign, will still need a major turnaround to avoid relegation. It has just nine points and sits 11 points from safety.

            “Anything is possible,” Elche goalkeeper Édgar Badia said of his team’s hopes of staying in the top-flight for a fourth consecutive season. “Our mentality is game by game and not look far ahead. It is not time to think about the past.”

            Milla, playing in his fourth season at Elche, was injured after his treble and was taken off on a stretcher in the 58th minute with a suspected broken collarbone.

            Milla opened the scoring when he fired a deflected ball past Pepe Reina three minutes after kickoff in Elche.

            Gerard Moreno equalized in the 22nd with his eighth goal across all competitions from a pass by Álex Baena.

            But Milla converted two penalties in the 48th and 52nd to ensure the 18,000 fans who turned out could finally have a reason to celebrate. The spectators did the wave at Martinez Valero Stadium in the final minutes. Elche player Omar Mascarell wept from relief.

            “I haven’t been here that long, but I know the players and the club workers, and of course our fans who never abandoned us, who believed this win would come. This is for them,” said manager Pablo Machín, who took over in November.

            Villarreal stayed in fifth place after a second straight loss.

            “We made too many mistakes and when you do that you pay for it,” Villarreal defender Raúl Albiol said. “It was a bad day for the entire team. They played harder than we did, so they are the rightful winners.”

            ATLETICO HELD

            Atletico was in control until Saúl Ñíguez gave away the penalty when a cross hit his flaying arm in the area.

            Getafe striker Enes Unal rifled the spot kick past Jan Oblak for the 83rd-minute equalizer.

            Ángel Correa opened in the 60th. His goal was initially waived off for offside but a video review overruled the referee’s decision. Correa was substituted by that point so his Atletico teammates rushed into the dugout to celebrate with him.

            Getafe’s first point of 2023 ended a run of four consecutive league losses for Quique Sánchez Flores’ team.

            Fourth-placed Atletico was left four points clear of Villarreal and Real Betis, which also stumbled.

            SHOOTOUT IN SEVILLE

            Celta Vigo midfielder Gabri Veiga scored twice to help win a high-tempo 4-3 thriller over Real Betis in Seville.

            Aided by the sharp passing of Carles Pérez, Iago Aspas and Luca de la Torre, Celta got its most impressive win of an otherwise difficult season.

            Betis’ Luiz Felipe was sent off for a brush with Aspas in the final minutes, setting off a brief scuffle between the teams.

            Also, Espanyol came back to draw at home with Osasuna 1-1.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800493,Pitcher Max Fried loses to Braves in salary arbitration,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Pitcher Max Fried lost to the Atlanta Braves in salary arbitration on Saturday, and will make $13.5 million in the upcoming season instead of his $15 million request.

            Mark Burstein, Fredric Horowitz and Jeanne Vonhof issued their decision a day after hearing arguments.

            Despite the defeat, Fried matched the $13.5 million Gerrit Cole won in 2019 as the highest decided by an arbitration panel.











            Fried won a $6.85 million salary last year in arbitration instead of the team’s $6.6 million proposal. 

            He followed former Atlanta teammate Dansby Swanson in going to a hearing in consecutive years. Swanson, a shortstop, lost in 2021 and won last year, then signed a $177 million, seven-year contract with the Chicago Cubs.

            The last player to win hearings in consecutive years was pitcher Trevor Bauer against Cleveland in 2018 and 2019.

            Fried, a 29-year-old left-hander, went 14-7 for the second straight season and lowered his ERA to 2.48 from 3.04 in 2021. Fried was a first-time All-Star last season, was second to Miami’s Sandy Alcantara in Cy Young Award voting and was third in the National League in ERA behind Alcantara and Julio Urías of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

            In 2021, Fried pitched six shutout innings in World Series Game 6 as the Braves won their first title since 1995.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800494,"Man United beats Palace 2-1, Casemiro suspended after red","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — After reigniting hope of an English Premier League title challenge, Manchester United was left counting the cost of Casemiro’s red card after beating Crystal Palace 2-1 on Saturday.

            The Brazil international was sent off in the second half for grabbing Palace midfielder Will Hughes by the neck and will serve a three-match ban for violent conduct.

            United is already without Christian Eriksen for the majority of the rest of the season because of an ankle injury and must cope with the loss of another influential midfielder.











            Casemiro was sent off in the 70th minute, shortly after Marcus Rashford put United ahead 2-0.

            Following a tussle between the teams on the sideline, VAR asked referee Andre Marriner to review footage of Casemiro and the decision was a straight red.

            His absence was immediately felt as Palace set up a tense finish, with Jeffrey Schlupp scoring six minutes after Casemiro's dismissal.

            “We played a brilliant game, I thought it was a really high level the first 70 minutes until that incident,"" United manager Erik ten Hag said. 

            United players were angered following an altercation between Schlupp and Brazil winger Antony. 

            “Then you see this team stands for each other,"" Ten Hag said. ""There is such a good spirit in the team and they don’t accept when a player from us can be badly injured. That is the way Antony got treated.”

            Bruno Fernandes opened the scoring from the penalty spot and United looked set to cruise to victory when Rashford added another.

            But in front an increasingly nervous Old Trafford crowd, Palace dominated once the home team was reduced to 10 men.

            United held on to move within eight points of leader Arsenal, which lost at Everton 1-0.

            The celebrations from the crowd at the final whistle after seven minutes of added time demonstrated how important the fans believe the result could be as the gap to the top of the table was closed.

            How to handle the loss of Casemiro, however, will be a concern for Ten Hag. 

            Casemiro has been outstanding for United since his summer move to England and his importance was underlined when he was suspended for the 3-2 loss to Arsenal last month.

            That suspension came after he received a fifth booking of the season, which also came against Palace.

            He will miss consecutive league games against Leeds and Leicester.

            United won at home for the 13th time in a row as Ten Hag’s influence continues to be felt in his first season.

            He has already led the team to the final of the League Cup, and Arsenal’s loss provided hope of a potential challenge for a first league title since 2013.

            Fernandes put United ahead in the seventh after Hughes handled in the box.

            Rashford then doubled the lead in the 62nd with a close-range finish.

            More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsMANCHESTER, England (AP) — After reigniting hope of an English Premier League title challenge, Manchester United was left counting the cost of Casemiro’s red card after beating Crystal Palace 2-1 on Saturday.The Brazil international was sent off in the second half for grabbing Palace midfielder Will Hughes by the neck and will serve a three-match ban for violent conduct.United is already without Christian Eriksen for the majority of the rest of the season because of an ankle injury and must cope with the loss of another influential midfielder.Casemiro was sent off in the 70th minute, shortly after Marcus Rashford put United ahead 2-0.Following a tussle between the teams on the sideline, VAR asked referee Andre Marriner to review footage of Casemiro and the decision was a straight red.His absence was immediately felt as Palace set up a tense finish, with Jeffrey Schlupp scoring six minutes after Casemiro's dismissal.“We played a brilliant game, I thought it was a really high level the first 70 minutes until that incident,"" United manager Erik ten Hag said.United players were angered following an altercation between Schlupp and Brazil winger Antony.“Then you see this team stands for each other,"" Ten Hag said. ""There is such a good spirit in the team and they don’t accept when a player from us can be badly injured. That is the way Antony got treated.”Bruno Fernandes opened the scoring from the penalty spot and United looked set to cruise to victory when Rashford added another.But in front an increasingly nervous Old Trafford crowd, Palace dominated once the home team was reduced to 10 men.United held on to move within eight points of leader Arsenal, which lost at Everton 1-0.The celebrations from the crowd at the final whistle after seven minutes of added time demonstrated how important the fans believe the result could be as the gap to the top of the table was closed.How to handle the loss of Casemiro, however, will be a concern for Ten Hag.Casemiro has been outstanding for United since his summer move to England and his importance was underlined when he was suspended for the 3-2 loss to Arsenal last month.That suspension came after he received a fifth booking of the season, which also came against Palace.He will miss consecutive league games against Leeds and Leicester.United won at home for the 13th time in a row as Ten Hag’s influence continues to be felt in his first season.He has already led the team to the final of the League Cup, and Arsenal’s loss provided hope of a potential challenge for a first league title since 2013.Fernandes put United ahead in the seventh after Hughes handled in the box.Rashford then doubled the lead in the 62nd with a close-range finish.But what looked like being a comfortable win was thrown into doubt after Casemiro’s red.Schlupp beat David de Gea after United failed to clear a Palace corner, and the visitors applied the pressure in the closing stages.Roared on by the home crowd, United, which conceded a late equalizer in a draw with Palace last month, avoided a repeat.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/05,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800495,Trooper no longer faces murder charge in fatal Thruway chase,"KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) — A judge has dropped a murder charge against a state trooper in the death of an 11-year-old girl during a high-speed chase on the New York State Thruway.

            Christopher Baldner still faces a second-degree manslaughter charge and other counts stemming from the Dec. 22, 2020 highway chase north of New York City that led to the death of Monica Goods.

            Baldner pepper sprayed the vehicle during a stop for speeding and Monica’s father, Tristin Goods, drove off. Baldner pursued and rammed his police vehicle into the SUV twice. The SUV flipped over several times and came to rest upside down, according to prosecutors.











            Monica was ejected from the vehicle and died.

            Ulster County Judge Bryan Rounds ruled Thursday that evidence was unable to prove Baldner acted with “depraved indifference to human life” when he rammed the vehicle.

            Evidence “supports only the conclusion that this defendant ignored agency protocols and exercised extremely poor judgment in a foolish attempt to perform his job,” Rounds wrote, according to the Times-Herald Record.

            The attorney general’s office said it was reviewing the ruling.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800509,Streaking Brentford see off Southampton 3-0 to rise in EPL,"LONDON (AP) — Brentford moved into the English Premier League top six after dispatching Southampton 3-0 on Saturday.

            Goals by Ben Mee, Bryan Mbeumo and Mathias Jensen extended Brentford’s unbeaten run to nine in the league stretching back to October. 

            Their fluid front four of Josh Dasilva, Ivan Toney, Yoane Wissa and Mbeumo simply tormented the Southampton defense.











            Southampton was game for 40 minutes then capitulated. 

            The goal the hosts were threatening arrived when Mbeumo spun out of trouble on the left wing and swung in a cross which Mee met with a powerful header.

            Mee also banged heads with defender Mohammed Salisu and both needed prolonged treatment. When play restarted, the Bees doubled their lead with another clinical, sweeping attack.

            Using the outside of his left boot like a pitching wedge, Dasilva spread the ball out wide to Wissa, who cut inside and provided a low cross for Mbeumo to tap in.

            As disgruntled Saints fans took out their frustration on manager Nathan Jones, Brentford piled on the misery with 10 minutes to go when Rico Henry’s cross was headed in by Jensen to wrap up another impressive win.

            One of Jones' substitutions was met with a chorus of “You don’t know what you're doing."" After the third goal, the mood worsened with “You're getting sacked in the morning” and “Nathan Jones, get out of our club” ringing out from one angry corner of the ground.

            Southampton has lost eight of its last nine matches.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800517,More misery for Liverpool after losing at Wolverhampton 3-0,"WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) — Liverpool's troubles continued after losing to Wolverhampton 3-0 in the English Premier League on Saturday. 

            A season after being in the hunt for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies, Liverpool looks in danger of finishing mid-table in the league or perhaps worse. 

            The team has lost seven times in the league and its hopes of salvaging the campaign by qualifying for the Champions League look increasingly unlikely. 











            Joel Matip’s own goal, Craig Dawson’s debut strike, and Ruben Neves’ effort sealed the win for Wolverhampton.

            Wolves were plunged into the relegation zone by Everton’s upset of Arsenal hours earlier, but responded impressively by scoring three goals or more in a game for the first time in 11 months.

            Liverpool was left in 10th after a third straight away loss in the league.

            Defender Matip put the ball into his own net after five minutes and Dawson struck from close range in the 12th. Neves slotted in from six meters to complete the scoring in the 71st.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800522,Regional leaders urge immediate cease-fire in eastern Congo,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Regional heads of state have called for an immediate cease-fire by all parties in eastern Congo, where tensions have grown amid talk of war as Congo and neighboring Rwanda trade allegations of backing armed rebels.

            The communique issued Saturday at the end of an East African Community summit also directed troop-contributing countries to immediately deploy more troops to a regional force created and sent to eastern Congo last year. It also directed defense chiefs to meet within one week and called for more dialogue and de-escalation of tensions.

            The heads of state of both Congo and Rwanda attended in a “cordial and friendly atmosphere,” the communique said.











            Some observers fear the toll and regional effects if the two countries slide again into all-out conflict as they did in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Alarm soared last month after Rwanda fired on a Congolese military aircraft it alleged violated its airspace. Congo called it “a deliberate act of aggression that equals an act of war” with the goal of sabotaging regional peace efforts.

            Congo for months has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 armed group — whose origins lie in the region’s ethnic fighting — and powerful voices in the West have openly agreed. Rwanda denies backing the M23, which is one of dozens operating in mineral-rich eastern Congo, and accuses Congo of backing another rebel group that reportedly includes ethnic Hutus who participated in the 1994 Rwanda genocide that killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

            United Nations experts have said they have “substantial evidence” of Rwandan government forces crossing into Congo to reinforce M23 rebels or to conduct operations against the other rebel group. The United States, France and Germany have urged Rwanda to stop supporting the rebels.

            Saturday's regional summit occurred days after Pope Francis visited Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, to highlight the toll that decades of conflict have taken on the country, particularly eastern Congo, a volatile region rich in minerals critical to much of the world’s technology. A planned visit by the pope to Goma in eastern Congo was called off because of the insecurity.

            At a Nov. 23 summit in Angola, which included Congo’s president and Rwanda’s foreign minister, regional leaders called for a cease-fire in eastern Congo to be followed by a withdrawal of rebels from major towns under M23 control.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800523,Hunt ends for mountain lion that attacked California boy,"HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) — California wildlife officials have called off the search for a mountain lion that attacked a 5-year-old boy who was on a hiking trail in rural Northern California, saying there was little chance of capturing the animal.

            The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said Friday that DNA testing confirmed that a mountain lion was responsible for the attack last Tuesday in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco. 

            But efforts to track down and capture the lion were hampered because investigators have been denied access to private property near the attack site.











            “This lack of access, combined with worsening weather and the nomadic nature of mountain lions has diminished the chances for a successful capture,"" said Capt. Patrick Foy, a department spokesman.

            Shortly before 7 p.m. Tuesday, the boy was on the trail along Tunitas Creek Road and had raced ahead of his mother and grandparents when the big cat pounced on him and pinned him to the ground, authorities and family members said.

            His mother, Suzie Trexler, charged the cougar and it let the boy go and ran off. 

            The boy wasn't bitten, Foy said. However, his face was scratched and he had a fractured bone near his eye, his aunt, Amie Wagner, told the Chronicle.

            He was treated at a local hospital.

            Mountain lion attacks on humans are rare. About 20 confirmed attacks have occurred in California in more than a century of record-keeping, and only three have been fatal, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife.

            Last September, a 7-year-old boy was bitten by a mountain lion while walking with his father around dusk in a park near Santa Clarita in Southern California. The father scared the animal away, and the child was treated for relatively minor wounds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800524,Messi's goal helps French leader PSG beat Toulouse 2-1,"PARIS (AP) — After Lionel Messi's second-half goal helped a lackluster Paris Saint-Germain beat Toulouse 2-1 to move eight points clear at the top of the French league on Saturday, the team was urged to lighten their superstar's load.

            Messi struck with a typical curling strike in the 57th minute following a move with Morocco right back Achraf Hakimi, who drew PSG level late in the first half after free kick specialist Branco van den Boomen put Toulouse ahead in the 20th.

            PSG was without injured forwards Kylian Mbappé and Neymar and relied heavily on Messi, who hit the post during stoppage time. Without Messi, who has hit 98 goals for Argentina, PSG would have struggled more.











            “Messi was a very important driving force for us, given his goal and the chances he created. I'm asking the team to play for him and to work for him. He must be relieved of certain duties,"" coach Christophe Galtier said. ""His teammates must intensify their efforts to win the ball back and to create spaces, so that he can spray around his passes which are so rare.”

            PSG needs Messi with Bayern Munich coming up on Feb. 14 in the first leg of their round-of-16 game in the Champions League.

            
                Mbappé is out for at least three weeks after sustaining a left thigh tear. Neymar is having treatment for a sore adductor and missed his second straight game. PSG's injury woes increased when Portugal midfielder Renato Sanches went off injured early with a thigh injury.

            PSG had lost two and drawn one of its previous five matches, and fell behind in the 20th when Van den Boomen's free kick from the right flew past stranded goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma into the left corner.

            After Marquinhos hit the post with a header from Messi's corner, PSG equalized with a fine 20-meter strike from Hakimi in the 38th.

            But Marquinhos appeared offside on Messi's goal, to the frustration of sarcastic-sounding Toulouse coach Philippe Montanier.

            “I don't know the rules of refereeing so well but I did play in goal for 30 years,” he said. “So I know that it's difficult when a player gets in the way of the ball.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800527,Sebastien Haller scores Dortmund first on World Cancer Day,"Ahead of kickoff at the Westfalenstadion, the center circle didn't look quite right.Usually a perfect white ring painted on pristine green turf, on Saturday it was disfigured by a small lump on one side — an intentional addition from groundsman Willi Droste on World Cancer Day to raise awareness of the importance of regular checks for tumors.And so, about one hour later, it was fitting that Borussia Dortmund’s third goal in a 5-1 win over ten-man Freiburg was scored by Sebastien Haller. His powerful header in front of the Yellow Wall was his first goal for the club since successfully undergoing treatment for testicular cancer.""I felt like I was flying, like I was on a cloud, like the whole stadium was on fire,"" the 28-year-old French-Ivorian said, his delight evident in the plethora of similies chosen.""I’ve been waiting for this moment since day one, and to score my first goal on this day of all days means so much. It’s a massive boost and I hope we’ll all have more moments like that, with even more goals.""""We're all more than happy [for Haller],” added BVB sporting director Sebastian Kehl. ""He's been working towards it for a long time, and we've been waiting for a long time. Now a huge burden is off his shoulders.""Preceded by a Karim Adeyemi strike and succeeded by further neat finishes from Julian Brandt and Gio Reyna’s third of 2023, in a furious second half, Haller’s header was the standout moment on a perfect afternoon for Borussia Dortmund.Not only did it make it four wins from four for the Black and Yellows; it was also a statement result against a Freiburg team which had begun the afternoon level on points with them, and which saw them leapfrog RB Leipzig, who were held to a goalless draw in Cologne, into third place.But most importantly for head coach Edin Terzic, it represented the continuation of a trend which has seen his team improve little by little, game by game, since the start of the year.Dortmund conceded three avoidable equalizers against Augsburg yet still won, they scored a last-minute winner from a set-piece after an otherwise poor performance away at Mainz, they kept a clean sheet against a dangerous Bayer Leverkusen, and now they’ve put five past a top four rival.""We’ve been training extremely well ever since the winter training camp [in Marbella],"" Terzic told DW. ""And when you look at these four victories, they show that our toolbox is getting bigger and bigger.""After facing so many accusations of a lack of ""mentality"" in recent years,  DW put it to Terzic that there is a new 'M-word' in Dortmund: momentum. ""I prefer that, but an even more important M-word is May,"" the BVB boss responded. ""A good start to the year in January doesn’t win us anything. But between now and then, we have the chance to keep collecting points and climbing the table.""Indeed, with 15 games still to play in the Bundesliga and the small matter of a Champions League last-16 meeting with Chelsea (not to mention a mini German Cup derby away at neighbors Bochum this week), there is clearly a long way to go yet.Nico Schlotterbeck’s failure to clear his lines in the buildup to Freiburg’s equalizer, right before halftime and completely against the run of play, was a reminder of that, on a day where the 23-year-old defender had opened the scoring against his former club.But there’s no denying that Dortmund are making incremental progress across the pitch: in defense, in attack and in midfield, where arguably the most important message of the day was the shape of the center circle.",2023/02/04,,

He did not elaborate.The brief comment rekindled speculation of the US possibly trying to shoot or otherwise bring down the high-altitude balloon.The Associated Press news agency later reported that the Biden administration was considering downing the balloon over the Atlantic and recovering the remnants, citing four unnamed officials. No concrete decision was reached yet, the news agency added.Meanwhile, air traffic was suspended around the area where the balloon was spotted on Saturday. The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) said it had temporarily blocked civilian flights within 100 square miles over the Atlantic Ocean and the South Carolina coast. In the document posted on its website, the FAA warned pilots that the military could use deadly force if airplanes violate restrictions and do not comply with orders to leave.An initial suggestion to shoot the suspected ""spy balloon"" down with F-22 fighter jets was turned down by the military, citing the risk posed by falling debris as greater than the perceived threat of the balloon itself. However, those comments were made about the prospect of shooting it down over US soil, with its wreckage likely crashing onto land, not into the sea.On Saturday morning, the balloon was reportedly spotted above the Carolinas, making its way toward the Atlantic.Police in South Carolina ackonwledged its likely presence, and urged people not to try to take matters into their own hands, saying their weapons' bullets would not reach the high-altitude balloon, but that they would fall back to the ground.First seen earlier this week, the balloon incident caused US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to postpone a high-stakes visit to Beijing, which aimed to ease the increasing tensions between the two countries.China has maintained that the balloon was used for ""civilian"" meteorological purposes that deviated off course ""due to the influence of westerly winds and its limited control capability.""Responding to a question about Blinken's decision to postpone his visit, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman denied that a visit was announced at all. He nevertheless said that maintaining contact ""at all levels"" was important, adding that the Chinese and US presidents had agreed on that during a rare meeting in Bali last November.The spokesman reiterated once more the country's denial that the balloon was floated for surveillance purposes, describing it as a ""civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological purposes"" in a Foreign Ministry statement on Saturday.He said that China acted in accordance with international law and respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries.""Some politicians and media in the US have hyped it up to attack and smear China. The Chinese side is firmly opposed to that,"" he said.rmt/msh (AP, Reuters)",2023/02/04,,

            Al-Hilal won the shootout 5-3 following a 1-1 draw and will face Copa Libertadores champion Flamengo of Brazil in the semis.

            Saudi midfielder Mohamed Kanno struck with a penalty in the 93rd minute against the African Champions League winner after Yahya Jabrane handled the ball and was sent off.

            Wydad led through right back Ayoub El Amloud's header from a deflected corner in the 52nd minute at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat.

            Wydad's Yahia Attiyat Allah was unlucky in the shootout when his effort hit both posts and rolled near the line but not over it. Midfielder Musab Fahz Aljuwayr scored the decisive kick for Al-Hilal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800532,6N: Scotland beats England 29-23 as Van der Merwe stars,"LONDON (AP) — Duhan van der Merwe scored an early contender for try of the tournament and went over for the match-clincher as Scotland beat England 29-23 in the Six Nations to continue its recent dominance of the Calcutta Cup on Saturday.

            The winger’s 75th-minute try in the left corner sealed a fourth victory in Scotland’s last six matches against its auld enemy, ruining the first game in charge of England for new coach Steve Borthwick. It marked the first time Scotland has secured back-to-back wins at Twickenham in rugby's oldest international fixture that dates to 1871.

            But it was Van der Merwe’s stunning first try — scored in the 29th minute after he set off from inside his own half — that illuminated an error-riddled and often chaotic match between teams who mixed flashes of brilliance with enough failings to explain their status as outsiders for the title.











            Van der Merwe burst through two players in England’s defensive line then shrugged off five would-be tacklers — including two weak efforts near the tryline — to go over for a sensational try that might not be bettered over the next seven weeks of action.

            “As a winger you don’t get a lot of opportunities to score so I needed to take them,” he said. “I was quite surprised how I got my first but I will take that one all day long.""

            Huw Jones set Scotland on its way with a 15th-minute try from fellow center Sione Tuipulotu’s grubber kick, only for England to reply with two tries by winger Max Malins in the first half and another from prop Ellis Genge after halftime.

            England was its own worst enemy as it sought to eke out victory in the second half, with a dropped restart by No. 8 Alex Dombrandt after Genge’s try in the 49th giving Scotland the platform to reply through a try from Ben White — via a missed tackle by England flanker Ben Curry — and leave the boys in blue only 20-19 behind.

            Owen Farrell’s penalty made it 23-19 but, again, England’s errors allowed opposite flyhalf Finn Russell to boot his own penalty to leave the Scots trailing 23-22 and give them hope.

            Van der Merwe made the English pay with a winning try — and a bonus point for his team — as he cut in off the left wing and through two challengers to score at the end of a sweeping move that began down the right and inside Scotland's half.

            Scotland is unbeaten on its last three trips to Twickenham, a stadium where England strolled to a string of unbroken, mostly comfortable wins from 1991-2017.

            “We are ultimately disappointed — we just weren’t good enough,"" England lock Maro Itoje said. ""Fair play to Scotland. There were a few things we got wrong as a team but we can fix them.

            “There were a few penalties in the middle third and that kept us in our half.""

            There remains plenty to fix for Borthwick, who has taken charge after England's seven years under Eddie Jones and with eight months to go until the World Cup. 

            “There is some stuff we need to get better at,"" Farrell said. “For now, we will give credit to Scotland for sticking at it like they did. They played well and scored that try in the end but it never felt like we went away, we caused them some problems and we’ll make sure we build on it.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800535,"Irving excused from Nets-Wizards, 1 day after trade request","NEW YORK (AP) — Kyrie Irving sat out the Brooklyn Nets’ come-from-behind win over Washington on Saturday night, a day after he told the team he would like to be traded.

            The Nets said Irving's absence was due to right calf soreness, adding him to the injury report for their game against Washington. Irving had not been listed on the report Friday night or Saturday morning. 

            Brooklyn coach Jacque Vaughn said after the Nets' 125-123 win that Irving did not attend the game and that the player's absence was excused. 











            “We were all in agreement on him not being here tonight,” Vaughn said. 

            Vaughn said before the game that he was unsure if Irving would be at Barclays Center. He did say Irving “was not at the walkthrough.”

            He wouldn't speculate if Irving would be available for the Nets' two remaining games before the trade deadline Thursday afternoon.

            “I’m just going to be concerned about (the Wizards),” Vaughn said. “I’m not going to complicate this thing at all.” 

            Irving asked the Nets for a trade Friday, a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press. The All-Star has been frustrated that the Nets have thus far refused to give him an extension on his contact that expires after this season.

            Vaughn said he spoke with Irving and the rest of the team Friday, prior to the star guard's trade request becoming public. However, it was not a topic of conversation between the coach and his team. 

            “Our conversations were more than basketball,” said Vaughn. “Life, checking in on them. I never want to speculate how a player feels. Their feelings are their feelings. And I'll always validate that. ... So I won't speculate.”

            Kevin Durant is still sidelined because of a sprained knee ligament, and Ben Simmons and T.J. Warren will each also miss their fourth straight game with left knee soreness and a left shin contusion, respectively. Simmons was downgraded after previously being listed as questionable. Warren was initially listed as doubtful, which changed to out about an hour before gametime.

            “Just trying to get to a level — T.J. and Ben — where they're comfortable getting back on the court and playing,” Vaughn said. 

            When asked if he had received a timetable when to expect Simmons to be able to play, Vaughn said, “I think we're inching toward that way. It's really day to day. He'll get back on the court tomorrow. Hopefully he feels a comfort level and responds to the work tomorrow to get him close to playing these next two games.”

I never want to speculate how a player feels. Their feelings are their feelings. And I'll always validate that. ... So I won't speculate.”Kevin Durant is still sidelined because of a sprained knee ligament, and Ben Simmons and T.J. Warren will each also miss their fourth straight game with left knee soreness and a left shin contusion, respectively. Simmons was downgraded after previously being listed as questionable. Warren was initially listed as doubtful, which changed to out about an hour before gametime.“Just trying to get to a level — T.J. and Ben — where they're comfortable getting back on the court and playing,” Vaughn said.When asked if he had received a timetable when to expect Simmons to be able to play, Vaughn said, “I think we're inching toward that way. It's really day to day. He'll get back on the court tomorrow. Hopefully he feels a comfort level and responds to the work tomorrow to get him close to playing these next two games.”___AP freelancer Denis P.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800537,"Man held for California school fight, gun threat to students","CORONA, Calif. (AP) — A man who allegedly punched three players during a girls' high school basketball game in Corona, California, and then pulled a gun on other students has been arrested, police said.

            Thaddis Brooks, 39, of Perris, was arrested Thursday in connection with a confrontation that occurred Jan. 24 during a game at Centennial High School, police said.

            During a game against visiting Santiago High School, witnesses said two students from the teams got into a fight on the court, a police statement said. 











            Police Sgt. Jason Waldon told the Los Angeles Times that Brooks, who was watching the game and was related to one player, left the stands, went onto the court and injured three girls, ages 16 and 17.

            He was restrained and left the gymnasium but went to the parking lot and got a handgun from his car, police said.

            He pointed it at some female students, ages 13 to 17, and threatened to shoot them but fled before police arrived, Waldon said.

            On Thursday, police searched his home. They didn't find any guns but found more than 40 dogs there. Animal control officers “determined there were animal cruelty factors present due to the conditions of the residence,"" the police statement said. 

            Brooks was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats, brandishing a deadly weapon, being a felon in possession of a firearm, possessing a firearm on school grounds and child abuse.

            He remained jailed Saturday on $350,000 bail. It wasn't immediately clear whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf.

            Court records show Brooks has a criminal record stretching back decades that includes guilty pleas to drug possession, battery causing serious bodily injury and making criminal threats, the Times said.

            Corona is about an hour's drive southeast of Los Angeles.

            In a statement, the Corona-Norco Unified School District said it would be increasing security at indoor athletic events, including the addition of more law enforcement and metal detectors.CORONA, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800538,Iraqi currency crash halts after meeting with U.S. official,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq's currency ended its nosedive after a meeting between the Iraqi Central Bank head and a top U.S. Treasury official.

            Under Secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence Brian E. Nelson said in a statement Saturday that he had met with Central Bank of Iraq Governor Ali al-Allaq in Istanbul the day before “to discuss banking sector reforms and a mutual commitment to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.”

            He praised Iraq's “steadfast dedication” to improving its compliance with international standards and “and offered continued cooperation in modernizing the banking sector,” the statement said.











            Measures taken by the United States in recent months to stamp out money laundering and the channeling of dollars to Iran and Syria from Iraq have severely restricted Iraq’s access to hard currency.

            Since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraq’s foreign currency reserves have been housed at the United States’ Federal Reserve, giving the Americans significant control over Iraq’s supply of dollars.

            The Iraqi dinar slipped to around 1,750 to the dollar at street exchanges in some parts of the country on Thursday, compared to the official rate of 1,460 dinars for $1. The devaluation has prompted protests and fears of inflation.

            The currency began to halt its slide after Iraq's Central Bank said in a statement Friday evening that the Treasury had “expressed its readiness for the necessary flexibility to achieve common goals.” As of Saturday, the dinar was trading at around 1,600 dinars to the dollar.

            The protesters marched at two locations in the central coastal city of Tel Aviv, waving flags and chanting slogans against the justice minister. “Doctors fighting for the life of democracy,” read a banner raised by a doctor at the Tel Aviv protest.

            The protest is the fifth against the new government, a coalition of ultra-Orthodox and far-right nationalist parties that took office in December. 











            The government launched proposals to weaken the Supreme Court by giving parliament the power to overturn court decisions with a simple majority vote. It also wants to give parliament control over the appointment of judges and reduce the independence of legal advisers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800546,No. 13 Iowa State rolls past eighth-ranked Kansas 68-53,"AMES, Iowa (AP) — Jaren Holmes scored all 15 of his points in the second half as No. 13 Iowa State rolled past No. 8 Kansas 68-53 on Saturday.

            Osun Osunniyi added 13 for the Cyclones (16-6, 7-3 Big 12), who stayed within at least a game of front-running Texas in the conference standings. Tamin Lipsey added eight rebounds and 10 assists.

            “Today, we came out and played desperate,” Holmes said.











            Jalen Wilson led the Jayhawks (18-5, 6-4) with 26 points for his sixth straight game with at least 20. No other Kansas player had more than 8 points.

            “It's not a formula for success for us,” Jayhawks coach Bill Self said. “We need balance from our starting five. If one guy feels like he's got to go do it all on his own, it crashes the offense.”

            The Cyclones led for all but 1:14 of the game, building a 34-16 scoring edge in the paint. Kansas struggled early, making just two of their first 10 shots and committing 11 turnovers in the first 20 minutes.

            Iowa State shot 46% for the game.

            “From the beginning, we gave them some easy buckets,” Wilson said. “That's something we've struggled with (defensively) ... the easiest way to get comfortable is easy buckets, layups, stuff like that.”

            Iowa State was up 33-21 at the break. 

            Holmes missed all four shots in the first half, but after getting sick at halftime, he helped the Cyclones stretched the lead to 42-31 early in the second half with a 3-pointer and layup.

            “I felt a little nauseous the whole day,"" he said. “I've been dealing with some sickness over the past week and a half.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Kansas: The Jayhawks dropped to 3-4 during a stretch in which six of its seven opponents were ranked. The lone unranked foe was Kentucky. ... Kansas committed a season-high 20 turnovers Saturday. ... The loss to Iowa State was Self’s first in five meetings with second-year Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger.

            Iowa State: Improved to 12-0 at home this season and 5-0 in the Big 12. It was also the Cyclones' fifth win over a top-10 opponent in the past two seasons. 

            UP NEXT

Tamin Lipsey added eight rebounds and 10 assists.“Today, we came out and played desperate,” Holmes said.Jalen Wilson led the Jayhawks (18-5, 6-4) with 26 points for his sixth straight game with at least 20. No other Kansas player had more than 8 points.“It's not a formula for success for us,” Jayhawks coach Bill Self said. “We need balance from our starting five. If one guy feels like he's got to go do it all on his own, it crashes the offense.”The Cyclones led for all but 1:14 of the game, building a 34-16 scoring edge in the paint. Kansas struggled early, making just two of their first 10 shots and committing 11 turnovers in the first 20 minutes.Iowa State shot 46% for the game.“From the beginning, we gave them some easy buckets,” Wilson said. “That's something we've struggled with (defensively) ... the easiest way to get comfortable is easy buckets, layups, stuff like that.”Iowa State was up 33-21 at the break.Holmes missed all four shots in the first half, but after getting sick at halftime, he helped the Cyclones stretched the lead to 42-31 early in the second half with a 3-pointer and layup.“I felt a little nauseous the whole day,"" he said. “I've been dealing with some sickness over the past week and a half.”BIG PICTUREKansas: The Jayhawks dropped to 3-4 during a stretch in which six of its seven opponents were ranked. The lone unranked foe was Kentucky. ... Kansas committed a season-high 20 turnovers Saturday. ... The loss to Iowa State was Self’s first in five meetings with second-year Iowa State coach T.J.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800547,Eyes on the sky as Chinese balloon shot down over Atlantic,"MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) — Eyes were locked on the Carolina skies Saturday as a suspected Chinese spy balloon ended its weeklong traverse over the U.S. when it drifted over the Atlantic Ocean and was shot down by a fighter jet.

            In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a crowd lining the beach boardwalk cheered as a missile from an F-22 fighter struck the balloon. It quickly deflated and plummeted to the ocean. 

            “That's my Air Force right there, buddy!"" a person exclaims just after the missile's impact, in a video taken by tourist Angela Mosley.











            Mosley said she came out of a store and saw four fighters circling, then saw the balloon. “One of the fighter jets gets going fast and gets closer to it, and then a boom and we knew it was gone.”

            Mosley said no boats appeared to be in the water beneath the balloon as the wreckage fell, but several aircraft arrived soon after. U.S. officials tried to time the operation so they could recover as much debris as possible before it sinks.

            The maneuverable balloon had become a major flashpoint in tensions between Washington and Beijing, and President Joe Biden faced pressure from Republicans in Congress to shoot it down. The administration waited until the balloon — about the size of three school buses — was over water because of risks to people on the ground from falling debris.

            China said it was a weather research vessel blown off course, a claim rejected by U.S. officials who said the craft had been over areas of Montana where nuclear missiles are siloed.

            As the balloon came over Myrtle Beach, software consultant Haley Walsh said she saw it floating in the clear blue sky. Walsh said she felt and heard a boom and ran outside where she saw the balloon tumbling down.

            ""I knew it was going over South Carolina, they were predicting it, but I didn't think it would go directly over,"" she said. 

            In Surfside Beach, South Carolina, photographer Travis Huffstetler set up on the roof of a condo to capture images of the balloon and said the beach was packed with people looking skyward and taking pictures and videos.

            He got still shots of the balloon before and after its destruction, but missed the strike itself because he was on the phone.

            “Aw, man, I just missed it,” he says at the outset of a video he posted to social media.

            Huffstetler said the plummeting balloon and debris looked like “confetti falling.”

            The balloon had entered the U.S. air defense zone north of Alaska's Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28, crossed into Canadian airspace two days later and then back into the U.S. over northern Idaho on Tuesday, U.S. defense and military officials said. It was acknowledged by government officials Thursday, a day after commercial flights were temporarily halted at the airport in Billings, Montana, where people on the ground saw the balloon seemingly loitering high above the city. 

            Scattered sightings continued as it passed over the nation's heartland — above Missouri and the Kansas City area Friday, North Carolina on Saturday morning and finally over the South Carolina coast.

            In York County, South Carolina the county sheriff’s office advised against anyone trying to take out the balloon on their own.

            “Don’t try to shoot it!!,” the sheriff’s office tweeted Saturday as the balloon passed over the region at an altitude of about 60,000 feet (18,600 meters). “Your rifle rounds WILL NOT reach it. Be responsible. What goes up will come down, including your bullets.”

            The fascination with the balloon that swept the nation also spawned false rumors that it had been shot down earlier in its journey.

            An unverified video out of Billings claimed a “massive explosion” over the city Friday evening, two days after the balloon had passed over. The video was aired by Fox News, and Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that he was “monitoring the situation.” 

            It was viewed millions of times and local officials had to bat down speculation that a Chinese balloon had been shot down. The city of Billings issued a statement that declared “there have not been any explosions in, around, or across #Montana.”

            Another video purported to show the balloon brought down in North Carolina Friday afternoon — about the same time people reported seeing it above Missouri.

            Software engineer and storm chaser Brian Branch captured photographs of the balloon high above western North Carolina hours before it was taken out. He could see a payload hanging from the round, white orb and watched it for more than an hour before it drifted into the path of the sun.

            “I let it just pass on by. If it was spinning, if it was a tornado, I would have chased it,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800548,No. 24 UConn uses late rally to beat last-place Georgetown,"WASHINGTON (AP) — On a team ranked as high as No. 2 this season, it was a freshman who saved the day for UConn. 

            Adama Sanogo and Tristen Newton each scored 15 and Alex Karaban knocked down two late 3-pointers as No. 24 UConn held for a 68-62 win at last-place Georgetown on Saturday. 

            “We’re lucky to have him in a UConn uniform,” coach Dan Hurleyy said about Karaban, who came into the game as the Huskies fourth-leading scorer, averaging 9.7. “There’s not many freshmen in the country that have been as consistent, solid.”











            Despite leading for most of the game, the heavily favored Huskies (18-6, 7-6 Big East) needed a late 8-1 run to earn the season sweep over the Hoyas. UConn has won two straight and three of four. 

            Brandon Murray’s three-point play with 4:42 left put the Hoyas on top at 61-60. It was Georgetown’s first lead since the 16:16 mark in the first half. Murray scored 14 of his game-high 21 points after halftime for the Hoyas (6-18, 1-12), who have lost six straight games to UConn. 

            It was a game far closer than expected as UConn began the day at No. 8 in the Net Rankings while Georgetown sat near the bottom.

            “This would have been a tough one in terms of the metrics and everything that’s at stake for us,"" Hurley said. ""There was a lot of pressure on us, in that under four timeout, because the group knew we could ill afford to come and lose here.”

            That’s when Karaban, who was scoreless at halftime, provided the spark.

            Karaban knocked down a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 3:03 left to restore the UConn lead at 63-61. With the game winding down and the Hoyas still within a possession, Karaban ended Georgetown's upset bid with his third 3-pointer of the day with 27 seconds left. 

            Karaban finished with 11 points, going 3 for 7 from deep after making 1 of 5 to start.

            Georgetown missed its final seven shots of the game. The Hoyas have lost three straight since a Jan. 24 win against DePaul ended their record-setting, 29-game Big East losing streak. Georgetown has now lost 32 of the last 33 conference games going back to March 2021.

            “I didn’t think we executed very well down the stretch,” Ewing said about his team’s late struggles in both games with UConn this season. 

            Primo Spears, the Hoyas leading scorer averaging 16.8 points, was scoreless and attempted just one shot in 37 minutes. He led the Hoyas with five assists. 

            BIG PICTURE

            UConn: Once the favorites in the league, the Huskies enter a difficult four-game stretch against teams all vying for NCAA bids. The Huskies went 1-3 this season against upcoming foes Marquette, Creighton, Seton Hall and Providence. 

            Georgetown: Ewing is 74-102 in his sixth season coaching at the school that he led to the 1984 NCAA championship as a player. The Hoyas have clinched a losing Big East record for the fourth straight season. Ewing’s lone winning season came in his second season in 2018-19 when the Hoyas finished 19-14 and lost in the first round of the NIT.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800549,Pedulla's 22 points lift Virginia Tech past No. 6 Virginia,"BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) — Sean Pedulla scored 22 points and Virginia Tech beat No. 6 Virginia 74-68 on Saturday, snapping the Cavaliers' seven-game winning streak.

            Pedulla made 6 of 13 from the floor as the Hokies (14-10, 4-8 Atlantic Coast Conference) posted their biggest win of the season. He added 8 of 9 from the free-throw line. Justin Mutts added 17 points. 

            Virginia Tech never trailed and shot 50% from the floor for the fourth straight game.











            “There was no pouting (after the Miami loss). Just back to practice the next day,"" Virginia Tech coach Mike Young said of his team, which lost 92-83 to No. 23 Miami on Tuesday. ""Yeah, we’ve got Virginia coming in. Yes, in-state and all of that stuff. We’ve got another opportunity to play another really good opponent. We’ve got a chance to play Virginia Tech basketball and fight and compete and adhere to the things that are important to us — and we did that by and large on both ends of the floor.”

            Jayden Gardner’s 20 points led Virginia (17-4, 9-3), which saw its usually stingy defense struggle. Kihei Clark finished with 17 points for the Cavaliers, while Reece Beekman had 15. Armaan Franklin, who had scored in double figures in 10 straight games, had six.

            The Cavaliers tied the game at 38 on Gardner’s basket with 15:09 remaining, but the Hokies outscored Virginia 17-7 over the next seven minutes and never looked back.

            Mutts hit 7 of 11 from the floor and added eight assists and four rebounds. Grant Basile had 14 points and Hunter Cattoor scored all 10 of his points in the second half for the Hokies.

            “The heart was there, but to win in this setting against a team that’s playing good basketball, and Tech is, and they’ve got the players, you’ve got to be hard and smart,” Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. “You can’t just be all hard. We were (hard and smart) for stretches, and they made us make some adjustments that helped a little bit, but they made the big shots.”

            TIP-INS

            Virginia: The Cavaliers suffered a rare poor outing on the defensive end, and it cost them. They led the ACC in scoring defense (60.2 ppg) going in, but allowed the Hokies to score 74 points and shoot 50.9% (27 of 53) from the floor. The Hokies became just the third team this season to shoot better than 50% against Virginia and scored 40 points in the paint.

            “They run a lot of action, whether it’s dribble handoffs, fakes, they keep you on your toes, and it takes an incredible, and I think disciplined (effort) to keep them in front and keep them out of the paint,” Bennett said. 

            Virginia Tech: After losing eight of their previous 10 games, the Hokies needed a big win to help their thin NCAA Tournament resumé. Registering 19 assists and turning the ball over just eight times were keys.

            “Obviously, we keep up with stuff throughout the year, like ‘Oh, this would be a huge win on our resumé,'"" Pedulla said. ""We do think about (the NCAA Tournament), and we obviously want to get there again. We know our team’s capable of it. We’re focused on it and we're just trying to stack those wins on top of each other. I think this win definitely helps us.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800550,Chile wildfires spread amid heat wave as death toll rises,"SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Chile extended an emergency declaration to yet another region on Saturday as firefighters struggled to control dozens of raging wildfires that have claimed at least 22 lives amid a scorching heat wave that has broken records.

            The government declared a state of catastrophe in the La Araucanía region, which is south of Ñuble and Biobío, two central-southern regions where the emergency declaration had already been issued. The measure allows for greater cooperation with the military. 

            At least 22 people have died in connection to the fires and 554 have been injured, including 16 in serious condition, according to Interior Minister Carolina Tohá. The death toll is likely to rise as Tohá said there are unconfirmed reports of at least 10 people missing.











            Sixteen of the deaths took place in Biobío, five in La Araucanía and one in Ñuble.

            The deaths included a Bolivian pilot who died when a helicopter that was helping combat the flames crashed in La Araucanía. A Chilean mechanic also died in the crash.

            Over the past week, fires have burned through an area equivalent to what is usually burned in an entire year, Tohá said in a news conference.

            The fires come at a time of record high temperatures.

            “The thermometer has reached points that we have never known until now,” Tohá said.

            As of Saturday morning, there were 251 wildfires raging throughout Chile, 151 of which were under control, according to Chile’s Senapred disaster agency. 

            “Seventy-six new fires appeared yesterday,” Tohá said Saturday.

            The minister also suggested the fires should serve as yet another wake up call about the effects of climate change.

            “The evolution of climate change shows us again and again that this has a centrality and a capacity to cause an impact that we have to internalize much more,” Tohá said. “Chile is one of the countries with the highest vulnerability to climate change, and this isn’t theory but rather practical experience.”

            Chile is requesting international cooperation to assist the firefighting efforts.

            “We’re requesting support from several countries to address the emergency,” President Gabriel Boric wrote on social media.SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Chile extended an emergency declaration to yet another region on Saturday as firefighters struggled to control dozens of raging wildfires that have claimed at least 22 lives amid a scorching heat wave that has broken records.The government declared a state of catastrophe in the La Araucanía region, which is south of Ñuble and Biobío, two central-southern regions where the emergency declaration had already been issued.

The death toll is likely to rise as Tohá said there are unconfirmed reports of at least 10 people missing.Sixteen of the deaths took place in Biobío, five in La Araucanía and one in Ñuble.The deaths included a Bolivian pilot who died when a helicopter that was helping combat the flames crashed in La Araucanía. A Chilean mechanic also died in the crash.Over the past week, fires have burned through an area equivalent to what is usually burned in an entire year, Tohá said in a news conference.The fires come at a time of record high temperatures.“The thermometer has reached points that we have never known until now,” Tohá said.As of Saturday morning, there were 251 wildfires raging throughout Chile, 151 of which were under control, according to Chile’s Senapred disaster agency.“Seventy-six new fires appeared yesterday,” Tohá said Saturday.The minister also suggested the fires should serve as yet another wake up call about the effects of climate change.“The evolution of climate change shows us again and again that this has a centrality and a capacity to cause an impact that we have to internalize much more,” Tohá said. “Chile is one of the countries with the highest vulnerability to climate change, and this isn’t theory but rather practical experience.”Chile is requesting international cooperation to assist the firefighting efforts.“We’re requesting support from several countries to address the emergency,” President Gabriel Boric wrote on social media.",2023/02/05,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800564,Everton stuns Arsenal and Liverpool's EPL troubles deepen,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Prowling the sideline and upsetting the big boys, it’s as if Sean Dyche never went away. 

            There was even a trademark headed goal from one of his former Burnley players to give Everton’s new manager a winning debut and blow the English Premier League title race wide open on Saturday.

            Table-topping Arsenal paid the price as Dyche immediately made his presence felt and defender James Tarkowski sealed a shock 1-0 win.











            There was no such joy for neighbor Liverpool as it slumped again to a 3-0 loss at Wolverhampton, and Jurgen Klopp's troubles deepened.

            EVERTON ERUPTS

            Victory for Everton was its first in any competition since October and ended a 10-game winless streak.

            That run led to the sacking of manager Frank Lampard last month and the appointment of Dyche in a desperate bid to avoid relegation.

            After 69 years in the top-flight, there is a lot riding on Everton's latest managerial hire, which already looks like shrewd business. 

            Dyche led unfashionable Burnley into the league in 2016 and repeatedly upset the odds in his near 10 years at the Lancashire club. In that sense, it was business as usual against an Arsenal team flying highest in the league and looking to open an eight-point gap on second-placed Manchester City. 

            Dyche was back in his element as he barked orders to his players and Goodison Park celebrated a win that could have significance at both ends of the table. 

            “It’s a start point. That one (win) doesn’t guarantee the next one,"" Dyche said. ""The way they have taken ownership and pride in what we have tried to do this week, I value that.”

            Arsenal lost for only the second time in the league and will see its lead cut to two points if City beats Tottenham on Sunday. But the London club will have a game in hand.

            The result also gave hope to Manchester United and Newcastle that they could yet challenge for the title.

            United beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Old Trafford and was eight points behind the leader having played a game more.

            Newcastle, however, failed to take full advantage of Arsenal’s loss when it was held by West Ham to 1-1.

            MISERY FOR LIVERPOOL

            Liverpool’s season is unravelling after a seventh league loss makes a bid for Champions League qualification look increasingly unlikely.

            Wolverhampton inflicted the latest blow to a team that was chasing an unprecedented quadruple of trophies last term. A season later, and after one win from its last seven games in all competitions, Liverpool is searching for answers.

            “We better change it. That’s true, 100%,” Klopp said. “I have no words for it really, I’m sorry.”

            CASEMIRO SEES RED

            United has seen the heart of its team torn apart in the space of a week after Casemiro was sent off on Saturday just days after Christian Eriksen was ruled out for most of the rest of the season through injury.

            Erik ten Hag’s rebuild, which has seen United reach the final of the League Cup and a league title challenge reignited, has been heavily reliant on his overhaul in midfield.

            But Casemiro will be suspended for three games after being sent off for violent conduct when putting his hands around the neck of Palace midfielder Will Hughes.

            How well Ten Hag patches up his team while Casemiro is absent could be crucial to United’s chances of chasing down Arsenal.

            NEWCASTLE MISSES CHANCE

            Newcastle could not follow United’s lead of fully capitalizing on Arsenal’s dropped points when it was matched by relegation-threatened West Ham at St James’ Park.

            Eddie Howe’s team conceded in the league for the first time since November, and it proved costly.

            Callum Wilson scored after three minutes to give Newcastle a flying start, but Lucas Paqueta evened the score in the 32nd.

            The draw dropped Newcastle to fourth, two points behind United.

            MITOMA STRIKES AGAIN

            Kaoru Mitoma might be Brighton’s latest star find after another late intervention.

            The Japan international stunned Liverpool last weekend with a goal in added time to send the holder out of the FA Cup. On Saturday, his 87th-minute header sealed a 1-0 league win against Bournemouth.

            Brighton has been impressive in spotting and developing talent. Marc Cucurella was sold to Chelsea for around $72 million last summer, and Moises Caicedo could command an even bigger fee at the end of this season.

            Mitoma could be the next one to catch the eye of league rivals. His goal was his third in as many games.

            FIGHT TO SURVIVE

            Harry Souttar had an eventful Leicester debut.

            Fresh from his deadline day move from Stoke, the defender scored an own goal but still ended up victorious as Leicester boosted its survival chances by beating Aston Villa 4-2 to secure a first league win since November.

            But it was another difficult day for fellow struggler Southampton, which lost at Brentford 3-0.

            Zach Edey finished with 33 points and 18 rebounds for Purdue (22-2, 11-2 Big Ten).

            The Hoosiers (16-7, 7-5) have won both of their home games against their archrival under second-year coach Mike Woodson.











            A roaring, raucous crowd that stayed on its feet most of the game wasted no time storming the court after the final buzzer sounded. Hood-Schifino had 16 points for the Hoosiers, who have won six of seven.

            NO. 2 TENNESSEE 46, NO. 25 AUBURN 43

            KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Josiah-Jordan James scored 15 points to lead Tennessee past Auburn in a game in which every point was difficult and nothing flowed.

            The Volunteers (19-4, 8-2 Southeastern Conference) shot just 27% from the field and 9.5% from the 3-point line. They were recovering from a Wednesday loss to Florida in which they shot 28%.

            The Tigers (17-6, 7-3) were led by Johni Broome with 11 points and K.D. Johnson off the bench with 10 points. Auburn managed only 24% from the field and 11% from the 3-point line.

            NO. 4 ALABAMA 79, LSU 69

            BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Noah Clowney and Rylan Griffen led a balanced scoring attack with 14 points each to carry Alabama over LSU, which lost its 10th straight.

            Derek Fountain led LSU (12-11, 1-9) with a career-high 26 points. Cam Hayes came off the bench and scored 15 points. Tigers leading scorer KJ Williams was held to eight points, nine below his season average.

            TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Azuolas Tubelis scored 19 points, Courtney Ramey added 11 and Arizona used a massive first-half run to get its sixth win in a row.

            The Wildcats (21-3, 10-3 Pac-12) slogged through a foul-filled first half before racing past the Beavers with a 19-2 run that gave them a 26-point halftime lead.

            Arizona had 22 assists on 28 field goal, grabbed 17 more rebounds and outscored Oregon State by 16 in the paint. Tubelis hit 6 of 10 shots and grabbed eight rebounds in 23 minutes.

            Once the Wildcats started rolling, the Beavers (9-15, 3-10) couldn’t catch them, losing their seventh straight to Arizona. Jordan Pope led Oregon State with 11 points.

            Pedulla hit 6 of 13 from the floor as the Hokies (14-10, 4-8 Atlantic Coast Conference) posted their biggest win of the season. He added 8 of 9 from the free-throw line and Virginia Tech never trailed.

            Justin Mutts added 17 points for the Hokies, who shot 50% from the floor for the fourth straight game.

            Jayden Gardner’s 20 points led Virginia (17-4, 9-3), which saw its usually stingy defense struggle.

            NO. 10 TEXAS 69, NO. 7 KANSAS STATE 66

            MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Christian Bishop scored all 14 of his points in the second half, including the go-ahead lay-in with 37 seconds to go, and Texas rallied from a 14-point first-half deficit.

            Sir’Jabari Rice also had 14 points for the Longhorns, and his two free throws with nine seconds left forced the Wildcats into needing a 3-pointer to send the game to overtime. 

            Tyrese Hunter and Marcus Carr added 10 points apiece for Texas (19-4, 8-2), which took over sole possession of first place in the rough-and-tumble Big 12 by avenging an overtime loss to the Wildcats (18-5, 6-4) early last month.

            Keyontae Johnson struggled through foul trouble but still had 16 points to lead the Wildcats, who have lost back-to-back games for the first time this season.

            Jalen Wilson led the Jayhawks (18-5, 6-4) with 26 points for his sixth straight with at least 20.

            The Cyclones led for all but 1:14 of the game, building a 34-16 scoring edge in the paint.

            LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jaime Jaquez Jr. had 24 points and a career-high 15 rebounds, and UCLA won its 21st consecutive home game.

            The Bruins (19-4, 10-2 Pac-12) own the nation’s longest active home winning streak, including a 13-0 mark at Pauley Pavilion this season.

            Washington State (10-15, 5-9) was without second-leading scorer DJ Rodman. The senior missed both games in Los Angeles because of illness. The Cougars were led by TJ Bamba with 19 points. Justin Powell added 17, hitting five 3-pointers.

            Mahaney scored or assisted on 19 of 21 points in a stretch that started with the Gaels (21-4, 10-0 West Coast Conference) trailing by four points with five minutes to play in regulation. Mitchell Saxen added 15 points for Saint Mary’s and Alex Ducas scored 14.

            Drew Timme scored 23 points to lead Gonzaga (19-5, 8-2), but got little help offensively from the rest of his team.

            Emanuel Miller led TCU (17-6, 6-4) with 17 points and Shahada Wells had 14. The Horned Frogs have struggled since their leading scorer, Mike Miles Jr., suffered a hyperextended right knee last Saturday early during a loss to Mississippi State. TCU also was minus injured big man Eddie Lampkin Jr.

            CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — Nijel Pack scored 20 points and Isaiah Wong added 15 as Miami used a second-half burst to hold off Clemson. 

            Wong and Pack each hit 3-pointers right after halftime for the Hurricanes (18-5, 9-4 Atlantic Coast Conference), who used a 21-9 run to open a 56-44 lead with 11:10 to play. 

            Wooga Poplar added 14 points for Miami while Jordan Miller had 12. 

            Clemson (18-6, 10-3) lost its second straight game after opening ACC play 10-1. PJ Hall had 17 of his team-high 19 points in the second half for the Tigers. Hunter Tyson added 13 points and 10 rebounds.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Adama Sanogo and Tristen Newton each scored 15 and Alex Karaban knocked down two late 3-pointers to give UConn a win over last-place Georgetown. 

            Despite leading for most of the game, the heavily favored Huskies (18-6, 7-6 Big East) needed a late 8-1 run to earn the season sweep over the Hoyas. UConn has won two straight and three of four. 

            Brandon Murray’s three-point play with 4:42 left put the Hoyas on top at 61-60 for their first lead since 16:16 in the first half. Murray scored 14 of his game-high 21 points after halftime for the Hoyas (6-18, 1-12), who have lost six straight games to UConn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800566,Al Ahly's late goal ends Seattle debut 1-0 in Club World Cup,"TANGIER, Morocco (AP) — Mohamed Afsha scored on a deflected shot in the 88th minute and sent Al Ahly into the Club World Cup semifinals by beating the Seattle Sounders 1-0 on Saturday. 

            Afsha scored after coming on as a substitute in the 63rd. He lifted Al Ahly into the semifinals for the third straight year, and brought an abrupt end to the first appearance by a team from the United States in the competition. 

            His initial shot from outside the penalty area hit the crossbar. Seattle was unable to clear the danger and Afsha’s second attempt deflected off defender Alex Roldan and bounded past goalkeeper Stefan Frei.











            It was the only shot on target by the Egyptian club as both sides played a heavily defensive game where chances at goal were limited. 

            Al Ahly will face Real Madrid in the semifinals next Wednesday in Rabat. Al Ahly has not lost a match in any competition since Aug. 27 in the Egyptian Premier League. 

            Al Ahly has finished third in each of the past two Club World Cups but has never made the final.

            Seattle was the first club from Major League Soccer to take part in the Club World Cup after winning the CONCACAF Champions League last May. The Sounders carried hopes of advancing through their first match and playing at least three matches at the event.

            But while Seattle was excellent defensively, it lacked quality chances on attack. Seattle finished with just one shot on goal, a speculative attempt from defensive midfielder Josh Atencio early in the second half.

            “I thought we were good. I thought we were evenly matched. A couple of chances. But the deflection on the goal, it’s unfortunate,” Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer said. 

            Seattle was playing its first competitive match in 3 ½ months while the rest of MLS was going through preseason preparations. The Sounders' previous match was last October and the team gathered for MLS preseason camp in early January. 

            “They put everything into the game. They put everything into preseason,” Schmetzer said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800569,"NFL infuses Pro Bowl with points system, flag football","LAS VEGAS (AP) — The NFL finally stopped pretending its all-star game was an actual game, and is breathing life into the exhibition with Sunday's Pro Bowl Games. 

            There will be no tackle football played for the first time — not that there was much tackling in recent years, more like two-hand touch. Flag football is now the marquee event.

            Will the dramatically different format work? The league desperately hopes so. Rather than a winner-take-all game, a series of events — each of which accumulates three points — lead up to three flag football contests to determine the winning conference.











            Two AFC players from the hometown Las Vegas Raiders weren't completely sold on the format. Running back Josh Jacobs even called it “stupid.”

            “They need to figure out a way for it to actually make sense because I don’t enjoy this,” Jacobs said. “Send everybody’s family on vacation and call it a day.”

            Defensive end Maxx Crosby was one of the few who treated last year’s Pro Bowl as an actual game. He had two sacks, three tackles for loss and three batted passes to win defensive MVP in the AFC’s 41-35 victory.

            “It’s just about being around the guys,” Crosby said. “The Pro Bowl is a blessing and a dream come true, so I’m not taking it for granted. ... We’ll see what happens next year. I hope we can play some football.”

            Two NFC players offered more favorable reviews.

            “I think the format's cool because it’s less taxing on the body."" Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander said. “A lot of guys finished the season injured and come out here and run around with some flags. Who wouldn't like that?""

            ""It's fun,"" New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley said. ""For a guy like me, especially, to participate in a flag football game and the skills challenge, I’m competitive. It makes you feel like a little kid again. And hopefully, it puts smiles on fans' and little kids' faces.”

            Four skills events took place Thursday, and the AFC will try to extend its five-game winning streak after taking a 9-3 lead by winning the precision passing competition, the three-event lightning round and the long drive. The NFC won in dodgeball.

            Sunday brings the end of the skills portion: the finals of the best catch, an obstacle race, a special teams game called kick-tac-toe and a strength contest. Then the two conferences will play each other in two flag football games, each worth six points. 

            The total points from all the contests will be the score entering the third and final flag football game.

            Got all that?

            A clear scoring system during the competition would help. Those watching ESPN on Thursday were able to keep up because the network regularly updated viewers, but inside the Raiders' facility, there was no scoreboard nor any announcements of which events were about to begin — nor any results afterward.

            That shouldn't be a problem Sunday. The score already was on the scoreboard during Saturday's media day.

            This isn't the first time the NFL has tried to figure out what to do with the Pro Bowl. It was successful in the early years after moving to Honolulu in 1980 and providing players a working vacation many actually looked forward to.

            The game remained there until 2009, when public and player interest began to wane. Then the NFL began to move it around — it has been in six cities, including a return to Aloha Stadium five times during one six-year stretch.

            Las Vegas is hosting for the second year in a row, and there has been no announcement about the Pro Bowl's future after this season. Because the Super Bowl will be at Allegiant Stadium next year, it's unlikely the NFL will want to play both in the same venue so close together.

            Sunday will go a long way in dictating the longer-term direction. 

            No matter the location or the format, lots of top stars usually opt out. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen cited an elbow injury as his reason to skip this year's event, but he played golf in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.

            The AFC had to go deep into the alternate quarterback list to fill out its roster with Tyler Huntley and Derek Carr. Huntley played in five games this season for the Baltimore Ravens, and Carr was benched by the Raiders with two weeks remaining.

            Not that the Pro Bowl is devoid of talent. The AFC's receiving corps of Ja'Marr Chase, Stefon Diggs and Tyreek Hill is the definition of an all-star group. There also are recognizable names throughout both rosters, such as Barkley, Derrick Henry, Justin Jefferson, Christian McCaffrey, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Roquan Smith, Micah Parsons and Fred Warner.

            But the biggest stars might be the two coaches — brothers Peyton and Eli Manning.

            Clifford Omoruyi added 15 points for the Scarlet Knights (16-7, 8-4 Big Ten), nine in the second half, and grabbed 12 rebounds for his ninth double-double this season. 

            Tyson Walker scored 12 points and Joey Hauser 10 for the Spartans (14-9, 6-6).

The Scarlet Knights rebounded from dismal 24% shooting in the first half when they trailed by six to hit 58% of their shots in the second when they emphasized getting the ball into the paint.

            Caleb O'Connell hit a 3-pointer to give Rutgers its final lead in the midst of a 9-0 run. The Knights were up two when Mulcahy followed with a free throw and consecutive driving layups to lead by seven with two minutes left. Rutgers' final 10 points came at the line.

            Michigan was 3 of 13 and Rutgers 2 of 15 over the first 10 minutes of the opening half for a combined 13 points. A 6-0 run at the end of the half gave Michigan State a 25-19 lead. 

            Rutgers finished at 38% shooting, Michigan State 34%, and they combined to go just 7 of 37 from the arc.

            Rutgers lost Mawot Mag with 6 1/2 minutes left in the first half with a right leg injury. He led the Knights in the first half with seven points but was in street clothes in the second half, wearing a brace.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800576,Super Bowl-bound Chiefs are built around Patrick Mahomes,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs are built around their half-billion dollar All-Pro quarterback, and for the past five years, Super Bowl-bound Patrick Mahomes has made everyone else around him all the more valuable.

            He's taken marginal wide receivers and turned them into stars. Mediocre offensive linemen became stalwarts.

            Finishing the second year of his mammoth 10-year contract, Mahomes soaks up more than a fifth of the Kansas City salary cap, and some would argue he's still underpaid. Yet the deal nevertheless creates a challenge in filling out the roster around him, and it's one that Chiefs general manager Brett Veach confronted with savvy business and creativity.











            Their prime rusher is a seventh-round pick. Their touchdowns leader is a journeyman running back making $1,272,500 this season, while none of their wide receivers is making $5 million. Their top tackler is still on his paltry rookie deal. 

            “I would start with Brett and the way that he and his guys have gone about putting this thing together,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said, while also pointing to the latitude given to him by chairman Clark Hunt and team president Mark Donovan.

            “They're all part of that, giving us the opportunity to do what Brett can do by bringing these guys in,” Reid said. “But the process he goes through, he's relentless. He's committed. He's got a great eye for talent. He's fearless when it comes to the trades and drafts and all those things. It's been fun for me to watch.""

            Reid used to hold both titles of coach and general manager when he was with the Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City's opponent in the Super Bowl next weekend. But when he took over the Chiefs in 2013, he decided to step away from front-office work and focus solely on his first love: coaching.

            The decision to draft Mahomes four years later got his blessing, of course, and it was then-GM John Dorsey who had the final say. But it was Veach, then the co-director of player personnel, who stood on the table and stumped for him.

            Veach took over as general manager the following year and began putting his thumbprint on the rest of the team.

            He invested heavily in defense, particularly when it comes to rushing the passer, and made sure veteran safeties could back up young cornerbacks acquired through the draft. On offense, he rebuilt the entire offensive line through free agency and the draft, then spread money around the skill positions without investing too heavily in any one player.

            That led to Veach's biggest decision since drafting Mahomes: trading Tyreek Hill to the Dolphins.

            Veach could have given the All-Pro wide receiver a massive contract extension last offseason, but doing so would have hamstrung the team for years to come. So, Veach sent him to the Dolphins for draft picks and financial flexibility.

            He used both to build a team that is heading back to the Super Bowl.

            “I think it’s a confirmation that we have confidence in our process,” Veach said. ""It just goes to show that I have a really talented staff and I think the hard work pays off. We have a process and we’re always going to be motivated to continue to add talent and depth to this roster and provide Coach and Pat what they need.”

            OFFENSE

            The Chiefs had to replenish at wide receiver after trading Hill and losing Byron Pringle and Demarcus Robinson in free agency. They signed JuJu Smith-Schuster to a one-year prove-it deal, Marquez Valdes-Scantling to a three-year contract and drafted Skyy Moore, who does many of the same jet sweeps that made Hill such a defensive terror.

            Having tight end Travis Kelce, every bit as dangerous as the best wide receivers, helps the cause.

            The Chiefs rebuilt their offensive line the previous year, and it returned largely intact, so the other focus was on the ground game. The Chiefs took a flier on running back Isiah Pacheco in the seventh round, and by the midpoint of the season, he had supplanted injury-prone former first-round pick Clyde Edwards-Helaire atop the depth chart.

            DEFENSE

            Besides the quarterback, the biggest contract on the books belongs to Chris Jones. And like Mahomes, there's an argument to be made that the big defensive tackle, with 15 1/2 sacks this season, has vastly outperformed it.

            Veach knows the value in pressuring the quarterback, though. It's why the Chiefs traded for Frank Clark and gave him a big contract, signed veteran Carlos Dunlap this past offseason and used a first-round pick on George Karlaftis.

            The Chiefs had to replace Tyrann Mathieu's leadership on the back end of the defense, so they signed safety Justin Reid in free agency. Little did Reid know that he'd spend all season tutoring a quartet of rookie defensive backs — Trent McDuffie, Jaylen Watson, Joshua Williams and Bryan Cook — who came up huge in the AFC title game against the Bengals.

            SPECIAL TEAMS

            Harrison Butker has been one of the league's best kickers going on six years, but an ankle injury sustained in the opener led to a shaky season. He came back to drive through the winning field goal in the final seconds against Cincinnati.

            Tommy Townsend merely earned All-Pro honors while setting several franchise milestones for punting this season.

            Lucas Paqueta's strike took the shine off Eddie Howe's 600th game as a manager and dented Newcastle's rise.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800580,"Lawrence returns, paces Vanderbilt past Ole Miss, 74-71","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — After sitting out a blowout loss for disciplinary reasons, Tyrin Lawrence returned to the Vanderbilt lineup Saturday and sparked the Commodores to a hard-fought, 74-71 win over Mississippi in a Southeastern Conference battle that featured 20 lead changes and nine ties.

            Lawrence earned the ire of Vanderbilt Coach Jerry Stackhouse following a 72-66 loss to Texas A&M and was held out of a 101-44 loss to No. 4 Alabama, the program's worst loss since 2003. 

            “I'm not a coach to hold grudges ... ” Stackhouse was quoted following the Alabama loss. “But at the end of the day, this is a benevolent dictatorship. You got to do it my way. You got to do it this way.”











            Lawrence played 37 minutes in his return and scored 18 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. He scored eight points in Vanderbilt's closing push that saw it take its biggest lead of the game, 72-61 after Myles Stute air balled a wide open 3-point attempt. Lawrence gathered the rebound and fired a pass to a still wide-open Stute, who this time buried the 3 with 57 seconds left.

            Liam Roberts, sporting a black eye left over from the Alabama game, led the Commodores (11-12, 4-6 SEC) with 19 points, 12 rebounds and seven blocked shots. Quentin Millora-Brown added 10 points.

            Ole Miss (9-14, 1-9) got 15 points and 12 rebounds from Jaemyn Brakefield and Myles Burns contributed 12 points and grabbed eight boards.

(AP) — After sitting out a blowout loss for disciplinary reasons, Tyrin Lawrence returned to the Vanderbilt lineup Saturday and sparked the Commodores to a hard-fought, 74-71 win over Mississippi in a Southeastern Conference battle that featured 20 lead changes and nine ties.Lawrence earned the ire of Vanderbilt Coach Jerry Stackhouse following a 72-66 loss to Texas A&M and was held out of a 101-44 loss to No. 4 Alabama, the program's worst loss since 2003.“I'm not a coach to hold grudges ... ” Stackhouse was quoted following the Alabama loss. “But at the end of the day, this is a benevolent dictatorship. You got to do it my way. You got to do it this way.”Lawrence played 37 minutes in his return and scored 18 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. He scored eight points in Vanderbilt's closing push that saw it take its biggest lead of the game, 72-61 after Myles Stute air balled a wide open 3-point attempt. Lawrence gathered the rebound and fired a pass to a still wide-open Stute, who this time buried the 3 with 57 seconds left.Liam Roberts, sporting a black eye left over from the Alabama game, led the Commodores (11-12, 4-6 SEC) with 19 points, 12 rebounds and seven blocked shots. Quentin Millora-Brown added 10 points.Ole Miss (9-14, 1-9) got 15 points and 12 rebounds from Jaemyn Brakefield and Myles Burns contributed 12 points and grabbed eight boards.Vanderbilt plays host to No. 2 Tennessee Wednesday.

(AP) — Damari Monsanto scored a career-high 28 points, making eight 3-pointers — also a career high — and Wake Forest defeated Notre Dame 81-64 on Saturday to snap a four-game losing streak.

            Monsanto made 8 of 13 from distance and also grabbed seven rebounds. His three 3-pointers in the first half were the only 3-point makes for either team.

            Wake Forest hit on 6 of 7 3-pointers in the first 5:02 of the second half, building a 13-point lead when Daivien Williamson hit a 3-pointer for a 47-34 advantage. 











            Marcus Hammond finally hit Notre Dame's first 3-pointer with 13:47 remaining. Nate Laszewski added two more 3-pointers, but the Fighting Irish were still down by eight with 8:31 remaining, 60-52. Tyree Appleby then hit a 3-pointer and a pair of free throws to put the Demon Deacons up by 13 again.

            Monsanto's seventh 3-pointer gave Wake Forest a 17-point lead with 4:27 remaining. His eighth 3 gave the Demon Deacons a 17-point lead again and capped the scoring with 41 seconds to go.

            Appleby had 16 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for Wake Forest (15-9, 7-6 ACC) and Bobi Klintman scored 10. Wake Forest shot 58.6% in the second half, with 11 of 19 3-pointers, and scored 50 points. For the game, the Demon Deacons shot 52.7% and connected on 14 of 30 3-pointers.

            Laszewski led Notre Dame (10-13, 2-10) with 18 points, Cormac Ryan added 12 and Hammond scored 10.

            Notre Dame, which averages 9.3 made 3-pointers per game, missed its first eight in the first half and finished 4 for 21. The Fighting Irish had only four turnovers, three of them by Ryan.

            The Fighting Irish hit 7 of their first 14 shots, including 7 of 11 inside the 3-point arc, and built a 16-4 lead. But Notre Dame missed its next eight attempts and Wake Forest rallied to get within 22-20 with 3:55 remaining in the half. The Demon Deacons took a 25-24 lead on a 3-pointer by Monsanto, his third of the half, and later a layup by Cameron Hildreth gave them a 27-26 lead at the break. Monsanto was the only player for either team to make a 3-pointer in the first half.

            Wake Forest won at Notre Dame for just the second time in seven trips to South Bend. Notre Dame leads the series 8-7 overall.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800590,No. 14 Marquette defeats Butler 60-52 for fifth straight win,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — While Marquette has surged into Big East title contention due to the efficiency of its offense, the 14th-ranked Golden Eagles showed Saturday they also can win with defense.

            Tyler Kolek had 13 points and eight assists as Marquette overcame a sluggish performance and defeated Butler 60-52 on Saturday for its fifth consecutive victory.

            “Obviously not one of our better offensive games, but the defensive effort was terrific,"" Marquette coach Shaka Smart said.











            Marquette (19-5, 11-2 Big East) remains tied for first place in the conference standings with No. 16 Xavier, which trounced St. John’s 96-71 later Saturday.

            The Golden Eagles have won 10 of their last 11 games, and their only loss in that stretch was an 80-76 decision at Xavier on Jan. 15. The two teams meet again Feb. 15 at Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum.

            Marquette entered Saturday leading all Division I teams in adjusted offensive efficiency, a metric measured by college basketball stats guru Ken Pomeroy that essentially translates to points scored per 100 possessions when adjusted for the level of competition. But the Golden Eagles weren't nearly as effective as usual on that end of the floor Saturday.

            Although they couldn't pull away from a Butler team that had lost each of its last four games by at least 21 points, the Golden Eagles got enough stops down the stretch to win.

            Butler (11-13, 3-10) had the ball while trailing by six a handful of times in the last three minutes, but Marquette didn't allow the Bulldogs to score on any of those possessions.

            “We have to be vicious,” said Chase Ross, who added 10 points for Marquette. “That was our motto for today: Be viciouus. We just have to fight through everything. They set a lot of screens, so we've got to get through them and stay solid.”

            Jayden Taylor scored 19 points and Simas Lukosius added 15 for Butler, which hurt itself with 19 turnovers and a disastrous final minute of the first half. Marquette led 32-20 after outscoring Butler 7-0 in the last 34 seconds of the half, including five points in the final four seconds.

            Butler trailed 25-20 and had the ball when Ross blocked a Jalen Thomas layup attempt with 44 seconds left, and Kolek hit a jumper 10 seconds later. After Ben Gold stole the ball from Eric Hunter Jr. on Butler’s next possession, Kolek drove toward the basket.

            Ali Ali fouled Kolek and then made contact with him again, a shove from behind that resulted in a flagrant foul-1. Kolek hit the two ensuing free throws and then fired an inbounds pass to a wide-open Kam Jones, whose corner 3-pointer at the buzzer gave Marquette a 12-point halftime lead.

            “That was one of the craziest endings to a first half,"" Butler coach Thad Matta said. “Everything that transpired in that time was stuff that had been covered. You can't get that back. But like I said, I thought our guys did a good job of shaking it down, coming back out and playing another 20 minutes at a high level.”

            After trailing by 15 midway through the second half, Butler got the margin down to 53-48 on a Lukosius 3-pointer with 4:54 remaining. But that’s as close as the Bulldogs would get.

            BIG PICTURE

            Butler: After so many blowout losses, the Bulldogs deserve credit for keeping this one close after even without Chuck Harris, who has 11.7 points per game but was unavailable Saturday after sustaining a concussion in a 70-49 loss to Seton Hall last weekend. The Bulldogs can only wonder what might have been if they'd closed out the first half more effectively and had taken better care of the ball.

            Marquette: The Golden Eagles took a 16-3 lead in the first 6 1/2 minutes of the game but otherwise didn't play as crisply as they have throughout this winning streak. They now go on the road for three of their next four games.

            
                POLL IMPLICATIONS
              

            Marquette has home victories over Villanova and Butler this week, which could enable the Golden Eagles to move up a spot or two.

The two teams meet again Feb. 15 at Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum.Marquette entered Saturday leading all Division I teams in adjusted offensive efficiency, a metric measured by college basketball stats guru Ken Pomeroy that essentially translates to points scored per 100 possessions when adjusted for the level of competition. But the Golden Eagles weren't nearly as effective as usual on that end of the floor Saturday.Although they couldn't pull away from a Butler team that had lost each of its last four games by at least 21 points, the Golden Eagles got enough stops down the stretch to win.Butler (11-13, 3-10) had the ball while trailing by six a handful of times in the last three minutes, but Marquette didn't allow the Bulldogs to score on any of those possessions.“We have to be vicious,” said Chase Ross, who added 10 points for Marquette. “That was our motto for today: Be viciouus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800593,Gary Bettman defends NHL handling of Pride night situations,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman at his state of the game news conference Saturday at All-Star Weekend defended the way the league and two teams handled situations that arose regarding Pride night celebrations.

            
                Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Ivan Provorov did not take part in warmups Jan. 18 because he refused to wear a Pride-themed jersey. Nine days later, the New York Rangers opted not to wear Pride jerseys or use Pride stick tape as part of their night despite previously advertising they planned to do so.

            Bettman said tolerance of varying viewpoints was part of being “open, welcoming and inclusive.”











            “You know what our goals, our values and our intentions are across the league, whether it’s at the league level or at the club level,” he said. “But we also have to respect some individual choice, and some people are more comfortable embracing themselves in causes than others. And part of being diverse and welcoming is understanding those differences.”

            Bettman said the NHL was not accepting bigotry or promoting homophobia. Provorov cited his Russian Orthodox religion for his decision, which coach John Tortorella supported, while the Rangers said in a statement: ""Our organization respects the LGBTQ+ community and we are proud to bring attention to important local community organizations as part of another great Pride Night. In keeping with our organization’s core values, we support everyone’s individual right to respectfully express their beliefs.”

            Bettman also revealed 2024 All-Star Weekend will take place in Toronto, addressed concerns about U.S. TV ratings and the current playoff format and provided an update on the sale process of the Ottawa Senators. 

            TORONTO ALL-STAR

            The NHL is trading fun in the sun in South Florida for the hype and buzz of All-Star festivities in the so-called center of the hockey universe in Toronto Feb. 2-3, 2024. It's the first time the Maple Leafs are set to host since 2000.

            “Being in Toronto where hockey is so important, we may not have 80-degree temperature, but we’ve got real intensity in one of the great hockey markets in the world,” Bettman said.

            The league originally planned to stage a World Cup of Hockey in February 2024, but plans fell through because of complications resulting from Russia's war in Ukraine. Toronto hosted the 2016 World Cup and has all the infrastructure in place to make All-Star Weekend happen in a place popular among players.

            “The city is always buzzing, especially for an event like this,” Leafs All-Star and Toronto area native Mitch Marner said. “It’s going to be every ready for it.”

            RATINGS WOES?

            Amid reports of U.S. TV ratings being down this season, Bettman said so many games streaming on ESPN+ were the cause and brushed off worries about the NHL on ESPN and TNT.

            ""Our ratings are fine,"" Bettman said. “Let’s not get too carried away with ratings because viewership overall is up nationally.”

            PLAYOFF FORMAT

            Some All-Stars, including longtime face of the league Sidney Crosby, have said they would prefer going back to the old playoff format that seeded teams 1 through 8 in the Eastern and Western Conferences.

            Currently, each division winner faces a wild-card opponent and second place against third, which could mean two of the top six teams in the NHL meeting in the first round and the league-leading Boston Bruins facing the winner in the second.

            “The debate of 1 versus 8, it’s not just that,” Bettman said. “You’ve got to also look at then changing the wild card and you’ve got to start looking at the matchups in terms of how many times everybody’s playing everybody else if you’re having conference-based playoffs. So it’s not as simple as saying, ‘I’d like 1 versus 8’ versus what we have. It involves a whole host of other issues that have to be addressed.”

            SENATORS SALE

            The process of selling the Senators after the death of owner Eugene Melnyk is ongoing, with 15 or more parties involved in the application process. No matter what happens, Bettman said, the team isn't leaving Canada's capital and could even move to a new downtown arena.

            “I want to be clear that whoever buys this club is doing so to keep it in Ottawa,"" he said. ""I say that so there’s no speculation.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800596,MVP Matthew Tkachuk lifts Atlantic to NHL All-Star Game win,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Florida's Matthew Tkachuk was right at home at the NHL All-Star Game.

            Again.

            Detroit's Dylan Larkin had a hat trick, Toronto's Mitch Marner had three assists and the Atlantic Division topped the Central Division 7-5 in the All-Star Game final on Saturday.











            All-Star Game MVP Matthew Tkachuk — playing alongside his brother Brady Tkachuk of the Ottawa Senators — had seven points on the day, after a five-point outburst in a semifinal win over the Metropolitan Division. Larkin had five goals in the Atlantic's two games.

            “We wanted to get a win for the home crowd, the fans,"" Montreal's Nick Suzuki said. “They did a good job of cheering on the Atlantic Division. We just wanted to put on a good show for them.""

            And for the MVP, winning in front of Panthers fans meant more than just winning.

            “It's been an honor to play in front of them this whole year and it's great that the other players in the league can see what a great place this is to play,"" Matthew Tkachuk said. “I'm as happy as can be here.""

            Arizona’s Clayton Keller, Dallas’ Jason Robertson, Colorado teammates Cale Makar, Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen all had goals for the Central in the final. Makar also had two assists.

            It was the first time the Atlantic won the All-Star Game, after six previous tries in the divisional format. The 11 players — nine skaters and two goalies — on the Atlantic roster split $1 million for the win.

            “It was so much fun,"" said Larkin, who had five goals in the two games. “I'm proud of how we won it. What a great group of guys ... it was just a great weekend.""

            Matthew Tkachuk has now been on the winning team in both of his All-Star appearances, and both times, he enjoyed the comforts of home. He helped the Pacific win the 2020 All-Star title in St. Louis, his hometown and one of the many spots that his father — Keith Tkachuk, who was in the crowd Saturday — played during his career.

            “I've been very fortunate, the two that I've been in that I know the ins and the outs of everything that goes on away from the rink,"" Matthew Tkachuk said. “It just made it so much more comfortable for me and extra special.""

            And this one truly had home-ice advantage. Matthew Tkachuk — the former Calgary standout who picked Florida this past offseason, despite much speculation that he would be going to St. Louis — had three goals and two assists in the Atlantic’s 10-6 win over the Metropolitan in the second semifinal.

            It was 3-0 Atlantic after the first half of the 20-minute final; all games under this All-Star format are 3-on-3, 20 minutes in length with a brief break after 10 minutes. The lead got to 4-0 early in the second half of the final, giving the Atlantic 10 consecutive goals; it trailed 6-4 in the semifinal before closing on a 6-0 run.

            Larkin scored with 1:06 left to make it 6-2, the first of five goals in a frantic finish.

            “It's been a blast,"" said Buffalo defenseman Rasmus Dahlin, who scored for the Atlantic with 36 seconds left to make it 7-3. “I met a lot of great people.""

            NOTES: The NHL gets right back to play on Monday with six games, including a home game for Florida — meaning it’ll be a quick turnaround for the arena. ... The Central Division is now the only one yet to win an All-Star Game in this format. The Pacific has three wins, the Metropolitan has three wins and now the Atlantic has one. ... Florida was supposed to host this game in 2021, only to have it canceled by the pandemic. The Panthers hosted All-Star weekend in 2023. ... Attendance was a sellout, 19,250.

            SEMIFINAL 1: CENTRAL 6, PACIFIC 4

            Keller had two goals and an assist, MacKinnon scored twice and the Central moved into the title matchup. St. Louis’ Vladimir Tarasenko had a goal and three assists for the Central. Vancouver’s Elias Pettersson had two goals, while San Jose’s Erik Karlsson and Edmonton’s Connor McDavid also scored for the Pacific.

            SEMIFINAL 2: ATLANTIC 10, METROPOLITAN 6

            The teams combined for a record-tying — in the 3-on-3 era, anyway — 16 goals. Matthew Tkachuk had three goals and two assists, tying a single-game record for the format. Larkin scored twice and Brady Tkachuk had a goal and three assists for the Atlantic. Columbus’ Johnny Gaudreau had three goals for the Metropolitan. Pittsburgh’s Sidney Crosby had two goals and Washington’s Alex Ovechkin had the other.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800598,"James leads No. 2 Tennessee over No. 25 Auburn, 46-43","KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Josiah-Jordan James scored 15 points and 14 rebounds to lead No. 2 Tennessee to a 46-43 victory over No. 25 Auburn on Saturday in a game in which every point was difficult and nothing flowed.

            “Both teams played as hard as they could,” said Tennessee coach Rick Barnes. “Every possession was a grind.”

            The Volunteers (19-4, 8-2 Southeastern Conference) shot just 27% from the field and 9.5% from the 3-point line. They were recovering from a Wednesday loss to Florida in which they shot 28%.











            Tennessee had a 47-42 edge on the boards and 15-8 on the offensive glass.

            “A game like this shows a lot of character,” said James. “I knew coming in (rebounding) was what I'd be called to do. I had to use the body God's given me.”

            “Both teams did a fantastic job,” said Auburn coach Bruce Pearl. “To hold Tennessee to 27% ... It doesn't get any better than that.”

            “I don't think there's a more physical league in the country,” said Barnes.

            The Tigers (17-6, 7-3) were led by Johni Broome with 11 points and nine rebounds and K.D. Johnson off the bench with 10 points. Auburn managed only 24% from the field and 11% from the 3-point line.

            Jaylin Williams made two free throws with 2:47 to play cut Tennessee's lead to 40-38. Santiago Vescovi hit his first 3-pointer of the game and got a four-point play out of it for a 44-38 lead. A 3-pointer by Wendell Green Jr. cut the advantage to 44-41 with 30 seconds left.

            A turnover on the inbounds play gave Auburn the ball with 23 seconds to play. Broome got a tip-in to make it a one-point game, and Zakai Zeigler made two free throws. 

            Green's last-second 3-point to tie clanked out.

            “At the end, Wendell Green got the shot off and got fouled,” said Pearl. “Nothing got called.”

            Auburn scored eight straight points to start the game. Tennessee followed with a six-point run and an eight-point spurt early in the second half. Those were the longest runs of the game.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Tennessee was in the No. 2 spot in the poll for two days before falling at Florida. Under Barnes, the Vols now have 25 wins over teams ranked in the Top 25. … Auburn had been clinging to the elite at No. 25 this week. The Tigers have been ranked as high as No. 11, coming in the fifth week of the season. 

            STAT SNACKS 

            Since statistics started being kept in 1999-2000, Tennessee is on pace to be the all-time leader in field-goal percentage defense (.348; Stanford, 1999-2000, is second .352) and 3-point defense (.225; Norfolk State, 2004-05, is second .253). … Through 22 games, the similarities between last year’s Vols point guard Kennedy Chandler (now with the Memphis Grizzlies) and this year’s Ziegler are striking (points per game: Chandler 13.5, Ziegler 11.4; rebounds: 3.0, 3.0; assists: 4.95, 5.05).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800601,"Boone, Oklahoma St blow big lead, recover to top No. 15 TCU","STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) — Senior forward Kalib Boone scored a career-high 25 points and Oklahoma State blew a 19-point second-half lead before recovering to beat depleted No. 15 TCU 79-73 on Saturday.

            Caleb Asberry added 19 points and John-Michael Wright had 17 for Oklahoma State (14-9, 5-5 Big 12). The Cowboys have won three straight and five of six to move back into the conversation for a potential NCAA tournament berth.

            Emanuel Miller led TCU with 17 points and Shahada Wells had 14.











            “A hell of a Big 12 game,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton said. “It was a battle like we anticipated against a team who I think is certainly one of the top 20, if not higher, teams in the country, even without the preseason conference player of the year. They’re deep. They’re fast. They’re athletic. But our guys met the challenge today.”

            The Horned Frogs (17-6, 6-4) have struggled since their leading scorer, Mike Miles Jr., suffered a hyperextended right knee last Saturday early during a loss to Mississippi State. TCU also was minus injured big man Eddie Lampkin Jr.

            “We’ve got to guard better,” TCU coach Jamie Dixon said. “I thought we had worked on it a lot going into this game and we had a plan in place, but we didn’t get it done. Obviously, we were down a couple of guys, but they were down a guy, too. We were in a position to win the game, but we didn’t get it done and that’s on me.”

            Dixon received a technical foul in the final minute of the first half and the Horned Frogs trailed 43-29 at the break. Five quick points by Asberry to open the second half gave Oklahoma State its biggest lead at 48-29 with 18:49 left.

            An 20-3 run by TCU cut the deficit and Damion Baugh’s layup with 11:51 left pulled the Horned Frogs within 51-49 with 11:51 left. Oklahoma State answered with six straight points to quell the immediate threat.

            TCU eventually tied it at 59 on three free throws by Baugh with 5:41 left, then took its first lead 33 seconds later on two free throws by Miller.

            Wright took over down the stretch for the Cowboys. His 3-pointer with 3:38 left gave Oklahoma State the lead for good at 66-65 and started a 9-0 run that included a dunk by Boone that started with an over-the-shoulder save by Wright.

            “I’m proud of how they approached the game from a mental standpoint,” Boynton said. “You get up 19 points and you hope to be able to extend that ... but the reality is it just doesn’t happen very often in this league.""

            “They are all tournament-caliber teams and tournament-caliber teams find a way to respond and make sure that the game is at least going to be in the balance late. I thought our guys’ response to (TCU’s) response was obviously critical. We lost the lead there, then had to make some plays to win,” he said.

            TCU pulled within 72-70 with 1:33 left on a 3-pointer by Wells, but Boone scored a pair of close-in baskets, the latter with 29.1 seconds left, to make it 76-71 and after a TCU miss, Asberry sealed the win with two free throws with 19.3 seconds left.

            “Obviously, they are playing for their lives and so are we,” Dixon said. “Everybody is in this league.”

            Oklahoma State took a 12-0 lead as TCU missed its first eight shots and didn’t make a basket for 6 1/2 minutes. Oklahoma State eventually led 22-6 less than eight minutes in and the Cowboys’ lead never fell below double digits the rest of the half.

            BIG PICTURE

            TCU: Miles can’t return fast enough for the Horned Frogs, who lost to Mississippi State in the game in which he was injured, then struggled to beat West Virginia at home before falling Saturday. The upcoming schedule for TCU looks daunting – No. 7 Kansas State, No. 11 Baylor and No. 13 Iowa State are its next three opponents, with the K-State and Iowa State games on the road.

            Oklahoma State: The Cowboys, now 2-6 this season against ranked foes, need all the big wins they can get as they look to position themselves for a NCAA tournament bid. To pick one up without one of their top players – Avery Anderson III – out with a wrist injury is a bonus.

            DID THAT REALLY HAPPEN?

            During the postgame media conference, Boone was answering a question when he stopped and asked a rhetorical question he already knew the answer to.

            “We really blew a 19-point lead?” he said, looking over at Wright with a grimace. Wright responded with a wry smile: “And still won the game.”

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            TCU has been ranked for a program-record nine consecutive weeks and while the Horned Frogs might drop a few spots for the loss to Oklahoma State, they figure to make it 10 in a row, since they beat West Virginia earlier in the week.

            UP NEXT

            TCU: Will visit No. 7 Kansas State on Tuesday.

(AP) — Senior forward Kalib Boone scored a career-high 25 points and Oklahoma State blew a 19-point second-half lead before recovering to beat depleted No. 15 TCU 79-73 on Saturday.Caleb Asberry added 19 points and John-Michael Wright had 17 for Oklahoma State (14-9, 5-5 Big 12). The Cowboys have won three straight and five of six to move back into the conversation for a potential NCAA tournament berth.Emanuel Miller led TCU with 17 points and Shahada Wells had 14.“A hell of a Big 12 game,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton said. “It was a battle like we anticipated against a team who I think is certainly one of the top 20, if not higher, teams in the country, even without the preseason conference player of the year. They’re deep. They’re fast. They’re athletic. But our guys met the challenge today.”The Horned Frogs (17-6, 6-4) have struggled since their leading scorer, Mike Miles Jr., suffered a hyperextended right knee last Saturday early during a loss to Mississippi State. TCU also was minus injured big man Eddie Lampkin Jr.“We’ve got to guard better,” TCU coach Jamie Dixon said. “I thought we had worked on it a lot going into this game and we had a plan in place, but we didn’t get it done. Obviously, we were down a couple of guys, but they were down a guy, too. We were in a position to win the game, but we didn’t get it done and that’s on me.”Dixon received a technical foul in the final minute of the first half and the Horned Frogs trailed 43-29 at the break. Five quick points by Asberry to open the second half gave Oklahoma State its biggest lead at 48-29 with 18:49 left.An 20-3 run by TCU cut the deficit and Damion Baugh’s layup with 11:51 left pulled the Horned Frogs within 51-49 with 11:51 left. Oklahoma State answered with six straight points to quell the immediate threat.TCU eventually tied it at 59 on three free throws by Baugh with 5:41 left, then took its first lead 33 seconds later on two free throws by Miller.Wright took over down the stretch for the Cowboys. His 3-pointer with 3:38 left gave Oklahoma State the lead for good at 66-65 and started a 9-0 run that included a dunk by Boone that started with an over-the-shoulder save by Wright.“I’m proud of how they approached the game from a mental standpoint,” Boynton said. “You get up 19 points and you hope to be able to extend that ... but the reality is it just doesn’t happen very often in this league.""“They are all tournament-caliber teams and tournament-caliber teams find a way to respond and make sure that the game is at least going to be in the balance late. I thought our guys’ response to (TCU’s) response was obviously critical. We lost the lead there, then had to make some plays to win,” he said.TCU pulled within 72-70 with 1:33 left on a 3-pointer by Wells, but Boone scored a pair of close-in baskets, the latter with 29.1 seconds left, to make it 76-71 and after a TCU miss, Asberry sealed the win with two free throws with 19.3 seconds left.“Obviously, they are playing for their lives and so are we,” Dixon said. “Everybody is in this league.”Oklahoma State took a 12-0 lead as TCU missed its first eight shots and didn’t make a basket for 6 1/2 minutes. Oklahoma State eventually led 22-6 less than eight minutes in and the Cowboys’ lead never fell below double digits the rest of the half.BIG PICTURETCU: Miles can’t return fast enough for the Horned Frogs, who lost to Mississippi State in the game in which he was injured, then struggled to beat West Virginia at home before falling Saturday. The upcoming schedule for TCU looks daunting – No. 7 Kansas State, No. 11 Baylor and No. 13 Iowa State are its next three opponents, with the K-State and Iowa State games on the road.Oklahoma State: The Cowboys, now 2-6 this season against ranked foes, need all the big wins they can get as they look to position themselves for a NCAA tournament bid. To pick one up without one of their top players – Avery Anderson III – out with a wrist injury is a bonus.DID THAT REALLY HAPPEN?During the postgame media conference, Boone was answering a question when he stopped and asked a rhetorical question he already knew the answer to.“We really blew a 19-point lead?” he said, looking over at Wright with a grimace. Wright responded with a wry smile: “And still won the game.”POLL IMPLICATIONSTCU has been ranked for a program-record nine consecutive weeks and while the Horned Frogs might drop a few spots for the loss to Oklahoma State, they figure to make it 10 in a row, since they beat West Virginia earlier in the week.UP NEXTTCU: Will visit No. 7 Kansas State on Tuesday.Oklahoma State: Will host Texas Tech on Wednesday.

(AP) — Matt Cleveland drove the baseline for a layup with 1:32 left to allow Florida State to fend off a late, 17-2 run by Louisville to escape with an 81-78 victory on Saturday.

            After picking up their first Atlantic Coast Conference win of the season, a 68-58 win over Georgia Tech to give first-year coach Kenny Payne his first conference win, the Cardinals put on a spirited, 19-4 rally to come back from a 15-point deficit with 15:40 left to tie the game at 76 with 1:24 to play.

            Cleveland's layup put the Seminoles (8-16, 6-7) in front for good and Jalen Warley extended it with two free throws with 25 seconds left. After Sydney Curry scored to pull Louisville within 80-78, Darin Green Jr. hit the first of two free throws to set the final margin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800607,Hasty Pudding celebrates Coolidge as its Woman of the Year,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Dressed up as a dolphin and forced to give someone a lightning-fast makeover, “The White Lotus” actress Jennifer Coolidge was roasted Saturday before being honored as the 2023 Woman of the Year by Harvard University’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals.

            As the oldest theatrical organization in the nation and one of the oldest in the world, since 1951, Hasty Pudding Theatricals has bestowed this award annually on women “who have made lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment.”

            Coolidge, who saw a career resurgence following her Emmy-winning turn as Tanya McQuoid-Hunt in the acclaimed HBO series “The White Lotus,” headlined a parade through the streets of Cambridge Saturday afternoon. Dressed in a leopard print coat and donning a fluffy pink hat, she waved to the crowd that had come out despite unusually frigid temperatures.











            Coolidge, who also played Stifler’s sultry mom in the film “American Pie” and sage manicurist Paulette in the “Legally Blonde” movies, grew up in the Boston area. Her other film credits include roles in “Best In Show,” “A Mighty Wind” and “Shotgun Wedding,” and she has appeared in multiple television shows, including “Seinfeld,” “2 Broke Girls” and “Nip/Tuck.”

            “It's been very fun. I'm really having a blast,"" said Coolidge before she was presented with her Pudding Pot award. ”I got to meet all these young students who are so much smarter than me.""

            Coolidge later got emotional, recalling how her late father who went to Harvard would have loved to have witnessed this moment.

            “I've been so blown away that this experience is happening. I never saw it coming. It blows away any sort of movie or television show I have ever done,” she said. “Seriously, my dad went here. I wish he was here. His brothers went here and everything so it's a big deal.”

            Producers roasted Coolidge with several zingers about her career, including at one point suggesting they wondered whether she was chosen only after Reese Witherspoon dropped out. They went on to poke fun at her lack of serious roles and noted how she left Boston for New York where she made a splash “as an incompetent cocktail waitress.”

            “Patrons raved at your unpredictable movement patterns and your quote haunting rendition of happy birthday,” one of the producers, Sarah Mann, joked. Fellow producer Aidan Golub then noted how she waitressed with Sandra Bullock, “marking the first and last time that you would get the chance to work with an Oscar winner.”

            Coolidge was then made to judge a contest of four people doing impressions of her, choosing a man dressed in a pink dress who uttered the words from an iconic scene she did in “Legally Blonde."" And after noting how Coolidge recently said her dream role was to play a dolphin, producers dressed her in a dolphin outfit and asked her to sing in the style of a dolphin.

            She made a series of dolphin-like squeaks before shooting a water pistol at two people dressed as menacing sting rays — a scene similar to the one in second season of “White Lotus"" where she guns down several people on a boat. “These rays are trying to murder me,” she said.

            Previous winners of the Woman of the Year Award include Meryl Streep, Viola Davis and Debbie Reynolds.

            On Thursday, award-winning actor and bestselling author Bob Odenkirk was honored as the 2023 Man of the Year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800619,"Ohtani set for WBC in Japan, but Angels future uncertain","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Although Shohei Ohtani's long-term future with the Los Angeles Angels is decidedly uncertain as he heads into the final season under contract, the two-way superstar's plans for the spring are all set.

            Ohtani will make one start on the Cactus League mound this month for the Angels before he heads to Japan on March 1 for the World Baseball Classic, Halos general manager Perry Minasian said Saturday.

            Whatever Ohtani wants to do in the tournament is entirely up him and the Japanese team, since the Angels will stick to their long-standing policy of allowing him to do whatever he feels is best for his growth on his unique career path.











            “I am not worried about Shohei Ohtani,” Minasian said. ""He's been in Arizona for a while now. He's preparing for the season. He's doing everything he needs to do to be ready to go when the bell rings. He'll get the proper work in when he needs it. He's the least of my concerns.”

            Ohtani's future beyond 2023 might be the most of Minasian's concerns, although the GM isn't giving much insight into the Angels' hopes of retaining the player who won the 2021 AL MVP award and finished second in last season's vote after going 15-9 with a 2.33 ERA while also batting .273 with with 34 homers and 95 RBIs.

            Ohtani will make $30 million this season under his final year of team control. Angels fans are clamoring for their team to sign Ohtani to a long-term deal at any price, while fans from Boston to San Diego are salivating at the prospect of adding the majors' greatest two-way player.

            Minasian deftly avoided any definitive statements about the Angels' chances of keeping Ohtani beyond this summer.

            “Obviously, we love Shohei Ohtani,” Minasian said. “This whole organization would like nothing more than to see him here for a long, long time. ... We love the player. We love what he's about. He's somebody that we can envision here for a long, long time.”

            Speculation about the Angels' chances of signing Ohtani has fluctuated wildly since they completed their seventh consecutive losing season and eighth consecutive non-playoff season — both the worst droughts in the majors.

            At 28 as he heads into his sixth big league season, Ohtani has made it clear wants to play for a winner, and the Angels have not been winners since the middle of the previous decade. But aside from the usual optimism of a fresh season with new signings and the possibility of improved roster health, Orange County fans still have hope because of Ohtani's loyalty and the Angels' willingness to allow him to train and to play in any way he chooses.

            “There’s a respect level here, obviously,” Minasian said. “He chose to play here, and I think that was one of the reasons he chose to play here. We’ve been able to agree on two deals over the last two years, which is not easy to do. There’s a respect and trust level there that I don’t think will change. I think the relationship is outstanding.”

            Angels owner Arte Moreno explored a sale of the season throughout the winter before deciding last month that he will keep the team. Moreno's departure likely would have brought in a wealthy new owner capable of making a splash by paying top dollar to Ohtani amid a new commitment to winning, but Moreno is also capable of handing out lavish contracts — even if most of his biggest deals have gone wrong.

            Minasian obviously couldn't speculate on whether Moreno's retention of the team improved or hurt its chances of keeping Ohtani.

            “He's already invested in this club throughout his whole ownership,” Minasian said. “We've been top-10 in payroll for a long time. I don't see that changing. Knowing (Moreno) and knowing how much he wants to win, I wouldn't put anything out of the realm of possibility.”

            Minasian said first baseman Jared Walsh and pitchers Griffin Canning and Chris Rodriguez will be ready to go for an essentially normal spring training after missing much of 2022 due to injuries. The GM also confirmed the Angels are still looking for bullpen additions, and they haven't decided on the identity of their sixth starter in the rotation around Ohtani.

            AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Although Shohei Ohtani's long-term future with the Los Angeles Angels is decidedly uncertain as he heads into the final season under contract, the two-way superstar's plans for the spring are all set.Ohtani will make one start on the Cactus League mound this month for the Angels before he heads to Japan on March 1 for the World Baseball Classic, Halos general manager Perry Minasian said Saturday.Whatever Ohtani wants to do in the tournament is entirely up him and the Japanese team, since the Angels will stick to their long-standing policy of allowing him to do whatever he feels is best for his growth on his unique career path.“I am not worried about Shohei Ohtani,” Minasian said. ""He's been in Arizona for a while now. He's preparing for the season. He's doing everything he needs to do to be ready to go when the bell rings. He'll get the proper work in when he needs it. He's the least of my concerns.”Ohtani's future beyond 2023 might be the most of Minasian's concerns, although the GM isn't giving much insight into the Angels' hopes of retaining the player who won the 2021 AL MVP award and finished second in last season's vote after going 15-9 with a 2.33 ERA while also batting .273 with with 34 homers and 95 RBIs.Ohtani will make $30 million this season under his final year of team control. Angels fans are clamoring for their team to sign Ohtani to a long-term deal at any price, while fans from Boston to San Diego are salivating at the prospect of adding the majors' greatest two-way player.Minasian deftly avoided any definitive statements about the Angels' chances of keeping Ohtani beyond this summer.“Obviously, we love Shohei Ohtani,” Minasian said. “This whole organization would like nothing more than to see him here for a long, long time. ... We love the player. We love what he's about. He's somebody that we can envision here for a long, long time.”Speculation about the Angels' chances of signing Ohtani has fluctuated wildly since they completed their seventh consecutive losing season and eighth consecutive non-playoff season — both the worst droughts in the majors.At 28 as he heads into his sixth big league season, Ohtani has made it clear wants to play for a winner, and the Angels have not been winners since the middle of the previous decade. But aside from the usual optimism of a fresh season with new signings and the possibility of improved roster health, Orange County fans still have hope because of Ohtani's loyalty and the Angels' willingness to allow him to train and to play in any way he chooses.“There’s a respect level here, obviously,” Minasian said. “He chose to play here, and I think that was one of the reasons he chose to play here.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800622,6N: Van der Merwe surprises himself with stunning solo try,"LONDON (AP) — Duhan van der Merwe was in the game. And, then again, he was not in the game.

            Poor marking by the big Scotland winger allowed his slinky England opposite Max Malins to score his first test try in their Six Nations opener on Saturday at Twickenham.

            For most of the first half-hour, Van der Merwe was on the periphery of a kickfest.











            Then the ball came to him, courtesy of an England clearance kick caught by fellow wing Kyle Steyn just inside his half.

            Van der Merwe sized up the onrushing English from about 60 meters out and accelerated.

            He blew past center Joe Marchant on halfway, busted through Ollie Chessum's attempted arm trip and was in the clear.

            His swerve left Freddie Steward grasping at air on the England 22, then a wrong-footed Jack van Poortvliet could get only an arm on him.

            But Van der Merwe was slowed down. Alex Dombrandt tried to scrag the winger high but Van der Merwe fended him off to clear free again and finally plunged over the tryline untouched.

            He gave a quick uppercut for Scotland fans before he was enveloped by teammates amazed to have witnessed one of the great Six Nations tries.

            Up in the TV analysts' booth, former England coach Clive Woodward was going, “Wow, wow, wow.”

            “I just saw the space in front of me (and) managed to finish it off,"" Van der Merwe said. “When I got up I was quite surprised as well.”

            Scotland coach Gregor Townsend likened the stunning solo score to one of those seen in the 1990s video game named for New Zealand great Jonah Lomu.

            “It was incredible, wasn't it? It reminded me of when, for everybody of a certain age, you played Jonah Lomu Rugby and suddenly one person can go quicker,” Townsend said.

            “That first try was amazing, and one that gets the Scotland supporters going crazy in the stand and silences everyone else because you don't see tries like that very often.”

            Malins bagged a second try soon after but Van der Merwe had the last say. At the end of a sweeping move, he cut inside two defenders and carried Malins over the line for the match-winning try five minutes from the end of a classic contest that Scotland snatched 29-23.

            South Africa-born Van der Merwe made a try-scoring debut for Scotland in 2020, after qualifying on residency. He scored the only try in Scotland's historic 2021 win at Twickenham and has collected 16 in 24 tests. But his brilliant solo effort was the most special yet.

            “I'll take that one any time of the day,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800627,Josh Jacobs expects to begin talks with Raiders next week,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Josh Jacobs, who led the NFL in rushing yards this season, said he expects to begin speaking with Las Vegas Raiders management next week about a possible new contract.

            He could become a free agent after the Raiders declined last April to exercise his fifth-year option, and he responded by rushing for a career-high 1,653 yards as well as 12 touchdowns that tied his personal best.

            “We haven’t talked yet, so I ain't feel disrespected in any type of way yet,” Jacobs said Saturday at the Pro Bowl Games media day.











            The Raiders could place the franchise tag on Jacobs, which would lock him in for a year for a salary $10.1 million, according to overthecap.com. His base salary this season was $2.1 million and his cap hit was $3.8 million.

            Jacobs let it be know such a move wouldn't go over well, but reiterated his preference to stay in Las Vegas. Many factors would go into that, including money, but so would the Raiders' ability to win.

            Jacobs said he was keeping an eye on the quarterback situation after the Raiders cut ties with nine-year veteran Derek Carr.

            “I kind of know where their head is at,” Jacobs said of the QB situation. “I’m not going to speak on what they're leaning to, but I know there are three that they're looking at.""

            Jacobs was asked if that included a certain recently retired quarterback. There was speculation the Raiders were interested in Tom Brady before he called it a career Wednesday.

            “I don't know nothing about nothing,” a feigning Jacobs said. “I feel like that was a contingency plan.""

            Regardless of what happens, Jacobs said he probably would keep his Las Vegas home “for tax purposes.” Nevada has no state income tax.

            He said players from other teams at the Pro Bowl events have tried to influence him to go elsewhere, and Jacobs has done his part to lure players to Las Vegas.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLLAS VEGAS (AP) — Josh Jacobs, who led the NFL in rushing yards this season, said he expects to begin speaking with Las Vegas Raiders management next week about a possible new contract.He could become a free agent after the Raiders declined last April to exercise his fifth-year option, and he responded by rushing for a career-high 1,653 yards as well as 12 touchdowns that tied his personal best.“We haven’t talked yet, so I ain't feel disrespected in any type of way yet,” Jacobs said Saturday at the Pro Bowl Games media day.The Raiders could place the franchise tag on Jacobs, which would lock him in for a year for a salary $10.1 million, according to overthecap.com. His base salary this season was $2.1 million and his cap hit was $3.8 million.Jacobs let it be know such a move wouldn't go over well, but reiterated his preference to stay in Las Vegas. Many factors would go into that, including money, but so would the Raiders' ability to win.Jacobs said he was keeping an eye on the quarterback situation after the Raiders cut ties with nine-year veteran Derek Carr.“I kind of know where their head is at,” Jacobs said of the QB situation. “I’m not going to speak on what they're leaning to, but I know there are three that they're looking at.""Jacobs was asked if that included a certain recently retired quarterback. There was speculation the Raiders were interested in Tom Brady before he called it a career Wednesday.“I don't know nothing about nothing,” a feigning Jacobs said. “I feel like that was a contingency plan.""Regardless of what happens, Jacobs said he probably would keep his Las Vegas home “for tax purposes.” Nevada has no state income tax.He said players from other teams at the Pro Bowl events have tried to influence him to go elsewhere, and Jacobs has done his part to lure players to Las Vegas.“The thing about Vegas is everybody wants to come here,” Jacobs said. “So hopefully we can figure it out.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/05,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800637,MATCHDAY: Man City at Spurs; Milan derby; Bayern seeks win,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Sunday:

            ENGLAND

            Manchester City can capitalize on Arsenal's surprise 1-0 loss to Everton when it travels to Tottenham. A win for the Premier League champion would close the gap on leader Arsenal to two points. But the Gunners have a game in hand. Nottingham Forest also hosts Leeds in a contest between teams fighting to avoid relegation.











            ITALY

            AC Milan will be hoping to end a woeful run of form when it faces Inter Milan in the derby della Madonnina. Milan is without a win in its past six matches and has conceded 12 goals in its past three games culminating in an embarrassing 5-2 loss at home to lowly Sassuolo. Milan has dropped to fifth and Inter has replaced it in second spot, albeit just two points above the Rossoneri. Inter is still 13 points behind runaway leader Napoli which visits relegation-threatened Spezia. Torino hosts Udinese with both teams harboring hopes of qualifying for Europe. Fiorentina and Bologna will be hoping to take advantage of any slip up as they look to boost their own chances of reaching the Europa Conference League.

            SPAIN

            Real Madrid visits Mallorca without Karim Benzema after the Ballon d’Or holder was dropped due to a leg injury that coach Carlo Ancelotti calls “mild.” Benzema leads Madrid with 13 goals. Defender Éder Militão is also out due to a leg injury. Madrid is in second place, five points behind Barcelona. After the Mallorca match, Madrid will play in the Club World Cup semifinals in Morocco. Xavi Hernández’s Barcelona is on a nine-game winning streak across all competitions going into a game with struggling visitor Sevilla. Third-placed Real Sociedad needs to beat Valladolid to stay in striking distance of the top two. Valencia is at Girona on a five-round winless slump that cost Gennaro Gattuso his coaching job.

            GERMANY

            Bayern Munich visits Wolfsburg where the 10-time defending champion is hoping for its first Bundesliga win of the year after three straight 1-1 draws. Bayern appeared to shake off its post-break rustiness with a 4-0 win at Mainz in the German Cup on Wednesday, but Wolfsburg started the year with big wins over Freiburg and Hertha Berlin before last weekend’s surprise loss at Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg coach Niko Kovac says his ex-club remains the favorite for the title. Also, relegation-threatened Stuttgart hosts Bremen. 

            FRANCE

            Marseille is unbeaten in nine games but needs to win at home to Nice to stay five points behind leader Paris Saint-Germain ahead of their league clash this month. Marseille fans could get a first glimpse of club-record signing Vitinha, a forward who joined from Portuguese side Braga for 32 million euros. Coach Igor Tudor could pair him with former France playmaker Dimitri Payet. Marseille can ill afford a slip up against third-placed Lens only one point behind ahead of its game at Brest.

A win for the Premier League champion would close the gap on leader Arsenal to two points. But the Gunners have a game in hand. Nottingham Forest also hosts Leeds in a contest between teams fighting to avoid relegation.ITALYAC Milan will be hoping to end a woeful run of form when it faces Inter Milan in the derby della Madonnina. Milan is without a win in its past six matches and has conceded 12 goals in its past three games culminating in an embarrassing 5-2 loss at home to lowly Sassuolo. Milan has dropped to fifth and Inter has replaced it in second spot, albeit just two points above the Rossoneri. Inter is still 13 points behind runaway leader Napoli which visits relegation-threatened Spezia. Torino hosts Udinese with both teams harboring hopes of qualifying for Europe. Fiorentina and Bologna will be hoping to take advantage of any slip up as they look to boost their own chances of reaching the Europa Conference League.SPAINReal Madrid visits Mallorca without Karim Benzema after the Ballon d’Or holder was dropped due to a leg injury that coach Carlo Ancelotti calls “mild.” Benzema leads Madrid with 13 goals. Defender Éder Militão is also out due to a leg injury. Madrid is in second place, five points behind Barcelona. After the Mallorca match, Madrid will play in the Club World Cup semifinals in Morocco. Xavi Hernández’s Barcelona is on a nine-game winning streak across all competitions going into a game with struggling visitor Sevilla. Third-placed Real Sociedad needs to beat Valladolid to stay in striking distance of the top two. Valencia is at Girona on a five-round winless slump that cost Gennaro Gattuso his coaching job.GERMANYBayern Munich visits Wolfsburg where the 10-time defending champion is hoping for its first Bundesliga win of the year after three straight 1-1 draws. Bayern appeared to shake off its post-break rustiness with a 4-0 win at Mainz in the German Cup on Wednesday, but Wolfsburg started the year with big wins over Freiburg and Hertha Berlin before last weekend’s surprise loss at Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg coach Niko Kovac says his ex-club remains the favorite for the title. Also, relegation-threatened Stuttgart hosts Bremen.FRANCEMarseille is unbeaten in nine games but needs to win at home to Nice to stay five points behind leader Paris Saint-Germain ahead of their league clash this month. Marseille fans could get a first glimpse of club-record signing Vitinha, a forward who joined from Portuguese side Braga for 32 million euros. Coach Igor Tudor could pair him with former France playmaker Dimitri Payet. Marseille can ill afford a slip up against third-placed Lens only one point behind ahead of its game at Brest.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800654,Suspended Padres star Tatis plans on 'redeeming myself',"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The laugh and smile are starting to return. So, too, is the fan adulation for Fernando Tatis Jr., at least in San Diego.

            Still serving an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug, the superstar was warmly received at FanFest on Saturday, when thousands of fans jammed Petco Park for a preview of the most eagerly anticipated season in Padres history.

            Tatis received sustained applause when he was introduced before a panel discussion on a grassy knoll just beyond center field that also included star teammates Manny Machado, Juan Soto and the newly signed Xander Bogaerts.











            “I love you San Diego. … I’m not going to leave here for a really long time,” Tatis told the crowd, to more applause. 

            This season will be a redemption tour for Tatis, one of baseball’s biggest stars whose entire 2022 season was wiped out by a wrist injury and then the suspension. He was on the cusp of returning from surgery on his left wrist when he was suspended by MLB on Aug. 12. He missed the Padres’ stirring run to the NL Championship Series, where they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies. 

            “I’ve missed it a lot,” Tatis said during a news conference earlier in the day. “I mean, I missed a year of it. I’m not looking forward to missing anymore. It just feels great to be out there again.”

            Tatis said the toughest part was missing the postseason. The Padres eliminated the 101-win New York Mets in the wild-card round before beating their biggest rival, the 111-win Los Angeles Dodgers, to reach the NLCS for the first time since 1998. 

            “It has given me a lot of fuel, trust me,” Tatis said. “I don’t want to put much words into it, I more want to prove myself on the field, just get back to the field with my boys. I definitely missed that fire, being in the jungle with them. It was definitely a dagger to my heart and now I’m looking forward to being on that front line.”

            Tatis blamed his positive PED test on a cream he said he took for ringworm. He was already drawing scrutiny after breaking his left wrist in December 2021, reportedly in a motorcycle accident in his native Dominican Republic that required surgery in March. After his suspension was announced, Tatis had surgery on his troublesome left shoulder.

            Tatis said he learned from all that happened to him in the last year. “I’m really looking forward to redeeming myself,” he said.

            He’s been taking batting practice, catching flyballs and fielding grounders for about a month. He expects to be a full participant at spring training and be ready when he’s eligible to rejoin the active roster on April 20. 

            Tatis said his shoulder “feels really good. Everything that we have been doing feels back to normal. I’m as close to 100% as I’ve been in the last two years. It feels like it was the perfect time to do it and I’m really glad we decided to get it out of the way.”

            When Tatis returns, it won’t be at shortstop. The Padres signed Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year contract in early December. Tatis will likely play in the outfield, although which position hasn’t been determined. 

            “I’ve got to talk to my manager,” he said with a laugh. “But I’m open. I feel this is a great team we have, it’s a great roster. I feel everybody’s on the same page and that page is winning. So, whatever it takes we’re going to do it.”

            Asked about the reaction he’s sure to get on the road, he said: “I feel like I’ve seen everything, what this game can bring you, what the fans can bring you, and I’m definitely looking forward to that challenge. It’s going to be fun and it’s going to be one of the most emotional years, I feel like, in my career. I’m looking to embrace it and looking to what’s going to come.”

            Tatis, who plays with a swagger, was an All-Star in 2021.

            “He’s a big part of this team, a big part of this organization, and we’re going to be with him the whole way,” said Machado, who finished second in NL MVP voting. “To have him back healthy, to have him back in that lineup and have him do the things that he’s capable of doing, is huge. 

            “He was a big, big part of our lineup in the past and he’s going to be a big part of the lineup this year for us. I know he’s going to have a monster year and he’s going to take us to the promised land,” Machado said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800655,"Ryland, Haener lead National team's 27-10 Senior Bowl win","MOBILE, Ala. (AP) — Maryland's Chris Ryland kicked four field goals and Fresno State quarterback Jake Haener passed for 139 yards and a touchdown to lead the National team to a 27-10 victory over the American team in the Senior Bowl on Saturday.

            Haener, named the game's MVP, delivered a 44-yard touchdown pass to Stanford receiver Michael Wilson in the fourth quarter. He thrived on a short-handed quarterback situation for the team, completing 12 of 19 passes after setting a Fresno State career record with a 68.1% completion rate.

            ""I just wanted to come out here and get a win with the guys and cap off a really good week,” Haener told NFL Network. “Just have a really good week and get the win.











            “We found a way to get the win and that was fun.”

            Haener missed four games with an ankle injury this season but returned to help finish off a nine-game winning streak for the Bulldogs. Like the other quarterbacks in the game, he's trying to improve on mid- to- late-round draft projections.

            “I love proving the doubters wrong,” Haener said. “I love the motivation. I love the passion that it brings me. Keep coming with it, man.”

            The American team's biggest play came early in the fourth when Virginia's Anthony Johnson Jr. returned an interception 37 yards for a touchdown. Johnson was wearing the No. 15 jersey in honor of wide receiver Devin Chandler, who was among three Cavaliers players shot and killed in November, along with Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry.

            Cunningham was hit as he threw and appeared to land on his right arm, briefly heading toward the locker room with a strained shoulder. He returned to the sidelines, but not the game.

            BYU quarterback Jaren Hall didn’t play in the game for the National team. It wasn’t immediately known why, but Hall missed the New Mexico Bowl with an ankle injury. He did participate in practices when quarterbacks were off-limits for contact. 

            The American team did get another big defensive play to stay alive with a fourth-down, fourth-quarter sack by Florida A&M's Isaiah Land, the 2021 Buck Buchanan winner as the top player in FCS after leading the nation with 19 sacks.

            Cunningham hit Purdue tight end Payne Durham just short of the left pylon late in the first half. Then he dropped the snap, picked up the ball and rushed for a 1-yard touchdown. Cunningham passed for 70 touchdowns and ran for 47 at Louisville following in the footsteps of friend and Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson.

            But he attempted only five passes in the Senior Bowl, completing three for 49 yards. Northwestern's Evan Hull ran 10 times for a game-high 74 yards.

            Ryland's four field goals included a 41-yarder on the final play of the first half for a 17-3 lead. He did miss a 52-yard attempt early in the third quarter.

            TCU's Max Duggan, the Heisman Trophy runner-up, completed 4 of 9 passes for 26 yards for the American team. Duggan overthrew Princeton's Andrei Iosivas in the end zone on a fourth-down play that was his best chance for a touchdown.

            Shepherd College quarterback Tyson Bagent, whose 159 career touchdown passes is an NCAA all-division record, completed 17 of 22 passes for 138 yards before throwing a last-minute interception near the goal line.

            Bagent is trying to become the first Division II quarterback drafted since the Rams picked Keith Null in the sixth round in 2009 after passing for more than 17,000 yards.

            Houston's Clayton Tune was 9-of-12 passing for 70 yards.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800657,North Macedonia honors hero also claimed by Bulgaria,"SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia on Saturday marked the birthday of a 19th century revolutionary amid tight security in the capital of Skopje due to fears of clashes between opposing nationalist groups from North Macedonia and Bulgaria.

            Both countries have claims on the historic figure, Gotse Delchev, who opposed Ottoman rule in the Balkans that ended in the early 20th century. The commemoration marks 151 years since the birth. 

            North Macedonia’s authorities say the commemoration is a “high security risk.”











            Police blocked streets, set up metal fences and conducted thorough checks in the area around the 16th century Orthodox Church “Sveti Spas” in downtown Skopje, where Delchev is buried.

            Helicopters and drones buzzed overhead, and inspections were carried out at border crossings between North Macedonia and Bulgaria. Tensions rose as hundreds of Bulgarians were forced to wait for a couple of hours at Deve Bair border crossing on the Macedonian side. Border officials blamed a computer system crash for the delay.

            Police said in a statement that three Bulgarians have been detained for “disturbing the public order.” 

            Bulgarian Interior minister Ivan Demerdzhiev, who led the official delegation, called the measures adopted by Macedonian police draconian.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800659,"No. 19 Florida Atlantic bounces back, beats Charlotte 67-52","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Vladislav Goldin and No. 19 Florida Atlantic are hoping Saturday marked the start of another long win streak that will carry them deep into the postseason.

            Goldin had 15 points and the Owls pulled away in the second half for a 67-52 victory over Charlotte, just two days after their 20-game win streak was snapped following a road loss at UAB.

            Alijah Martin added 11 points and Brandon Weatherspoon had 10 for the Owls (22-2, 12-1 Conference USA), who outscored Charlotte 37-21 in the second half.











            FAU had put together a school-record 20 straight wins — a streak dating back to a Nov. 14 win at Florida — before getting away from their strength against UAB, which is moving the ball and creating shots on offense. That all changed against Charlotte where unselfish passes led to open 3s and 13 assisted baskets.

            FAU coach Dusty May said he doesn't believe the streak added any pressure to his players, but added there may be some good that comes from the loss.

            “The benefit is now they aren't going to get so much chatter and love on social media,” May said. “They aren't going to get the external love and that will allow us to focus on getting better. When you are told how great you are for a long time, young guys have a tendency to believe it.”

            Brice Williams led Charlotte (13-10, 4-8) with 14 points.

            The Owls built a 10-point lead in the first half before the 49ers rallied to take a 31-30 lead at the break with Lu'Cye Patterson scoring on a spin move on the low block and converting the ensuing free throw for a three-point play.

            But FAU owned the second half.

            The Owls opened with an 20-4 run, finding success pounding the ball inside to 7-foot-1 Goldin, who scored four straight points and helped open driving lanes and spot up 3s for his teammates. With Charlotte's 6-11 center Aly Khalifa out for a second straight game due to what coach Ron Sanchez deemed “health and safety protocols,” the 49ers lacked the height to stop Goldin from dominating the paint. 

            Bryan Greenlee and Michael Forrest took advantage of Charlotte’s collapsing defense, knocking down back-to-back 3-pointers to help put the Owls up by 15 with 10 minutes remaining.

            “Those baskets down low by Vlad probably caused them to shrink in a little more and then Greenlee gets a couple of 3s, so our shooters were able to shake loose and make some baskets,” May said.

            Greenlee came open off a screen to hit another 3 to push the lead to 17 with 4 1/2 minutes remaining leaving little doubt about the outcome, particularly with Charlotte struggling to get much going on the offensive end — often using the entire shot clock before settling for low percentage shots.

            FAU was 9 of 20 from 3-point range.

            “We talked in the locker room about how we can be better in the second half because we didn't play how we were supposed to play in the first half,"" Goldin said. ""That was one of the things we talked about is getting the ball into the post.”

            Unlike in the previous meeting where Charlotte was able to cut a 20-point deficit to two before ultimately losing 71-67, there would be no frantic rally. 

            “They played a phenomenal second half, both offensively and defensively,” Sanchez said. “They are a top 20 team in the country for a reason and they showed that today. They are so balanced in their scoring.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            Florida Atlantic: It was a good second half for the Owls, who shot 61% from the field after the break, while holding the 49ers to 31.8% shooting. 

            Charlotte: The 49ers entered the game 4-7 in conference play, but have been competitive with the last six defeats by four points or less. They didn't put up a big fight in the second half without Khalifa's inside presence. ""He's so important to what we do,"" Sanchez said.

            Graham sank 8 of 10 shots from the floor for the Razorbacks (16-7, 5-5 Southeastern Conference), who earned their first true road win of the season. Davonte Davis hit four 3-pointers and scored 15. Anthony Black totaled 13 points six rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Ricky Council IV scored 10.

            Josh Gray scored a career-high 20 points — 11 more than his previous best — for the Gamecocks (8-15, 1-9), who have lost seven straight. Gray matched his career best with 14 rebounds — set last time out in a loss to Mississippi State. Meechie Johnson also scored 20, sinking 5 of 8 shots from 3-point range. Hayden Brown added 10 points. Five players did all the scoring for the Gamecocks.











            Graham had 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting and Davis buried a 3-pointer with 18 seconds left to send the Razorbacks into halftime with a 36-27 lead. Arkansas shot 57.7% from the floor before intermission (15 of 26). 

            The Razorbacks took their biggest lead at 47-35 on a jumper by Council with 14:05 left to play. Johnson sandwiched two 3-pointers around a Jacobi Wright layup — off a steal by Johnson — to pull the Gamecocks within 58-57 at the 5:09 mark. Gray followed with two free throws and South Carolina went ahead for the first time since leading 10-9. 

            Arkansas regained the lead with 2:53 remaining on two free throws from Black after he grabbed an offensive rebound and was fouled by Gray. Gray scored twice on dunks, but Council and Black answered with layups and the Razorbacks led 64-63 with 1:21 to go.

            Johnson missed a 3-pointer for South Carolina, but Davis missed the front end of a 1-and-1 at the other end and Gray grabbed the rebound with 19 seconds left. Hayden Brown couldn't connect on a layup coming out of a Gamecocks' timeout and Black sank the first of two free throws for a 65-63 lead. Gray missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800664,"Clowney, Griffen lead No. 4 Alabama to hold off LSU 79-69","BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Noah Clowney and Rylan Griffen led a balanced scoring attack with 14 points each to carry No. 4 Alabama to a 79-69 victory over LSU on Saturday.

            Nimari Burnett and Mark Sears each had 13 points and Brandon Miller had 11 for the Crimson Tide (20-3, 10-0 Southeastern Conference).

            The Tigers (12-11, 1-9) have lost 10 straight. Derek Fountain led LSU with a career-high 26 points. Cam Hayes came off the bench and scored 15 points. Tigers leading scorer KJ Williams was held to eight points, nine below his season average.











            “It was definitely not one of our better wins,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said. “Sometimes when you’re competing for a championship, you have to go on the road and win games that aren’t pretty.”

            Alabama did not take control of the game until midway through the second half. Holding a two-point advantage at the 13-minute mark of the second half, the Crimson Tide went on a 19-9 run over the next six minutes.

            Alabama’s long-range shooting carried it during this run. Both Griffen and Sears made two 3-pointers and Clowney made one 3-pointer in this stretch. Sears’ second 3-pointer gave the Crimson Tide a 75-63 lead with 7:19 remaining.

            Alabama did not finish strong, going more than six minutes without a point. The Crimson Tide’s lead was down to six points at 75-69 entering the final minute. Both Sears and Miller made two free throws in the last 45 seconds.

            “Our defense was nowhere close to where we’d like it to be,” Oats said. “Late in the game, we got some stops when we needed to. Clowney really stepped up for us big late. We’re at 10-0 (in the SEC) and we’ve got a tough week ahead of us, a couple of tough weeks ahead of us to be honest with you.”

            LSU stayed within striking distance of Alabama throughout the first half. On two occasions in the first 12 minutes, the Crimson Tide went ahead by nine points – the last at 29-20 on a 3-pointer by Miller.

            Sparked by a technical foul on Oats, the Tigers reduced their deficit to three points at 33-30 after Williams made two free throws with 4:23 before halftime. The Crimson Tide then went on an 11-4 run to take a double-digit lead in the final minute.

            “We saw some improvement from our team,” LSU coach Matt McMahon said. “Alabama just has so much firepower and they can really score it at a high level. The last seven minutes of the game, both teams struggled to score. We got stops, but we were not able to convert those into points.”

            PICKING UP THE SLACK

            Miller and Sears, Alabama’s top two scorers, had subpar offensive games. Miller, who is averaging 19 points a game, finished with 11. Miller missed eight of his 11 field goal attempts. Sears ended with 13 points, just one below his season average, thanks to a flurry of points over the last eight minutes. Clowney, Griffen and Burnett stepped up on the offensive end of the floor. The trio made 15 of their 26 field goal attempts.

            BIG PICTURE

            Alabama: The Crimson Tide, which has won its first ten conference games for just the third time in school history, will enter the final four weeks of the SEC schedule with a two-game lead. But the schedule will become more challenging with two games against Auburn and games against both Tennessee and Texas A&M down the stretch. Three of those four games will be on the road. 

            LSU: The Tigers’ losing streak has now reached 10 games, with nine of the defeats coming against SEC opponents. All but one of LSU’s conference losses have come against teams who began Saturday with a winning league record.

Tigers leading scorer KJ Williams was held to eight points, nine below his season average.“It was definitely not one of our better wins,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said. “Sometimes when you’re competing for a championship, you have to go on the road and win games that aren’t pretty.”Alabama did not take control of the game until midway through the second half. Holding a two-point advantage at the 13-minute mark of the second half, the Crimson Tide went on a 19-9 run over the next six minutes.Alabama’s long-range shooting carried it during this run. Both Griffen and Sears made two 3-pointers and Clowney made one 3-pointer in this stretch. Sears’ second 3-pointer gave the Crimson Tide a 75-63 lead with 7:19 remaining.Alabama did not finish strong, going more than six minutes without a point. The Crimson Tide’s lead was down to six points at 75-69 entering the final minute. Both Sears and Miller made two free throws in the last 45 seconds.“Our defense was nowhere close to where we’d like it to be,” Oats said. “Late in the game, we got some stops when we needed to. Clowney really stepped up for us big late. We’re at 10-0 (in the SEC) and we’ve got a tough week ahead of us, a couple of tough weeks ahead of us to be honest with you.”LSU stayed within striking distance of Alabama throughout the first half. On two occasions in the first 12 minutes, the Crimson Tide went ahead by nine points – the last at 29-20 on a 3-pointer by Miller.Sparked by a technical foul on Oats, the Tigers reduced their deficit to three points at 33-30 after Williams made two free throws with 4:23 before halftime. The Crimson Tide then went on an 11-4 run to take a double-digit lead in the final minute.“We saw some improvement from our team,” LSU coach Matt McMahon said. “Alabama just has so much firepower and they can really score it at a high level. The last seven minutes of the game, both teams struggled to score. We got stops, but we were not able to convert those into points.”PICKING UP THE SLACKMiller and Sears, Alabama’s top two scorers, had subpar offensive games. Miller, who is averaging 19 points a game, finished with 11. Miller missed eight of his 11 field goal attempts. Sears ended with 13 points, just one below his season average, thanks to a flurry of points over the last eight minutes. Clowney, Griffen and Burnett stepped up on the offensive end of the floor. The trio made 15 of their 26 field goal attempts.BIG PICTUREAlabama: The Crimson Tide, which has won its first ten conference games for just the third time in school history, will enter the final four weeks of the SEC schedule with a two-game lead. But the schedule will become more challenging with two games against Auburn and games against both Tennessee and Texas A&M down the stretch. Three of those four games will be on the road.LSU: The Tigers’ losing streak has now reached 10 games, with nine of the defeats coming against SEC opponents. All but one of LSU’s conference losses have come against teams who began Saturday with a winning league record.UP NEXTAlabama returns home to play Florida on Wednesday night.LSU plays at Mississippi State on Wednesday night.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/05,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800666,Rivals Crosby and Ovechkin relish being All-Star teammates,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin have played dozens of regular-season and playoff games against each other since breaking into the NHL together in 2005.

            The longtime rivals and respective captains of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals have also shared the ice at All-Star Games before. But with each superstar in his mid-30s, they know this trip could be their last together.

            They took advantage of it, with Ovechkin setting up Crosby for two goals Saturday in the lone game of the All-Star 3-on-3 tournament their Metropolitan Division team got to play. 











            “I think we have fun to play together, not against each other,” Ovechkin said, flashing his gap-toothed smile. ""Right now, we was on the same team, and it was pretty special, pretty good moment.”

            Crosby, who also had the secondary assist on Ovechkin's goal, did not expect to get the puck back. That's not unreasonable given Ovechkin has built a career on scoring and is only 82 goals back of Wayne Gretzky's NHL career record. 

            “I was thinking I just did my job: gave it to him,” said Crosby, whose career numbers are so close to Ovechkin's that he has just five more points overall. ""I thought he was just going finish it, but he was kind enough to send me a couple back. We had some nice goals there.”

            Not enough to win the 3-on-3 semifinal against the Atlantic, which beat the Central in the final. Ovechkin lamented not scoring more and took some jabs at his goalie teammates for a day: fellow Russians Igor Shesterkin of the New York Rangers and Ilya Sorokin of the Islanders.

            “Obviously goalie could play better,” Ovechkin said.

            Crosby and Ovechkin being together at All-Star weekend for the first time since 2018 was one of the themes of the weekend, given how they shared the stage as faces of the NHL for much of their careers. But they don't want this to be a Sid and Ovi swan song and could do this again as soon as next year when the festivities are in Toronto.

            “You try to go out there have fun and stay in the moment,” Crosby said. “Hopefully, it’s not our last one. That’s the best way to approach it.”

            HOMETOWN HEROICS

            The introductions for Aleksander Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk were saved for last.

            And of course, the two Florida Panthers stars, representing the Atlantic Division, delivered in their home arena. 

            “We play regular-season and playoff games here, but with this event, it’s even more special to be here representing the Florida Panthers,” Barkov said.

            Tkachuk was clearly comfortable playing in the same arena where has amassed 66 points (sixth in the NHL) this season with the Panthers. He was named All-Star MVP after his seven points (four goals, three assists) Saturday, including a goal and an assist in the Atlantic Division’s 7-5 win over the Central Division to take the All-Star game title. 

            “To be honest, I really didn’t care about anything other than just representing my team,” Tkachuk said, “and it’s a big honor to be one of the representatives, along with Barky, to be the host city. Without everybody saying it, it kind of revolves around us a little bit with having the home crowd on our side and doing the big skills and starting the game having the fans basically just cheering for us.”

            Tkachuk had a hat trick and a pair of assists in the Atlantic squad’s semifinal game against the Metropolitan division — tying a single-game points record for the 3-on-3 All-Star format. Two of those goals were assisted by his Panthers teammate to give their squad a win 10-6 and advance to face the Central division the final.

            By the time Barkov and Tkachuk came out for the All-Star game final, “Let’s go Panthers!” cheers were being belted throughout FLA Live Arena.

            Barkov, the beloved Panther in his 10th season, has 14 goals this year and 33 assists. He has 234 career goals and 600 points.

            BROTHERLY LOVE

            Brothers Matthew Tkachuk and Brady Tkachuk have played against each other plenty over the years. But with both players starting for the Atlantic division, they got to experience playing together as the 11th set of brothers to be All-Star teammates.

            The brothers each had a goal in Saturday’s semifinal game between the Atlantic and Metropolitan divisions. And Brady assisted on his brother’s goal in the final against the Central division.

            “We’ve always dreamt of playing with each other one way or the other,"" Matthew Tkachuk said. ""We thought that the best chance would be a Team USA thing at one point because I was in the West forever and he was in the Atlantic, so we never really thought this was a possibility.""

            Matthew, drafted in 2016 by the Calgary Flames, is a two-time All-Star with 177 career goals and 448 points. 

            Brady, the younger Tkachuk sibling, was drafted in 2018 by the Ottawa Senators and has 110 career goals and 243 points.

            Both were All-Stars back in 2020 in their hometown St. Louis. Brady represented the Atlantic division, while Matthew represented the Pacific squad. 

            WEATHER WOES

            It was 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 Celsius) outside FLA Live Arena when the All-Star 3 on-3 tournament started — more than 50 degrees warmer than 2024 host Toronto. That doesn’t mean this year’s event didn’t have a weather issue.

            The NHL All-Star Beach Festival — which had areas where fans could test their hockey skills, get a photo with the Stanley Cup and check out a Hockey Hall of Fame exhibit, among other things — couldn’t open on Saturday.

            Rain in the morning delayed the opening on Fort Lauderdale Beach, and then 40 mph (64 kilometers per hour) wind gusts later in the day forced the NHL into keeping it closed and calling off a watch party for the All-Star Game.

            It was open Thursday and Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800667,"Bishop helps No. 10 Texas rally past No. 7 K-State, 69-66","MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Christian Bishop was as frustrated as anyone in a Texas jersey in the first half Saturday. He'd been held without a point by Kansas State and, not surprisingly, the No. 10 Longhorns were facing a double-digit deficit on the road.

            Maybe that's why he punctuated every bucket in the second half with a fist pump.

            Bishop poured in 14 points after the break to lead the Longhorns' comeback, including the go-ahead lay-in with 37 seconds to go, and the new Big 12 leaders held on for a 69-66 victory over the No. 7 Wildcats on Saturday.











            “Christian’s been working really hard over the last couple of games to get him back to the level he was playing four or five games ago,” interim Texas coach Rodney Terry said. “He really came out and rebounded and gave our team an incredible lift the way he played the second half.”

            Red-hot guard Sir'Jabari Rice also had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Longhorns, and it was his two free throws with nine seconds left that forced the Wildcats into needing a 3-pointer to send the game to overtime. 

            After a quick timeout, the Wildcats' Ismael Massoud got an open look from the wing but came up well short of the basket, allowing the Longhorns to hold on for their fifth win over a Top 25 team this season.

            Tyrese Hunter and Marcus Carr added 10 points apiece for Texas (19-4, 8-2), which took over sole possession of first place in the rough-and-tumble Big 12 by avenging its overtime loss to the Wildcats (18-5, 6-4) early last month.

            “Our league, we don't have any bad teams,” Terry said. “To come in on a home court against a top-10 team and have this kind of performance, I'll stack it up with one of the best wins I've been part of in 30 years of coaching.”

            Keyontae Johnson struggled through foul trouble but still had 16 points to lead the Wildcats, who have lost back-to-back games for the first time this season. Desi Sills scored 11 points and Markquis Nowell had 10, but he also had six turnovers, including one with less than a minute to go and Kansas State down by one.

            “I don't want to wash this one. I want to live with this one for 36 hours,” Wildcats coach Jerome Tang said. “Everybody in our arena did our job except the coaches and players on the floor.”

            Kansas State and Texas played one of the most entertaining games of the season in Austin, when they went bucket-for-bucket through regulation and into overtime. The Wildcats eventually escaped with a 116-103 victory.

            Early on Saturday, Texas looked as if it would struggle to score half as much.

            With the Wildcats clamping down on the perimeter, the Longhorns kept throwing the ball away, and at one point had seven turnovers against just five made shots. They also went a stretch of more than 7 minutes with just one field goal.

            Kansas State took advantage of their offensive malaise.

            Despite the sure-handed Nowell's turnover trouble, and leading scorer Johnson picking up his third foul with 5 1/2 minutes left in the half, the Wildcats steadily built a lead. It reached as many as 14 before Texas made three free throws in the final second to get within 36-25 heading to the locker room.

            It was the spark the Longhorns needed: They made their first six shots of the second half, and their run spanning the break eventually reached 17-4 while getting them within 40-39 with 15 minutes left in the game.

            “There were points in the second half we did get rushed,” Nowell said, “and it led to turnovers and fast-break points.”

            Rice's 3-pointer a few minutes later gave Texas its first lead since the opening minutes. And when the Wildcats went on a nearly 5-minute scoring drought, Bishop began to assert control, the Creighton transfer scoring 11 points over a 6-minute stretch and punctuating each of them with a roar and a fist pump.

            Just like their first meeting Jan. 3, though, the rematch Saturday was destined to go down to the wire.

            “There's no blowouts in our league,” Tang said.

            BIG PICTURE

            Texas could do nothing right in the first half and nothing wrong in the second, shooting 57% from the floor over the final 20 minutes. Most of the success came in the paint; the Longhorns were just 4 of 16 from the 3-point arc.

            Kansas State couldn't overcome 19 turnovers, including six by Nowell, who had 36 points, nine assists and eight rebounds when the teams met in Austin. He had just six rebounds and three assists on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800668,Newgate wins Robert Lewis Stakes; Baffert runs 1-2-3-4,"ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) — Newgate won the $200,000 Robert B. Lewis Stakes by a neck on Saturday, with Bob Baffert as the trainer of all four horses in the Kentucky Derby prep race at Santa Anita. 

            Ridden by Frankie Dettori, Newgate ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:43.11 and paid $4 and $2.60 as the even-money favorite. There was no show wagering because of the field size.

            Hard to Figure returned $5.20 at 12-1 odds. Worcester was another 1 3/4 lengths back in third. Arabian Lion was fourth.











            “So much improvement in all these horses,” Baffert said. ""I was actually nervous before the race, worried that something weird might happen, but I can relax now.”

            The Lewis was a Kentucky Derby prep race, but no points were awarded because Baffert has been banned for two years by Churchill Downs Inc. The Hall of Fame trainer was in Louisville on Friday to testify in federal court as he seeks a temporary injunction to end the suspension, which runs through the end of the upcoming spring meet. It was meted out following a failed drug test by Medina Spirit after the colt finished first in the 2021 Kentucky Derby.

            Newgate earned his first graded stakes victory. The colt was second, beaten by a neck in the Sham Stakes last month in his previous start.

            ""Frankie Dettori has been teaching him how to just sit back, relax and come with a punch and that’s what he did today,” Baffert said.

            The victory, worth $120,000, increased Newgate's career earnings to $241,975, with two wins in six starts.

Lewis Stakes by a neck on Saturday, with Bob Baffert as the trainer of all four horses in the Kentucky Derby prep race at Santa Anita.Ridden by Frankie Dettori, Newgate ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:43.11 and paid $4 and $2.60 as the even-money favorite. There was no show wagering because of the field size.Hard to Figure returned $5.20 at 12-1 odds. Worcester was another 1 3/4 lengths back in third. Arabian Lion was fourth.“So much improvement in all these horses,” Baffert said. ""I was actually nervous before the race, worried that something weird might happen, but I can relax now.”The Lewis was a Kentucky Derby prep race, but no points were awarded because Baffert has been banned for two years by Churchill Downs Inc. The Hall of Fame trainer was in Louisville on Friday to testify in federal court as he seeks a temporary injunction to end the suspension, which runs through the end of the upcoming spring meet. It was meted out following a failed drug test by Medina Spirit after the colt finished first in the 2021 Kentucky Derby.Newgate earned his first graded stakes victory. The colt was second, beaten by a neck in the Sham Stakes last month in his previous start.""Frankie Dettori has been teaching him how to just sit back, relax and come with a punch and that’s what he did today,” Baffert said.The victory, worth $120,000, increased Newgate's career earnings to $241,975, with two wins in six starts.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/05,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800672,"Jackson-Davis, No. 21 Indiana beat Edey, No. 1 Purdue 79-74","BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Trayce Jackson-Davis returned to Indiana so he could celebrate a banner season.

            On Saturday, the fourth-year forward added another big piece to his legacy.

            He scored 25 points and then watched Jalen Hood-Schifino break free for the clinching dunk with 2 seconds left to give No. 21 Indiana a 79-74 victory over No. 1 Purdue — and a quick storming of the court.











            It's the fourth time the Hoosiers have beaten the nation's top-ranked team at Assembly Hall, and the first since upsetting Michigan almost exactly 10 years earlier.

            “I just think it’s a toughness factor,” Jackson-Davis said, explaining why this team is different. ""I feel like teams in the past that I've been on just weren't that tough, honestly. We've kind of played with a chip on our shoulders since we got punked by Rutgers and we've kind of found our niche and that's what we're doing.'

            The only guy that's been even close to Jackson-Davis' productivity over the past month has been Purdue's Zach Edey, who had 33 points and 18 rebounds.

            But it was Jackson-Davis who walked away with his sixth win in seven games by moving within 16 points of becoming the first Indiana player to ever score 2,000 and grab 1,000 rebounds. He finished with seven rebounds and five blocks, becoming the first player to have 25 points and five blocks against a No. 1-ranked team since Marcus Camby in November 1995 against Kentucky.

            Fittingly, Jackson-Davis and the Hoosiers (16-7, 7-5 Big Ten) celebrated with their fellow students, who rekindled memories of Christian Watford's buzzer-beating 3-pointer to beat No. 1 Kentucky in December 2010. And this time, the fans lingered on the court long after the final buzzer as they pumped fists and danced to the sweet sounds emanating from the pep band.

            It marked the first time in the 216-game series Purdue (22-2, 11-2) was ranked No. 1.

            “They were our sixth man honestly and we fed off of it,” Jackson-Davis said. “That was the most electric crowd since I’ve been here. They really helped us.”

            But Indiana also played pretty well, forcing 16 turnovers and shooting 52.6% from the field against a defense that had held 24 consecutive opponents to 70 or fewer points. It won despite getting outrebounded 38-22 and nearly blowing a 16-point lead.

            The 7-foot-4 Edey positioned Purdue for the charge by scoring eight of Purdue's first 10 second-half points to cut a 15-point deficit to nine. He then added the final six points in a 12-4 spurt that make it 67-65 with 5:40 to play. And when Braden Smith's layup made it 71-70 with 2:03 left, even Boilermakers coach Matt Painter sensed the fans' angst.

            “If you can flip that or tie it or take the lead there, it's just a different feeling,” he said. “It's really hard to overcome that, the air kind of goes out of it, things get quiet in your own arena.""

            Instead, the Hoosiers forced three turnovers and eventually closed it out with four free throws, a layup from Hood-Schifino and the dunk off a perfectly designed inbound pass from second-year coach Mike Woodson, who has won both home meetings against Indiana's archrival.

            “I didn’t know the play was going to go that way, obviously,” said Hood-Schifino, who had 16 points. “But in the last timeout, I told coach I’m going to get this last bucket, so I was happy.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Purdue: Even on an uncharacteristic day, the Boilermakers showed why they are the nation's top team. The matchup with Edey is so difficult, Purdue can exploit it at will.

            Indiana: The Hoosiers did everything they needed early — making shots, ramping up the pace and making life generally difficult for the Boilermakers. And down the stretch they showed the mettle of a team that was the preseason conference favorite.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Purdue entered the day with a nine-game winning streak and as the only one-loss team in Division I, so another loss may not knock them out of the top spot. Indiana, which reappeared Monday in the Top 25, has solidified its spot despite losing earlier this week at Maryland.

            SPECIAL MOMENTS

            Indiana Athletics Hall of Fame radio announcer Don Fischer was honored at halftime for calling his 50th season of play-by-play. He's tied for the fourth-longest active tenure in Division I basketball with Kevin McKinney of Wyoming. Then during the final media timeout, the Hoosiers thanked ESPN color analyst Dick Vitale with a video tribute to his career. Vitale stood and waved to the crowd in appreciation.

The ceiling for cars, sedans and wagons is lower at $55,000.That represented a win for Tesla, General Motors GM.N, Ford F.N and other automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to loosen the vehicle definitions in the implementation of the incentive plan to make more of their lineups eligible.At its previous price, a Tesla buyer of a Model Y would only have been able to add about $1,000 in extra features, such as a tow hitch, before pushing the price above the level at which the tax incentive would apply.Tesla cut prices globally in January in response to signs of slowing demand. It cut prices for a second time in South Korea on Friday.Chief Executive Elon Musk said last month that vehicle orders were roughly double the company’s output in January after the first round of price cuts. He said strong demand had prompted the company to make its first small price increase to the Model Y.(Reporting by Rishabh Jaiswal and Akanksha Khushi in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by William Mallard)",2023/02/05,101,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800684,U.S. fighter jet shoots down suspected Chinese spy balloon with missile,"A U.S. military fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday, a week after it entered U.S. airspace and triggered a dramatic -- and public -- spying saga that worsened Sino-U.S. relations.President Joe Biden said he had issued an order on Wednesday to take down the balloon, but the Pentagon had recommended waiting until it could be done over open water to safeguard civilians from debris crashing to Earth from thousands of feet (meters) above commercial air traffic.""They successfully took it down, and I want to compliment our aviators who did it,"" Biden said.Multiple fighter and refueling aircraft were involved in the mission, but only one -- an F-22 fighter jet from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia -- took the shot at 2:39 p.m. (1939 GMT), using a single AIM-9X supersonic, heat-seeking, air-to-air missile, a senior U.S. military official said.The balloon was shot down about six nautical miles off the U.S. coast, over relatively shallow water, potentially aiding efforts to recover elements of the Chinese surveillance equipment in the coming days, officials said.The shootdown came shortly after the U.S. government ordered a halt to flights in and out of three regional airports -- Wilmington, Myrtle Beach and Charleston -- due to what it said at the time was an undisclosed ""national security effort."" The flights resumed on Saturday afternoon.While Saturday's shootdown concludes the military dimension to the spying saga, Biden is likely to continue to face intense political scrutiny from Republican opponents in Congress who argue he failed to act quickly enough.Questions also remain about how much information China may have gathered during the balloon's trek across the United States.The balloon first entered U.S. airspace in Alaska on Jan. 28 before moving into Canadian airspace on Monday Jan 30. It then re-entered U.S. airspace over northern Idaho on Jan. 31, a U.S. defense official said. Once it crossed over U.S. land, it did not return to the open waters, making a shootdown difficult.U.S. officials did not publicly disclose the balloon's presence over the United States until Thursday.""It's clear the Biden administration had hoped to hide this national security failure from Congress and the American people,"" said U.S. Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican who leads the House Armed Services Committee.Biden's emphasis on Saturday that -- days ago -- he ordered the balloon shot down as soon as possible could be an effort to respond to such critics.Former President Donald Trump, Biden's potential rival in the 2024 election, called earlier this week for the balloon to be shot down, and has sought to portray himself as stronger than Biden on China. The U.S. relationship with China is likely to be a major theme of the 2024 presidential race.Washington had called the balloon's appearance a ""clear violation"" of U.S. sovereignty and notified Beijing about the shootdown on Saturday, a U.S. official said.Still, officials on Saturday appeared play down the balloon's impact on U.S. national security.""Our assessment -- and we're going to learn more as we pick up the debris -- was that it was not likely to provide significant additive value over and above other (Chinese) intel capability, such as satellites in low-Earth orbit,"" the senior U.S. defense official said.A Reuters photographer who witnessed the shootdown said a stream came from a jet and hit the balloon, but there was no explosion. It then began to fall.China expressed regret that an ""airship"" used for civilian meteorological and other scientific purposes had strayed into U.S. airspace.China's foreign ministry said on Saturday that the flight of the airship over the United States was a force majeure accident, and accused U.S. politicians and media of taking advantage of the situation to discredit Beijing.The Pentagon assesses that this balloon was part of a fleet of Chinese spy balloons. On Friday, it said another Chinese balloon was flying over Latin America.""Over the past several years, Chinese balloons have previously been spotted over countries across five continents, including in East Asia, South Asia and Europe,"" the U.S. official said.The suspected spy balloon prompted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to postpone a visit to China this week that had been expected to start on Friday.The postponement of Blinken's trip, which had been agreed to in November by Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, was a blow to those who saw it as an overdue opportunity to stabilize an increasingly fractious relationship between the two countries.China is keen for a stable U.S. relationship so it can focus on its economy, battered by the now-abandoned zero-COVID policy and neglected by foreign investors alarmed by what they see as a return of state intervention in the market.SHANGHAI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry said on Sunday that it expressed strong dissatisfaction and opposition towards the United States' use of force to attack its airship.A U.S. military fighter jet shot down the airship, which Washington has described as a suspected Chinese spy balloon, off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday, a week after it entered U.S. airspace and triggered a dramatic -- and public -- spying saga that worsened Sino-U.S. relations.",2023/02/05,831,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800685,Chile wildfires spread amid heat wave as death toll rises,"SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Chile extended an emergency declaration to yet another region on Saturday as firefighters struggled to control dozens of raging wildfires that have claimed at least 22 lives amid a scorching heat wave that has broken records.The government declared a state of catastrophe in the La Araucanía region, which is south of Ñuble and Biobío, two central-southern regions where the emergency declaration had already been issued. The measure allows for greater cooperation with the military.At least 22 people have died in connection to the fires and 554 have been injured, including 16 in serious condition, according to Interior Minister Carolina Tohá. The death toll is likely to rise as Tohá said there are unconfirmed reports of at least 10 people missing.Sixteen of the deaths took place in Biobío, five in La Araucanía and one in Ñuble.The deaths included a Bolivian pilot who died when a helicopter that was helping combat the flames crashed in La Araucanía. A Chilean mechanic also died in the crash.Over the past week, fires have burned through an area equivalent to what is usually burned in an entire year, Tohá said in a news conference.The fires come at a time of record high temperatures.“The thermometer has reached points that we have never known until now,” Tohá said.As of Saturday morning, there were 251 wildfires raging throughout Chile, 151 of which were under control, according to Chile’s Senapred disaster agency.“Seventy-six new fires appeared yesterday,” Tohá said Saturday.The minister also suggested the fires should serve as yet another wake up call about the effects of climate change.“The evolution of climate change shows us again and again that this has a centrality and a capacity to cause an impact that we have to internalize much more,” Tohá said. “Chile is one of the countries with the highest vulnerability to climate change, and this isn’t theory but rather practical experience.”Chile is requesting international cooperation to assist the firefighting efforts.“We’re requesting support from several countries to address the emergency,” President Gabriel Boric wrote on social media.",2023/02/05,,World

            Hurts would win any Philly most-popular athlete poll these days —- well, it is football season — and the third-year quarterback has the Eagles just one win away from only their second Super Bowl victory in franchise history.

            Turns out, the Eagles were built on the strength of a QB still on his paltry rookie deal. He’s a finalist for AP NFL MVP, Offensive Player of the Year and tied a franchise record with 33 total touchdowns. 

            At just 24, Hurts has a Super Bowl -- and super riches -- ahead. He’s due for a new contract that will pay him in the neighborhood of $50 million a season, one that could rival the mammoth 10-year contract given to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes that has choked the team’s salary cap. The Chiefs have been creative in finding ways to remain at an elite level despite Mahomes’ salary. The Eagles will have to do the same.

            General manager Howie Roseman has been masterful of late at making all the right moves in drafts, trades and smart contracts. If the Eagles are to remain contenders for the same window the Chiefs have smashed open with Mahomes, Roseman will have to be just as adept at working the salary cap and finding gems in the draft.

            The future can wait until Feb. 13. On deck, the Super Bowl.

            “We want to go out there and play to our standard,” Hurts said. “That doesn’t change, regardless of the magnitude of the game.” 

            The Eagles offseason is already off to an astounding start. Roseman swung a 2022 draft-weekend deal with New Orleans that involved all draft picks -- notably, the Eagles would get the Saints’ first-round pick in 2023. Hey, the Saints were supposed to be pretty good and a pick in the 20s would have been fine. Instead, the Saints sank (though they did beat the Eagles) and Philadelphia has the No. 10 pick of the draft. Not bad for a team in the Super Bowl. The Eagles can only hope they can land a star player that could keep them championship contenders for another decade.

            Odds are, though, this time they won’t stun anyone and pick a quarterback. 

            OFFENSE

            Did someone say steal? Roseman outmaneuvered the Titans during the 2022 draft when he engineered a deal to get wide receiver A.J. Brown.

            With Brown upset with his contract in Tennessee, the Eagles sent two draft picks to the Titans and immediately gave the wide receiver a $100 million, four-year deal with $57 million guaranteed. Brown was worth the price and his playmaking ability has only brought out the best in Hurts. The two are close friends and their chemistry is evident on the field.

            He had 155 yards receiving in his Eagles debut and kept on rolling all the way to 88 catches for 1,496 yards and 11 touchdowns in the regular season. He topped Mike Quick’s 1,409 yards in 1983 for the Eagles’ single-season high.

            Across the field, DeVonta Smith put up similar bold numbers. Smith, a first-round pick in the 2021 draft, finished his second NFL season with 95 catches, which are the most by a wide receiver in team history.

            Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson have anchored the offensive line for a decade. Miles Sanders was a second-round pick who had 1,269 yards rushing this season and 11 touchdowns. Dallas Goedert has blossomed into one of the top tight ends in the league and made the offense one of the more dynamic in the league. 

            DEFENSE

            Did someone say steal, Part II? Haason Reddick signed a $45 million, three-year contract, that included $30 million guaranteed. It turned in one of the greatest season performances in team history. He had 16 sacks and 3½ more in the playoffs to pace the Eagles. Brandon Graham and Fletcher Cox are 10-plus-year veterans who helped the Eagles win their first Super Bowl. 

            SPECIAL TEAMS

            Jake Elliott, a fifth-round pick in 2017, has kept a low profile this season as Philadelphia’s fourth-down aggressiveness has kept him from putting up big field goal numbers. Elliott has at least been automatic on extra points, missing only one this season. It seems almost laughable that it’s worth noting, but Dallas kicker Brett Maher missed five extra points in the postseason. 

            The Eagles this week activated the 21-day practice window for punter Arryn Siposs to return from injured reserve. Siposs had been sidelined since mid-December with an ankle injury. The Eagles have since used veteran Brett Kern. Siposs could be activated for the Super Bowl ahead of Kern.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800696,New-look Logano leads NASCAR back to the L.A. Coliseum,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Joey Logano arrived at the first event of the season with a jet black shock of thick hair and a banner in the grandstands advertising the company that treated NASCAR's reigning champion for alopecia and early baldness. 

            “Ask Joey!” the company Hairclub urged on a banner draped in the lower bowl of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The voluminous locks on the two-time champion has been the talk of NASCAR's offseason, a short break from the December awards ceremony to Sunday's exhibition Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum. 

            In the eight weeks since he picked up his second Cup and Saturday, when he pulled his No. 2 Team Penske Ford into the Coliseum, Logano underwent a procedure that has given him a full head of hair for the first time in a decade. 











            He did not reveal Saturday if he received implants, but raved about the change in his appearance. Logano also said many drivers have reached out to him with questions since he revealed his new look. 

            “They had a fix for me, probably have a fix for everybody, and so I look 10 years younger,” said the 32-year-old father of three. “I'm like the old days again. I'm back. I look better and I feel good.”

            Logano opens his championship reign where it began last season: Logano was the winner of last year's inaugural Clash at the Coliseum. It was a radical experiment that NASCAR tried by shifting its exhibition opening race from its only previous home at Daytona International Speedway to a temporary track built inside the iconic University of Southern California football stadium. 

            NASCAR added a halftime show performed by Ice Cube, filled the stands with a younger, curious audience, and succeeded with a flawless show. 

            “Last year, this was one of the biggest risks, if not the biggest risk, our sport has ever taken,"" said Logano. “I was very nervous. This could be really bad for the sport, and it was great. I would almost look at winning the Clash last year as one of my biggest victories, and I don’t think there’s many non-points paying races that you’d ever say that about.” 

            So it was somewhat quizzical that NASCAR would return to the Coliseum for a second year and try to duplicate that success on Sunday. The event is a warm-up for the season-opening Feb. 19 Daytona 500, but after the Coliseum worked so well last year, NASCAR theoretically was emboldened to try something entirely different. 

            “I think this has opened a lot of doors that in the past probably weren't expected to be open, because when I came here last year, I really thought this was going to be a joke,” Kevin Harvick said. “And it was one of the races that I probably had the most fun at last year. The atmosphere, it was a great event, and I think coming back this year, everybody is looking forward to it.” 

            NASCAR for this second edition booked Cypress Hill for the pre-race concert and Wiz Khalifa will play the halftime show. Cheat Codes, a popular DJ group, will entertain during caution breaks Dixie D’Amelio is scheduled for a special performance. Rob Lowe is the grand marshal. 

            NASCAR has put mufflers on the cars for Sunday to dull the grumble and give spectators an opportunity to both carry on conversations inside the Coliseum and enjoy the musical acts. 

            The tweak is another attempt by NASCAR to break from its mold and reach new audiences. It will do it again in July when NASCAR runs its first-ever street race in downtown Chicago. NASCAR has committed to using mufflers in Chicago, too. 

            But returning to the Coliseum for a second year might also be calculated. 

            Dave Allen, the president of Auto Club Speedway in nearby Fontana, said Saturday the track will not host any racing in 2024 as it renovates into a new configuration. Allen couldn't even guarantee the track will be ready by 2025. 

            Before the Clash came to Los Angeles last year, the race at Auto Club was NASCAR's only stop in Southern California. It could be that the Coliseum in 2024 hosts a points-paying Cup race to maintain NASCAR's presence in the area as the Fontana track is renovated. 

            “I think it’s a great venue,"" said Brad Keselowski, co-owner of RFK Racing. ""The potential is here to do so many different things — points races or carry the idea to other venues. I think it’s certainly in one year’s time earned a lot of respect within the industry that opens up numerous doors and opportunities. 

            ""How that plays forward, I know I’m pretty open-minded to it as both a driver and an owner and look forward to see it play out.”
