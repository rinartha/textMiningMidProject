            GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Patrick Mahomes was magical when the Kansas City Chiefs desperately needed him to pull off another Super Bowl comeback.

            Playing on an injured ankle, Mahomes threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter and scrambled 26 yards on the go-ahead drive before Harrison Butker kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left to give the Chiefs a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night.











            The Chiefs won their second NFL title in four years and two-time NFL MVP Mahomes earned his second Super Bowl MVP award. 

            Coach Andy Reid, who couldn’t win the big game in Philadelphia, beat his former team to earn his second ring with Mahomes and the Chiefs. 

            With the score tied at 35-35, the Eagles tried to let the Chiefs score a touchdown with under two minutes left so they could get the ball back after a defensive holding call on cornerback James Bradberry on third-and-8 gave Kansas City a first down. But Jerick McKinnon slid at the 2, forcing the Eagles to use their last timeout.

            After Mahomes took a knee twice, Butker nailed his kick, sending thousands of red-clad Chiefs fans into a frenzy. 

            PHOENIX (AP) — Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen is the leading candidate to be the next head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, a person familiar with the team’s decision told The Associated Press.

            The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Sunday because Steichen was coaching the Eagles in the Super Bowl and a deal hasn’t been completed.

            Steichen, who was one of three finalists for AP Assistant Coach of the Year, would become the second Eagles offensive coordinator hired by the Colts as their head coach. Frank Reich, who was fired by the Colts earlier this season, was Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator before becoming Indianapolis’ head coach in 2018.

            NBA

            SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Golden State Warriors have decided to go through with completion of a trade to acquire Gary Payton II from Portland despite concerns that arose surrounding the guard’s health following offseason surgery for a core muscle injury that sidelined him until last month.

            A person with direct knowledge of the situation said Sunday that the Warriors spoke to the NBA about how the Trail Blazers handled the deal and information about the medical situation for Payton, whose physical Friday brought up issues that put the trade in jeopardy. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no details of the negotiations and discussions were made public.

            The defending champions had until Sunday night to make a decision whether to rescind the swap that sent center James Wiseman to Detroit. Golden State also will receive unprotected 2026 and ‘28 second-round draft picks from Portland while giving up Memphis’ 2026 second-round pick and its own 2028 second-round selection to Portland. The Pistons traded forward Saddiq Bey to the Hawks and the Blazers acquire forward Kevin Knox II from the Detroit along with three conditional second-round picks from the Hawks.

            CLEVELAND (AP) — Danny Green will sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers once the free agent swingman and three-time NBA champion clears waivers, a person familiar with the agreement told The Associated Press on Sunday.

            Green, who began his pro career with Cleveland in 2009, is expected to rejoin the Cavs in the next two days, said the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team is not commenting on its interest in him.

            Green drew interest from several contending teams but chose to rejoin the Cavs, who will add another outside shooter, a valued veteran and player with extensive postseason experience. Green has appeared in 165 playoff games over 14 seasons.

            METAIRIE, La. (AP) — New Orleans Pelicans All-Star Zion Williamson has aggravated his previously injured right hamstring, extending the timeline for his return to “multiple weeks past All-Star break,” basketball operations chief David Griffin said Sunday.

            Griffin said Williamson, who has been averaging 26 points per game this season, had progressed to the point where he was able to participate in 3-on-3 drills in practice and was on the court when he experienced his setback.

            BOSTON (AP) — Derrick White scored 23 points to help the short-handed Boston Celtics hold off Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies 119-109 on Sunday. 

            Sam Hauser added 20 points, tying his career-high with six 3-pointers, Al Horford had 16 points and Payton Pritchard 12 for NBA-leading Boston, which won its fourth straight. 

            Morant led the Grizzlies with 25 points, seven assists and six rebounds. 

            TORONTO (AP) — Fred VanVleet scored 35 points, topping 30 for a career-best ninth time this season, and Pascal Siakam added 28 points as the Toronto Raptors beat the Detroit Pistons 119-118 for their fourth win in five games Sunday.

            Scottie Barnes scored 20 points and Precious Achiuwa had 11 points and 11 rebounds as Toronto got its second straight win over Detroit after losing the previous six meetings. 

            BASEBALL

            GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez have been reunited.

            Fox Sports announced during its Super Bowl pregame show that Jeter will be part of the network’s studio coverage for the coming season.

            Rodriguez hugged Jeter as he came on stage and presented him with a Fox Sports baseball jersey. Jeter, who was elected to baseball’s Hall of Fame in 2020, also joins fellow Hall of Famer David Ortiz and host Kevin Burkhardt as part of the studio team.

            Jeter and Rodriguez were teammates on the New York Yankees for 10 seasons, but their relationship wasn’t close. The two were good friends early on during their big league careers, but Jeter acknowledged during his ESPN documentary series “The Captain” last year that they had grown apart after comments Rodriguez made in a 2001 interview with Esquire magazine.

            ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Reliever Jason Adam beat Tampa Bay in the first of four arbitration cases involving the Rays and will get $1.775 million instead of the team’s offer of $1.55 million.

            Adam was 2-3 with a career-low 1.56 ERA and a career-best eight saves in 67 relief appearances last season, striking out 75 and walking 17 in 63 1/3 innings. The right-hander earned $1.15 million.

            Arbitrators Jasbir Parmar, Margaret Brogan and Stephen Raymond made the decision on Saturday, a day after hearing arguments.

            Tampa Bay also is awaiting decisions in the cases of relievers Ryan Thompson ($1.2 million vs. $1 million) and Colin Poche ($1.3 million vs. $1.175 million) and outfielder Harold Ramirez ($2.2 million vs. $1.9 million). Those decisions are being held for cases involving other players to be argued or settled next week.

            Players and teams have split six decisions.

            GOLF

            SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Scottie Scheffler successfully defended his WM Phoenix Open title Sunday at TPC Scottsdale to regain the No. 1 spot in the world.

            Scheffler closed with a 6-under 65 to beat Nick Taylor by two strokes in breezy conditions on the firm and fast Stadium Course. The 26-year-old Texan will jump from second to first in the rankings, taking the top spot from Rory McIlroy with his fifth PGA Tour victory.

            Scheffler finished at 19-under 265. He earned $3.6 million from the $20 million purse in the second of the PGA Tour’s new designated events, created in response to LIV Golf to bring the top tour players together more often.

            He’s the seventh player to successfully defend a title in the tournament, following Ben Hogan (1946-47), Jimmy Demaret (1949-50), Lloyd Mangrum (1952-53), Arnold Palmer (three straight from 1961-63), Johnny Miller (1974-75) and Hideki Matsuyama (2016-17).

            Taylor also finished with a 65. Jon Rahm was third at 14 under after a 68. 

            TENNIS

            DALLAS (AP) — Wu Yibing became the first Chinese player to win an ATP Tour title, rallying in a three-set, all-tiebreaker thriller to beat John Isner in the Dallas Open on Sunday.

            Wu overcame 44 aces from the big-serving Isner — one shy of tying a three-set record — and four match points in the 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (12) victory. The 23-year-old was the first Chinese player in an ATP final.

            Wu also came back from a set down to beat top-seeded American Taylor Fritz in the semifinals. There were no service breaks in Wu’s victory over the fifth-seeded Isner, who was playing in his hometown tournament.NFLGLENDALE, Ariz.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808701,Search for earthquake survivors enters final hours in Turkey,"ADIYAMAN, Turkey (AP) — The desperate search for earthquake survivors in Turkey and Syria entered its final hours Monday as rescuers using sniffer dogs and thermal cameras surveyed pulverized apartment blocks for any sign of life a week after the disaster.

            Teams in southern Turkey's Hatay province cheered and clapped when a 13-year-old boy identified only by his first name, Kaan, was pulled from the rubble. In Gaziantep province, rescue workers, including coal miners who secured tunnels with wooden supports, found a woman alive in the wreckage of a five-story building.

            Stories of such rescues have flooded the airwaves in recent days. But tens of thousands of dead have been found during the same period, and experts say the window for rescues has nearly closed, given the length of time that has passed, the fact that temperatures have fallen to minus 6 degrees Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit) and the severity of the building collapses.











            The 7.8 magnitude earthquake and its aftershocks struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria on Feb. 6, reducing huge swaths of towns and cities to mountains of broken concrete and twisted metal. The death toll has surpassed 35,000.

            In some areas, searchers placed signs that read “ses yok,” or “no sound,” in front of buildings they had inspected for any sign that someone was alive inside, HaberTurk television reported.

            Associated Press journalists in Adiyaman saw a sign painted on a concrete slab in front of wreckage indicating that an expert had inspected it. In Antakya, people left signs displaying their phone numbers and asking crews to contact them if they found any bodies in the rubble.

            The quake's financial damage in Turkey alone was estimated at $84.1 billion, according to the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation, a non-governmental business organization. Calculated using a statistical comparison with a similarly devastating 1999 quake, the figure was considerably higher than any official estimates so far.

            In other developments, Syria’s president agreed to open two new crossing points from Turkey to the country’s rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment for millions of earthquake victims, the United Nations announced.

            U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the decision by Syrian leader Bashar Assad to open crossing points at Bab Al-Salam and Al Raée for an initial period of three months. Currently, the U.N. has only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa.

            Some 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the epicenter, almost no houses were left standing in the Turkish village of Polat, where residents salvaged refrigerators, washing machines and other goods from wrecked homes.

            Not enough tents have arrived for the homeless, forcing families to share the tents that are available, survivor Zehra Kurukafa said.

            “We sleep in the mud, all together with two, three, even four families,” Kurukafa said.

            Turkish authorities said Monday that more than 150,000 survivors have been moved to shelters outside the affected provinces. In the city of Adiyaman, Musa Bozkurt waited for a vehicle to bring him and others to western Turkey.

            “We’re going away, but we have no idea what will happen when we get there,” said the 25-year-old. ""We have no goal. Even if there was (a plan), what good will it be after this hour? I no longer have my father or my uncle. What do I have left?”

            Fuat Ekinci, a 55-year-old farmer, was reluctant to leave his home for western Turkey, saying he did not have the means to live elsewhere and that his fields need to be tended.

            “Those who have the means are leaving, but we’re poor,” he said. “The government says, go and live there a month or two. How do I leave my home? My fields are here, this is my home, how do I leave it behind?”

            Volunteers from across Turkey have mobilized to help millions of survivors, including a group of chefs and restaurant owners who served traditional food such as beans and rice and lentil soup to survivors who lined up in the streets of downtown Adiyaman.

            The widespread damage included heritage sites in places such as Antakya, on the southern coast of Turkey, an important ancient port and early center of Christianity historically known as Antioch. Greek Orthodox churches in the region have started charity drives to assist the relief effort and raise funds to rebuild or repair churches.

            In Syria, authorities said a newborn whose mother gave birth while trapped under the rubble of their home was doing well. The baby, Aya, was found hours after the quake, still connected by the umbilical cord to her mother, who was dead. She is being breastfed by the wife of the director of the hospital where she is being treated.

            Such accounts have given many hope, but Eduardo Reinoso Angulo, a professor at the Institute of Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said the likelihood of finding people alive was “very, very small now.”

            David Alexander, a professor of emergency planning and management at University College London, agreed. He said the odds were not very good to begin with.

            Many of the buildings were so poorly constructed that they collapsed into very small pieces, leaving very few spaces large enough for people to survive in, Alexander said.

            “If a frame building of some kind goes over, generally speaking we do find open spaces in a heap of rubble where we can tunnel in,“ Alexander said. “Looking at some of these photographs from Turkey and from Syria, there just aren’t the spaces.”

            Winter conditions further reduced the window for survival. In the cold, the body shivers to keep warm, but that burns a lot of calories, meaning that people also deprived of food will die more quickly, said Dr. Stephanie Lareau, a professor of emergency medicine at Virginia Tech in the U.S.

            Many in Turkey blame faulty construction for the vast devastation, and authorities have begun targeting contractors allegedly linked with buildings that collapsed. Turkey has introduced construction codes that meet earthquake-engineering standards, but experts say the codes are rarely enforced.

            As the scale of the disaster has come into view, sorrow and disbelief have turned to rage over the sense that the emergency response was ineffective. That anger could be a political problem for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who faces a tough reelection battle in May.

            Turkey’s death toll has exceeded 31,000, and the health minister said more than 19,000 survivors were being treated in hospitals. Deaths in Syria, split between rebel-held areas and government-held areas, have risen beyond 3,500, although those reported by the government haven’t been updated in days.

            U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths met Monday with Syria’s President Bashar Assad and foreign minister after visiting Aleppo and seeing the devastating damage there.

            He stressed that the United Nations doesn’t have heavy equipment for excavations or search-and-rescue efforts “so the international community as a whole needs to step up to get that aid where it’s needed.”

            In addition, the U.N.’s humanitarian partners need ambulances, medicine, shelters, heaters and emergency food, water and sanitation and hygiene items, Dujarric said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808702,Toyota's CEO-to-be outlines leadership team bullish on EVs,"TOKYO (AP) — The next president at Japan’s top automaker Toyota, Koji Sato, introduced a management team Monday that he said will lead an aggressive push on electric vehicles. 

            Sato stressed that “electrification” is a key theme for his team and promised to develop a totally new, next-generation electric vehicle by 2026. 

            That will be a Lexus, while Toyota Motor Corp. will also beef up all its EV model offerings, Sato said. 











            “Lexus will lead the move,” he told reporters at a news conference in Tokyo. “I see myself as the captain of the soccer team.” 

            In a presentation, Sato listed the various executives, each with different responsibilities, such as carbon neutrality, safety technology, as well as overseeing regions like North America and Asia. 

            Hiroki Nakajima, who now oversees mid-size vehicles, was named executive vice president overseeing technology. Yoichi Miyazaki, who has been overseeing business operations, was named chief financial officer. 

            The selection of Sato, now Toyota's chief branding officer, as the next chief executive was announced last month. The new leadership takes the helm April 1.

            Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid and Camry sedan, has billed the move as an effort to stay abreast of social changes like electrification. At times it has been seen as lagging its rivals in EVs. 

            The company's success with hybrids, which have both a battery and a gas engine, and hydrogen fuel cells may be partly behind that perception. 

            Sato reiterated that view, noting that Toyota is intent on reducing emissions with models that are already widespread. Most vehicles on the roads today run on gas, he noted. 

            Toyota officials have always said they have BEV technology, which stands for “battery electric vehicles,” or pure EVs. But that market has so far been dominated by the likes of Tesla, Japanese rival Nissan and BYD of China. 

            “We have been working on developing BEVs, but the perception may not have reflected that as well,” Sato said.

            The electric vehicles Toyota offers can't be just more EVs to keep up with the times, but “must answer the question of what kind of EV Toyota can offer,” he said. 

            Sato and the other executives said the company's entire production system must be revamped to make quality EVs. Toyota is also grappling with the high cost of the batteries, although lowering costs is not a goal in itself. Toyota prides itself on its “just in time” production system. 

            Toyota will also make more intelligent cars that are safer and more fun, Sato said, implying they will link to the net and offer other entertainment features. 

            With its management reshuffle, Toyota's chief executive and president, Akio Toyoda, who is grandson of the company’s founder, becomes its chairman. Toyoda did not appear at Monday’s announcement. 

            Sato has also overseen the Lexus luxury division and Toyota motor racing. The appointments still need shareholders’ approval, scheduled for the company's next general meeting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808741,Wife of former US pilot complains of Australian treatment,"SYDNEY (AP) — The wife of a former U.S. military pilot accused by the United States of illegally training Chinese aviators said Monday her husband was being held in inhumane conditions as he fights extradition from Australia.

            Saffrine Duggan said her husband Daniel Duggan had already been kept 115 days in a “tiny cell” in Sydney’s Silverwater Correctional Complex because of U.S. charges that had yet to be heard in court.

            “He is suffering the harshest possible prison classification in Australia as an ‘extreme high risk restricted inmate’ despite having no prior (or current) convictions,” she said in a statement. 











            “This is unprecedented and an affront to Australia’s rule of law and manipulation of the Australian legal system by the United States, at the expense of the Australian taxpayer,” she said. 

            Having already filed a complaint with Australia’s Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Saffrine Duggan said a further complaint would be filed with the United Nations Human Rights Committee.

            “The manner and circumstances behind this prosecution of Dan are something you would expect to find in an authoritarian country, but not in a democratic Australia where its citizens expect a more fair and balanced equal application of the law and the overriding principle of a ‘fair go’ for all,” she said.

            Daniel Duggan, 54, was arrested in October last year near his family home in Orange, in New South Wales state, and was accused of providing military training to pilots working for China.

            He has denied the allegations, saying they were “political” posturing by the United States, which unfairly singled him out.

            His wife said the treaty under which the FBI had attempted to extradite her husband was not being used properly.

            “The treaty specifically states that alleged crimes under its provisions should not be of a ‘political character,’ should require dual criminality — which is not the case in this instance — and should be in Australia’s national interests,” she said. Dual criminality means illegal in both Australia and the United States.

            The case is proceeding through Sydney courts where a magistrate will decide whether the husband is eligible for extradition. A hearing is scheduled for March 20.

            Daniel Duggan’s lawyer, Dennis Miralis, told reporters outside Sydney's Downing Center Local Court on Monday that Australian and U.S. government agencies had been reluctant to hand over documents critical to Duggan’s defense.

            “Regrettably, to date, we haven’t been getting the cooperation that, in our view, would be essential to ensure that Mr. Duggan’s rights are properly protected,"" Miralis said. ""Government agencies, perhaps unsurprisingly, are refusing to produce documents on the basis of secrecy provisions.” 

            Born in Boston, Duggan served in the U.S. Marines for 12 years before immigrating to Australia in 2002. In January 2012, he gained Australian citizenship, choosing to give up his U.S. citizenship in the process.

            A 2016 indictment from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., was unsealed late last year. In it, prosecutors say Duggan conspired with others to provide training to Chinese military pilots in 2010 and 2012, and possibly at other times, without applying for an appropriate license.

            Prosecutors say Duggan received about nine payments totaling about 88,000 Australian dollars ($61,000) and international travel from another conspirator for what was sometimes described as “personal development training.”

            The indictment says Duggan traveled to the U.S., China and South Africa, and provided some training to Chinese pilots in South Africa.SYDNEY (AP) — The wife of a former U.S. military pilot accused by the United States of illegally training Chinese aviators said Monday her husband was being held in inhumane conditions as he fights extradition from Australia.Saffrine Duggan said her husband Daniel Duggan had already been kept 115 days in a “tiny cell” in Sydney’s Silverwater Correctional Complex because of U.S. charges that had yet to be heard in court.“He is suffering the harshest possible prison classification in Australia as an ‘extreme high risk restricted inmate’ despite having no prior (or current) convictions,” she said in a statement.“This is unprecedented and an affront to Australia’s rule of law and manipulation of the Australian legal system by the United States, at the expense of the Australian taxpayer,” she said.Having already filed a complaint with Australia’s Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Saffrine Duggan said a further complaint would be filed with the United Nations Human Rights Committee.“The manner and circumstances behind this prosecution of Dan are something you would expect to find in an authoritarian country, but not in a democratic Australia where its citizens expect a more fair and balanced equal application of the law and the overriding principle of a ‘fair go’ for all,” she said.Daniel Duggan, 54, was arrested in October last year near his family home in Orange, in New South Wales state, and was accused of providing military training to pilots working for China.He has denied the allegations, saying they were “political” posturing by the United States, which unfairly singled him out.His wife said the treaty under which the FBI had attempted to extradite her husband was not being used properly.“The treaty specifically states that alleged crimes under its provisions should not be of a ‘political character,’ should require dual criminality — which is not the case in this instance — and should be in Australia’s national interests,” she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808742,Australia adds $300 million in funding for Indigenous pledge,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Fifteen years after the Australian Parliament’s historic apology to its Indigenous people for past wrongs, the government on Monday announced 424 million Australian dollars ($293 million) in new funding to improve the lives of Australia’s original inhabitants.

            In 2008, a newly elected center-left Labor Party government apologized to the Indigenous population for ""laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians.”

            The focus of the apology was the so-called Stolen Generations — 100,000 children who were taken from Indigenous mothers under assimilation policies throughout most of the 20th century.











            The apology was accompanied by the ambitious pledge to close the gap in life expectancies between Indigenous Australians and the wider population within a generation.

            Key measures of disparities between the Indigenous population and others have been tracked annually in Closing the Gap Reports to identify and reduce a range of disadvantages. The report shows gaps widening in some areas, including with increasing rates of suicide and incarceration among Indigenous people.

            Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose Labor government was elected in May after nine years in opposition, told Parliament the new funding reaffirms “Closing the Gap as a top priority for my government.”

            Indigenous people, accounting for 3.2% of Australia’s population in the 2021 census, are the most disadvantaged ethnic group in country. They die younger than other Australians, are less likely to be employed, achieve lower education levels and are overrepresented in prison populations.

            “These aren’t gaps, they’re chasms,” Albanese said of measures of Indigenous disadvantage.

            On top of the AU$1.2 billion ($830 million) in Indigenous spending announced in October, the new funding includes AU$150 million ($104 million) over four years to provide clean drinking water to Outback Indigenous communities.

            AU$22 million ($15 million) would be spent over five years on combating family violence. Indigenous women and children were 34 times more likely to experience family and domestic violence than other Australians, the government said.

            In three years immediately before the apology and the Close the Gap pledge, Indigenous men died 11.4 years before the average Australian man and Indigenous women died 9.6 years younger than other Australian women, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

            A decade later, that gap had narrowed to 8.6 years for men and 7.8 years for women, the bureau’s latest data shows. Indigenous men have a life expectancy of 71 years and Indigenous women 75 years.CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Fifteen years after the Australian Parliament’s historic apology to its Indigenous people for past wrongs, the government on Monday announced 424 million Australian dollars ($293 million) in new funding to improve the lives of Australia’s original inhabitants.In 2008, a newly elected center-left Labor Party government apologized to the Indigenous population for ""laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians.”The focus of the apology was the so-called Stolen Generations — 100,000 children who were taken from Indigenous mothers under assimilation policies throughout most of the 20th century.The apology was accompanied by the ambitious pledge to close the gap in life expectancies between Indigenous Australians and the wider population within a generation.Key measures of disparities between the Indigenous population and others have been tracked annually in Closing the Gap Reports to identify and reduce a range of disadvantages.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808743,Pakistan nabs 50 men in weekend killing of blasphemy suspect,"LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan's police arrested at least 50 suspects in the kidnapping and lynching of a man already detained on charges of blasphemy, officials said Monday.

            A mob of hundreds of enraged Muslims descended on the police station in the Nankana district of eastern Punjab province on Saturday. Members of the mob had been alerted that a man identified only as Waris desecrated a copy of Islam’s holy book, the Quran. 

            According to the district police chief, Babar Sarfraz Alpa, the mob had accused Waris of pasting images of himself, his wife and a knife on pages of the book, displaying and throwing them in the streets.











            Charges of blasphemy carry the death penalty under Pakistani law.

            Officials said the mob stormed the Warburton police station on Saturday. Some used a wooden ladder to climb a wall and open the main gate, allowing the mob to enter. By the time police reinforcement could reach the scene to save the prisoner's life, the mob had already lynched him and were about to burn his body. Police dispersed the crowd. 

            On Monday, Alpa said police have arrested at least 50 people for participating in the attack. He said more raids are underway to arrest other alleged participants.

            International and Pakistani rights groups say accusations of blasphemy have often been used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal scores. Pakistan’s government has long been under pressure to change the country’s blasphemy laws, something the Islamists strongly resist.

            The slain man, Waris, was arrested in 2019 on a blasphemy charge and was in prison until mid-2022. 

            Police say Waris again desecrated the Quran, and that some witnesses grabbed and beat him. Police took Waris into custody. But the mob later attacked the police station and killed him, saying they were punishing him for insulting the Quran.

            A statement said authorities have sacked the police station chief and the area deputy superintendent for negligence in failing to prevent the attack.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808744,Cambodia independent radio station VoD closes on PM's orders,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — One of Cambodia’s last free media outlets, Voice of Democracy radio, ceased operations on Monday after Prime Minister Hun Sen ordered its closure for allegedly slandering his son in a story.

            The story — which was also published on the website of VoD, as the station is better known — said that Hun Sen’s son, Lt. Gen. Hun Manet, had signed a donation on his father’s behalf of $100,000 for Turkey earthquake relief. 

            Hun Sen said the article misinterpreted the facts and that only the prime minister has the authority to make decisions on foreign aid. VoD acknowledged it had made a mistake, but that did not satisfy Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia with an iron fist for 38 years, during which he has cracked down on critics and independent media. 











            His son heads the army and has been nominated by Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party to succeed him when he steps down. With most opponents silenced, including the only credible opposition party, Hun Sen is expected to lead his party to another victory in a general election scheduled for July.

            VoD has reported extensively on sensitive issues such as land grabbing and criminal gangs operating with near impunity to carry out internet scams with people, especially foreigners, tricked into working under conditions of near slavery. 

            A previous media clampdown has already forced several outlets out of business on disputed grounds that they had not properly paid their taxes.

            The Information Ministry said Monday that VoD’s license was being revoked “because it has seriously violated the ethics of professional journalism and did not make a correction according to the press law, affecting the honor and prestige of the government.”

            Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said the Cambodian government ""has never liked VoD’s reporting, and given Prime Minister Hun Sen’s authoritarian attitude towards independent media, it’s likely VoD have been living on borrowed time for a while.” 

            “But that’s no excuse for this outrageous and ridiculous order to shut them down based on the silliest of rationales about who signed a government document to give aid to Turkey. This flimsy and absurd decision barely masks the government’s real intent to further suppress media freedom.”

            He said that historically, Hun Sen and his party usually crack down hard on any independent voices ahead of a national election. 

            “Going after VoD is a good indication that scheduled July 23 poll will be neither free nor fair,"" Robertson said.

            Hun Sen ordered VoD to cease operating at 10 a.m. Monday, and the station’s personnel were at their desks when representatives from Phnom Penh City Hall and the Information Ministry arrived to serve the order. The road outside was closed in an apparent effort to quash any street protests.

            However, there were no confrontations because VoD said it would honor the license revocation. Hun Sen had advised the authorities to inform the station when the deadline arrived and not take any further action.

            After the authorities left, other reporters visited the VoD office to hear staff express their disappointment.

            “I could not imagine that the prime minister would shut down the voice of the people like this,” said a tearful reporter, Khan Leakhena. “VoD only went directly to report on people who had land disputes, but then it was manipulated to look as if we are from the opposition.”

            A VoD spokesperson, Sothoeuth Ith, said after receiving the closure order, “So for now, we will stay silent, we will not continue our broadcast.”

            “Maybe hopefully this is not the end of everything,” he said. In what appeared to refer to the possibility that Hun Sen might eventually restore VoD’s license, he added, “We will try our best to work with all relevant stakeholders and hopefully a solution can be realized.” 

            The United States Embassy in Cambodia said it was ""deeply troubled by the abrupt decision"" to revoke VoD's media license. 

            “We urge Cambodian authorities to revisit this decision,"" the embassy said in a statement. It said the station ""has provided objective, fact-based reporting on issues that serve the interests of the Cambodian people” for more than 20 years. 

            U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price, speaking Monday to reporters in Washington, said the move was “particularly troubling given the chilling impact it will have on freedom of expression and on access to information ahead of the national elections in July.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808745,"Palestinian man, Israeli policeman, killed in new fighting","JERUSALEM (AP) — A Palestinian man on Monday was killed during a shootout in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian paramedics said, while an Israeli policeman was killed while trying to stop a Palestinian stabbing attack in east Jerusalem, police said. 

            The incidents were the latest violence in a surge of deadly Israeli-Palestinian fighting that began last spring and shows no signs of slowing. 

            The Israeli military said it carried out raids across the West Bank overnight, and that troops came under fire during the arrest of two men suspected of killing an Israeli soldier in October. The army said the two wanted men were injured in the shootout in the northern city of Nablus and arrested.











            The Palestinian Health Ministry said Amir Bustami, 21, was killed in the Israeli army raid. It was not clear if he had been involved in the shootout. 

            In east Jerusalem, meanwhile, Israeli police said a young teenage Palestinian boy pulled out a knife and stabbed a paramilitary officer during a routine inspection at a military checkpoint. Police said a security guard opened fire, apparently shooting the officer. The boy was arrested, and the officer later died of his wounds, police said.

            Tensions have mounted for months as Israel has conducted nightly arrest raids in the West Bank, which were prompted by a spate of Palestinian attacks on Israelis last spring. Some 30 people were killed in Israel by Palestinians in 2022, and at least 11 others in attacks so far in 2023. 

            Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed last year in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, making it the deadliest year in those areas since 2004, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. At least 46 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since the start of this year. 

            Israel says that most of those killed have been militants but others — including youths protesting the incursions and other people not involved in confrontations — have also been killed. 

            Israel says the military raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart future attacks while the Palestinians view them as further entrenchment of Israel’s open-ended, 55-year occupation.

            Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war, territories the Palestinians claim for their hoped-for independent state.

            Earlier on Monday, the Israeli military said aircraft bombed a rocket manufacturing site and military installations in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants launched four rockets into southern Israel overnight. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

            The Gaza-Israel frontier had been largely quiet in recent months, but there have been intermittent rocket fire and airstrikes as tensions between Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem have soared.JERUSALEM (AP) — A Palestinian man on Monday was killed during a shootout in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian paramedics said, while an Israeli policeman was killed while trying to stop a Palestinian stabbing attack in east Jerusalem, police said.The incidents were the latest violence in a surge of deadly Israeli-Palestinian fighting that began last spring and shows no signs of slowing.The Israeli military said it carried out raids across the West Bank overnight, and that troops came under fire during the arrest of two men suspected of killing an Israeli soldier in October. The army said the two wanted men were injured in the shootout in the northern city of Nablus and arrested.The Palestinian Health Ministry said Amir Bustami, 21, was killed in the Israeli army raid. It was not clear if he had been involved in the shootout.In east Jerusalem, meanwhile, Israeli police said a young teenage Palestinian boy pulled out a knife and stabbed a paramilitary officer during a routine inspection at a military checkpoint. Police said a security guard opened fire, apparently shooting the officer. The boy was arrested, and the officer later died of his wounds, police said.Tensions have mounted for months as Israel has conducted nightly arrest raids in the West Bank, which were prompted by a spate of Palestinian attacks on Israelis last spring. Some 30 people were killed in Israel by Palestinians in 2022, and at least 11 others in attacks so far in 2023.Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed last year in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, making it the deadliest year in those areas since 2004, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. At least 46 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since the start of this year.Israel says that most of those killed have been militants but others — including youths protesting the incursions and other people not involved in confrontations — have also been killed.Israel says the military raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart future attacks while the Palestinians view them as further entrenchment of Israel’s open-ended, 55-year occupation.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war, territories the Palestinians claim for their hoped-for independent state.Earlier on Monday, the Israeli military said aircraft bombed a rocket manufacturing site and military installations in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants launched four rockets into southern Israel overnight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808747,Taiwan eyeing '0+n' quarantine for mild COVID cases,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced on Monday (Feb. 13) that it is considering changing the quarantine period for mild COVID cases from the ""5+n"" scheme to a ""0+n"" formula.During a press conference that afternoon, the CECC announced three major priorities for returning the country to normalcy, including strengthening next-generation vaccinations, adjusting the quarantine method for mild COVID patients, and revising the definition of confirmed cases. CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) said that the center is leaning towards a policy of ""0+n"" for mild cases, meaning zero days of quarantine and up to seven days of self-health monitoring, depending on how soon they test negative.In addition, Wang said that the CECC is considering only reporting hospitalized patients with severe illness, while those with mild symptoms will not be officially reported.Wang explained that the inoculation of the next generation of vaccines will continue to be expanded. He pointed out that he has continued to visit various counties and cities and listened to the opinions of locals.He said that a summary of the vaccination plan for this year will soon be provided.As for the guidelines for quarantining COVID patients, Wang said that the center is looking at reducing quarantine for mild cases from ""5+n"" to ""0+n."" Wang explained that a panel of experts will be invited to a meeting in which the decision on when to implement the new quarantine formula will be decided.According to Wang, the definition for official COVID cases will also be revised. He said that in the future, only severe cases, especially hospitalized patients, will officially be reported, while mild cases will no longer be reported.Amid the decision by countries such as Singapore to change the status of COVID to an endemic disease, Wang said that the CECC is also moving in the direction of listing the virus as an endemic disease as well.",2023/02/13,2297,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808772,Taiwan egg prices continue to rise due to avian flu,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Negotiations between poultry farms and the Taipei Producer Association led to an agreement to raise egg prices by NT$2 (US$0.07) per kilogram beginning today (Feb. 13).Unfortunately, many in the industry believe the price increase is too little too late, and cannot alleviate supply-side pressure brought about by the global outbreak of avian flu. Domestically, egg shortages are becoming more common as local egg farms continue to come under pressure from fewer laying hens and higher raw material prices.At the moment, not only are laying hens in short supply, but also broiler chickens. It may take poultry stocks at least three to four months to regenerate, per UDN. Many within the industry believe that not only eggs, but even chicken meat prices will remain high in the short to mid-term.“Egg merchants still can’t make money as avian flu continues to rage and the price of raw materials and labor has risen, which is making it hard for egg merchants,"" said Fwusow Chairman Hung Yao-kun (洪堯昆).Hung added that his company originally hoped to import chicks from abroad, but the avian flu has had international effects, and the quantity of chicks hasn’t been enough to satisfy demand, leading to further complications and higher prices, per UDN.CP Foods Chairman Willis Cheng (鄭武樾) also believes that the recent price increase is too small as the avian flu outbreak has simply killed too many chickens and resulted in fewer eggs and a serious imbalance in supply and demand.Cheng added that another mass culling of tens of millions of chickens in Europe and the United States a few days ago, making it the worst outbreak of avian flu in history. Cheng worries Taiwan could suffer both a chicken meat and egg shortage if imports are not allowed, per UDN.According to a manager from Morn Sun, another Taiwanese poultry producer, avian flu in Europe, the United States, and Taiwan will definitely upset the balance between supply and demand, with an egg shortage inevitably leading to higher prices.He believes the new supply won’t come online for another four months as local consumers might face a difficult time securing a daily egg supply.",2023/02/13,2237,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808784,11 taboos for Valentine’s Day in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — When religious holidays become international affairs, like the Valentine’s Day merriment on Tuesday, Feb. 14, they often become localized and lose or even gain something in translation at the same time.While Taiwan already has a holiday of its own for star-crossed lovers, Qixi Festival on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, this does not prevent anyone from giving gifts on Valentine’s Day too. As they say, there is no such thing as too much love.Valentine’s Day has evolved in Taiwan over recent years and now looks a little different from the West, where it originated as a Christian feast day dedicated to a martyr known as Saint Valentine. Typically, abroad, lovers will send each other cards, chocolates or flowers, and have a night out a deux at a restaurant or the cinema.In Taiwan, a romantic date is par for the course, but gift giving has become a complicated affair to some extent because the words for gifts may have unfortunate double meanings or are thought to be unlucky. A recent TVBS article featuring folklore expert Yang Deng-yu (楊登嵙) addresses these faux pas for Valentine’s.Valentine's card from 1810, from Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. (AP photo)Actually, gift giving for foreigners can be a bit of a minefield at any time of the year because of cultural misunderstandings, like white being the color of death, while black is more often associated with death in the West. The good news is cards, chocolates, and flowers (but not funeral flowers!) generally get a pass.If in doubt, ask a friend. Happy Valentine’s.",2023/02/13,7837,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808804,"EU foresees economy improving, but inflation still painful","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Union's executive branch has raised its economic growth forecast for the year, saying Europe will narrowly avoid a recession and has already passed its inflation peak as natural gas prices fall from astronomical highs. 

            But the European Commission warned Monday that the high prices plaguing consumers will keep holding back the economy for months to come. 

            Growth for 2023 should reach 0.8% for the 20 EU countries that use the euro currency, the commission said in its winter economic outlook. That is an increase from 0.3% expected in the last outlook from November. 











            For the broader 27-nation bloc, growth was estimated at 0.9%, also up from 0.3%. 

            Getting credit for the improvement was the high level of natural gas storage that has alleviated fears of energy rationing over the winter. European utilities and governments raced to line up new supplies after Russia cut off most natural gas deliveries to Europe amid the war in Ukraine. 

            Prices for natural gas — used to heat homes, fuel industry and generate electricity — reached record levels last summer, rising to 18 times above their pre-crisis level, and led households and businesses to reduce their use. Prices have since fallen from that peak, though they are some three times higher than before Russia started massing troops on Ukraine's border. 

            The economy is expected avoid a contraction in the current January-to-March quarter, the commission said. Coming after growth of 0.1% in the final three months of last year, that indicates there won't be a technical recession as was once feared. 

            Two straight quarters of shrinking economic output is one definition of recession, though the economists on the eurozone business cycle dating committee use a broader range of data such as unemployment and the depth of the downturn when assessing whether to declare a recession.

            Paolo Gentiloni, European commissioner for economy, cited the effort to line up new supplies of natural gas and a 25% drop in use because of high prices and conservation measures as the major achievement behind the improved outlook.

            “What we were able to manage was the energy independence from Russia,” he said at a news conference. 

            While the outlook is “less negative than we expected,” Gentiloni said, “this doesn’t mean we have a positive overall outlook.”

            He said “inflation will release its grip on purchasing power only gradually.” And the possibility that the war in Ukraine could further disrupt the economy is a risk to growth that “is not easy to predict.”

            Headwinds to the economy are strong, the commission said in its report. Energy costs and consumer prices are still high even after three straight months of decline in annual inflation from the 10.6% peak in October to 8.5% in January.

            On top of that, the European Central Bank is sharply raising interest rates to contain inflation, a step that dampens growth by raising the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses.FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Union's executive branch has raised its economic growth forecast for the year, saying Europe will narrowly avoid a recession and has already passed its inflation peak as natural gas prices fall from astronomical highs.But the European Commission warned Monday that the high prices plaguing consumers will keep holding back the economy for months to come.Growth for 2023 should reach 0.8% for the 20 EU countries that use the euro currency, the commission said in its winter economic outlook.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808816,Pioli: Right time for Milan to face Tottenham in CL,"MILAN (AP) — AC Milan might be turning things around just in time for its Champions League meeting with Tottenham, which is also trying to shake off its poor domestic form. 

            Milan heads into its first Champions League knockout match since 2014 on the back of a 1-0 win over Torino in Serie A, which ended a run of four straight losses in all competitions. 

            It was far from a perfect performance by Milan but coach Stefano Pioli said it helped “cleanse our spirit” after the poor run. Milan had been winless in seven matches stretching back to Jan. 4, a run that included two losses to bitter rival Inter Milan — one in the league and one in the Italian Super Cup — and also saw the Rossoneri knocked out of the Italian Cup by Torino.











            “It has been a difficult month, for us and the whole club,” Pioli said. “We have to raise our game because the Champions League is more demanding and Tottenham is a strong team. It will be tough but it comes at the right time for us.”

            Tottenham, meanwhile, travels to Italy for Tuesday’s round-of-16 match having lost three of its past five Premier League games. The latest was Saturday’s dispiriting 4-1 loss at struggling Leicester, which halted the momentum of a surprising win over Manchester City in the previous round.

            Spurs coach Antonio Conte was back in the dugout for that match following surgery to remove his gallbladder. He now faces a return to Italy and San Siro, where he led Inter to the league title in 2021. The Italian coach also steered Juventus to three Serie A titles.

            “It’s good for the club, the team and everyone to have Antonio back,” assistant coach assistant Cristian Stellini said. “He has to take it easy a bit, he cannot use his energy 100% and we have to give something more to cover the gap.""

            Conte has a great record against Milan, having won 10 of 14 games against the Rossoneri as coach and only losing one.

            The two sides have been drawn against each other once before in the Champions League, at the same stage in 2011. Tottenham progressed 1-0 on aggregate after Peter Crouch scored at San Siro in the first leg.

            Tottenham will be without midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur after he was forced off in the second half of Saturday’s match with a knee injury.

            Pioli could welcome defender Fikayo Tomori and midfielder Ismaël Bennacer back from injury after the pair trained on Sunday.

            “It’s clear we are still far away from our best level, not least in psychological terms,” Pioli said. “But we’ll be ready to play to the best of our ability and with both great energy and enthusiasm.”

Milan had been winless in seven matches stretching back to Jan. 4, a run that included two losses to bitter rival Inter Milan — one in the league and one in the Italian Super Cup — and also saw the Rossoneri knocked out of the Italian Cup by Torino.“It has been a difficult month, for us and the whole club,” Pioli said. “We have to raise our game because the Champions League is more demanding and Tottenham is a strong team. It will be tough but it comes at the right time for us.”Tottenham, meanwhile, travels to Italy for Tuesday’s round-of-16 match having lost three of its past five Premier League games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808817,"Portugal church sex abuse study: Victims may number 4,800","LISBON, Portugal (AP) — More than 4,800 individuals may have been victims of child sex abuse in the Portuguese Catholic Church and 512 alleged victims have already come forward with their stories, an expert panel looking into historic abuse in the church said Monday.

            Senior Portuguese church officials had previously claimed that only a handful of cases had occurred.

            Senior clergymen sat in the front row of the auditorium where panel members read out some of the harrowing accounts of alleged abuse included in their final report. There were vivid and shocking descriptions.











            The Independent Committee for the Study of Child Abuse in the Catholic Church, set up by Portuguese bishops just over a year ago, looked into alleged cases from 1950 onward. Portuguese bishops are due to discuss the report at an extraordinary meeting on March 3.

            The statute of limitations has expired on most of the alleged cases. Only 25 allegations were passed to prosecutors, the panel said.

            The report, criticized by some as long overdue, came four years after Pope Francis gathered church leaders from around the world at the Vatican to address the sex abuse crisis in the church.

            That meeting was held more than 30 years after the scandal first erupted in Ireland and Australia and 20 years after it hit the United States.

            Bishops and other Catholic superiors in many parts of Europe at the time continued to deny that clergy sex abuse existed or insisted on giving little weight to the problem.

            The head of the Portuguese Bishops Conference, Bishop José Ornelas, asked the victims for forgiveness and apologized for the church having failed to grasp the scale of the problem.

            Child sex abuse is a “heinous crime,” Ornelas said in a statement he read out later Monday, adding: “It is an open wound which pains and embarrasses us.”

            The panel regretted that the Vatican had taken so long to grant access to church archives. Permission came only in October, giving the panel just three months to go through written evidence of abuse.

            Pedro Strecht, a psychiatrist who headed the panel in Portugal, said it estimates the true number of victims during the period under study as being at least at 4,815. That extrapolation was made on potential other victims mentioned by those victims who came forward.

            The panel is not publishing the names of the victims, the identities of the alleged abusers, or the places the abuses allegedly happened. However, it is to send to bishops by the end of the month a list of alleged abusers who are still active in the church.

            The final report includes a separate — and confidential — annex of all the names of church members reported to the committee that is being sent to the Portuguese Bishops Conference and to the police.

            The Portuguese church hasn’t said whether it intends to pay compensation to any victims.

            The six-person committee included psychiatrists, a former Supreme Court judge and a social worker.

            The report said that 77% of the abusers were priests, with other perpetrators being linked to church institutions. It added that 77% of victims didn’t report the abuse to church officials and only 4% went to the police. Most of the abuse took place when the victims were in early adolescence.

            It said 48% of those who came forward had spoken about the abuse for the first time. Most of the alleged victims were male, though 47% were female, the report said.

            It said there were places in Portugal, such as some seminaries and religious institutions, that were “real blackspots” for abuse.

            Information about child sex abuse found in ecclesiastical records should be regarded as “the tip of the iceberg,” the report said.

            Those records frequently do not refer directly to abuse, even when discussing it, and many incidents appear to have been dealt with informally, the panel said.

            The panel recommended that the statute of limitations on such crimes be extended to at least 30 years from the current 23 years.LISBON, Portugal (AP) — More than 4,800 individuals may have been victims of child sex abuse in the Portuguese Catholic Church and 512 alleged victims have already come forward with their stories, an expert panel looking into historic abuse in the church said Monday.Senior Portuguese church officials had previously claimed that only a handful of cases had occurred.Senior clergymen sat in the front row of the auditorium where panel members read out some of the harrowing accounts of alleged abuse included in their final report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808818,Australian inquiry asks whether mom smothered her 4 children,"SYDNEY (AP) — A retired Australian judge investigating the convictions of a mother in the deaths of her four children was told Monday there is a “reasonable hypothesis” that could cast doubt on her guilt.

            The inquiry by retired New South Wales state Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Bathurst into Kathleen Folbigg’s convictions in 2003 resumed on Monday after a two-day hearing in November.

            It is the second judicial investigation into Folbigg’s convictions and reflects advances in genetic science that add weight to her argument that her four children died over a decade from natural causes, not from being smothered.











            Counsel assisting the inquiry, Sophie Callan, on Monday summarized the evidence that genetic experts are expected to give this week.

            No witness is expected to give definitive evidence about the causes of death of the four children, and Bathurst will have to use his judgment, Callan said.

            Bathurst asked, “There’s, even on this evidence, whichever way you look at it, a reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt?”

            Callan replied that the evidence would suggest just a hypothesis.

            The first inquiry by retired District Court Chief Justice Reginald Blanch concluded in 2019 that there was no reasonable doubt that Folbigg, now age 55, murdered her children Sarah, Laura and Patrick and was guilty of the manslaughter of her firstborn, Caleb.

            The start of the new inquiry in Sydney in November focused on a rare CALM2 genetic variant present in both daughters. Research into the variant published in 2021, after Blanch’s report, found that it might cause heart arrhythmias and sudden death in young children.

            Experts are expected to tell the inquiry that all four children, but not their mother, also carried another genetic variant, identified in 2018, which could be an aggravating factor in cardiac death.

            Folbigg is serving a 30-year prison sentence which will expire in 2033. She will become eligible for parole in 2028.

            New South Wales Attorney General Mark Speakman ordered the new inquiry last May when he rejected Folbigg’s petition for a pardon.

            That petition said it was “based on significant positive evidence of natural causes of death” and was signed by 90 scientists, medical practitioners and related professionals.

            If Bathurst finds reasonable doubt of Folbigg’s guilt, he can report to the Court of Criminal Appeals, which could consider quashing her convictions.SYDNEY (AP) — A retired Australian judge investigating the convictions of a mother in the deaths of her four children was told Monday there is a “reasonable hypothesis” that could cast doubt on her guilt.The inquiry by retired New South Wales state Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Bathurst into Kathleen Folbigg’s convictions in 2003 resumed on Monday after a two-day hearing in November.It is the second judicial investigation into Folbigg’s convictions and reflects advances in genetic science that add weight to her argument that her four children died over a decade from natural causes, not from being smothered.Counsel assisting the inquiry, Sophie Callan, on Monday summarized the evidence that genetic experts are expected to give this week.No witness is expected to give definitive evidence about the causes of death of the four children, and Bathurst will have to use his judgment, Callan said.Bathurst asked, “There’s, even on this evidence, whichever way you look at it, a reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt?”Callan replied that the evidence would suggest just a hypothesis.The first inquiry by retired District Court Chief Justice Reginald Blanch concluded in 2019 that there was no reasonable doubt that Folbigg, now age 55, murdered her children Sarah, Laura and Patrick and was guilty of the manslaughter of her firstborn, Caleb.The start of the new inquiry in Sydney in November focused on a rare CALM2 genetic variant present in both daughters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808820,Netanyahu launches contentious overhaul as thousands protest,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israelis on Monday protested outside the parliament building in a show of force against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as his government formally launched its contentious plan to overhaul the country’s legal system.

            The boisterous demonstration outside the Knesset, coupled with a stormy committee vote inside the building, deepened the divisions over Netanyahu’s program. The plan has triggered weeks of mass protests, prompted condemnations from wide swaths of Israeli society and drawn a statement of concern from President Joe Biden.

            Netanyahu and his allies say the country’s unelected judges have too much power and need to be reined in. His opponents say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, has a deep conflict of interest. They say his planned overhaul will destroy the country’s democratic checks and balances and is a poorly disguised plot to make his criminal case go away.











            Monday’s demonstration was the largest to take place in the city in years. Thousands of people poured into Jerusalem from around the country on jam-packed trains, hoisting flags and chanting “democracy” as they exited the station. 

            “They hear us,” opposition leader Yair Lapid told the crowd as he pointed at the parliament. “They hear our strength and our commitment. They pretend they don’t hear. They pretend they’re not afraid. But they hear and they are afraid.”

            Organizers claimed that more than 100,000 people joined Monday’s rally. They included Arab, women’s rights and LGBTQ activists as well as opposition parties. They were joined by groups of academics, army reservists, students, high-tech employees, retirees and young families. 

            The crowd was noisy, blowing horns, chanting “democracy,” singing and whistling. But the event passed without incident and police said there were no arrests.

            Many protesters carried the blue and white Israeli flag and posters decrying what they said was an attack on the country’s democratic institutions. “Shame! Shame!” and “Israel will not be a dictatorship,” they chanted. 

            “The people won’t have it,” said Boaz Zarki, a demonstrator in Jerusalem. “The separation of authority is critical to the existence of democracy.”

            Other large demonstrations were held in cities around the country. 

            Despite a call by Israel’s figurehead president to freeze the legislation and begin a dialogue with the opposition, Netanyahu pressed ahead with his program.

            As protesters were gathered outside, a parliamentary committee controlled by a Netanyahu ally passed the first pieces of legislation connected to the plan. 

            They include a proposal to give the Netanyahu-dominated legislature control over judicial appointments. Currently, judges are appointed by an independent committee that includes lawyers, politicians and judges. 

            A second proposal would take away the Supreme Court’s authority to review the legality over major pieces of legislation known as “Basic Laws.” 

            Still in the works is another proposal to give parliament the power to overturn Supreme Court decisions it does not like. Opponents say the proposal would push Israel toward a system like Hungary and Poland in which the leader wields control over all major levers of power. 

            During the unruly committee vote, opposition members stood on the conference table, pounded the desks and shouted “shame!” The committee chairman, Simcha Rothman, a member of a far-right religious party, ejected several opposition politicians, at least two of whom were dragged away by security guards.

            Monday’s vote sends the first pieces of legislation to the full parliament – which would have to pass them again in three separate votes. 

            The first such vote is expected to take place next Monday. Netanyahu controls a solid majority in parliament, and there appears to be little to prevent him from pushing ahead. Nonetheless, Monday’s developments set the tone for what could lie ahead.

            Netanyahu accused the opposition of “intentionally dragging the country to anarchy,” but also appeared to hold out the possibility of dialogue with his opponents.

            “Get a hold of yourselves. Show some responsibility and leadership,” he said. “The majority of Israeli citizens don’t want anarchy. The majority of citizens want a substantive discussion, and in the end, they want unity.”

            But Netanyahu’s opponents didn’t take his words seriously.

            Merav Michaeli, leader of the opposition Labor Party, said there could be no dialogue until Netanyahu freezes the legislation. “Anything else is surrender. Anything else destroys the protests,” she said.

            At a joint news conference held by opposition leaders, former Defense Minister Benny Gantz said that opposition party leaders were united “against the targeted assassination of democracy.” 

            Netanyahu and his allies took office in December after the country’s fifth election in less than four years. That election, like its predecessors, focused on Netanyahu’s fitness for office at a time when he is facing serious criminal charges. 

            Netanyahu has lashed out at the country’s police, prosecutors and judges, saying he is the victim of a deep-state style conspiracy to oust him. His critics say he is motivated by a personal grudge and the plan will put Israel on a path similar to authoritarian countries like Hungary and Poland.

            Eliad Shraga, chairman of the Movement for Quality Government, a civil-society group that organized Monday’s demonstration, said the gathering was meant to send a message of support to the Supreme Court and a warning to the Knesset. 

            “We came to demonstrate against the very aggressive legislation, which is going to turn Israel from a liberal democracy into a fascist dictatorship,” he said.JERUSALEM (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israelis on Monday protested outside the parliament building in a show of force against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as his government formally launched its contentious plan to overhaul the country’s legal system.The boisterous demonstration outside the Knesset, coupled with a stormy committee vote inside the building, deepened the divisions over Netanyahu’s program.

Global study on “Palliative Care” provides a comprehensive assessment of the market’s current and future state.The Palliative Care Market was valued at USD 12.82 Bn. The total revenue will grow by 8.93% from 2023 to 2030, to reach nearly USD 24.42 billion in 2030.Palliative care refers to the treatment of patients and their loved ones who are suffering from life-threatening diseases. Palliative care services are designed to alleviate and prevent suffering by diagnosing and treating pain as soon as possible. Palliative care also supports patients and their career through a team approach. Palliative care is necessary for patients with chronic conditions such as cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, kidney disease, chronic liver disease, or other serious diseases.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-palliative-care-market-qy/327746/#requestforsampleThe rapid innovations and changes to the global health system have led to the creation and implementation policies that encourage palliative care services within vital healthcare facilities. Medicare Hospice Benefits (MHB), for example, covers 87 percent patient days in hospices and palliative care facilities. The remaining costs are covered by Medicaid, self pay, private insurers and charity care. The integration of palliative care at both the primary and second levels of health care has helped to increase its acceptance in patient care.Medicare can also save money through home-based palliative services. This helps to reduce hospitalizations as well as expenditures. As financial and quality incentives are made available for home-based palliative services, both payers and health systems are more interested in palliative models. Patients and their families have become more eligible for palliative services as a result of the creation of palliative groups. Coordinated care is a multidisciplinary approach that addresses pain and symptoms, as well as grief counselling. It focuses on improving quality of life, assisting patients with daily assistance, proactive medical care and managing disease.Private Residence Care

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808882,Hikers face legal woes after building campfire in Taiwan forest,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A hiking group of 21 members faces legal woes after they were caught building a campfire on a forest plantation in central Taiwan on Feb. 3.The Dongshih Forest District Office said in a press release that it received notification around 11 a.m. on Feb. 3 that remnants of a campfire were found in an afforestation area under its jurisdiction. The office immediately dispatched seven personnel from its Anmashan Workstation to investigate.The workstation personnel, along with police officers, arrived at the scene at around noon and found smoke coming out of a pile of burning wood and a number of cooking utensils on the ground. They collected evidence and waited until the hikers returned to the camp at around 3 p.m.The office said the location of the incident was a forestation site, and the wood used for the campfire was likely small-diameter logs left behind during the forestation. The tree species forested there include fir, red cypress, and cedar trees, all of which are oily trees with fragrant smells and are classified as first class conifers.If a campfire accidentally triggered a forest fire, it would cause huge losses, and would be difficult to put out, the office said, adding that starting a fire in the forest violates the Forestry Act, and according to Article 56, is punishable by a fine between NT$120,000 (US$3,960) and NT$600,000.In addition, taking wood in the forest to build a fire is considered theft and violates Article 50 of the same law, which stipulates, ""Those who steal primary forest products or forest by-products shall be liable to at least six months but no more than five years of imprisonment; in addition to a penalty of at least NT$300,000 but no more than NT$6,000,000.""If the offenses are committed on primary forest products that are regarded as precious wood, the penalty shall be increased by one half, according to the act.The case has been referred to police for further investigation, the office said.According to the office, the dry season has come, and there has been no rainfall in the central mountainous area for nearly two months. The forest land is quite dry, and a spark may cause a forest fire.(Dongshih Forest District Office photos)",2023/02/13,1761,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808890,UK to review security after unknown objects puzzle N America,"LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Monday that the government would do “whatever it takes” to protect the country, as the U.K. announced a security review after several unidentified objects were shot down in the skies over North America.

            Asked about the objects, Sunak said he wouldn’t “comment in detail on security matters, but people should be reassured that we have all the capabilities in place to keep the country safe,” including a quick-reaction force of Typhoon fighter jets.

            Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said “the U.K. and her allies will review what these airspace intrusions mean for our security.""











            He said ""this development is another sign of how the global threat picture is changing for the worse.”

            U.S. fighter jets shot down an object over Lake Huron on Sunday – the fourth such downing over the U.S. or Canada this month.

            On Feb. 4, the U.S. military downed what officials say was a Chinese spy balloon off the South Carolina coast after tracking it for several days across North America.

            On Friday, F-22 jets shot down a “car-sized” object in U.S. airspace off the coast of Alaska, and on Saturday Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had ordered a U.S. warplane to shoot down an unidentified object – later described as a balloon — high over the Yukon territory in northwest Canada.

            The item downed Sunday was described as octagonal, with strings hanging off, but had no discernable payload.

            The three objects were much smaller in size, different in appearance and flew at lower altitudes than the suspected spy balloon — one of what U.S. officials say is a fleet of Chinese aerial surveillance balloons that have targeted more than 40 countries over several years.

            China says the unmanned balloon was a civilian meteorological airship that had blown off course.

            British Transport Minister Richard Holden said Monday that it was “possible” China had flown spy balloons over the U.K. He said Britain would deal “robustly” with China, which he called “a hostile state.”

            A senior U.S. military official said Sunday that part of the reason for the repeated shootdowns is a “heightened alert” and closer scrutiny of the skies following discovery of the spy balloon. 

            Pentagon officials say the three objects downed since then posed no security threats, but so far little is known about them and officials have ruled nothing out — not even UFOs.LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Monday that the government would do “whatever it takes” to protect the country, as the U.K. announced a security review after several unidentified objects were shot down in the skies over North America.Asked about the objects, Sunak said he wouldn’t “comment in detail on security matters, but people should be reassured that we have all the capabilities in place to keep the country safe,” including a quick-reaction force of Typhoon fighter jets.Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said “the U.K. and her allies will review what these airspace intrusions mean for our security.""He said ""this development is another sign of how the global threat picture is changing for the worse.”U.S. fighter jets shot down an object over Lake Huron on Sunday – the fourth such downing over the U.S. or Canada this month.On Feb. 4, the U.S. military downed what officials say was a Chinese spy balloon off the South Carolina coast after tracking it for several days across North America.On Friday, F-22 jets shot down a “car-sized” object in U.S. airspace off the coast of Alaska, and on Saturday Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had ordered a U.S. warplane to shoot down an unidentified object – later described as a balloon — high over the Yukon territory in northwest Canada.The item downed Sunday was described as octagonal, with strings hanging off, but had no discernable payload.The three objects were much smaller in size, different in appearance and flew at lower altitudes than the suspected spy balloon — one of what U.S. officials say is a fleet of Chinese aerial surveillance balloons that have targeted more than 40 countries over several years.China says the unmanned balloon was a civilian meteorological airship that had blown off course.British Transport Minister Richard Holden said Monday that it was “possible” China had flown spy balloons over the U.K. He said Britain would deal “robustly” with China, which he called “a hostile state.”A senior U.S. military official said Sunday that part of the reason for the repeated shootdowns is a “heightened alert” and closer scrutiny of the skies following discovery of the spy balloon.Pentagon officials say the three objects downed since then posed no security threats, but so far little is known about them and officials have ruled nothing out — not even UFOs.",2023/02/13,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808891,Ex-CEO of Germany's Wirecard denies charges at fraud trial,"BERLIN (AP) — The former CEO of payments company Wirecard denied having known anything about false accounting at the firm as he testified Monday at his trial over its collapse in 2020.

            Wirecard was long the darling of Germany’s fintech scene until it filed for insolvency, saying that 1.9 billion euros ($2 billion) that had been on its balance sheet could not be found. The case exposed flaws in the country's financial oversight bodies.

            Ex-CEO Markus Braun, along with two other former managers, is charged with fraud amid allegations that much of Wirecard’s revenue and assets were faked.











            “I had no knowledge of falsification or embezzlement,” Braun told the Munich state court, German news agency dpa reported. Of the missing 1.9 billion euros, Braun said: “I had no knowledge of this money being misappropriated.”

            It was Braun's first testimony since the trial opened in December. There are no formal pleas in the German legal system.

            Prosecutors allege that Braun signed off on financial reports he knew were false. The firm allegedly booked nonexistent revenue it attributed to multiple partnerships in other countries and used fake documents to show it had funds that it did not, they contend.

            The fraud cost banks 3.1 billion euros in loans and writedowns, according to prosecutors.

            One of the central figures in the case, the company’s former chief operating officer, Jan Marsalek, remains on the run.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808892,Workers get support for Atlantic City casino smoking ban,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Atlantic City casino dealers pushing for a smoking ban received support from several state lawmakers Monday at a long-awaited hearing on a bill that would end smoking inside the nine casinos.

            Dealers, cocktail servers and other casino workers — some of them with breathing ailments and other health problems they suspect are related to secondhand smoke from casino patrons — testified before a state Senate panel in favor of a law that would close a loophole in the state’s 2006 indoor smoking law. That measure was written specifically to exempt casinos from bans on smoking indoors. Currently, smoking is permitted on 25% of a casino floor in Atlantic City.

            Although no action was taken on the bill, numerous lawmakers supported a ban, calling it long overdue.











            Whether to ban smoking is one of the most controversial issues not only in Atlantic City casinos, but in other states where workers have expressed concern about secondhand smoke. They are waging similar campaigns in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

            “It’s immoral for the owners of casinos to think their employees are expendable,” said Sen. Joseph Vitale, the committee’s chairperson. “If you smell it, it’s in your lungs.”

            Democratic Senator Richard Codey was acting governor in 2006 when the indoor smoking law was adopted.

            “Unfortunately, to get that passed I had to agree that casinos could still have smoking,” he said, adding that “it's time” for the state to implement a casino smoking ban.

            Atlantic City's main casino workers' union drove four van loads of workers to the hearing as well, taking 60 of them to the state Capitol as a counterpoint to those calling for a smoking ban. These workers back the industry's position that a smoking ban would place Atlantic City at a competitive disadvantage with casinos in neighboring states.

            The issue is among the most divisive in Atlantic City, where even though casino revenue matched its all time high of $5.2 billion last year, only half that amount was won from in-person gamblers. The other half was won online and must be shared with third parties including tech platforms and sports books.

            Just three of the nine casinos — Borgata, Ocean and Resorts — surpassed their pre-pandemic revenue levels in terms of money won from in-person gamblers last year.

            “I am responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of chips,” said Borgata dealer Pete Naccarelli, one of the leaders of the anti-smoking movement in Atlantic City. “When a player 12 inches away blows a cloud of smoke at me, I can't move, and I'm prohibited from waving the smoke away, a gesture that would be considered rude. We all have people that love us. We don't think it's fair that we should have to choose between a paycheck and our health.”

            Lamont White, another Borgata dealer, has been working in the casinos for 38 years. 

            “Now I'm 60. I realize that people dying in their 40s and 50s is not normal,” he said. “As dealers, we cannot walk away; our job is to take it, no matter how many cigarettes or cigars are lit.”

            Bob McDevitt, president of Local 54 of the Unite Here casino workers union, opposes a smoking ban, saying he wants to preserve the jobs of his members.

            “I would bet everything I have that one year after a smoking ban, we will have a 10 to 15% decline in gambling revenue,” he said. “Of that I am certain. As soon as we did it, Pennsylvania would double down on smoking. It would close one, maybe two casinos in Atlantic City.""

            Cynthia Hallett, president of Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights, said union management does not speak for the majority of its members on a smoking ban, and said the casino industry keeps saying it is the wrong time for such a measure.

            “When will it be time?” she asked.

            The Casino Association of New Jersey submitted written testimony opposing a smoking ban.

            “An immediate smoking ban in New Jersey casinos, while smoking is still permitted in casinos in neighboring states, against the backdrop of an already weakened and worsening economic climate, would endanger thousands of jobs and jeopardize millions of dollars in tax revenue dedicated to seniors and the disabled of New Jersey,” the association's statement read, adding that a smoking ban “could cause a devastating effect.”

            Support for a smoking ban is widespread among New Jersey lawmakers: Identical smoking ban bills are sponsored or co-sponsored by 51 Assembly members and 23 state Senators, representing a bipartisan majority in both chambers.

            The bill needs to be voted upon in committees of the Senate and Assembly, then voted on by the full membership of those legislative bodies before going to the governor. Those hearings and votes have not yet been scheduled. 

            New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has promised to sign the bill if it's passed by the Legislature.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808893,Pakistan set for tax hikes in return for massive IMF bailout,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Cash-strapped Pakistan will impose new taxes of 170 billion rupees this month in a bid for massive bailout, officials and analysts said Monday, even as they warned the new taxes could accelerate the country's spiraling inflation.

            The dire outlook from economists and political analysts comes after the International Monetary Fund delayed the release of a crucial $1.1 billion portion of a 2019 deal worth $6 billion, on hold since December over Pakistan's failure to meet the terms. The latest round of the talks between Pakistan and the IMF concluded Friday with the fund recommending steps including imposing new taxes.

            “The imposition of more taxes means tough days are ahead for the majority of the people in Pakistan who are already facing higher food and energy costs, but there is no other way out if Pakistan needs the IMF loans, and Pakistan desperately needs it,"" said Ehtisham-ul-Haq, a veteran economist. 











            The stalemate in talks between IMF and Pakistan was seen as a blow to the government of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, who is struggling to avoid a default amid a worsening economic crisis and a surge in militant violence. Pakistan already is struggling with the recovery from record-breaking floods, which killed 1,739 people in summer 2022 and destroyed 2 million homes. 

            In January, dozens of countries and international institutions at a U.N.-backed conference in Geneva pledged more than $9 billion to help Pakistan recover and rebuild from devastating summer floods, but economists and Pakistani officials say those funds will be given for the projects, and not in cash.

            Since then, Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has said that his experts were preparing to impose additional taxes and slash subsidies on electricity, gas and more to meet the deal’s terms. 

            Haq, the economist, said Pakistan's inflation rate of 26% will jump to 40% after the imposition of new taxes. But, he said in an interview, “life will become more difficult for the common man if Pakistan fails to revive the IMF bailout without any further delay.""

            Officials say several friendly countries like China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had assured Sharif's government that they will financially help Islamabad — but they too wanted Pakistan to complete the 2019 IMF program. 

            Imtiaz Gul, a senior Pakistani political analyst, said Sharif's government is likely to raise taxes on those who are already paying taxes. 

            “There is a need to broaden the tax base,"" he said, but raising taxes ""will trigger an increase in the prices of all essential items.""

            The government insists that it will impose new taxes in such a way that poor people are not affected. The new taxes will be imposed on those who can afford to pay additional taxes to save the economy, the government said.

            Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to slightly over $2 billion. That’s enough only to pay for imports for 10 days. Officials say Pakistan's talks with IMF will resume virtually later Monday or Tuesday. Sharif last week warned that Pakistan would have difficulty complying with the IMF’s conditions.

            Sharif's predecessor, Imran Khan — now the opposition leader since his ouster through April's no-confidence in Parliament — has been warning that Pakistan could face a Sri Lanka-like situation because of the deepening economic crisis. He has publicly warned that Pakistan could be blackmailed by the world community over the country's nuclear program if Pakistan defaults in the near future.

            Khan insists his government was ousted under a U.S. plot, a charge Washington denies.ISLAMABAD (AP) — Cash-strapped Pakistan will impose new taxes of 170 billion rupees this month in a bid for massive bailout, officials and analysts said Monday, even as they warned the new taxes could accelerate the country's spiraling inflation.The dire outlook from economists and political analysts comes after the International Monetary Fund delayed the release of a crucial $1.1 billion portion of a 2019 deal worth $6 billion, on hold since December over Pakistan's failure to meet the terms.

He has publicly warned that Pakistan could be blackmailed by the world community over the country's nuclear program if Pakistan defaults in the near future.Khan insists his government was ousted under a U.S. plot, a charge Washington denies.",2023/02/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808906,Taiwan's top representative to US returns to brief Legislative Yuan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s envoy to the United States, Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴) returned to Taiwan on Monday (Feb.13) to have tea with legislators from the Foreign and National Defense Committee, per CNA.The first item of interest from legislators is whether a U.S. House special committee on China will visit Taiwan. Hsiao was coy with her answer, noting that more than 30 members of the U.S. Congress have visited Taiwan in the past year. She added that more U.S. congress members could be on their way and her office will accommodate each congressional delegation.Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Ting-yu (王定宇), convener of the Legislative Yuan’s Foreign and National Defense Committee, invited Hsiao to speak with legislators on Monday. Their first meeting was with Legislative Yuan President You Si-kun (游錫堃), and later lawmaker Ker Chien-ming (柯建銘).Hsiao later reminisced about serving four terms as a legislator and was happy to reconnect with colleagues. She says duties in Washington, D.C. prevent her from returning though she eagerly greets colleagues as part of visiting delegations, having met 20 such individuals so far, per CNA.As for whether a newly established U.S. House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party will send a delegation to Taiwan, Hsiao says no details have been discussed, though her office would help with arrangements if asked.The media also asked whether President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) might have a chance to visit the U.S. in the latter half of 2023. Hsiao said that prior to the pandemic, it was routine for the president to visit countries with which Taiwan had diplomatic relations. Such plans may be planned in the future, though none exist at the moment.Additionally, Taiwan media asked whether or not Hsiao would become Vice President Lai Ching-te's (賴清德) running mate in the 2024 presidential election. Hsiao did not directly respond, simply saying her return to Taiwan this time was for official business regarding Taiwan-U.S. relations, and that her time in Taiwan was actually very short.",2023/02/13,856,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808915,Turkey-Syria earthquakes: Rescue phase 'coming to close',"United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths on Monday said the Turkey and Syria earthquake rescue phase is nearing an end, with efforts now set to turn more towards recovery.The two powerful earthquakes that struck border regions of the two countries last Monday have killed at least 35,000, with the UN expecting the number to rise to more than 50,000.Griffiths, who made the comments during a visit to the devastated northern Syrian city of Aleppo, said the disaster response was reaching a turning point.""The rescue phase is dragging live people out from the rubble and finding those who died in the rubble... that's coming to a close,"" he said. ""Now the humanitarian phase, the urgency of providing shelter, psychosocial care, food, schooling, and a sense of the future for these people, that's our obligation now.""Griffiths drew particular attention to the plight of those in Aleppo, a major focal point in the Syrian civil war.""What is the most striking here, is even in Aleppo, which has suffered so much these many years, this moment, that moment... was about the worst that these people have experienced,"" he added.Griffiths also said the UN would have aid moving from government-held regions in Syria to the rebel-held northwest of the country.He said that, so far, the world had failed to provide enough aid to Syria, with people there ""looking for international help that hasn't arrived.''""We have so far failed the people in northwest Syria. They rightly feel abandoned,'' he said, adding, ""My duty and our obligation is to correct this failure as fast as we can.""Here are other updates from Monday, February 13, on the aftermath of the deadly earthquakes:Figures put the latest death toll from the quakes at more than 35,000 on Monday, with search and rescue efforts starting to wind down.Official and medical sources said that at least 31,643 people had died in Turkey and 3,581 in Syria, bringing the confirmed total to 35,224.The first 7.8-magnitude quake struck near the Turkish city of Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border, followed by a 7.5-magnitude tremor.The earthquakes reduced whole neighborhoods of cities in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria to rubble.Rescuers have pulled more survivors from the rubble about a week after the quakes struck.Workers dragged a 40-year-old woman alive from a collapsed building on Monday, some 170 hours after the first of two quakes struck the region, reports said.Teams separately freed a seven-year-old boy and a 62-year-old woman from debris in southeast Turkey's Hatay province. Both had been trapped for 163 hours before their rescue late Sunday.In Kahramanmaras, a rescue team successfully made contact with three survivors, believed to be a mother, daughter and baby, in the ruins of a building.In many areas, the rescuers say they lacked sensors and advanced search equipment having to instead dig through the rubble with shovels or by hand.A representative of people of Turkish descent living in Germany has called for earthquake victims from Turkey to be allowed to enter Germany quickly.""In this difficult situation, the authorities both in Germany and in Turkey should do everything they can to ensure that these people can travel,"" the chairman of the Turkish community in Baden-Württemberg, Gökay Sofuoglu, told the RND news organization.""The need is very great right now,"" Sofuoglu stressed. People of Turkish descent in Germany are also willing to pay for expenses of their relatives from Turkey. What is important now is ""faster processing of visa applications.""The German government has already said it wants to temporarily ease visa restrictions for survivors of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. The easing of rules would apply to those who have close family ties to Germany if they are facing homelessness or were injured.As hope of recovering survivors fades, many grieving Turks are asking why more wasn't done to prepare for the inevitable. DW spoke with survivors living along the Turkish-Syrian border.In light of much-needed aid, President Bashar Assad is accelerating his ambitions to end Syria's international isolation, have sanctions lifted and return to the international stage.rc/fb (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808917,Major corporations still polluting despite climate pledges,"The net-zero emissions plans of 24multinational companies are not only largely misleading, but also distract from a failure to cut climate-wrecking emissions in line with the Paris climate goals.The latest Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor, which is authored by Berlin-based think tank, the New Climate Institute, paints a picture of private sector obfuscation in regard to meaningful decarbonization.The report found the climate strategies of 15 of the 24 companies surveyed were of ""low"" or ""very low integrity"" due to inadequate or ambiguous pledges.Nearly all of the corporations have committed to becoming net-zero or carbon neutral in the next three decades. Net-zero can only be reached after a 90% minimum emissions cut, say the report's authors.Yet on average, the companies will only reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 36%, which is ""wholly insufficient"" to limit temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), said the report.Just five of the 24 companies — H&M Group, Holcim, Stellantis, Maersk, and Thyssenkrupp — commit to decarbonize their emissions by at least around 90% by their respective net-zero target years.Promises of climate neutrality by half of the corporations analyzed – including tech companies Apple, Google and Microsoft, and German postal delivery service Deutsche Post DHL — are highly misleading in that they only refer to 3% of total emissions.""Quite shockingly,"" the largest share of the companies' own emissions are left out, noted Thomas Day, an analyst at the New Climate Institute and report co-author.He said the terminology of net zero ""should really mean deep decarbonization to not mislead investors and consumers.""Only three corporations — shipping company Maersk, and telecommunications firms Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom — commit to deep decarbonization across all their emissions up and down the value chain.""This creates a really difficult situation for the handful of companies that are genuinely ambitious and are taking part in the process with more honesty and integrity, because it's impossible for them to distinguish themselves from companies who are greenwashing,"" said Day.The inadequacy of the pledges is compounded by the fact that two-thirds of the companies plan to rely on offsetting emissions through carbon credits – rather than cutting emissions at the source.The companies, which are all members of the UN initiative, Race to Zero — whose membership has tripled to nearly 9,000 companies since January 2022, noted the report — commonly use forests and other biological carbon reservoirs to offset their emissions.However, the report noted that such offsets might be unable to neutralize GHG emissions in the long term if destroyed by forest fires, for example.Furthermore, two to four planets would be required if all companies were to plan CO2 compensation strategies on a similar scale.The inadequacy but also the ambiguity of the longer term net-zero corporate targets is masking the even bigger failure to make immediate emissions cuts in line with 2030 targets, said the authors.To achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century, the report estimates that companies need to cut emissions 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels.""On average, these 24 companies commit only 15% emissions reductions by 2030,"" noted Thomas Day. ""So it's much closer to business as usual than it is to where we need to be going.""Companies are responding to calls from consumers, shareholders and regulators to decarbonize by setting goals and demonstrating their climate leadership.""[But] the fragmentation of approaches and the general lack of regulation or oversight, means that it is more difficult than ever to distinguish between real climate leadership and unsubstantiated greenwashing,"" according to the report.Moreover, the ambiguity of these net zero targets is ""actually distracting from the grave insufficiency of short-term targets,"" said Day.Since the publication of the first Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor a year ago, there has been little progress in general, said the authors.Of the companies surveyed, German steel giant Thyssen Krupp's climate strategy was rated to have ""moderate"" integrity, but those of Deutsche Post DHL, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz all had ""low"" integrity.As in the 2022 edition of the report, Danish multinational Maersk is the only company whose climate strategy had ""adequate"" integrity, in part through investment in alternative fuels.One of the report's key findings is that intense scrutiny and transparency is vital for ensuring that pledges and claims are credible. Companies must be held accountable if they are not.This should be the job of regulators who cannot rely on public and shareholder pressure to keep corporations in line with climate targets, said Thomas Day.""Regulators, international standard setters and companies need to focus with great determination on the integrity of companies' emissions reduction plans up to 2030,"" he said.""Current corporate plans in no way reflect the urgency for immediate drastic emissions cuts.""Edited by: Jennifer Collins",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808918,China says US flew balloons in its airspace,"The row between China and the United States over surveillance balloons deepened on Monday, with Beijing accusing Washington of more than ten incursions since the beginning of last year.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said US high-altitude balloons had flown over its airspace ""more than ten times without any approval from Chinese authorities.""Wang did not provide further details, but urged the US to ""change its course and introspect itself rather than smear and accuse China.""China's assertion comes after the US shot down what it says was a Chinese ""spy balloon"" off the coast of South Carolina earlier this month.The US military has subsequently shot down three other flying objects over North America.It was not clear where the three aerial objects downed over North America in the past three days came from.""We're calling them objects, not balloons, for a reason,"" General Glen VanHerck, the commander of the US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said on Sunday.He added, however, that part of the reason for the repeated shootdowns was a ""heightened alert'' following the incursion of the balloon from China.VanHerck said the US adjusted its radar so it could track slower objects.""With some adjustments, we've been able to get a better categorization of radar tracks now,"" he said, ""And that's why I think you're seeing these, plus there's a heightened alert to look for this information.""Pentagon officials said they were still trying to determine what exactly the objects were.The downing of the object over North American airspace has no peacetime precedent.""I believe this is the first time within United States or American airspace that NORAD or United States Northern Command has taken kinetic action against an airborne object,"" VanHerck said.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said that the United Kingdom would review its security plans in the wake of the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon into the US.""The UK and her allies will review what these airspace intrusions mean for our security. This development is another sign of how the global threat picture is changing for the worse,"" Wallace told the Telegraph newspaper late on Sunday.The paper reported that the security review would be used to help decide whether changes need to be made to the surveillance of British airspace.lo/fb (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808919,Is CEE winning its inflation battle?,"The countries of the Central and Eastern European region have ""probably already digested"" the majority of economic shocks caused by the was in Ukraine, the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies noted recently. Growth in the region is expected to pick up somewhat and inflation to come down at the end of 2023, the institute said in a report published January 30.In the course of 2023, however, the four CEE countries — comprising Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia — face a series of tough choices, and a complex and uncertain global and regional situation.Central banks in the region have put their interest rate hike cycles on hold as a feared acceleration in inflation appears to have abated at the start of 2023. But the economic fate of the region is heavily tied into how its EU partners to the west cope with rising prices and high interest rates.With around 80% of their trade done with the rest of the EU, all four CEE countries are as likely as ever to catch a cold if Germany and others sneeze.UK-based economic consultancy Capital Economics thinks CEE headline inflation could rise from around 15% now to 20% in the second or third quarters of 2023.How well CEE governments and central banks navigate the tricky course between the dual and often contradictory needs of avoiding recession while dampening inflation will determine how well the CEE countries perform in 2023 and beyond.Poland's gross domestic product (GDP) rose 4.9% in 2022, easing from 6.8% in 2021 —  the year of the post-pandemic rebound. Excellent figures, experts say, when compared to Western Europe, but for 2023 growth forecasts differ widely and are far lower.Dutch bank ING sees GDP expanding just 1%, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its growth forecasts to 0.3%. The World Bank sits in between, forecasting GDP to rise by 0.7% in 2023.The key reasons for the slowdown in Poland are weaker growth in the eurozone  and lower domestic demand largely due to inflation outstripping wage growth, thus reducing purchasing power.Capital Economics said in a note to clients that Poland's economy ""seems to be holding up much better"" than in Hungary and the Czech Republic. But the impact of high inflation, the lagged impact of higher interest rates and subdued global demand are still likely to impede growth.Meanwhile, ING expects Poland's consumer price inflation to rise to 18.1% in January from 16% at the end of 2022, before dropping to about 10% in December.Poland has managed to slash its dependence on Russian gas and oil since the invasion of Ukraine last February, but global energy prices remain a key factor and depend on events in Ukraine and how fast China ends its COVID-19 lockdowns.The EU decision to withhold funds over doubts about Poland's commitment to winding back on controversial judicial reforms also leaves a hole in the coffers that will need to be filled by added borrowing or higher taxes, neither of which will go down well with voters as parliamentary elections beckon in the autumn.The role of monetary policy will then be crucial and closely watched. The expected slowdown in 2023 means that the National Bank of Poland is faced with an awkward choice between monetary tightening to rein in inflation and loosening to boost growth after almost a year of rate hikes.The Czech economy entered recession in the second half of 2022. Economists say this was mainly due to a reduction in consumer spending, following rate rises and higher borrowing costs. As a result the central bank lowered its GDP growth forecast in November from 2.3% to 2.2% for this year.Meanwhile, consumer price inflation rose to 16.2% at the end of 2022 after the government unveiled plans to cap energy price rises, thus boosting spending and borrowing and in turn reducing the space for spending to stimulate growth. It is expected to stay high in 2023, before falling in 2024.Czech National Bank expects inflation to remain strong due mainly to supply-side effects, including higher imported energy and food prices, which should fade over the year. The economy, it said in a recent report, depended heavily on energy imports from Russia before Moscow's attack, leaving Prague desperately seeking alternative suppliers.On the monetary policy side, ING expects the central bank to keep interest rates on hold in February.Strong growth in Hungary in 2022 was driven by domestic demand and a tight labor market. But the economy is expected to slow in 2023, as domestic and external demand fall away.ING revised its 2023 GDP growth forecast to 0.7%, but said any growth poses an inflationary risk due to preexisting structural economic imbalances, aggravated further by a series of shocks, including the war in Ukraine, which have driven up inflation, now among the highest in Europe at 24.5%.ING sees headline inflation peaking just below 26% in the two months of January and February and a 18.5% average rate in 2023.Slovakia's economy has stuttered since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, even though it ""pleasantly surprised in the third quarter,"" as Lubomir Korsnak, chief economist at UniCredit Bank in Bratislava, told news website Euractive recently. However, a ""short recession"" is likely to follow, he added, as indicated by the stagnation in the job market.The European Commission forecasts growth of 0.5% in 2023, and is much more upbeat than the National Bank of Slovakia, which sees activity even declining 1% this year.Being a member of the euro area, Slovakia has fewer means at its disposal to fight inflation, expected to average 13.9% in 2023. It cannot raise the exchange rate of its own currency to mitigate higher consumer prices or set its own policy rate.But, like its CEE neighbors, the crucial decisions rest in balancing spending to boost growth while combating persistent inflation. For small, open economies caught between richer neighbors to the west and a vicious war to the east, the only viable approach is one of vigilance and flexibility.Edited by: Uwe Hessler",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808920,Paris Olympics: Dissident Belarusians abandoned by IOC,"When she was a child, Karyna Kazlouskaya never imagined she would get to compete at the Olympics. Archery was just a hobby for her, one of many sports she practiced with her friends.The more she trained, however, the more she found she was good at it, and the hobby became her profession. A fourth-place finish in the team event at the Tokyo Games in 2021 was the culmination of years of effort and improvement.But what should have been the fulfillment of a dream turned out to be a nightmare for Kazlouskaya. She was riddled with anxiety throughout the competition, because she had dared speak out against the president of her country, Alexander Lukashenko.""There was a lot of stress,"" Kazlouskaya told DW. ""I really wanted to show what I could do because you only have that kind of big competition maybe once in a lifetime. But I wasn't able to relax.""I was under the control of the Belarusian Olympic Committee, and there were a lot of things I wasn't allowed to do. They even put someone with us, probably from the KGB [the Belarusian secret service], who observed us when we were shooting.""At a time when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is pushing for a reintegration of Russian and Belarusian athletes, despite Russia's war in Ukraine, government critics like Kazlouskaya have been left in limbo.She is among more than one hundred Belarusian sportspeople who have fallen foul of Lukashenko's regime. Since his controversial August 2020 re-election, which led to months of mass protests, openly dissenting athletes have been detained, lost their government-sponsored jobs and — as was the case for Kazlouskaya — been forced off national teams.For the purposes of international competition, they are effectively stateless, ostracized for their political views. Even if other athletes from Belarus are eventually allowed to compete in Paris, Kazlouskaya won't be among them as things currently stand.On Friday, Poland's sports minister mooted the idea of creating a refugee team made up of Russian and Belarusian dissident athletes. However, it is unclear how this would work in the context of the current Olympic refugee team, and given the fact that some dissident athletes are in the process of changing, or have changed, nationality.Asked if she felt abandoned by the IOC, Kazlouskaya said: ""Yes, there is that sense,"" adding that two letters she sent to the organization about her plight went unanswered.""They just left us, the people who suffered under the regime. They didn't do anything,"" she said.Ever since signing an open letter in 2020 demanding new elections, Kazlouskaya, 22, says she has endured threats and intimidation. Fearing for her safety, she decided to flee Belarus last April and continue her archery career in neighboring Poland.""The head of the Belarusian federation put a lot of pressure on me,"" Kazlouskaya said. ""He said that I should stop my political activity and stay quiet. I had those sorts of conversations a lot.""Everything got worse after the war started. We started getting checked by the sports ministry for everything. And I realized that either it would be my last year as an athlete or I would have to leave the country.""The IOC's Olympic Charter requires National Olympic Committees (NOCs) to ""take action against any form of discrimination and violence in sport."" Failure to do so can result in a NOC being suspended and its athletes barred from Olympic events.Earlier this month, the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation (BSSF), an opposition athlete-led movement, called on the IOC to defend Belarusian athletes punished by the authorities, declaring that they ""should be granted the right to participate in sports competitions and saved from persecution by the Lukashenko regime for their civic position.""The IOC was approached for comment on the BSSF's declaration and how it is protecting dissident athletes, but it didn't respond before the publication deadline.It also failed to answer why it hadn't suspended the Belarusian NOC — which is headed by Alexander Lukashenko's son, Viktor — for appearing to breach the Olympic Charter.The BSSF was set up to provide financial and legal assistance to opposition athletes. They include Kazlouskaya and sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, who made headlines at the Tokyo Games when she refused to get on a flight back to Belarus, following public criticism of her coaches and an ensuing backlash at home.Like Kazlouskaya, Tsimanouskaya now lives and trains in Poland. She has joined an athletics club in Warsaw and takes part in local competitions with other international athletes.Even though the 26-year-old has obtained Polish citizenship, Olympic rules mean she must wait three years before she can represent her adopted country. Unless the Belarusian NOC waives this 'cooling off' period, she also has little chance of making it to Paris.""The athletes and coaches that currently represent the Belarusian team were chosen according to political principles and not athletic ones,"" Tsimanouskaya told DW.""Only people loyal to the regime are in the team at the moment, people who were approved by the KGB. That violates the principles of Olympism and the rights of athletes like me. It looks like we don't have any rights.""Tsimanouskaya says she too has received ""zero"" support from the IOC. She claims officials haven't contacted her since the day she landed in Poland from Tokyo, and that she never heard back from them after applying for a financial grant through the Olympic solidarity fund.The IOC was offered the chance to respond to Tsimanouskaya's claims. It didn't reply.As far as BSSF director Alexander Opeikin is concerned, it is a classic example of the organization's hypocrisy.""If they speak about 'human rights' regarding official Belarusian and Russian athletes, why don't they care about the rights of other Belarusian athletes who were repressed?"" Opeikin said in a phone message.Tsimanouskaya says she is looking forward to running for Poland one day, a sign of her gratitude to the country for accepting her. But she knows that several of her former teammates aren't in such a position.""It's clear that I won't be representing Belarus again,"" Tsimanouskaya said. ""But at the very least I want my country to be free and for the war to stop.""I would just like the International Olympic Committee to hear our voices, the voices of the athletes who have faced repression. For them to hear our voices and to exercise our rights in some way.""",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808921,US defends decision to shoot down 3 unidentified objects,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House defended the shootdowns of three unidentified objects in as many days even as it acknowledged that officials had no indication the objects were intended for surveillance in the same manner as the high-altitude Chinese balloon that traversed American airspace earlier this month.

            The three objects, including one shot down Sunday over Lake Huron, were unmanned and traveling at such a low altitude as to pose a risk to civilian commercial air traffic, said White House national security spokesman John Kirby. And though the Biden administration does not yet have evidence that they were equipped for spying purposes, officials have not ruled that out either, he said. 

            “These were decisions based purely and simply on what was in the best interests of the American people,” Kirby said Monday of the action to shoot them down.











            Meantime, off the coast of South Carolina where the Chinese balloon was shot down, crews have been able to recover significant debris from the site, according to a statement Tuesday from NORAD and U.S. Northern Command. It said crews have recovered “all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified as well as large sections of the structure.”

            The weeks-long succession of objects, starting with a giant white orb first detected over U.S. skies in late January, has puzzled American officials and stirred curiosity around the world. Though the three most recent objects differed in size, maneuverability and other characteristics from the surveillance balloon shot down Feb. 4 off the Carolina coast, officials moved to eliminate each one from the sky — actions that Pentagon officials believe have no peacetime precedent.

            “Because we have not been able to definitively assess what these most recent objects are, we acted out of an abundance of caution to protect our security, our interests and flight safety,” Kirby said.

            One possibility that the U.S. has been able to rule out is any connection to extraterrestrial activity, the White House said Monday, tamping down lighthearted public speculation about aliens and outer space.

            “I know there have been questions and concerns about this, but there is no — again, no — indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent takedowns,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at the outset of a press briefing.

            Other Western nations are also trying to assess the spate of incidents. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Monday that the government would do “whatever it takes” to protect the country, as the U.K. announced a security review. And Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said “there is some sort of pattern” to the balloon and three other objects, though the U.S. has not echoed that claim. 

            Kirby spoke from the White House podium hours after China alleged that more than 10 U.S. high-altitude balloons have flown in its airspace during the past year without its permission. American officials have vigorously denied the claim, with Kirby saying Monday, “We are not flying surveillance balloons over China.”

            The Chinese allegation came after the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had crossed from above Alaska to South Carolina over a period of multiple days, sparking a new crisis in bilateral relations that have sunk to their lowest level in decades and prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned visit to China.

            At the time, Blinken said he hoped to reschedule the trip at an appropriate time. but there are several upcoming opportunities for high-level talks with the Chinese, including as early as this weekend. Blinken and Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party foreign policy chief, will both be in Munich, Germany, for the annual Munich Security Conference that begins Friday.

            The State Department said no meeting between the men has been scheduled but spokesman Ned Price added that the U.S. is “always assessing options for diplomacy.” “We are open and we are committed to keeping lines of communication open,” he told reporters.

            The latest of the three objects was shot down Sunday over Lake Huron after being detected a day earlier over Montana. 

            On Friday, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined U.S.-Canada organization known as NORAD that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations, detected and shot down an object near sparsely populated Deadhorse, Alaska.

            Later that evening, NORAD detected a second object flying at a high altitude over Alaska, U.S. officials said. It crossed into Canadian airspace Saturday and was over the Yukon, a remote territory, when it was ordered shot down by Trudeau.

            In both of those incidents, the objects were flying at roughly 40,000 feet (12,000 meters). The object on Sunday was flying at about 20,000 feet (6,000 meters). 

            None of the three most recent objects has been recovered, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters in Brussels, where he was scheduled to attend a NATO defense ministers meeting this week.

            Austin said weather has impeded recovery efforts in Alaska, while in Canada the object was shot down in a very remote area that was also impeding efforts. In Alaska, where the object landed on sea ice, wind chill and safety concerns “are dictating recovery timelines,” he said.

And though the Biden administration does not yet have evidence that they were equipped for spying purposes, officials have not ruled that out either, he said.“These were decisions based purely and simply on what was in the best interests of the American people,” Kirby said Monday of the action to shoot them down.Meantime, off the coast of South Carolina where the Chinese balloon was shot down, crews have been able to recover significant debris from the site, according to a statement Tuesday from NORAD and U.S. Northern Command. It said crews have recovered “all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified as well as large sections of the structure.”The weeks-long succession of objects, starting with a giant white orb first detected over U.S. skies in late January, has puzzled American officials and stirred curiosity around the world. Though the three most recent objects differed in size, maneuverability and other characteristics from the surveillance balloon shot down Feb. 4 off the Carolina coast, officials moved to eliminate each one from the sky — actions that Pentagon officials believe have no peacetime precedent.“Because we have not been able to definitively assess what these most recent objects are, we acted out of an abundance of caution to protect our security, our interests and flight safety,” Kirby said.One possibility that the U.S. has been able to rule out is any connection to extraterrestrial activity, the White House said Monday, tamping down lighthearted public speculation about aliens and outer space.“I know there have been questions and concerns about this, but there is no — again, no — indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent takedowns,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at the outset of a press briefing.Other Western nations are also trying to assess the spate of incidents. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Monday that the government would do “whatever it takes” to protect the country, as the U.K. announced a security review. And Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said “there is some sort of pattern” to the balloon and three other objects, though the U.S. has not echoed that claim.Kirby spoke from the White House podium hours after China alleged that more than 10 U.S. high-altitude balloons have flown in its airspace during the past year without its permission. American officials have vigorously denied the claim, with Kirby saying Monday, “We are not flying surveillance balloons over China.”The Chinese allegation came after the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had crossed from above Alaska to South Carolina over a period of multiple days, sparking a new crisis in bilateral relations that have sunk to their lowest level in decades and prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned visit to China.At the time, Blinken said he hoped to reschedule the trip at an appropriate time. but there are several upcoming opportunities for high-level talks with the Chinese, including as early as this weekend. Blinken and Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party foreign policy chief, will both be in Munich, Germany, for the annual Munich Security Conference that begins Friday.The State Department said no meeting between the men has been scheduled but spokesman Ned Price added that the U.S. is “always assessing options for diplomacy.” “We are open and we are committed to keeping lines of communication open,” he told reporters.The latest of the three objects was shot down Sunday over Lake Huron after being detected a day earlier over Montana.On Friday, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined U.S.-Canada organization known as NORAD that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations, detected and shot down an object near sparsely populated Deadhorse, Alaska.Later that evening, NORAD detected a second object flying at a high altitude over Alaska, U.S. officials said. It crossed into Canadian airspace Saturday and was over the Yukon, a remote territory, when it was ordered shot down by Trudeau.In both of those incidents, the objects were flying at roughly 40,000 feet (12,000 meters). The object on Sunday was flying at about 20,000 feet (6,000 meters).None of the three most recent objects has been recovered, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters in Brussels, where he was scheduled to attend a NATO defense ministers meeting this week.Austin said weather has impeded recovery efforts in Alaska, while in Canada the object was shot down in a very remote area that was also impeding efforts. In Alaska, where the object landed on sea ice, wind chill and safety concerns “are dictating recovery timelines,” he said.____Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Colleen Long and Matthew Lee in Washington and Tara Copp in Brussels contributed to this report.",2023/02/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808922,Skiers seek climate change moves: 'The seasons have shifted',"COURCHEVEL, France (AP) — Overall World Cup winners Mikaela Shiffrin, Federica Brignone and Aleksander Aamodt Kilde are among nearly 200 athletes from multiple disciplines who have signed a letter addressed to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation demanding action over climate change.

            The letter was delivered during the skiing world championships after warm weather and a lack of snow wiped out nearly a month of racing at the start of this season, with preseason training on melting European glaciers heading toward extinction and the impact of climate change on the schedule being seen even in January.

            “It’s about time to address a really important topic,” Kilde said after earning a silver medal in downhill on Sunday. “We see that the world is changing. We see also the impact of our sport. … I want the future generations to experience winter and to be able to do what I do.”











            
                The letter was written by Austrian downhiller Julian Schütter, an ambassador for the nonprofit organization Protect Our Winters, known as POW.

            “We are already experiencing the effects of climate change in our everyday lives and our profession,” the athletes said in the letter. “The public opinion about skiing is shifting towards unjustifiability. … We need progressive organizational action. We are aware of the current sustainability efforts of FIS and rate them as insufficient.”

            Olympic cross-country skiing champion Jessie Diggins and Freeride World Tour champions Arianna Tricomi and Xavier de le Rue were also among the letter’s signees.

            “This is our most important race, let’s win it together,” the athletes said.

            In terms of Alpine skiing, the athletes asked the federation, known as FIS, to shift the start of the season from late October to late November and the end of the season from mid-March to late April.

            “The seasons have shifted and in the interest of us all we need to adapt to those new circumstances,” they said.

            Racers also requested a more “geographically reasonable” race schedule to reduce carbon emissions, citing how the men’s circuit will have traveled from Europe to North America and back twice by the end of this season.

            “The races of Beaver Creek in November and those in Aspen in February are 50 kilometers (30 miles) away from each other,” the skiers said, referring to the two Colorado resorts. “Planning those two races one after the other would reduce approximately 1,500 tons of (carbon emissions).""

            The athletes also asked FIS to create a sustainability department.

            There was no immediate response from FIS.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808938,Rights group questions Lockerbie suspect’s extradition,"CAIRO (AP) — A leading rights group urged the U.S. and Libya on Monday to explain the legal basis of a surprise extradition of a former Libyan intelligence officer accused of making the bomb that exploded on Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. 

            U.S. authorities announced in December that they had arrested Abu Agila Mohammad Mas’ud Kheir Al-Marimi on allegations that he was behind the bomb that brought down the New York-bound flight just days before Christmas in 1988. The attack killed 259 people in the air and 11 on the ground.

            Mas’ud’s arrest and extradition has raised questions about the legal basis of how he was picked up, just months after his release from a Libyan prison, and sent to the U.S. American officials have said his transfer was lawful and described it as a culmination of years of cooperation with Libyan authorities.











            Libya and the U.S. don’t have a standing agreement on extradition, so there was no obligation to hand Mas’ud over. Libyan officials told The Associated Press in December that militias loyal to the Tripoli-based Government of National Unity were behind his detention and handover to the U.S.

            Human Rights Watch said in a report that Mas’ud’s saga has raised rights concerns.

            “It appears that no Libyan court ordered or reviewed Mas’ud’s transfer to the US, and he had no chance to appeal, raising serious due process concerns,” said Hanan Salah, associate Middle East and North Africa director at HRW.

            When asked for comment on the HRW report, the Department of Justice referred to its December statement that Mas’ud was wanted by the international police agency Interpol to face the charges.

            Mas’ud was picked up from his home in Tripoli’s Abu Salim district, which is controlled by a network of militias allied with Tripoli-based Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah. Libya’s public prosecutor’s office has challenged the move and opened an investigation.

            
                Dbeibah acknowledged his government’s role in the extradition, calling Mas’ud a “terrorist.” The prime minister, however, did not explain the legality of his arrest or transfer to the U.S. He did not provide hard evidence for any of his allegations.

            The rights group also called for the U.S. to hold a fair trial and allow the suspect to challenge his extradition. It also urged Libyan authorities to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for “violently seizing Mas’ud from his home.”

            Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie less than an hour after takeoff from London on Dec. 21, 1988. Of those killed on the flight, 190 were American citizens.

            A breakthrough in the decades-long investigation came in 2017 when the U.S. Justice Department received a copy of an interview that Mas’ud, a former explosives expert with Libya’s intelligence services, had given to the North African country’s law enforcement in 2012, while in custody following the collapse of Moammar Gadhafi’s decades-long rule.

            Libya has been torn by civil war since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed Gadhafi in 2011. The North African country is divided between Dbeibah’s government and a rival government based in eastern Libya headed by Prime Minister Fathi Bashagha.

            Human Rights Watch said Libya's detention facilities were mired in abuses — including torture and intimidation — to extract confessions during Mas’ud's years in Libyan prisons. It called the U.S. to ensure that “no coerced confessions, including confessions made under torture, are used as part of the prosecution.”

            Mas’ud is the third Libyan intelligence official charged in the U.S. in connection with the Lockerbie attack but the first to appear in an American courtroom. U.S. officials have not explained how he was taken into their custody.

            “Justice for the many victims of Pan Am flight 103 risks being tainted unless the US and GNU governments clarify the legal basis for Mas’ud’s transfer to US custody,” Salah said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808949,Moldovan leader outlines Russian 'plan' to topple government,"CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldova’s president outlined Monday what she described as a plot by Moscow to overthrow her country’s government using external saboteurs, put the nation “at the disposal of Russia” and derail its aspirations to one day join the European Union.

            President Maia Sandu’s briefing comes a week after neighboring Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country had intercepted plans by Russian secret services to destroy Moldova, claims that were later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.

            “The plan for the next period involves actions with the involvement of diversionists with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will undertake violent actions, attack some state buildings, and even take hostages,” Sandu told reporters at a briefing.











            Since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly a year ago, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought to forge closer ties with its Western partners. Last June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.

            Sandu said the alleged Russian plot’s purpose is ""to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power from (Moldova’s capital) Chisinau to an illegitimate one,” which she said “which would put our country at the disposal of Russia, in order to stop the European integration process.”

            She defiantly vowed: “The Kremlin’s attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed.”

            There was no immediate reaction from Russian officials to Sandu’s claims.

            Sandu said that between October and December Moldovan police and its Intelligence and Security Service, the SIS, have intervened in “several cases of organized criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence.”

            Over the past year, non-NATO member Moldova has faced a string of problems. These include a severe energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supplies; skyrocketing inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that have traversed its skies, and debris that has been found on its territory. 

            Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine had entered its airspace on Friday. 

            Last April, tensions in Moldova also soared after a series of explosions in Transnistria — a Russia-backed separatist region of Moldova where Russia bases about 1,500 troops — which had raised fears it could get dragged into Russia’s war in Ukraine. Transnistria has a population of about 470,000 and has been under the control of separatist authorities since a civil war in 1992.

            Sandu claimed that Russia wants to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine, without providing more details, and that information obtained by intelligence services contained what she described as instructions on rules of entry to Moldova for citizens from Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.

            “I assure you that the state institutions are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control,” Sandu said.

            She said that Moldova’s Parliament must adopt draft laws to equip its Intelligence and Security Service, and the prosecutor’s office, “with the necessary tools to combat more effectively the risks to the country’s security.”

            Costin Ciobanu, a political scientist at the Royal Holloway University of London, said it’s likely there “was a huge pressure” on Moldovan authorities to explain more to the public after Zelenskyy first went public with the security information last week in Brussels.

            “Today’s announcement by President Sandu legitimizes the narrative that Moldova needs to focus on its security,” he told The Associated Press. “Probably, based on the evidence they received, they are now more sure of these kinds of attempts by Russians.”

            He added that Sandu going public could also be a preemptive bid to thwart “Russia’s attempts to destabilize Moldova,” in the same way Western officials called out the Kremlin’s war plans before its invasion of Ukraine.

            The president added that the plan would “rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups” and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are currently in exile. Both men last year were sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. 

            Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by Shor's populist, Russia-friendly Shor Party, also rocked Moldova amid the energy crunch. 

            The president’s press briefing Monday comes after the surprise resignation on Friday of Moldova’s Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita. The same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Recean, to succeed Gavrilita.

            On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that “Russia has for years supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova, which often involve weaponizing corruption to further its goals.”

The same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Recean, to succeed Gavrilita.On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that “Russia has for years supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova, which often involve weaponizing corruption to further its goals.”___McGrath reported from Sighisoara, Romania___Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/02/14,,World

            Today is Sunday, Feb. 19, the 50th day of 2023. There are 315 days left in the year. 

            Today’s Highlight in History: 











            On Feb. 19, 2008, an ailing Fidel Castro resigned the Cuban presidency after nearly a half-century in power; his brother Raul was later named to succeed him. 

            On this date: 

            In 1473, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus was born in Torun, Poland. 

            In 1807, former Vice President Aaron Burr, accused of treason, was arrested in the Mississippi Territory, in present-day Alabama. (Burr was acquitted at trial.) 

            In 1878, Thomas Edison received a U.S. patent for “an improvement in phonograph or speaking machines.” 

            In 1942, during World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which paved the way for the relocation and internment of people of Japanese ancestry, including U.S.-born citizens. 

            In 1945, Operation Detachment began during World War II as some 30,000 U.S. Marines began landing on Iwo Jima, where they commenced a successful month-long battle to seize control of the island from Japanese forces. 

            In 1959, an agreement was signed by Britain, Turkey and Greece granting Cyprus its independence.

            In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford, calling the issuing of the internment order for people of Japanese ancestry in 1942 “a sad day in American history,” signed a proclamation formally confirming its termination. 

            In 1985, the British soap opera “EastEnders” debuted on BBC Television.

            In 1986, the U.S. Senate approved, 83-11, the Genocide Convention, an international treaty outlawing “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” nearly 37 years after the pact was first submitted for ratification. 

            In 1997, Deng Xiaoping (dung shah-oh-ping), the last of China’s major Communist revolutionaries, died at age 92. 

            In 2003, an Iranian military plane carrying 275 members of the elite Revolutionary Guards crashed in southeastern Iran, killing all on board.

            In 2017, three former elite U.S. gymnasts, including 2000 Olympian Jamie Dantzscher, appeared on CBS’ “60 Minutes” to say they were sexually abused by Dr. Larry Nassar, a volunteer team physician for USA Gymnastics. (Nassar would be sentenced to decades in prison after hundreds of girls and women said he sexually abused them under the guise of medical treatment.)

            In 2019, President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to develop plans for a new Space Force within the Air Force, accepting less than the full-fledged department he had wanted. 

            Ten years ago: The United Nations said the number of U.S. drone strikes in Afghanistan had risen sharply in 2012 compared with 2011. A bail hearing began in Pretoria, South Africa, for double-amputee Olympian Oscar Pistorius, charged with killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day; the defense said Pistorius had mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder while prosecutors said he had deliberately opened fire on Steenkamp as she cowered behind a locked bathroom door.

            Five years ago: Syrian government forces began a bombing campaign in the northeastern suburbs of Damascus, the last major stronghold for rebels in the area of the capital; the campaign left hundreds dead. President Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney in Utah’s Senate race, a sign that the two Republicans were burying the hatchet after a strained relationship. The U.S. women’s Olympic hockey team reached the title game, shutting out Finland 5-0 in the semifinals. 

            One year ago: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, facing a sharp spike in violence in and around territory held by Russia-backed rebels and increasingly dire warnings that Russia plans to invade, called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet him and seek a resolution to the crisis. Vice President Kamala Harris says the world had arrived at “a decisive moment in history” and that the United States was committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty against the threat of what the West called an imminent threat of invasion by Russia. (Russia would invade Ukraine on Feb. 24.) China's Sui Wenjing and Han Cong captured the Olympic gold medal that eluded them by a razor-thin margin four years earlier, edging Russian rivals Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov to win the pairs figure skating competition at the Beijing Games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808956,"Russia pushes advance on Bakhmut, bolsters defenses in south","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Fierce battles raged outside Bakhmut as Russian forces pushed their advance on the eastern city with heavy shelling and infantry attacks, Ukraine's presidential office said Monday, with at least five civilians killed and as many wounded in action across the war-torn country in the last 24 hours.

            The presidential office said the situation in Bakhmut's northern suburb of Paraskoviivka is “difficult"" as Russian forces continued to pummel the area with “intense shelling and storming actions."" The nearby town of Vuhledar is also under heavy bombardment. 

            Ukrainian soldiers began training on Leopard 2 battle tanks, Germany's Defense Ministry spokeswoman Nadine Krueger said in Berlin. Germany pledged to deliver 14 of the tanks to Ukraine by the end of March.











            Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg again urged Ukraine’s Western allies to ramp up their military support. Asked Monday when he expects Russia’s so-called spring offensive to begin, Stoltenberg said that “the reality is that we have seen the start already.”

            “For me, this just highlights the importance of timing. It’s urgent to provide Ukraine with more weapons,” he told reporters in Brussels. Stoltenberg said that NATO sees “no sign whatsoever that President Putin is preparing for peace” and that arming Ukraine more quickly could save lives by bringing a quicker end to the conflict.

            Russian forces shelled a dozen cities and villages in the Donetsk region in the last 24 hours including in Druzhkivka where a missile hit a hospital and in Pokrovsk where shelling damaged seven houses and a kindergarten.

            “The shelling intensifies, and the Russians accumulate more forces for an attack on peaceful cities,” Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said. “We’re seeing a very tough battle in which the Russians aren’t sparing neither themselves, nor us.”

            In the neighboring Luhansk region, Russian troops pulled back after several days of intense fighting near the key city of Kreminna, although they're not “running out of steam,” Luhansk Gov. Serhii Haidai told Ukrainian television. 

            In the partially occupied southern region of Kherson, artillery fire hit more than 20 cities and villages over the past 24 hours including the regional capital of the same name which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. Two men were killed in one of the villages when their car ran over a landmine. 

            In the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region, Russian shelling of the city of Nikopol killed one person and wounded two others. The shelling also damaged a residential building, a water treatment facility and a college. 

            Meanwhile, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russian forces are bolstering defensive fortifications on the edge of the battlefront in southern Ukraine to protect their flank, despite their focus on the Donbas region.

            “This is demonstrated by continued construction of defensive fortifications in Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk oblasts and deployment of personnel,” the Ministry said in a briefing Monday.

            The U.S. embassy in Moscow issued another warning to U.S. citizens not to travel to Russia for fear of harassment or detention, urged them to leave immediately if they have to travel there. 

            The warning cited “the potential for harassment and the singling out of U.S. citizens for detention by Russian government security officials, the arbitrary enforcement of local law, limited flights into and out of Russia, the Embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, and the possibility of terrorism.”

            The embassy also noted that Russian authorities may sweep up U.S. citizens who also hold Russian citizenship in a possible renewed mobilization of reservists. “Russia may refuse to acknowledge dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, deny their access to U.S. consular assistance, subject them to mobilization, prevent their departure from Russia, and/or conscript them,” the warning said.

            Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, the embassy has regularly issued advisories for U.S. citizens not to travel to Russia and leave if they already have.

            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Monday that a second round of mobilization is looming.

            Although many people have fled the Donetsk province where the bulk of the fighting is concentrated, those who opted to stay depend on sporadic aid deliveries of food and water.

            In the city of Sviatohirsk, in northern Donetsk, the few residents who remain rely on volunteers with the organization World Central Kitchen for food and supplies to cope with freezing temperatures. Sviatohirsk was liberated by Ukrainian forces in September.

            On Sunday, the area was blanketed with snow, concealing the massive destruction from repeated bombardments and heavy fighting.

            Standing by the ruins of the city council building, resident Valeriy Andrievskiy said the building used to be “beautiful.”

            “God forbid our forces retreat and we stay (behind enemy lines). God forbid. I will not survive this one more time,” he said.

            Walking near the ruins of her home, 80-year-old Tamara Yevdokimova said she had been “tortured” by Russian forces.

            “I haven’t been able to hear for five months ... They (Russians) have knocked my teeth out. What can I do?” she said. In her yard were the burned out remnants of a Russian tank.

            People who left the front lines in search of safety continue are still struggling to adapt to a new life elsewhere. In Kyiv, dozens of people from Donbas, Kherson and Kharkiv regions are being helped by Center of Hope and Recovery, an organization that provides temporary homes and meals.

            “These are people who have left in the past what they have earned for years, and this is a very traumatic experience,” said head of the center Anna Harkun. They receive psychological and medical help, while volunteers help them find work and permanent lodging, she added.

            Russian rockets destroyed the home of 80-year-old Anatoly Zakharenko in village Terny in Donetsk. His wife, daughter, and disabled granddaughter were all evacuated and are being helped in the city.

            Missing his hometown, he wrote a poem to ease the pain of displacement. “I will return to you, believe me,” he said, reading it aloud.KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Fierce battles raged outside Bakhmut as Russian forces pushed their advance on the eastern city with heavy shelling and infantry attacks, Ukraine's presidential office said Monday, with at least five civilians killed and as many wounded in action across the war-torn country in the last 24 hours.The presidential office said the situation in Bakhmut's northern suburb of Paraskoviivka is “difficult"" as Russian forces continued to pummel the area with “intense shelling and storming actions.""

They told the officers at the station that they had run out of Taiwan dollars and had no place to change their Japanese yen because banks were closed on weekends.Police officer Shen Po-hao (沈柏豪) said in an interview on Monday that he first searched online and found that people needing currency exchange on Saturdays would have to go to Taipei to get it done.Upon approval from his supervisor, Shen exchanged NT$5,000 (US$165) of his money with the couple for 22,000 Japanese Yen based on the exchange rate at the time.Shen said that he actually planned to travel to Japan and would need Japanese Yen, so he made the exchange with the couple, which let them continue to enjoy their trip in Yilan, per CNA.",2023/02/13,4600,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809015,"Egypt's president praises UAE, seeking to heal Gulf aid rift","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi offered effusive praise Monday for the United Arab Emirates, seeking to repair a rift between Cairo and the Gulf Arab states that have supplied billions of dollars in aid to his nation. 

            El-Sissi has relied on handouts from Gulf Arab states to keep his country's economy afloat since seizing power in 2013. Estimates suggest over $100 billion in Gulf money has gone to Cairo via Central Bank deposits, fuel aid and other support since then. 

            But in recent weeks, Gulf Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, have begun signaling that they want to see more reforms from countries receiving their aid — particularly as nations worldwide struggle with inflation and the fallout from Russia's war on Ukraine. That likely would affect Egypt, which already is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to reform. 











            “We used to give direct grants and deposits without strings attached and we are changing that,"" Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. “We need to see reforms. We are taxing our people. We are expecting also others to do the same, to do their efforts. We want to help but we want you also to do your part.”

            In Kuwait, at least one lawmaker has begun asking about the billions loaned to Egypt and whether any of those funds had been repaid. While leaders in the United Arab Emirates haven't commented publicly on its aid packages, it too has its own development plans and is being asked to deliver aid to earthquake-stricken Turkey and Syria. 

            Earlier this month, an opinion piece in the Egyptian state-owned newspaper Al-Gomhorya argued that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states had no right to criticize the Egyptian government’s handling of its economy.

            “Those barefoot and naked, who wore the most luxurious clothes recently, should not attack Egypt,” wrote editor Abdel Razek Tawfiq. “States whose age does not exceed the age of my youngest son do not have the right to talk about Egypt except with politeness, reverence and respect.”

            The article later disappeared from the newspaper's website, but a firestorm broke out online over the column. During a televised speech last week, el-Sissi talked down the spat.

            ‘’If we can’t say something good we should remain silent,’’ el-Sissi said.

            El-Sissi spoke Monday before the World Government Summit in Dubai at a session attended by both UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The Egyptian president began his remarks acknowledging the two rulers as his “brothers.”

            El-Sissi, onstage at the summit for what was billed as an interview with a journalist, launched into a monologue praising the UAE and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed for his aid after the 2013 overthrow. 

            “The first to highlight is the support I have received from our brothers,” el-Sissi said. “Everything I said would not have been possible without the support we received.” 

            He didn't directly address the controversy around the newspaper column, though toward the end of his remarks he referred elliptically to the dispute.

            “Reality may be different from what we see in the media or what we hear from politicians … even when it’s politicians who think they are in control,” el-Sissi said. “Make sure to thank God for the generosity we have received.” 

            Anwar Gargash, a senior Emirati diplomat, tweeted after el-Sissi's appearance: “Egypt, as usual, is loyal to its brothers and their stances. Appreciation for the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was present in President Sissi’s speech.”

            The Egyptian government has plans to sell stakes in dozens of state-controlled companies, including banks and energy firms. However, the government and the Egyptian military dominate the economy of the Arab world's most-populous country, worrying investors. 

            Egypt meanwhile is allowing its Egyptian pound to devalue, with the currency down nearly 50% over the last year. The country also faces a foreign currency shortage exacerbating its woes and forcing it to postpone major projects.

            El-Sissi, an army general, led the 2013 ouster of then-President Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. His government has cracked down on dissidents and critics, jailing tens of thousands, virtually banning protests and monitoring social media.

            Comer won for her performance as a lawyer dealing with the aftermath of a sexual assault in one-person show “Prima Facie,” which is due to open on Broadway in April.

            At Sunday’s awards Gwyneth Keyworth was named best supporting performer in a play for the role of Scout in “To Kill a Mockingbird.”











            A revival of “Legally Blonde: The Musical” at Regent’s Park Open Air Theater scored acting prizes for Courtney Bowman, as best performer in a musical, and Lauren Drew as best supporting performer.

            Lucy Jones won the prize for best takeover of a role, for “Wicked.” The sole male acting winner was Joe Locke, who won best professional debut for “The Trials.” 

            “Prime Facie,” written by Suzie Miller, was named best new play, while a new production of Mike Bartlett’s “Cock” took the trophy for best revival.

            “Bonnie & Clyde the Musical,” a decade-old Broadway flop revived to acclaim in London’s West End, was named best new musical. An edgy, stripped down production of “Oklahoma!” that came to London after a hit run in New York was named best musical revival.

            The night’s biggest winner was “My Neighbor Totoro,” an adaption of a classic Studio Ghibli animated film, which took five prizes including best direction for Phelim McDermott.

            The awards, now in their 23rd year, are sponsored by theater website WhatsOnStage.com and are decided by public vote.LONDON (AP) — “Killing Eve” star Jodie Comer was named best actor at London’s WhatsOnStage awards, were female performers dominated newly gender-neutral acting categories.Comer won for her performance as a lawyer dealing with the aftermath of a sexual assault in one-person show “Prima Facie,” which is due to open on Broadway in April.At Sunday’s awards Gwyneth Keyworth was named best supporting performer in a play for the role of Scout in “To Kill a Mockingbird.”A revival of “Legally Blonde: The Musical” at Regent’s Park Open Air Theater scored acting prizes for Courtney Bowman, as best performer in a musical, and Lauren Drew as best supporting performer.Lucy Jones won the prize for best takeover of a role, for “Wicked.” The sole male acting winner was Joe Locke, who won best professional debut for “The Trials.”“Prime Facie,” written by Suzie Miller, was named best new play, while a new production of Mike Bartlett’s “Cock” took the trophy for best revival.“Bonnie & Clyde the Musical,” a decade-old Broadway flop revived to acclaim in London’s West End, was named best new musical.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809019,Kimberly Palmer: Family budgeting tips that actually work,"When Tom Snyder coaches people in his church about how to budget, he starts by encouraging them to track their spending.

            “If we don’t track, we don’t know when to stop spending,” he says. The retired engineer and financial coach in Grand Rapids, Michigan, adds that it’s easy to be bumped off track by irregular costs, such as birthday gifts or vacations.

            Successful family budgeting is all about staying flexible so you can handle those irregular costs as well as unexpected challenges, including sky-high grocery store prices or rising interest rates. Financial experts like Snyder say that by using creative methods to dial in a budget and trim costs in some areas, you can often still find ways to spend on what is most important to you.











            FOLLOW YOUR RHYTHM, NOT RULES

            Severine Bryan , a personal finance educator and coach based in Atlanta, says a budget needs to stay flexible and constantly adjust to challenges. One of the biggest mistakes people make, she adds, is thinking they have to follow a set approach, such as the 50/30/20 budget.

            Bryan, who holds a doctorate in business administration, likes to track her spending with spreadsheets, but her college-age daughter prefers a more creative approach with visuals and graphs. They each use their preferred method, then communicate about spending when necessary. “It has to be a method you enjoy so you want to use it all the time,” she says.

            FACTOR IN VARIABLE EXPENSES

            “The default view of budgeting is annual, but I think that can be frustrating because it’s really hard to have a perspective on your entire year in one sitting,” says Charlie Bolognino, a certified financial planner in Plymouth, Minnesota. Instead, he suggests starting with a month-by-month approach, then taking time to layer in the less predictable costs such as holiday expenses. “We’ll never catch them all, but we want to reduce surprises as much as we can.”

            Bolognino adds that while big expenses such as housing and child care payments are often fixed, other costs, especially food, fluctuate much more. While that means food costs can be high during months you are hosting dinners or going to restaurants, it also means you can trim them with shifts such as planning meals and shopping grocery store discounts.

            TEAM UP WITH YOUR PARTNER

            Being in sync with your partner is an essential part of the budgeting process, even though it can be one of the hardest parts. Instead of rehashing a money disagreement, plan your future together and get excited about joint goals, Bolognino suggests. Those conversations, he says, can strengthen a relationship because “it feels like we are aiming for the same thing.”

            In his case, he stopped criticizing his wife about her coffee-buying habit when he realized it didn’t add up to a significant expense.

            DECIDE WHAT’S REALLY IMPORTANT

            Cara Macksoud, chief executive officer of Money Habitudes, a money personality assessment company, says she, her husband and five children first decide what expenses are “nonnegotiable” together. In addition to food, that might include costs related to sports or private lessons, for example.

            From there, Macksoud suggests creatively meeting those needs by choosing less expensive options. If going on vacation is important to you, perhaps what’s most critical is being together somewhere away from everyday demands. Her family, who live in Venice, Florida, opted for a road trip together, planned partly by her children based on places they’d seen on Instagram. “We did crazy, off-the-beaten path things,” she says, such as visiting White Sands National Park in New Mexico. They had a memorable (and Instagram-worthy) day riding down the mounds of white sand on an air mattress.

            LEVERAGE COMMUNITY RESOURCES

            Erin Voisin, a certified financial planner and managing director at EP Wealth Advisors in Torrance, California, says she has saved hundreds of dollars on toys for her children by picking up items from local moms groups and “buy nothing” groups. “I don’t want to pay full price, so I join groups that post flash deals or giveaways,” she says.

            Voisin has found her children’s holiday and birthday gifts from giveaways shared on those community social media pages, including a large Hot Wheels garage set that retails for over $100. She has also found ideas for free activities from Facebook groups, such as taking your kids to a pet store to look at the animals.

            For families struggling to buy essentials, the website 211.org can help them find local food banks as well as bill-paying assistance.

            “Prioritize the roof over your head, food, a way to get to work and utilities,” Bryan says. “Everything else will fall into place.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809054,Norway: Russia is a threat for all of Europe,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Russia is the main security threat for all of Europe and will remain so for a long time, Norway's intelligence officials said Monday, warning that recent burnings of Islam's holy book in Scandinavia could possibly lead to terror attacks in the country. 

            “Russia today poses the biggest threat to Norwegian and European security, and the confrontation with the West will be long-lasting,” said Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram. 

            Arild Gram made the remark after the government received the annual threat assessments from Norway’s three security services: the domestic and the foreign intelligence agencies and the Norwegian National Security Authority, or NSM.











            “The burning of the Quran could be seen as offensive or provocative and we expect that such events will also occur in 2023 in Norway,” said Beate Gangås, head of the domestic security service, known by its acronym PST. “When such events take place in Norway, the likelihood of radicalization and ultimately terrorist planning against Norway increases.""

            Despite the warning, Norway’s terror domestic threat level was left unchanged at “moderate."" 

            The deputy head of the foreign Norwegian Intelligence Service Lars Nordrum said that Norway’s oil and gas installations could be targeted by Russian sabotage. NSM head Sofie Nystrøm warned that “all of Europe will suffer” if Norwegian gas and oil installations were hit.

            “Norway is now Europe’s most important energy supplier after Russia ended its gas exports to the West,"" said Nordrum. But PST assessed that it's unlikely Russia would carry out any sabotage operation on Norwegian soil this year.

            Desecrating a book held sacred by a religious community is protected in Scandinavian countries by freedom of speech. 

            On Feb. 2, police in Oslo, the Norwegian capital, had barred a group to stage a protest outside the Turkish Embassy that would have involved setting a fire a copy of the Quran on grounds that security could not be ensured “in a satisfactory manner” at the event.

            Ankara is angry that anti-Turkish protests have been allowed to take place, and particularly that it has not prevented an anti-Muslim activist from repeatedly burning the Quran, the Muslim holy book. In Stockholm and Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. 

            Last week, the Swedish domestic security agency SAPO warned that the threat of attacks in Sweden has increased in the weeks since a far-right activist burned a Quran outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm. An application to stage a protest during which the Quran was to be burned was turned down with Swedish police saying that “such a gathering is judged to be capable of causing serious disturbances to national security.”COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Russia is the main security threat for all of Europe and will remain so for a long time, Norway's intelligence officials said Monday, warning that recent burnings of Islam's holy book in Scandinavia could possibly lead to terror attacks in the country.“Russia today poses the biggest threat to Norwegian and European security, and the confrontation with the West will be long-lasting,” said Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram.Arild Gram made the remark after the government received the annual threat assessments from Norway’s three security services: the domestic and the foreign intelligence agencies and the Norwegian National Security Authority, or NSM.“The burning of the Quran could be seen as offensive or provocative and we expect that such events will also occur in 2023 in Norway,” said Beate Gangås, head of the domestic security service, known by its acronym PST. “When such events take place in Norway, the likelihood of radicalization and ultimately terrorist planning against Norway increases.""Despite the warning, Norway’s terror domestic threat level was left unchanged at “moderate.""The deputy head of the foreign Norwegian Intelligence Service Lars Nordrum said that Norway’s oil and gas installations could be targeted by Russian sabotage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809055,11 states consider 'right to repair' for farming equipment,"DENVER (AP) — On Colorado’s northeastern plains, where the pencil-straight horizon divides golden fields and blue sky, a farmer named Danny Wood scrambles to plant and harvest proso millet, dryland corn and winter wheat in short, seasonal windows. That is until his high-tech Steiger 370 tractor conks out. 

            The tractor's manufacturer doesn't allow Wood to make certain fixes himself, and last spring his fertilizing operations were stalled for three days before the servicer arrived to add a few lines of missing computer code for $950. 

            “That’s where they have us over the barrel, it’s more like we are renting it than buying it,” said Wood, who spent $300,000 on the used tractor. 











            Wood's plight, echoed by farmers across the country, has pushed lawmakers in Colorado and 10 other states to introduce bills that would force manufacturers to provide the tools, software, parts and manuals needed for farmers to do their own repairs — thereby avoiding steep labor costs and delays that imperil profits.

            ""The manufacturers and the dealers have a monopoly on that repair market because it’s lucrative,"" said Rep. Brianna Titone, a Democrat and one of the bill's sponsors. “(Farmers) just want to get their machine going again.” 

            In Colorado, the legislation is largely being pushed by Democrats while their Republican colleagues find themselves stuck in a tough spot: torn between right-leaning farming constituents asking to be able to repair their own machines and the manufacturing businesses that oppose the idea.

            The manufacturers argue that changing the current practice with this type of legislation would force companies to expose trade secrets. They also say it would make it easier for farmers to tinker with the software and illegally crank up the horsepower and bypass the emissions controller — risking operators' safety and the environment.

            Similar arguments around intellectual property have been leveled against the broader campaign called ‘right to repair,’ which has picked up steam across the country — crusading for the right to fix everything from iPhones to hospital ventilators during the pandemic. 

            In 2011, Congress tried passing a right to repair law for car owners and independent servicers. That bill did not pass, but a few years later, automotive industry groups agreed to a memorandum of understanding to give owners and independent mechanics — not just authorized dealerships — access to tools and information to fix problems. 

            In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission pledged to beef up its right to repair enforcement at the direction of President Joe Biden. And just last year, Titone sponsored and passed Colorado's first right to repair law, empowering people who use wheelchairs with the tools and information to fix them.

            For the right to repair farm equipment — from thin tractors used between grape vines to behemoth combines for harvesting grain that can cost over half a million dollars — Colorado is joined by 10 states including Florida, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Vermont. 

            Many of the bills are finding bipartisan support, said Nathan Proctor, who leads Public Interest Research Group's national right to repair campaign. But in Colorado's House committee on agriculture, Democrats pushed the bill forward in a 9-4 vote along party lines, with Republicans in opposition even though the bill's second sponsor is Republican Rep. Ron Weinberg.

            “That’s really surprising, and that upset me,” said the Republican Wood. 

            Wood's tractor, which flies an American flag reading “Farmers First,” isn't his only machine to break down. His grain harvesting combine was dropping into idle, but the servicer took five days to arrive on Wood's farm — a setback that could mean a hail storm decimates a wheat field or the soil temperature moves beyond the Goldilocks zone for planting.

            “Our crop is ready to harvest and we can’t wait five days, but there was nothing else to do,” said Wood. “When it’s broke down you just sit there and wait and that’s not acceptable. You can be losing $85,000 a day.”

            Rep. Richard Holtorf, the Republican who represents Wood's district and is a farmer himself, said he's being pulled between his constituents and the dealerships in his district covering the largely rural northeast corner of the state. He voted against the measure because he believes it will financially impact local dealerships in rural areas and could jeopardize trade secrets.

            “I do sympathize with my farmers,"" said Holtorf, but he added, “I don’t think it’s the role of government to be forcing the sale of their intellectual property.”

            At the packed hearing last week that spilled into a second room in Colorado's Capitol, the core concerns raised in testimony were farmers illegally slipping around the emissions control and cranking up the horsepower.

            “I know growers, if they can change horsepower and they can change emissions they are going to do it,” said Russ Ball, sales manager at 21st Century Equipment, a John Deere dealership in Western states. 

            The bill's proponents acknowledged that the legislation could make it easier for operators to modify horsepower and emissions controls, but argued that farmers are already able to tinker with their machines and doing so would remain illegal. 

            This January, the Farm Bureau and the farm equipment manufacturer John Deere did sign a memorandum of understanding — a right to repair agreement made in the free market and without government intervention. The agreement stipulates that John Deere will share some parts, diagnostic and repair codes, and manuals to allow farmers to do their own fixes.

            The Colorado bill's detractors laud that agreement as a strong middle ground while Titone said it wasn't enough, evidenced by six of Colorado's biggest farmworker associations that support the bill.

            Proctor, who is tracking 20 right to repair proposals in a number of industries across the country, said the memorandum of understanding has fallen far short.

            “Farmers are saying no,"" Proctor said. “We want the real thing.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809056,"Berlusconi blames Ukraine war on Zelenskyy, chafes Meloni","MILAN (AP) — Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi has blamed Ukraine's president for the nearly year-old Russian invasion, again placing himself at odds with Premier Giorgia Meloni's staunch support for Kyiv. 

            Berlusconi, whose party backs Meloni's right-wing coalition government, is a long-time friend and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said the war in Ukraine “would have never happened"" had Zelenskyy “ceased attacking the two autonomous republics of Donbass” — parts of the country that Russia has illegally annexed.

            Berlusconi said he judged Zelenskyy’s behavior “very, very negatively.'' He also criticized Meloni for meeting with Zelenskyy, telling reporters Sunday that he wouldn’t have done the same had he been premier. 











            The comments drew a quick rebuttal Sunday from Meloni’s office, which said that “the government’s support for Ukraine is solid and unwavering.’’ Her office said backing for Ukraine was clear in both government policy and parliament votes, which have included weapons deliveries to Ukrainian forces. 

            Zelenskyy advisor Oleg Nikolenko on Monday slammed Berlusconi’s statements, saying that “by spreading Russian propaganda, he encourages Russia to continue its crimes against Ukraine, and then bears political and moral responsibility.”

            “Berlusconi’s senseless accusations against the Ukrainian president are an attempt to kiss Putin’s hands, which are up to the elbows in blood,″ Nikolenko said.

            Meloni met with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of a summit in Brussels last week, and she plans to travel to Ukraine before the first anniversary of the war's outbreak.

            Meloni has previously warned Berlusconi over his friendship with Putin, and has asserted a strong pro-NATO, pro-European position on Russia’s war in Ukraine. The last warning came after Berlusconi boasted of having re-established contact with Putin and exchanged gifts of vodka and wine on his 86th birthday in September. 

            In his latest remarks, Berlusconi said that U.S. President Joe Biden could help bring an end to the fighting by offering Zelenskyy trillions in dollars in rebuilding funds, similar to the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. 

            ""Only something like that will convince this gentleman to agree to a cease-fire,'' Berlusconi said after casting his vote in a regional election. 

            Italian commentators have characterized the remarks as an attempt to profile Berlusconi’s much weakened party against Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, which has been gaining in popularity.MILAN (AP) — Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi has blamed Ukraine's president for the nearly year-old Russian invasion, again placing himself at odds with Premier Giorgia Meloni's staunch support for Kyiv.Berlusconi, whose party backs Meloni's right-wing coalition government, is a long-time friend and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Production optimization efforts in 2022 resulted in the addition of 656 bbl/d of light oil production with an average cost of $4,237/bbl. The Oxbow drilling was highlighted with six wells that had IP30 production of over 100 bbl/d of light oil. The 2023 drilling program in Oxbow is currently underway with two wells now completed targeting Frobisher light oil, following up on successful wells drilled in 2022 in the Weirhill and Gainsborough areas.   Viking Operations Update   Saturn had particular success in developing light oil production at the Company's Viking Asset with average IP30 production per new horizontal well at approximately 38% above forecasted type curves. Drilling costs per Viking location averaged approximately $1.4 million as a result of longer lateral lengths well designs, increased completion stages and increased completion costs. The combined 30 day average production of the 31 net wells drilled in the Viking Asset in 2022 amount to approximately 2,900 bbl/d of light oil production. Saturn closed on two acquisitions in the Viking Asset in 2022 including: the February Plato acquisition of 240 boe/d, and the July Viking acquisition of 4,000 boe/d. In aggregate, Saturn increased production 1,650% in the Viking Asset from approximately 294 boe/d in January 2022 to approximately 5,158 boe/d in December 2022. The 2023 drilling program in the Viking Asset is currently underway with the drilling of a three well pad offsetting strong performing wells drilled in 2022 in the Herschel area.

Forward-looking information in this press release may include, but is not limited to capital expenditure and business plans and strategy of the Company.   The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Saturn, including expectations and assumptions concerning: the timing of and success of future drilling, development and completion activities, workovers & optimization projects, the performance of existing wells, the performance of new wells, the availability and performance of facilities and pipelines, the geological characteristics of Saturn's properties, the application of regulatory and licensing requirements, the availability of capital, labour and services, the creditworthiness of industry partners and the ability to source and complete asset acquisitions.   Although Saturn believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Saturn can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses, and health, safety and environmental risks), constraint in the availability of services, commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, actions of OPEC and OPEC+ members, changes in legislation impacting the oil and gas industry, adverse weather or break-up conditions and uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures.

All boe conversions in this news release are derived by converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet (""Mcf"") of natural gas to one barrel (""Bbl"") of oil. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A Boe conversion rate of 1 Bbl : 6 Mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio of oil compared to natural gas based on currently prevailing prices is significantly different than the energy equivalency ratio of 1 Bbl : 6 Mcf, utilizing a conversion ratio of 1 Bbl : 6 Mcf may be misleading as an indication of value.   ABREVIATIONS AND FREQUENTLY REOCCURING TERMS   Saturn uses the following abbreviations and frequently recurring terms in this press release: ""bbl"" refers to barrel; ""bbl/d"" refers to barrels per day; and ""Mcf"" refers to thousand cubic feet.   Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this press release.   All dollar figures included herein are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809069,Analysis: Super Bowl had feel-good vibes for all,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The Super Bowl had something for everyone.

            Long before Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs lifted the Vince Lombardi Trophy, the biggest winner of this NFL season walked onto the field. Damar Hamlin came out to a rousing ovation during a pregame ceremony honoring the men and women who saved his life.

            Hamlin’s third appearance of the week was the best feel-good moment on a day filled with many inspirational themes.











            Mahomes and Jalen Hurts put on a historic show in the first Super Bowl featuring two Black starting quarterbacks. Hurts was spectacular but Mahomes played through an ankle injury and rallied the Chiefs from a 10-point deficit for a 38-35 comeback win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night.

            It was yet another lesson on dealing with adversity and rising to the occasion playing out before hundreds of millions of viewers on the sport’s biggest stage.

            “I appreciate it because of the failures,” Mahomes said about winning his second championship in four years. “I mean the failure of losing a Super Bowl and losing the AFC championship game gives you a greater appreciation to be standing here as a champion.""

            
                Brotherhood was on display in the first Super Bowl matchup involving two brothers playing on different teams. Chiefs All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce caught a touchdown pass to help his team topple All-Pro center Jason Kelce and the Eagles. Mama Kelce was everywhere throughout the week and sat between NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Hamlin in a suite.

            “There’s nothing I can say to him other than I love him and he played a hell of a year, a hell of a season,” Travis Kelce said. “To see my family be in all its glory and get all its flowers, my mom be the center of attention on the Jumbotron before the game on the biggest stage and being able to get closer with my brother throughout the season and to meet him at the mountain top, it’s the best feeling in the world. I don’t know how many more I got left, but I’ll cherish this one forever.”

            Donna Kelce was the most popular mother in Arizona until Rihanna showed up for a scintillating halftime show. The superstar singer kicked off and finished her superb performance soaring high above the slippery field surface on a platform that was suspended in the air.

            And, she did it while pregnant. Rihanna’s representative confirmed afterward that she’s pregnant with her second child.

            “So iconic for Rihanna to let an American football game happen at her pregnancy reveal/concert,” a fan wrote on Twitter.

            Even the commercials had a warm, fuzzy vibe. Advertisers used familiar celebrity faces, light humor and plenty of cute dogs in ads that cost as much as $7 million for 30 seconds.

            About the only negative on Super Sunday was a controversial penalty on the final drive of the game that left viewers feeling angry that officiating again impacted a playoff game. A defensive holding call on Eagles cornerback James Bradberry allowed Kansas City to keep the ball, run down the clock and Harrison Butker kicked the go-ahead 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left. 

            But Bradberry quickly squashed the outrage, saying he held the receiver.

            “It was a holding. I tugged his jersey. I was hoping they would let it slide,” Bradberry said.

            On a day filled with unifying events, Bradberry’s acknowledgement was a prime example of losing with dignity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809070,War for control of Haiti's capital targets women's bodies,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Nadia hushes the crying 3-month-old baby swaddled in her arms, gently planting kisses on her forehead.

            She was 19, not ready to be a mother. But the young Haitian’s life changed when she was walking home from class on the dusty streets of a gang-controlled area of Haiti’s capital last year.

            She was dragged into a car by a group of men, blindfolded and kidnapped. For three days, she was beaten, starved and gang-raped.











            Months later, she learned that she was pregnant. In an instant, her dreams of studying and economically lifting her family dissolved.

            As Haiti’s toxic slate of gangs continue to plunder the crisis-stricken Caribbean nation, kidnapping, displacing and extorting civilians with nothing left to give, they are increasingly weaponizing women’s bodies in their war for control.

            Women like Nadia live with the consequences.

            “The most difficult part is that I have nothing to give her,” Nadia said of her daughter. “I’m scared because as she gets older to ask about her father, I won’t know what to tell her. ... But I will have to explain to her that I was raped.”

            The woman offered only the name of Nadia, which is not her real one, to The Associated Press, which does not identify survivors of sexual violence. 

            Long plagued by crisis — natural disasters, political turmoil, deep poverty and waves of cholera — Haiti spiraled into chaos after the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.

            Sexual violence has long been used as an instrument of war around the world, a barbaric way to sow terror in communities and assert control.

            “They’re running out of tools to control people,” said Renata Segura, deputy director for Latin America and the Caribbean for International Crisis Group. “They extort, but there’s only so much money that can be extorted from people that are really poor. This is the one thing they have they can inflict on the population.”

            That fear has rippled across Port-au-Prince. Parents hesitate to send their children to school, worried they could be kidnapped or raped by gangs. By night, the buzzing streets of the city empty. 

            For women especially, going outside the house is a risk. So is fleeing: Gangs use the threat of rape to stop communities from abandoning the areas they control.

            Helen La Lime, U.N. special envoy in Haiti, told the Security Council in late January that the gangs employ sexual violence to “destroy the social fabric of communities,"" particularly in zones controlled by rival gangs.

             They rape girls and boys as young as 10, she said.

            Compounding that is severe underreporting, making it difficult for any authority to grasp the full extent of the damage. Women fear gangs will seek revenge on them and trust Haitian police just about as much.

            The country's current government, which many view as illegitimate, declined to comment on what it is doing to address the issue.

            The U.N. documented 2,645 cases of sexual violence in 2022, a 45% increase from the year before. That figure is just a fraction of the real number of assaults.

            Nadia was among those who did not report.

            She struggled over if she would keep the baby when she learned that she was pregnant, but decided to give her daughter the best life that she could. In Port-au-Prince, a place already lacking in opportunity with high levels of poverty, it became impossible for the new mother to work or continue her studies.

            Meanwhile doctors like Jovania Michel are trying to fill in the gaps.

            Michel works in one of the only hospitals in Cite Soleil, the epicenter of the gang wars in Port-au-Prince. There, she sees mothers who were gang-raped after their husbands were killed; sexual violence survivors living on the streets, unable to return home out of fear that it could happen again; and survivors suffering from sexually transmitted infections.

            “Sexual violence is a way to paralyze, to scare people. The minute there’s an increase in sexual violence, everyone stops moving, people don’t go to work because they’re scared,” Michel said. “It’s a weapon, it’s a way to send a message.”

            That was the case for one 36-year-old woman, who spoke with the AP dressed in a shirt with bright red roses, her hair pulled back carefully in braids. She asked to remain unnamed for fear of retaliation.

            The woman once ran a boutique with her husband in Haiti's capital to put her two daughters and son through school. In July, a group of armed men, members of the gang G-Pep, showed up on their doorstep and told them they needed money for bullets.

            Unable to get the cash, the men took her husband away at 8 p.m.

            The next day, she found his body in a gutter. She fled the neighborhood, sending her children to live with friends and family in other parts of the city. Meanwhile, she slept alone on the streets, joining at least 155,000 other Haitians forcibly displaced by violence.

            In December, when she tried to return home, the gangsters raped and beat her.

            “I’m a professional, and out of nowhere these bandits come … and made me lose everything. I’m not good. I’m not okay. It all makes me really angry. I got to a point that I wanted to kill myself,” the woman said. 

            Standing straight with a firm jaw and her head tilted upward, she brushed tears from her face.

            When she tried to report the rape to police, they told her that they didn’t handle gang cases.

            Today, sleeping in a park with other forcibly displaced Haitians, the one thing that brings her hope is that her children, whom she rarely sees, may still live a better life.

            But she worries what deep instability and rising gang control in Haiti will mean.

            “I’m not living in a good country,” she said.PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Nadia hushes the crying 3-month-old baby swaddled in her arms, gently planting kisses on her forehead.She was 19, not ready to be a mother.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809079,Union Berlin finding own Bundesliga success hard to believe,"BERLIN (AP) — Even the players are having a hard time believing Union Berlin’s remarkable run this season.

            “It’s a bit surreal,” Union midfielder Rani Khedira said after Saturday’s 2-1 win over Leipzig in the Bundesliga.

            Promoted for the first time in 2019, Union has already reached — and surpassed — its season target of 40 points to ensure survival and its place in the league for a fifth season. There are still 14 games to go.











            “No one had imagined this development,” Khedira said. “We sat down before the season, and it quickly became apparent to everyone that we wanted to reach 40 points again as quickly as possible because we know how difficult the Bundesliga is.”

            Despite modest resources, Union is only a point behind 10-time defending champion Bayern Munich in second place after winning every game since the turn of the year.

            “The madness continues,” Union coach Urs Fischer said after the win in Leipzig.

            It was the club’s fifth consecutive 2-1 league victory over Leipzig and it ended the home team’s 18-game unbeaten run in all competitions.

            Fischer echoed Khedira, who was captain in place of the rested Christopher Trimmel, when he referred to the team’s point total.

            “It’s even more surreal than it was before the game,"" the Swiss coach said. ""Forty-two points in the 20th round, what should I say?”

            Leipzig, backed and controlled by energy drink giant Red Bull, was seen as a genuine title contender after winning the German Cup last year. But the loss to Union, a club owned by its 49,000 members, left Leipzig seven points behind Bayern.

            It was the fourth game from the six this year that Union turned around to win after falling a goal behind.

            “We don’t know exactly how we turn games like this around. I think it’s simply an unbelievable morale,” said Khedira, the younger brother of former Germany midfielder Sami Khedira. “It wasn’t a deserved win, it wasn’t a nice win, but a win for morale. And I think that’s what makes this team.”

            Union also came from behind to reach the German Cup quarterfinals with a 2-1 win over Wolfsburg on Feb. 1.

            Union made good use of the Bundesliga’s extended winter break. The team’s punishing schedule took its toll in November as it conceded 11 goals in three games without a win. Union previously had the league’s best defense with only nine goals conceded in 12 games.

            While the players recovered, Union general manager Oliver Ruhnert worked on reinforcements, bringing in Croatia fullback Josip Juranović from Celtic, Tunisia midfielder Aïssa Laïdouni from Ferencvaros and French defender Jerome Roussillon from Wolfsburg to compensate for the departures of Julian Ryerson and Genki Haraguchi.

            All three new arrivals have featured prominently in the team’s winning start to the year.

            Five straight victories in the Bundesliga is a record for Union, the only team in the league to have played in the DDR-Oberliga, East Germany’s Bundesliga equivalent.

            The team next visits Dutch club Ajax in Europa League playoffs on Thursday. It’s the first time Union has been in the knockout stages of the competition.

            Former West Germany captain Lothar Matthäus, commentating on TV, was effusive with his praise after Saturday's victory.

            “We don’t want to just talk about the championship, but Union’s performances over the last years. Union is still competing in three competitions this season. For a club like Union, which was promoted four years ago, it’s everything, it’s enormous, it deserves the highest recognition from every soccer fan, whether a Union fan or not,” Matthäus said.

            “In such games, with such fans, with this mentality, how they play games. They don’t just play soccer, they work soccer, and that’s Union’s strength. That’s why they’re so successful, because they work for one another.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809081,"Antisemitism worries rising for many U.S. Jews, survey finds","More than four in ten Jews in the United States feel their status in America is less secure than it was a year earlier, according to a new survey by the American Jewish Committee.

            The survey, conducted in the fall of 2022, was released Monday by the AJC, a prominent Jewish advocacy organization.

            The survey was taken in a year of high-profile incidents of antisemitism, including a hostage-taking at a Texas synagogue and anti-Jewish statements shared by celebrities on social media. Former President Donald Trump dined with two openly antisemitic guests, drawing criticism from his own Jewish supporters.











            According to the AJC survey, 41% of the respondents said the status of Jews in the U.S. is less secure than it was the year before, while 55% said it was the same. Only 4% thought it was more secure.

            The results show anxieties increasing since a comparable survey in 2021, when 31% of respondents thought their status was less secure than a year earlier.

            Four in five Jews said in the 2022 survey that antisemitism has grown in the past five years; nearly half said it’s taken less seriously than other forms of bigotry or hate.

            A quarter of the respondents said they were directly targeted by antisemitic expressions, either in person or on social media, with 3% reporting a physical attack. Nearly four in 10 changed their behavior to lower risks to their safety.

            Similarly, nearly four in ten reported avoiding visible expressions of Jewishness in public, such as wearing a skullcap. Smaller percentages reported taking similar steps on campus or at work.

            Other findings:

            —Nearly 90% of U.S. Jews — and the same percentage of the country's total population — believe antisemitism is a serious problem, up from 73% in 2016.

            —Of the Jews surveyed in 2022, 63% said that they see law enforcement as appropriately responsive when it comes to antisemitism, a substantial drop from 2019 when that number was 81%.

            The survey collected data from a nationally representative sample of 1,507 adults of Jewish religion or background. It was conducted from Sept. 28 through Nov. 3.

            News of antisemitic incidents surfaces almost daily in the U.S. Earlier this month, for example, numerous antisemitic flyers were distributed in suburban Atlanta, including at the home of Georgia’s only Jewish state legislator.

            Rep. Esther Panitch, a freshman Democrat, denounced the flyers from the floor of the House of Representatives, with dozens of colleagues surrounding her to show solidarity.

            “This weekend, it was my turn to be targeted,” Panitch said. “Unfortunately, it’s not the first time to be afraid as a Jew in the United States.”

            On Thursday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, took his campaign against antisemitism to the United Nations, urging diplomats from many nations to speak out against the rising global hatred of Jews and stressing: “Silence is not an option.”

            Emhoff pointed to celebrity comedians too often using antisemitism “to draw cheap laughs, high profile entertainers and politicians openly spouting tired antisemitic tropes (and) others making comments laced with not so subtle innuendo.”

            Among the most dramatic antisemitic incidents in 2022 was the January hostage standoff at Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, a suburb of Forth Worth.

            A pistol-wielding British man took four people at the synagogue hostage and held them for 10 hours before they escaped, and the captor was killed by the FBI.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809106,German party moves to expel former spy chief as member,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany's main opposition party on Monday launched an effort to expel from its ranks a former head of the country's intelligence agency, weeks after he complained of what he said was a move toward “eliminatory racism against whites.”

            The center-right Christian Democratic Union two weeks ago gave Hans-Georg Maassen an ultimatum to leave the party by Feb. 5, which he ignored. On Monday, party leader Friedrich Merz said the CDU leadership decided unanimously to start expulsion proceedings and withdraw his membership rights with immediate effect.

            Maassen was removed as the head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency in 2018 after appearing to downplay far-right violence against migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz. He has since become a vocal if marginal figure on the hard right of the CDU — the party once led by former Chancellor Angela Merkel — and ran unsuccessfully for election to the national parliament in 2021.











            Party leaders ran out of patience with Maassen after a mid-January tweet in which he said that the direction of “the driving forces in the political and media sphere” was “eliminatory racism against whites and the burning desire for Germany to kick the bucket.”

            Merz said that “this is not the kind of language we use in political arguments, no matter with whom.""

            “A clear line has been drawn today, and the party will thank us for it in very, very large part,” he added. “And above all, it will be recognizable for the population that we are conservative, we are liberal, we are Christian and social, but we are not right-wing radicals.”

            Merz said the move also underscored the “firewall” between his party and the far-right Alternative for Germany, which has established itself as a political force over the past decade and has been represented in the national parliament since 2017.

            Despite Monday's decision, it may be some time before the CDU can put Maassen behind it. In Germany, expelling party members is a complicated and often lengthy process that frequently fails.BERLIN (AP) — Germany's main opposition party on Monday launched an effort to expel from its ranks a former head of the country's intelligence agency, weeks after he complained of what he said was a move toward “eliminatory racism against whites.”The center-right Christian Democratic Union two weeks ago gave Hans-Georg Maassen an ultimatum to leave the party by Feb. 5, which he ignored.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809108,German conservatives hail rare 'big city' win in Berlin,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany's main opposition party on Monday celebrated its victory in a Berlin state election re-run made necessary by serious voting glitches in 2021, arguing that the result shows the party can appeal to voters in urban areas with center-right policies that include tough talk on immigration.

            The Christian Democratic Union of former Chancellor Angela Merkel has struggled for years with declining support in major cities and last governed the capital in 2001. On Sunday, the party came first with 28.2% of the vote, gaining 10 percentage points as the three parties that made up the leftist regional government all lost supporters.

            “This re-election result shows that the CDU can win in big German cities,"" the party's main candidate, Kai Wegner, told reporters.











            He planned to hold talks with the center-left Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens about swiftly forming a new coalition government. Both of those parties received 18.4% of the vote, a particularly grim result for the Social Democrats of Mayor Franziska Giffey, who took much of the blame after the chaotic election failures two years ago.

            During the election campaign conservatives also attacked her government as being soft on crime following an outburst of violence against first responders during New Year's Eve celebrations.

            The Christian Democrats' national leader, Friedrich Merz, claimed the attacks were the result of a “little Pasha” mentality among youths in some immigrant communities, prompting accusations of racism from the left.

            Wegner was unapologetic Monday, saying that “we need to name problems in order to solve them together.”

            But he insisted that his goal now was “to form a successful Berlin coalition that brings this city together again” and tackles some of its many problems, from lack of affordable housing to run-down schools and slow bureaucracy.

            Doing so successfully could boost the conservatives' chances at the national level, where the CDU came a narrow second behind the Social Democrats in 2021.

            The Green party’s leader in Berlin, Bettina Jarasch, said she was willing to discuss a coalition with the CDU but made clear her preference for continuing the existing three-party government with the Social Democrats and the ex-communist Left despite their diminished majority.

            The Greens, whose strongholds are in Berlin’s inner districts, have repeatedly clashed with conservatives on the issue of restricting car access to the city center.

            Wegner, 50, made clear Monday that he would oppose efforts seen in other cities, such as Paris, London and New York, to promote cycling, walking and public transport at the expense of motorists.

            “With me there won’t be any one-sided politics against cars,” he said.BERLIN (AP) — Germany's main opposition party on Monday celebrated its victory in a Berlin state election re-run made necessary by serious voting glitches in 2021, arguing that the result shows the party can appeal to voters in urban areas with center-right policies that include tough talk on immigration.The Christian Democratic Union of former Chancellor Angela Merkel has struggled for years with declining support in major cities and last governed the capital in 2001.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809109,France says its troops misrepresented in 'Wakanda Forever',"PARIS (AP) — France’s defense minister has denounced the way he says French soldiers deployed in Africa appear to be depicted in the Marvel Studios superhero film “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” as “false and misleading.” 

            Minister Sebastien Lecornu “strongly condemned” the similarity of a fictional group of villainous mercenaries with French armed forces members, in a tweet published Sunday about the film that came out in November in France and the U.S.

            The plot of the film involves a fictional African country, Wakanda, faced with Western nations seeking to control fictional metal resources across the continent.











            A scene from the film retweeted by the minister shows a group of soldiers with their hands tied behind their backs, wearing uniforms very similar to those of French troops deployed in Africa’s Sahel region, being brought before the United Nations in Geneva. The movie scene depicts mercenaries captured by Wakandans after they attacked an outpost in Mali.

            “I am thinking of and honoring the 58 French soldiers who died defending Mali, at its request, in the face of Islamist terrorist groups,” Lecornu added.

            The issue is sensitive in France, which completed its withdrawal from Mali last year after nine years fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Tensions have also grown over the past year between Mali, its African neighbors and Western nations after Mali’s transitional government allowed Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group to deploy on its territory.

            France has recently announced it is withdrawing troops from Burkina Faso this month following a demand by the West African country's military rulers.

            About 3,000 French soldiers remain deployed in the Sahel region, many of those based in Niger and Chad.PARIS (AP) — France’s defense minister has denounced the way he says French soldiers deployed in Africa appear to be depicted in the Marvel Studios superhero film “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” as “false and misleading.”Minister Sebastien Lecornu “strongly condemned” the similarity of a fictional group of villainous mercenaries with French armed forces members, in a tweet published Sunday about the film that came out in November in France and the U.S.The plot of the film involves a fictional African country, Wakanda, faced with Western nations seeking to control fictional metal resources across the continent.A scene from the film retweeted by the minister shows a group of soldiers with their hands tied behind their backs, wearing uniforms very similar to those of French troops deployed in Africa’s Sahel region, being brought before the United Nations in Geneva.

Tensions have also grown over the past year between Mali, its African neighbors and Western nations after Mali’s transitional government allowed Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group to deploy on its territory.France has recently announced it is withdrawing troops from Burkina Faso this month following a demand by the West African country's military rulers.About 3,000 French soldiers remain deployed in the Sahel region, many of those based in Niger and Chad.",2023/02/13,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809120,German court to make landmark decision over phone searches of asylum-seekers,"What right to data privacy do asylum seekers have? That's the question at the core of a little-noticed lawsuit in Germany, a country known as a world forerunner on data protection — and a landmark ruling could land as early as this week.On Thursday, the country's highest administrative law court in Leipzig is hearing a case over whether authorities broke the law in 2019 when they scanned the phone of an Afghan refugee with no passport for clues about where she was from.""The court is making a decision over one individual case, but what happened to our client is common practice in Germany,"" Lea Beckmann, one of the asylum seeker's attorneys and a member of the legal team at the nonprofit Society for Civil Rights (GFF,) told DW. The plaintiff's name is being kept secret at her lawyers' request for fear of repercussions.Supported by the GFF, the woman sued Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) over the search of her phone in 2020. In June 2021, a regional court in Berlin ruled in her favor, arguing that authorities had violated the law because they had not exhausted less intrusive means first. But the BAMF appealed the decision and asked the country's top judges at the Federal Administrative Court to take a second look.The court could announce its ruling as early as the end of this week's hearing, and either throw its weight behind the regional judgment or quash it.The decision will be watched closely by migration authorities around the world, where similar technology is being used in asylum applications. Ahead of this week's trial, the BAMF said it stood by its practice.""Clarifying the identity and nationality of asylum seekers who cannot present identity documents by analyzing mobile devices is fundamentally important for the security of our country and for the accuracy of asylum decisions,"" a spokesperson for the BAMF told DW in a written reply to a list of questions.Beckman, the plaintiff's attorney, said a ruling could have far-reaching consequences for phone searches. ""Should the judges agree with the Berlin court in their reasoning, that would mean that the BAMF would no longer be allowed to analyze cell phones unless the agency has previously exhausted all other measures available to verify information about citizenship,"" she said.Underlying the controversy is a paragraph Germany added to its asylum law in 2017that allows authorities to demand access to the cell phones, laptops, and tablets of asylum seekers if they cannot provide any valid passport or ID card, and if an identification ""cannot be achieved by milder means.""Once inside the devices, authorities use software to scan files for clues about where the phones have been. Such digital evidence includes location metadata attached to photos, country codes of numbers saved on the phone, or the language used in text messages.The program automatically compiles results in a report. That document is kept confidential until a lawyer at the BAMF grants the office's case workers access. They can then factor in the results when they decide whether to grant asylum.Between 2018 and 2021, the office searched over 47,000 devices of asylum seekers, according to data provided by BAMF.That was necessary to ""ensure a high-quality and secure asylum procedure,"" said a BAMF spokesperson. At the same time, he stressed that the searches were just one among several tools for ""obtaining additional information to prepare the conduct of the asylum interview and, thus, placing the asylum decision on a broader and better basis.""Since the practice was first introduced, it has met harsh criticism from civil liberties advocates in Germany — a country where the experience of two authoritarian regimes has made people particularly sensitive about privacy, and where the world's first data protection law was passed in 1970.At the forefront of that fight is Berlin-based nonprofit GFF. In 2019, the group published an investigation arguing that the phone searches are both ineffective and intrusive.By 2020, the group had convinced three asylum seekers from Syria, Afghanistan, and Cameroon to sue the BAMF. In three separate lawsuits, they argued that the agency had demanded access to highly intimate data stored on their phones without meeting the legal requirements. That, they said, encroached on their fundamental right to privacy.During the very first hearing on June 1, 2021, held in an inconspicuous administrative court building in central Berlin, regional judges upheld the Afghan refugee's complaint, a decision that came as a surprise to both parties.On the spot — and aware that the practice affects tens of thousands of refugees — both the GFF and BAMF agreed that an appeal would directly go to the country's highest administrative judges in Leipzig. Shortly after, the GFF decided, together with the plaintiffs from Syria and Cameroon, to pause the other two lawsuits until the top court's decision.The BAMF, meanwhile, has not changed its practice in the 20 months since, arguing that ""the first-instance ruling represented an isolated case.""The upcoming decision will likely have greater legal impact.""The Federal Administrative Court will deal with the question of whether the relevant paragraph in Germany's asylum law is a sufficient legal basis for what authorities are doing,"" court spokesperson Carsten Tegethoff told DW. ""In this respect, the lawsuit is of fundamental importance.""At the same time, the ruling will also impact a separate complaint filed by the GFF that could put an end to the phone searches as they're conducted today.In early 2021, the nonprofit asked Germany's data protection watchdog, the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, to look into the phone searches. Unlike the courts, the office has the power to directly order the BAMF to cease the practice.Two years later, the watchdog has not yet reacted on the issue – something attorney Beckmann described as ""disappointing.""But Christoph Stein, a spokesperson for the agency, confirmed to DW that the case was still pending. The office, he added, ""intends to take the pending decision into account in its further actions.""All eyes are on what judges in Leipzig will decide.",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809121,South Korea steps up efforts to root out the North's agents,"Authorities in South Korea have arrested a number of activists on suspicion they were working with North Korean agents to further Pyongyang's political ambitions on the peninsula, with analysts suggesting it is highly likely that more people sympathetic to North Korea are still active in the South.Arrest warrants were issued by a court in Seoul for four members of a group known as The Vanguard of the People's Independent Unification on suspicion that they met with North Korean agents in Cambodia and Vietnam in 2016 before returning to South Korea to organize rallies against US military presence in the country and promote far-left politicians and ideologies.Members of the group, who have not been named, also greeted North Korean athletes when the city of Changwon hosted the ISSF World Shooting Championships in 2018, according to Yonhap News, and were seen waving flags promoting the unification of the peninsula.The National Intelligence Service (NIS) believes that the group helped to set up other cells in at least three other cities, Jeonju, Jinju and Jeju.In January, intelligence officials and police on the island of Jeju, off the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, searched the homes and workplaces of a former senior member of the Progressive Party for allegedly violating espionage laws.In statements, the authorities said the suspect had traveled to Cambodia in 2017 to meet with an official of the Workers' Party Cultural Exchange Bureau, a well-known front organization for North Korea's spy agency. The South Korean, whose name has not been released, was allegedly trained over the course of three days in how to form an underground group and ensure its security from the police and how to send and receive coded messages.The police said they had been monitoring the suspect's movements for seven years before they were able to gather sufficient evidence to obtain search warrants.Another local politician and his wife are also being investigated as part of the probe.In Seoul, meanwhile, police arrested Ha Yeon-ho, head of the Jeonbuk People's Movement, for allegedly violating the National Security Law, which forbids unauthorized contact with North Korean nationals. The authorities claim Ha met North Korean agents in Beijing and Hanoi on several occasions between 2013 and 2019.""For some people in the South, this is the ideology that they choose to follow,"" said Rah Jong-yil, a former diplomat and head of South Korea's intelligence agency. ""They believe they can work with people in the North to ultimately bring about reunification of the two Koreas through some form of rapprochement, but they do not realize they are just being used by the North.""They are naive,"" he told DW. ""It's actually curious to think that trade union members would fight for North Korea because while unions are accepted in the South and the rest of the democratic world as a right for workers, they don't even exist under totalitarian regimes.""Pyongyang is attempting to ""use stooges for their own political purposes, which are to destabilize South Korean society, weaken the government and damage our security alliances, primarily with the US,"" Rah said.Kim Sang-woo, a former politician with the left-leaning Congress for New Politics and now a member of the board of the Kim Dae-jung Peace Foundation, said the recent crackdown on North Korean sympathizers comes after relatively few arrests under the administration of President Moon Jae-in, who stepped down in May 2022 and was replaced by the more hawkish Yoon Suk-yeol.""There were not any large espionage cases uncovered during the Moon government, with critics suggesting that he was quite lax in this area as he did not want to do anything that would antagonize the North or jeopardize the possibility of better relations with Pyongyang,"" Kim said.""The obvious downside of that was that it endangered national security and reduced awareness of the threat among ordinary South Koreans,"" he added. ""And that has made this wave of arrests something of a wake-up call to society here.""The Moon administration has  also drawn up controversial plans to transfer investigations into cases of espionage or other collaboration with the North away from the National Intelligence Service to the police. The transfer is scheduled to take place next year, with the NIS announcing on February 6 that it is setting up a joint team with specialist prosecutors and the police to liaise on ongoing investigations of suspected violations.There are suggestions that the Yoon administration may attempt to scrap the transfer, although his government faces an uphill battle as the opposition Democratic Party of Korea has a majority in the National Assembly and relations between the two main parties are fiercely hostile.South Korean politician Kim said that the South Koreans who agree to work for Pyongyang are being deceived by the North. These people also believe that they are still living under an authoritarian regime that is closer to the military juntas of the past than a thriving, modern democracy, he added.""They are living in the past and that way of thinking is just absurd, but we also have to say that the North has done very well in convincing these people to work for them, to do their bidding,"" he underlined. ""It's almost as if they have been brainwashed.""Kim stressed that such underground cells that are committed to destabilizing the South are extremely dangerous.Hwang Jang-yop, a senior member of the North Korean leadership who defected to South Korea in 1997, claimed in an interview shortly before his death in 2010 that no fewer than 50,000 North Korean agents were acting on behalf of Pyongyang in the South at any time.""It is very likely that there are a lot more of their agents here,"" Kim said. ""All we can do is to remain vigilant.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809122,Why is India clashing with Pakistan on landmark water deal?,"The landmark Indus Water Treaty (IWT), signed by India and Pakistan in 1960, agreed to regulate the flow of Indus River and its five tributaries. But India's current government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is pushing for the treaty to be renegotiated. Many in India are now calling for New Delhi to withdraw from it altogether.The growing friction has prompted Pakistan to raise the issue at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in the Hague. However, Indian officials refused to attend the first meeting in late January, leaving Pakistani representatives to face nothing but empty chairs in front of the PCA officials.New Delhi's stance is that the PCA is not competent to consider the questions on the IWT, and that an alternative, expert-led process is needed.The PCA has signaled it would issue a decision regarding its competence in June.The IWT gives New Delhi unrestricted control over the three eastern rivers — the Beas, Ravi and Sutlej — while Islamabad has control over the three western rivers — Jhelum, Chenab and Indus — flowing through India-administered Kashmir into Pakistan.India can use 20% of the water of the three western rivers for purposes of irrigation, transport and power generation. The treaty also created a permanent commission where both countries' representatives are working to implement water-sharing goals.The arrangement has survived through decades of rivalry and even open wars between the two countries. But tensions are high once again, and experts warn it would be difficult to re-negotiate the treaty if New Delhi unilaterally withdraws from it.""The trust deficit is so wide that I don't think even a purely professional review of the treaty, in light of the serious overarching issues like climate change, is possible. Both sides should focus on building further from the treaty rather than dismantling what is already achieved and trying to rebuild something different,"" political analyst Reyaz Ahmad told DW.If India unilaterally leaves the IWT, the move would likely trigger public resentment in Pakistan. But resentment could be merely a starting point — if India decides to block the flow of the rivers currently controlled by Pakistan, it would affect nearly 62% of Pakistan's agricultural area.Political analyst Ahmad said that officials needed to be ""fair and reasonable.""He argued that the treaty has stood the test of time — six decades with three wars is a good enough period. ""So don't think meddling with it is a good idea — whatever the compulsions may be. It is a shining example of water diplomacy,"" he said.Ahmad recommends continuing the treaty and boosting the roles of the members of the Indus Commission in both countries.""The roles and responsibilities should be enhanced — rather than seeing themselves as custodians of each country's interests, both sides' commissioners should see themselves as ambassadors of their respective countries to increase engagement and cooperation between the countries,"" he said.In India, critics argue the current arrangement is unfair to their country.A senior leader of the ruling BJP party, Priya Sethi, has called for building electricity dams and irrigation channels ""to ensure the water flow into Pakistan is stopped.""""We have to rethink the IWT because why should we allow our water to go to Pakistan, which has troubled us throughout?"" she said.""We will build impediments so that our water is used by farmers of Jammu and Kashmir and northern Indian states instead of going to Pakistan.""Modi himself has hinted at using the IWT to pressure the neighboring country in the past. In 2016, the Indian leader told IWT officials that ""blood and water can't flow together at the same time"" after militants killed 19 Indian Army soldiers in Kashmir.New Delhi accuses Islamabad of backing militants in India-administered Kashmir, a charge denied by Pakistan.People in India-administered Kashmir too have grievances as they believe the IWT is discriminatory and unfair towards them.They argue the region's economy has suffered because the IWT has adversely impacted the hydropower potential of the region as it puts restrictions on the storage volumes on the three western rivers, which are controlled by Pakistan.People in Pakistan, one of the highly water-stressed countries in the world, are also not happy as they feel the treaty has not fully safeguarded their interests.A major source of conflict is that the treaty is ambiguous on hydropower projects in the troubled area. Kashmir has the potential to produce 20,000 megawatts (MW) of hydropower, which can become a major driving force for its economic growth, but it currently produces a mere 3,263 MW.Notably, the Jhelum river has ideal topography for constructing large water storage systems, a senior official of Jammu Kashmir Power Development Corporation told DW. The river flows through Kashmir valley before entering into Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The IWT gave the control of the river itself to Pakistan.""But any large storage along the Jhelum will inundate Kashmir Valley,"" he said.A former official of Kashmir's Irrigation department said New Delhi should build smaller dams, possibly in cascade, on Jhelum's many tributaries. This would be permitted by the IWT.The western rivers contribute more than 80% (around 117 billion cubic meters — BCM) of their flow to Pakistan's Indus basin irrigation system. In theory, stopping the flow to Pakistan could be achieved either by storing or diverting the water of these rivers.However, the water from the western rivers is enough to inundate, every year, nearly 120,000 square kilometers (46,300 square miles) to a height of 1 meter (3 feet 3 inches). It could inundate the whole of Kashmir to a height of 7 meters in just one year. India would need 30 storage systems the size of Tehri Dam (260.5 m high and 592 m long) to store this volume which is practically not possible, said another expert.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809123,Bhutan's allrounder aiming to lift country higher,"Pema Choden Tshering has big dreams. ""My vision for Bhutan women's football is to really use football as a catalyst and tool to enhance, change and improve the lives of everyone involved in women's football,"" the 27-year-old told DW.""Of course, results matter at the end of the day and hence, I want our national senior and youth teams to perform well regionally in the next five or six years and then also make an impact at a continental level.""Tshering is an allrounder in the most literal sense of the word: she plays in midfield for Bhutan's national team, while also being in charge of women's football in the country's football association.Tshering says it's helpful for her to know both sides of football. ""For football to progress, it must go beyond the pitch.""About 780,000 people live in the small Himalayan country and 80% of them reside more than 2,000 meters above sea level. The country only has 20 full-sized pitches and the national team plays at the 15,000-capacity Changlimithang National Stadium in the capital Thimphu, which is 2,300 meters above sea level. Many smaller pitches have been built by private owners in recent years. According to Tshering, this comes as a result of football being known as a lucrative business.Bhutan only joined FIFA in the year 2000. Its men's national team is currently 185th out of 211 associations in FIFA's world rankings. The women's team is 177th out of 187. The domestic men's league was established in 2012, with its equivalent for women starting in 2016 and now including nine teams. The current champion is Paro Women's FC, a club from a city with a population of about 15,000. A 10th club will join the league next season in Bumthang WFC, a team from a northern district of the country.The Bhutan Football Federation (BFF) counts 219 registered female players and, according to Tshering, while most come from the big cities, the country's FA has been trying to establish programs for more remote locations, which are often at even greater altitude.The BFF is keen on developing the next generation. Apart from the men's training center in Thimphu, Bhutan also has a football academy for girls and women in the southern city of Gelephu, close to the border with India. The academy has a pitch and a gym for the country's top talents, with the youngest team using the facility being Bhutan's under-14s.Hong Kyung-suk has been Bhutan's national women's team coach since 2022. The former South Korean international decided to step up the number of training sessions to six days a week ahead of the South Asian Cup, which took place in Nepal last fall, and it paid off. The team achieved its first significant win, beating Sri Lanka 5-0, and qualifying for the semifinal as the group's second-placed team, after hosts Nepal. There, Bhutan was beaten 8-0 by Bangladesh, who went on to win the tournament.Despite the heavy defeat, the Bhutan coach was pleased that her team could concentrate on ""improving skills and muscle strength and trying to play faster than before,” Hong told DW. Bhutan will also play its first ever qualifiers for the 2024 Olympics in April. with its opponents being Uzbekistan (49), East Timor (153) and Jordan (69), Bhutan is anything but favorite.""I think it will be a great learning experience and exposure for our girls,"" said Pema Choden Tshering, also adding the games would serve as a ""good platform to to benchmark where Bhutan women's football is at on a continental level.""Tshering says female footballers in Bhutan do not really face any prejudice. ""We have a very liberal society and sex, religion, caste, etc have no bearing on what profession one takes. For example, a game of darts, which is a traditional sport and [used to be] played by only men, is now very popular with women and there are even many women participating in a darts tournament.""The midfielder comes from a family with football in its blood. Her father, Hishey Tshering, is the president of Thimphu City FC, a club from Bhutan's capital city. Both Pemba Choden and her brother Orgyen Wangchuk play for the club. Just like his sister, Orgyen Wangchuk Tshering is also part of Bhutan's national team.Both the ""Dragon Girls"" and the ""Dragon Boys"" receive a monthly wage of 30,000 Ngultrum, approximately €350, a fact which the BFF take pride in.""As the more dominating football nations make the news in their fight for equal pay, our Dragon Girls are eminently blessed to receive equal pay without having to fight for it,"" the country's football federation says on its website.The wage is slightly higher than that of an average government official, according to Tshering. ""However, the problem is that one can lose this income overnight due to injuries or loss of form and hence being dropped from the sport.""As a result, many footballers prefer to find more secure jobs.""One of the biggest challenges with football in Bhutan, not just with women's football, is the mere fact that it is very difficult to make a living out of the sport so there is immense pressure from family or the society giving more preference to academia.""However, that could change if the national team keeps making progress. Coach Hong thinks Bhutan's potential in women's football is ""unlimited."" She hopes Bhutan's female players will not only play football in their country, but also abroad. The first step was achieved last October as Deki Lhazom became the first female footballer from Bhutan to sign for a club outside the country, sealing a move to top Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad.In Bhutan, too, there are quite a few people who earn a living from football, according to Pema Choden Tshering. ""Hopefully this will inspire others and be the tipping point for football in Bhutan, though it will take some time.""The country's women's football is also in need of more sponsors.""Since there are very minimal funds, a lot of the girls give up football after a certain age, so sustaining players is a significant challenge.""Tshering is currently working on a strategy for the next four years, with FIFA's help. She thinks women's football in Bhutan cannot only play second fiddle if they achieve success.""[The question] should always be, ‘what about for women's football?' and not, ‘oh, we forgot or let's wait till someone brings it up.' It should be given equal priority and importance with the men's game.""This article was adapted from German",2023/02/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809125,Portugal: Thousands of children abused by Catholic clergy,"Members of the Portuguese Catholic Church sexually abused at least 4,815 children over the past 70 years, a commission investigating the issue said in its final report on Monday.The Portuguese inquiry, commissioned by the church in the staunchly Catholic country, published the results of its investigation after hearing from more than 500 victims.""This testimony allows us to establish a much larger network of victims, at least 4,815,"" said Pedro Strecht, a psychiatrist who headed the Independent Committee for the Study of Child Abuse in the Portuguese Catholic Church.He said most perpetrators were priests, and the abuse occurred in Catholic schools, priests' homes, confessionals and other locations.The report found most victims were boys, barely older than 11. The youngest victim was reportedly a 2-year-old child.It called for decisive action by the judiciary and asked for psychological care for the victims and the suspension of the statute of limitations for 30 years.The statute of limitations has expired on most of the alleged cases but the committee sent the names of church members reported to the Portuguese Bishops Conference and to the police.Police have already opened several inquiries based on the committee's initial work last year.One of the cases was about a 43-year-old woman who said she was raped by a priest during confession when she was a 17-year-old novice nun.""It's very hard to talk about these things in Portugal,"" a country where 80% of people say they are Catholic, she said.""I kept it secret for many years but it became more and more difficult to cope with it alone,"" she told the AFP news agency.She eventually reported her attacker to the church authorities but said she was ""ignored.""""[We want] to pay a sincere tribute to those who were abuse victims during their childhood and dared to give a voice to silence,"" said Pedro Strecht, president of the Independent Commission for the Study of Sexual Abuse in the Portuguese Catholic Church.""They are much more than a statistic,"" he added.Portuguese bishops were due to discuss the commission's report next month.The Catholic Church, which funded the commission's work, previously said it was prepared to ""take appropriate measures.""Pope Francis is scheduled to visit Lisbon in August, where he is expected to meet some of the alleged victims, according to media reports.The pontiff promised in 2019 to root out pedophilia within the church.Investigations have been launched in several countries, including Australia, France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands.The Portuguese commission started its work in January last year after a report in France revealed around 3,000 priests and religious officials sexually abused over 200,000 children.lo/fb (AP, AFP, EFE, Reuters)",2023/02/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809127,"EU economic forecasts: Inflation past its peak, no recession","The EU's executive branch published revised economic forecasts on Monday, saying the bloc will narrowly avoid a technical recession and has already passed its inflation peak as natural gas prices continue to retreat from the historic levels of mid-to-late 2022.But the European Commission also warned that consumers would continue to feel the pinch of reduced purchasing power as inflation remains above 5%.""The EU economy beat expectations last year, with resilient growth in spite of the shockwaves from the Russian war of aggression,"" Commissioner for the Economy Paolo Gentiloni said. ""And we have entered 2023 on a firmer footing than anticipated: the risks of recession and gas shortages have faded and unemployment remains at a record low.""Growth for 2023 should reach 0.8% for the 20 countries using the euro single currency, and 0.9% for the 27-member bloc as a whole, the Commission said. That's compared to forecast growth of 0.3% in its previous quarterly report.The Commission also forecast that the bloc would avoid a contraction in the current January-March quarter, and thereby narrowly stave off a technical recession. This follows growth of just 0.1% in the previous quarter.Many economists classify a technical recession as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But by the EU's measuring system, the previously-forecast first quarter performance coupled with the last quarter of 2022 would have qualified as a technical recession.Longer-term growth forecasts for 2024 remained unchanged, at 1.6% for the EU and 1.5% for the eurozone.""Europeans still face a difficult period ahead. Growth is still expected to slow down on the back of powerful headwinds and inflation will relinquish its grip on purchasing power only gradually over the coming quarters,"" Gentiloni said.""Thanks to a unified and comprehensive policy response, the EU has weathered the storms that have hit our economies and societies since 2020. We must show the same resolve and ambition in tackling the challenges we face today.""For 2023 as a whole, inflation was forecast to be 5.6% within the eurozone and 6.3% across the entire EU.Inflation peaked last October at 10.6% in the eurozone but has been falling since, reaching 8.5% in January. The EU believes that falling gas prices, partly as the EU secures alternative sources of supply and compensates for the halt of Russian imports, explain this — but it warns that pressures on the prices of other goods is less likely to decrease.""The decline was driven mainly by falling energy inflation, while core inflation has not yet peaked,"" the Commission said in a press release on Monday.The European Central Bank (ECB) has been raising interest rates in a bid to slow inflation. The aim is to discourage some borrowing and spending by making credit more expensive, but this can also have a negative impact on economic output.Currently, the Commission predicts inflation much closer to the ECB target level of 2%, at around 2.8% for the whole bloc, in 2024.The report also points to record low unemployment in the EU, at 6.1% at the end of 2022, as a bright spot helping to counteract the economic impacts following the COVID pandemic and amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""Europe's economy is proving resilient in the face of current challenges. We were able to narrowly avoid a recession. We are somewhat more optimistic about growth prospects and the projected decline in inflation this year,"" the Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said.""But we still face multiple challenges, so this is no time for complacency — not least because Russia's relentless war against Ukraine is still causing uncertainty.""The Commission also referred directly to this uncertainty in its press release, noting that its current forecast ""crucially hinges on the purely technical assumption that Russia's aggression of Ukraine will not escalate but will continue throughout the forecast horizon.""msh/fb (AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809128,German ballet director suspended over feces attack on critic,"BERLIN (AP) — A German newspaper critic had animal feces smeared on her face in the city of Hannover by a ballet director who apparently took offense at a review she wrote.

            The Hannover state opera house apologized for the incident and said Monday that it was suspending ballet director Marco Goecke with immediate effect.

            The daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that a furious Goecke approached its dance critic, Wiebke Huester, during the interval of a premiere at Hannover's opera house on Saturday and asked what she was doing there. It said that the two didn't know each other personally.











            The newspaper said that Goecke, who apparently felt provoked by a recent review she wrote of a production he staged in the Dutch seat of government, The Hague, threatened to ban her from the ballet and accused her of being responsible for people canceling season tickets in Hannover.

            He then pulled out a paper bag with animal feces and smeared her face with the contents before making off through a packed theater foyer, the newspaper said. Huester identified the substance as dog feces and said she had filed a criminal complaint, German news agency dpa reported.

            In a statement on its website, the opera house said Huester's “personal integrity” was violated “in an unspeakable way.” It said that it contacted her immediately after the incident to apologize.

            The opera house said that Goecke's “impulsive reaction” violated the ground rules of the theater and that “he caused massive damage to the Hannover State Opera and State Ballet.” As a result, it said, he is being suspended and banned from the opera house until further notice.

            Goecke has been given the next few days to apologize “comprehensively” and explain himself to theater management “before further steps are announced,” it added.

            The ballet director appeared at least partly unrepentant, however. In an interview with public broadcaster NDR, Goecke acknowledged that his “choice of means wasn’t super, absolutely.”

            “Of course socially that is also certainly not recognized or respected, if one resorts to such means,” he said of the attack, adding that he had never done anything like that before and was “a bit shocked at myself.”

            Goecke said that while having his work “soiled for years” was a price he had been told he had to pay for being in the public eye, there was a limit.

            “Once a certain point has been reached, I disagree,"" he said.

            The German journalists’ association DJV denounced the attack.

            “An artist must tolerate criticism, even if it seems exaggerated,” the union’s regional head in Lower Saxony state, Frank Rieger, said. “Whoever reacts violently to criticism is unacceptable. The attack on the ... journalist is also an attack on press freedom.”BERLIN (AP) — A German newspaper critic had animal feces smeared on her face in the city of Hannover by a ballet director who apparently took offense at a review she wrote.The Hannover state opera house apologized for the incident and said Monday that it was suspending ballet director Marco Goecke with immediate effect.The daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that a furious Goecke approached its dance critic, Wiebke Huester, during the interval of a premiere at Hannover's opera house on Saturday and asked what she was doing there. It said that the two didn't know each other personally.The newspaper said that Goecke, who apparently felt provoked by a recent review she wrote of a production he staged in the Dutch seat of government, The Hague, threatened to ban her from the ballet and accused her of being responsible for people canceling season tickets in Hannover.He then pulled out a paper bag with animal feces and smeared her face with the contents before making off through a packed theater foyer, the newspaper said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809129,Polish officials observe training of Ukrainians on new tanks,"SWIETOSZOW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s president and defense minister met Monday with Polish and foreign instructors intensively training Ukrainian troops to operate the German-made Leopard 2 tanks that some European countries and Canada have offered Kyiv to help fight the Russian invasion. 

            President Andrzej Duda and minister Mariusz Blaszczak also watched Leopard 2 training at a military base and test range in Swietoszow, in southwestern Poland. The training is part of the European Union's military assistance to Ukraine, but Canadian instructors also have a role, as do Norwegians. 

            Taking part are Ukrainian tank crews from units fighting in the east of the country. The intensive training lasts up to 10 hours a day, including weekends, the Polish military said. Instruction is also being held in Germany.











            Duda voiced hope the tanks would help Ukrainian forces “in a much more efficient way to defeat the enemy.”

            He said the Ukrainian trainees have come straight from the front line. “You can see in their faces that these people have gone through terrible things, but they are determined to defend their homeland.”

            A Polish instructor, Senior Staff Warrant Officer Krzysztof Sieradzki, said the Ukrainians are so motivated to learn everything fast that the instructors “have to hold them back and transfer knowledge to them in small batches.”

            The trainees’ commander, Major Vadym Khodak, said they all have combat experience.

            “They didn’t come from the street, they’ve been fighting on our tanks for a long time, so I think learning how to operate these tanks will be a lot easier,” said Khodak, who's from Dnipro in eastern Ukraine.

             Khodak said the modern tanks would be a great help.

            “If we learn how to use them, we will put them to test in combat conditions and it will give a great effect,” he said.

             Stationed in Swietoszow are Poland's 10th Armored Cavalry Brigade and a U.S. armored cavalry combat group. 

            Warsaw is among the most active supporters of neighboring Ukraine, and has pushed European nations to provide the Leopard 1 and 2 tanks. Germany has pledged at least 178 Leopard 1 tanks and 14 Leopard 2s. Poland has pledged 14 Leopard 2s. Other contributing countries include Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands, while Britain has pledged Challenger tanks and the U.S. its M1 Abrams main battle tanks.

            Duda especially thanked Germany for allowing the German-made tanks to be made available to Kyiv and for its own contribution.

            Poland has also provided or pledged more than 300 of its Soviet-era T-72 tanks and modernized PT-91 tanks. 

            Ukrainian officials say they expect Russian forces to make a new drive in eastern and southern Ukraine, as the Kremlin strives to secure territory it illegally annexed in late September and where it claims its rule is welcomed.

            Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said last week that the first battalion of 31 Leopard 1 tanks in Ukraine should be ready in April. The first Ukrainian soldiers to be trained on the tanks departed for Germany last week.SWIETOSZOW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s president and defense minister met Monday with Polish and foreign instructors intensively training Ukrainian troops to operate the German-made Leopard 2 tanks that some European countries and Canada have offered Kyiv to help fight the Russian invasion.President Andrzej Duda and minister Mariusz Blaszczak also watched Leopard 2 training at a military base and test range in Swietoszow, in southwestern Poland.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809130,"After their genitals were cut, some women search for healing","CAIRO (AP) — She remembers it all: How female relatives held her down when she was 11, legs spread and genitals exposed. The fear that stiffened her body. The stranger in black holding the scissors. And the pain. 

            Like so many others, the 34-year-old Egyptian woman has lived with the psychological and physical repercussions of that day, when she was subjected to a practice many activists call “mutilation.” 

            For N.S., who asked to be identified only by her initials to discuss the sensitive topic, the trauma continuing into adulthood was accompanied by a desire to reclaim control over her health and body.











            “I had a feeling of being incomplete and that I will never feel happy because of this,” she said. “It’s a horrible feeling.”

            A global target aims to eradicate the deeply entrenched practice by 2030, and protect the next generations of girls, though campaigners acknowledge the difficulties in achieving that. The United Nations has designated an International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, or FGM, observed every Feb. 6. 

            Meanwhile, some women living with the consequences have embarked on deeply personal journeys to heal. They search for answers, sometimes scouring the Internet, amid treatment gaps in many countries, or shame and possible related sexual complications.

            Prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, cutting has been performed in communities of different cultures and faiths. It can be viewed as a rite of passage or linked to beliefs about chastity or femininity and cleanliness, and be fueled from generation-to-generation by social pressure.

            “It’s an entrenched social norm and really deeply rooted in cultural beliefs and sometimes in religious beliefs,” said Nafissatou Diop, an official with the United Nations Population Fund. “So to be able to make any change, people need to be convinced that this is not threatening their culture.”

            
                It’s estimated that at least 200 million women and girls are living with the aftermath of the practice, which can include partial or total removal of their external female genitalia and can cause excessive bleeding and even death. Long term, it can lead to urinary tract infections, menstrual problems, pain, decreased sexual satisfaction and childbirth complications, as well as depression, low self-esteem and post-traumatic stress disorder. 

            Some faith leaders have worked to eliminate the practice, while others condone it. In Egypt, where genital cutting has been widespread but illegal since 2008, top Islamic authorities condemn the practice. In online edicts or television appearances, they cite medical evidence of its harms and say it’s a custom with no sound religious basis. Still, there’s opposition to the bans in Egypt and elsewhere.

            Besides resistance from some religious leaders and other “traditional gatekeepers,” Diop said the campaign to change minds is hindered by limited funding, lack of political will from some governments and a perception that ending cutting reflects a “Western-led agenda.”

            Meanwhile, some women suffering the aftereffects post anonymously online in the quest for healing. They express feelings of distress, discomfort in their own skin, embarrassment or fears that being cut could stop them from getting married or condemn their marriages to failure. Some want information on medical procedures.

            Some considering medical interventions have found specialized treatment, including in the United States and Europe, where opposition to the practice is longstanding. But in many countries, options can be scarce or too costly.

            “There are so many treatment gaps in a lot of countries where FGM is really widely practiced,” said Christina Pallitto, a scientist leading the work on FGM at the World Health Organization. “A lot of health care providers receive no training at all.”

            N.S. turned to a private clinic in Egypt, Restore FGM, that opened in 2020 and has promoted treatments on Instagram and other social media.

            Dr. Reham Awwad, a plastic surgeon and clinic co-founder, said many patients’ initial visits are emotional. “One of the first things they’ll say is, ‘I’ve never spoken about this to anybody,’” she said. 

            The clinic, which also attracts clients from Sudan and elsewhere, offers surgical and non-surgical therapies. Psychological therapy is recommended, but many don’t pursue it, Awwad said.

            N.S. has struggled with anger at her parents and low self-confidence. She’s wrestled with sensitive questions: Will sex hurt? Will cutting lead to sexual problems in a marriage? What about pregnancy and childbirth? She struggled with pain and difficulty reaching orgasm.

            At Restore FGM, she opted for “reconstruction” surgery to remove scar tissue, expose uncut parts of the clitoris and make that more accessible. But some experts view the procedure with caution. 

            Surgeons who back it say it can improve function and appearance, and reduce pain. Others, including the WHO, call for more research and say there isn't adequate evidence to assess benefits, possible complications or long-term outcomes.

            “We don’t have a recommendation in favor of that at this moment because of the lack of evidence on the safety and the efficacy,” said WHO's Pallitto. “Any woman who has clitoral reconstruction should be offered sexual health counseling in conjunction with it."" Neither the procedure nor such counseling is widely available in high prevalence countries, she added. 

            It’s been more than a year since N.S. underwent the surgery. After treatment for post-surgery bruising, she's feeling better. “I no longer feel pain,” she said. “Sensation has also improved a lot.”

            But her journey isn't over. “I still need to work on accepting myself, accepting that this has happened to me and that it has been treated,” she said. ""The operation on its own is not enough. ... I don’t feel like I am completely over the trauma and I still struggle with the idea of physical touch.”

            She wants to pursue psychological therapy but says she can't afford it and worries about finding someone she can trust with such intimate details. 

            Basma Kamel recalled bleeding badly days after getting cut — at the hands of a doctor — when she was 9. For a long time, the 30-year-old Egyptian couldn’t trust her mother. Eventually, she concluded her mother didn’t know better and didn’t mean to hurt her. But feelings of being “different” lingered. 

            After moving from Egypt to England, she started looking for answers and turned to an FGM clinic and charity group for talk therapy. She's made progress, but her self-acceptance work is ongoing. 

            “The goal is to find peace with myself and accept my body and accept that I am a normal person,” she said. “Even if I have, like, a missing part from my body, I’m still a normal woman.”

            Dr. Jasmine Abdulcadir, a gynecologist at Geneva University Hospitals, treats women, mostly from East and West Africa, who underwent genital cutting. 

            The women have options for medical intervention, including a procedure to re-open a narrowed vaginal opening to help with everything from urination and menstruation to natural childbirth. 

            Clitoral reconstruction surgery also is an option. Abdulcadir said the procedure for that includes meeting with a psychologist, who is also a trauma-trained sex therapist, and making sure patients are prepared if the surgery ends up being mentally triggering. 

            She said some patients said they felt “born again” post-surgery, which she attributes to her practice's holistic approach. 

            “What is very important is that you are not just focusing on the clitoris,” Abdulcadir said. “It’s really the health of the person.”

            N.S. has yet to tell her family about her surgery. One day she might; she especially wants to tell her sister who was cut the same day she was.

            But she does speak up when she can.

            She threatened to call the police on learning some relatives were considering genital cutting for their daughters even though the practice is outlawed in Egypt.

            “I didn’t want anyone else to be tormented like I was,” she said. “Someone must put their foot down and say: ‘Enough.’”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809131,Czech soccer player Jakub Jankto comes out as gay,"PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) — Czech Republic midfielder Jakub Jankto posted a video on social media on Monday saying he is gay, making him one of the most high-profile male soccer players to come out.

            Jankto posted a video on Twitter saying: “I'm homosexual. And I no longer want to hide myself.”

            The 27-year-old Jankto is playing for Sparta Prague this season on loan from Spanish club Getafe. He has previously played for Italian clubs Sampdoria and Udinese and has made 45 appearances for the Czech national team, scoring four goals and setting up 13 more.











            “Like everyone else, I want to live my life with freedom, without fear, without violence, without prejudice, but with love,” Jankto says in the video.

            Sparta Prague's official Twitter account retweeted the video and said “you have our support.”

            “Live your life, Jakub,” the club added.

            Getafe also posted a message on Twitter, saying: “Our utmost respect and unconditional support to our player Jakub Jankto.""

            Brazil forward Neymar was asked about the video on Monday ahead of Paris Saint-Germain's match against Bayern Munich in the Champions League.

            “It’s an important day. I think each person should be free, I don’t have any problem with this,” Neymar said through a translator. “Every human being should be free to be who they want.”

            The Czech national team said “nothing is changing for us.""

            The Premier League responded to Jankto's video with a comment saying: ""We’re with you, Jakub. Football is for everyone.""

            Jankto has a 3-year-old son, David, with his partner Marketa. Their relationship ended in 2021.

            While women’s soccer features many prominent LGBTQ+ players, it's still rare for professional male players to come out publicly as gay.

            Josh Cavallo, who plays for Adelaide United in Australia, became the only openly gay player in a top men's league when he came out in 2021.

            Last year, Jake Daniels of English second-division club Blackpool became the first active male professional soccer player in Britain to publicly say he's gay.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809149,Disney is planning an Avatar experience at Disneyland,"The Walt Disney Co. is planning to add an Avatar experience to Disneyland and explore other opportunities at its theme parks as it looks for more ways to appeal to its guests.

            While Disney announced last week that it is cutting about 7,000 jobs as part of an ambitious companywide cost-savings plan and “strategic reorganization,” the company is pleased with the performance of its domestic theme parks and is actively looking for ways to grow the business. In Disney's most recent quarter, sales at its parks, experiences and products segment grew 21% to $8.74 billion, from $7.23 billion a year earlier.

            CEO Bob Iger said during the company's first-quarter earnings call that the success of the latest Avatar film is spurring the creation of an Avatar experience at Disneyland in California. The movie, “Avatar: The Way of Water,” is currently the fourth biggest film of all time globally with close to $2.2 billion earned at the box office to date. 











            While it is unclear what type of Avatar experience will be created at Disneyland, Iger said that when Pandora - The World of Avatar was launched at Walt Disney World in Florida, it prompted more people to visit Animal Kingdom, the park where Pandora is located. Pandora includes two rides, Avatar - Flight of Passage and Na'vi River Journey. 

            “We have learned that when we invest in increasing capacity, the Star Wars lands would be a good example of that, Pandora was a great example of that, we can grow our business. In fact, if you look at the results, when we put Pandora in Animal Kingdom, from year to year, they were stunning in terms of how many more people visited Animal Kingdom,” Iger explained.

            Iger, who returned as CEO in November following a challenging two-year tenure by his hand-picked successor, Bob Chapek, said that he has spoken with Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney parks, experiences and products, to look at all of the company's franchises to see where Disney can invest in them in its theme parks to increase capacity while preserving guest satisfaction.

            In another effort to keep guests happy, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said during the call that Disney managed to achieve significant revenue and operating income growth in the quarter despite purposefully lowering capacity at its domestic theme parks during select peak holiday periods by approximately 20% versus pre-pandemic levels in order to prioritize the guest experience.

            “Quarter-to-date, park attendance at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort are pacing above prior year, and based on reservation bookings, we expect to see this trend continue,” she said. 

            While Disney’s theme parks business has been performing well, many visitors over the past two years have been highly critical of increased prices and other moves that the company made, including the end of the Magical Express bus service from the airport in Orlando, Florida to Walt Disney World resorts, the implementation of the Genie planning and ride reservation system and its theme park reservation system.

            Listening to guests' concerns, Disney said last month that it was making several changes at its domestic theme parks, including some easier reservations. 

            Among the changes: it will cease charging for overnight self-parking at its Walt Disney World resorts; Walt Disney World annual passholders will be able to visit the theme parks after 2 p.m. without needing a park reservation (except on Saturdays and Sundays at Magic Kingdom) and individuals buying its Genie+ service will receive digital downloads of their ride photos taken in the park on the day of their purchase for no additional charge.The Walt Disney Co. is planning to add an Avatar experience to Disneyland and explore other opportunities at its theme parks as it looks for more ways to appeal to its guests.While Disney announced last week that it is cutting about 7,000 jobs as part of an ambitious companywide cost-savings plan and “strategic reorganization,” the company is pleased with the performance of its domestic theme parks and is actively looking for ways to grow the business.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809153,NBA launching 'Films for Fans' at All-Star weekend in Utah,"NEW YORK (AP) — The NBA will launch “NBA Films for Fans"" during All-Star weekend festivities in Salt Lake City.

            The initiative involves filmmakers from 11 countries developing 24 short films that were commissioned by the NBA. The NBA is hoping the films provide a deeper outlook into the milestones and events that shape the league's influence across the globe from the filmmaker's perspective.

            Filmmakers were given access to the league's video archives for either historical content or action from this season.











            Films from Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Senegal, the United Kingdom and United States will debut on Friday during a red-carpet event and be screened throughout the weekend at the NBA Crossover fan experience. All the films can be viewed on the league's app later this season.

            Filmmakers from Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines and South Africa are also involved in the project. 

            Among the films debuting on Friday is “Champagne Stain,” which was produced by the Utah Jazz in partnership with Brigham Young University's Adlab. 

            The other films that will debut are “Salve, Guys!” from João Gabriel Caffarelli of Brazil, “Yaari” by Pavneet Gakhal and Amol Gakhal, Daniel Arroniz and Sam Neter/Hoopsfix (United Kingdom) with “Got Next,” “Renaissance” by Abdoulaye Ndao and Mohamed Diokhané of Senegal and Tier Zero's (Canada) “Bounce,”

            The league launched a redesigned app before the start of the season that includes more original programming.

            “We are excited to work with this global group of filmmakers and bring their unique basketball stories to fans around the world through the new NBA App,” said Andrew Yaffe, NBA Senior Vice President, Head of Social, Digital & Original Content, in a statement. “Films for Fans will showcase the power of basketball to create connections among people of different cultures and backgrounds through their shared love of the game and the excitement of the NBA.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809155,A few poems Maine Gov. Janet Mills wrote over the years,"Maine’s Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said poems “elevate our soul.” Here are a few that she has written over the years:

            “For My Granddaughter” (2016)

            Men running for office











            Bellow about the future,

            Punch the air, 

            Wave their arms,

            Yell on the tv.

            While in the delivery room,

            It is the fist you notice first,

            The quiet fingerlets 

            That cling to one another

            With invisible strength

            Clutching their own new skin,

            forming a circle

            Only she understands.

            Then the face, wrinkly,

            The little body,

            A sturdy belly, 

            knees and feet 

            in miniature.

            Eyes and ears

            Ready to know 

            Everything that is new,

            Everything that is.

            A brain ready 

            To learn,

            A heart ready 

            To love.

            That is your god

            Warming your own heart,

            That is your god 

            holding your hand 

            So tight,

            Never letting you 

            Go.

            “Every government

            Ought to have 

            A Department of the Future,”

            Kurt Vonnegut said.

            And here, she is.

            Clenching all our

            Tomorrows.

            —

            “For Stan” (2015)

            There are things I have seen I cannot explain –

            The way a child cries and laughs 

            At things only it knows.

            The way autumn always brings

            the smell of fries and donuts, musty hay,

            the baying of old animals, the carnies and barkers,

            the crowd in the grandstand shouting with a single voice, 

            the chill of a new wind.

            The way spring brings everything back we’ve

            Sheltered all the long dark days—

            Grass in the field, 

            water in the stream,

            hope in the heart.

            And the way a dying person sometimes 

            has one last good day.

            Our friend Harry had one last good day.

            In deep coma, it was the end, they said,

            as they pulled the tubes,

            and he awoke with a smile.

            And when you and I went to say goodbye,

            He was having the best party, 

            Telling such stories with his

            Firefighter friends, his wife, his neighbors,

            Before he died.

            There are other things,

            Like red lights in the sky

            That twice appeared when I was on 

            An old road on a dark night.

            Like the music we heard at the lake

            That came from swift bats, tall trees,

            naked loons at dusk.

            Like the man lost three days in deep woods,

            given up for dead, who

            Walked out, following the river 

            To the trail.

            Like the time I found you, love,

            and two lives changed.

            Like you, when we came to say goodbye. 

            Laughing like lightning,

            You knew us, you saw us, you held us,

            And thanked us, every one, 

            knowing it was the end.

            And like me now

            holding in my hands 

            your old smile,

            missing that music, 

            looking,

            following the river 

            to another trail. 

             —-

            “This Fussy Fatality” (from “Balancing Act: A Book of Poems by Ten Maine Women,” 1975)

            This fussy fatality I have found must

            belong to some god-like dog-day dreamer

            who, falling under the frequency of

            the full moon, forgets us,

            blinded by forgeries of the past,

            his eyes two telescopes of time turned inward.

            Pink and scarlet of dusk’s purgatorial

            keeps us in-and-out, flame-bent for

            purposes priceless and unfathomed.

            We return from forms of perfect mind

            to under zero, acknowledging the

            conditions of the day,

            harboring in undergarments our wares

            preserved with secret sacrifice.

            Logic makes checker squares on all that’s touched

            feigning bravado from every face I see;

            yet from the crevice of all eyes

            come these spiralling scarlet circles,

            mad-apple crimson.

            —

            “So What” (from Island Journal, 2021)

            You are Miles Davis

            disinterred, a Hamlet

            of Hypothermia,

            Part Faberge cloud, 

            One piece of sky, 

            a little amputation of eagle

            Hiding strong wide wings,

            wild offspring of Canada,

            queen of camouflage,

            perched like a coyote

            waiting for dark. 

            Cynical archangel,

            Singing soundless 

            hymns to an ancient heart,

            what memories, fears, 

            loves and retributions 

            do you inspire?

            Something too long absent, 

            someone saying

            “I have always known you

            And know you still,”

            eyes promising 

            never to leave you.

            Your talons clutch 

            a branch that is 

            my former soul. 

            I say, I am Kind of Blue

            like that sea of yours.

            You smile

            As if you have just 

            Devoured a crow

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809156,Brutality detailed in Alex Murdaugh case; 2 jurors get COVID,"A pathologist detailed the close range shots that killed Alex Murdaugh's wife and son as prosecutors on Monday started winding up their case in the disgraced South Carolina attorney's double murder trial.

            But the future of the trial could be in jeopardy. Two jurors were dismissed Monday morning after contracting COVID-19, leaving just three alternates available as the trial's fourth week started. Both sides suggested delaying the trial in case the coronavirus might be spreading though the jury and others in court, but Judge Clifton Newman decided to continue.

            “At the moment, we are going to encourage everyone here to mask up for your own protection as well as the protection of these proceedings and each other,” Newman told the courtroom, which has been packed with more than 200 people for the past two weeks.











            Murdaugh, 54, faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murdering his wife, 52-year-old Maggie, and their 22-year-old son Paul near kennels at the family's Colleton County home on June 7, 2021. Prosecutors have said he killed his family in order to buy time to cover up other crimes for which he is accused, including stealing money from clients and insurance fraud.

            Alex Murdaugh has adamantly denied killing his wife and son.

            Pathologist Dr. Ellen Riemer gave some of the most graphic testimony of the trial Monday as she detailed what she found during the autopsies of the victims.

            Paul Mudaugh was shot twice with a shotgun. The first wound skirted his chest with pellets. The second shot was to his head and was so violent it left his skull nearly empty, Riemer said.

            Maggie Murdaugh was hit by four or five bullets. The first two wounds happened as she faced the shooter and weren't fatal, but a bullet did hit her kidney, the pathologist said.

            “She had projectiles, ammunition going through her left kidney, you can imagine that was a very painful wound and could have cause her to fold over in pain.,"" Riemer said.

            While bent over facing away from the shooter, the fatal shot then went into and out of her chest and into her face. “It basically destroyed her brain,"" Riemer said.

            While the pathologist stood in front of the jury, drawing on diagrams and detailing her autopsy photographs, Alex Murdaugh sat at the defense table, distraught or crying at times. He fidgeted with a yellow highlighter and the disbarred attorney seemed so distracted that it took him several seconds to stand when the bailiff said “All rise!"" as the judge left the bench at the end of the day.

            The defense will start its cross examination of Riemer on Tuesday.

            Earlier Monday, state agents testified about DNA.

            Genetic material from all three Murdaughs were found on the shirt Alex Murdaugh was wearing when he found the bodies after returning home from visiting his ailing mother. State Law Enforcement Division agent Sara Zapata testified

            But Zapata said it wasn't blood and the defense said it isn't unusual for people who spend time together to get their DNA on clothes and other items and Alex Murdaugh said he checked on the bodies after he found them.

            DNA was also found under Maggie Murdaugh's fingernails and it didn't match her husband or son, Zapata said on cross examination.

            Further testing wasn't done on the DNA, including sending it to a nationwide database to see if there was a match, the agent said.

            DNA tests didn’t find genetic material from anyone tested on a blue raincoat found at the house of Alex Murdaugh’s mother, Zapata said. Earlier testimony said the inside lining of the coat had a large amount of gunshot residue inside.

            DNA from a number of people who volunteered samples — other workers on the Murdaugh property, the family of a teen killed in a crash by a boat driven by Paul Murdaugh and other family members of Alex Murdaugh — was not found on items from the crime scene, Zapata said.

            Monday marked the 13th day of testimony with prosecutors still presenting their case.

            The dangers of a long trial seemed even more evident with the COVID-19 news. Along with the two jurors, the clerk of court also has the virus, the judge said. 

            Newman said jurors agreed to wear masks. He rejected suggestions from both the defense and prosecutors to delay the trial until that second round of tests Wednesday, reduce the over 200 people allowed to attend the trial each day or order everyone in the courtroom to wear masks other than testifying witnesses and questioning attorneys.

            Jurors will be tested again Wednesday, the judge said.

            “My only concern is we don’t create train wreck with this jury,"" said defense attorney Dick Harpootlian, who immediately began wearing a mask.

            Prosecutor Creighton Waters said he agreed with the defense that delaying the trial for a few days to make sure the virus isn't spreading is much better than losing so many jurors there has to be a mistrial and three weeks of work is gone. He also suggested limiting the number of people inside the large, century-old courtroom. The trial is being livestreamed and shown on television.

            “A little less numbers might be warranted. None of us want to limit anything, but we're in different paradigm. Both of us have a concern about getting this thing to the end without COVID causing it to fall apart,"" Waters said.

            The judge said he would keep all options in mind, but for now the trial will continue without any changes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809157,Poetic politician: Maine governor's skills include verse,"AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Many Mainers know Democratic Gov. Janet Mills as a level-headed leader, a pragmatic politician or even a former tough-minded prosecutor. But there’s another side to the governor — she’s a poet.

            “If more politicians knew poetry, and more poets knew politics, I am convinced the world would be a little better place in which to live,” Mills said, quoting John F. Kennedy at her inauguration last month.

            Her inner poet emerged after she dropped out of Colby College and headed to San Francisco for the Summer of Love before returning to college and later attending the University of Maine School of Law. 











            Mills, who is addressing a joint session of the Legislature on Tuesday to discuss her goals for her second term, said it was in San Francisco in 1967 that she began composing poetry in her head to counter the daylong drudgery of typing forms at an insurance company to pay the bills.

            Decades later, sitting behind her desk in the State House, Mills said she remains convinced that poetry and the arts are essential to being well rounded and understanding the world.

            “I think it behooves us as public policymakers and public officeholders to extend our intellects as broadly as we can,” Mills said. “Poetry and reading are a way of learning the world and opening our eyes and ears to what other people are experiencing.”

            Two of her early poems were published in 1975 in “Balancing Act: A Book of Poems by Ten Maine Women,” compiled by Agnes Bushell, of Portland, who was frustrated that male publishers were giving short shrift to the poetry of women.

            The words of Mills, then a law student, stood out from the other poets, Bushell said. One of her poems was entitled, “He Looks in the Metal Waters,” about a man’s gloomy breakfast routine, and the other was about introspection and irony, “This Fussy Fatality.”

            “Culture isn’t dead. We have a governor who’s a poet. How great is that?” said Bushell, who has since published “Balancing Act 2: An Anthology of Poems by Fifty Maine Women.”

            Mills, whose father gave her a journal at age 5 and whose mother was an English teacher, enjoys transforming journal notes into verse on subjects ranging from the birth of her granddaughter to a painting of a snowy owl by Jamie Wyeth.

            When her husband of three decades, Stanley Kuklinski, died, Mills recorded her memories of him in a poem, recalling loons and tall trees, and writing of “following the river / to another trail.”

            As governor, Mills served on a committee that selected the state’s current poet laureate, Julia Bouwsma. and she restored poetry to inaugurations. Last month, her second inauguration featured not one, but two poets — Bouwsma and Richard Blanco, former President Barack Obama’s inaugural poet. 

            Blanco read a poem that he penned, but not before lauding Mills as “an amazing poet in her own right.”

            Wesley McNair, University of Maine at Farmington professor emeritus, recalled Mills attending poetry readings in her hometown, and said prose makes her a better leader.

            “Its beauty comes from the truths it tells,” he said of poetry. “You can’t be a poet without understanding the world and the people in it, and having a compassion toward them.” 

            Mills, 75, said she doesn’t write political poetry, but the poem for her granddaughter’s birth started with a stanza about male politicians who “Yell on the TV.”

            The poem, written in the hospital waiting room while the TV blared, quickly shifted to hopefulness and optimism surrounding her newborn granddaughter.

            “Eyes and ears / Ready to know / Everything that is new, / Everything that is,” she wrote. “A brain ready / To learn, / A heart ready / To love. / That is your god / Warming your own heart, / That is your god / holding your hand / So tight / Never letting you / Go.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809158,Japan watchdog OKs new safety rules to extend reactor life,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese nuclear regulators on Monday approved contentious safety evaluation changes and draft legislation to allow aging reactors to operate longer, in a rare split decision in which one of the five commissioners dissented.

            The Nuclear Regulation Authority, responding to a new government policy to scrap the current 60-year operating limit for reactors, adopted a new system in which additional operating extensions can granted every 10 years after 30 years of service. No maximum limit is specified. The authority also adopted a draft revision of the reactor regulation law for approval by parliament.

            It’s a major change from the current 40-year operating limit with a possible one-time extension of up to 20 years, a rule that was introduced as part of stricter safety standards adopted after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.











            Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s Cabinet adopted a plan last Friday to maximize the use of nuclear energy, including accelerating restarts of halted reactors, prolonging the operational life of aging plants and development of next-generation reactors to replace those designated for decommissioning, as Japan struggles to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

            One of the authority's five commissioners, Akira Ishiwatari, a Tohoku University geologist, opposed the changes.

            “We are open to revisions (to rules) if changes are clearly to contribute to greater safety for scientific or technical reasons. To me, these changes do not serve either purpose,” Ishiwatari said at Monday’s commission meeting. 

            Another commissioner, Tomoyuki Sugiyama, deputy chief of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s nuclear safety research center, said he felt the discussion was “rushed"" as a result of government pressure and that the regulatory body should have acted more independently.

            Authority Chairman Shinsuke Yamanaka denied that the watchdog yielded to government pressure and said he believes the new safety system is adequate. 

            The authority's task is “to inspect the safety of (aging) reactors no matter how long their operational lifespan is,"" he said. “We simply do not issue safety permits for reactors with progressing deterioration.""

            Anti-nuclear sentiment and safety concerns rose sharply in Japan after the Fukushima disaster, in which a massive earthquake and tsunami damaged the plant's cooling system, resulting in the meltdown of three reactors and the release of large amounts of radiation.

            The government has been pushing for a return to nuclear power amid worries of energy shortages following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a global push to reduce greenhouse gases. 

            While maintaining a 20%-22% target for nuclear energy's share of the energy mix for 2030, the government previously denied it was considering building new nuclear plants or replacing aged reactors in an apparent attempt to avoid triggering criticism from a wary public.TOKYO (AP) — Japanese nuclear regulators on Monday approved contentious safety evaluation changes and draft legislation to allow aging reactors to operate longer, in a rare split decision in which one of the five commissioners dissented.The Nuclear Regulation Authority, responding to a new government policy to scrap the current 60-year operating limit for reactors, adopted a new system in which additional operating extensions can granted every 10 years after 30 years of service.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809161,Judge to release parts of Georgia special grand jury report,"ATLANTA (AP) — A Georgia judge on Monday ordered the partial release later this week of a report by a special grand jury that investigated efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss.

            The report’s introduction and conclusion, as well as a section in which the grand jurors expressed concerns that some witnesses may have lied under oath, will be released on Thursday, said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.

            Any recommendations on who should or should not be prosecuted will remain secret for now to protect their due process rights, McBurney wrote.











            McBurney's order came three weeks after hearing arguments from prosecutors, who urged the report be kept secret until they decide on charges, and a coalition of media organizations, which pressed for its release.

            The release is a significant development in one of several cases that threaten legal jeopardy for the former president as he ramps up a 2024 White House campaign. The special grand jury spent about seven months hearing testimony from witnesses including high-profile Trump allies, such as attorney Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and high-ranking Georgia officials, such as Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp.

            
                McBurney wrote that the report includes recommendations for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, including “a roster of who should (or should not) be indicted, and for what, in relation to the conduct (and aftermath) of the 2020 general election in Georgia.” The special grand jury did not have the power to issue indictments, and it will ultimately be up to Willis to decide whether to seek indictments from a regular grand jury.

            The special grand jury's final report was requested by Willis and is meant to inform her investigative decision-making process, McBurney wrote, adding that the panel's investigation was largely controlled by the district attorney and her team and was “a one-sided exploration."" 

            There was “very limited due process” for people for whom the grand jurors recommended charges, McBurney wrote. Some may not have had the opportunity to appear before the panel, and those who did appear did not have the right to have their lawyers present or to offer any rebuttal.

            For that reason, the judge concluded, it is not appropriate to release the full report at this time.

            It is not clear if or when Willis will present the case to a regular grand jury with the purpose of getting one or more indictments. At a Jan. 24 hearing, she said decisions are ""imminent” but did not elaborate. 

            Trump told The Associated Press last month that he did “absolutely nothing wrong.” He said he felt “very confident” that he wouldn’t be indicted.

            At the January hearing, Willis had argued against the immediate release of the report, saying it could violate the rights of potential defendants and negatively affect the ability to prosecute those who may be charged with crimes.

            “We want to make sure that everyone is treated fairly and we think for future defendants to be treated fairly, it is not appropriate at this time to have this report released,” Willis said during the hearing.

            A group of news organizations, including the AP, argued in favor of releasing the report immediately in full, saying that public interest in the report is “extraordinary.”

            “The discomfort of the prosecuting authority in disclosing court records isn’t enough to make them sealed,” said attorney Tom Clyde, representing the media. “It has to be significant, identifiable evidence that’s going to cause a problem.”

            Willis said in an emailed statement Monday that she believes McBurney's order is “legally sound and consistent with my request” and that she has no plans to appeal. Clyde declined to comment.

            Willis and her team began investigating two years ago, shortly after the release of a recording of a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. In that conversation, the then-president suggested that Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, could “find” the votes needed to overturn Trump’s narrow election loss in the state to Biden, a Democrat.

            “All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,” Trump said on the call.

            Since then, the investigation’s scope has broadened considerably. The special grand jury operated behind closed doors, as required by law, but public court filings and hearings related to its work provided a window into some of the topics Willis was exploring. Those included:

            — Phone calls by Trump and others to Georgia officials in the wake of the 2020 election.

            — A group of 16 Georgia Republicans who signed a certificate in December 2020 falsely stating that Trump had won the state and that they were the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors.

            — False allegations of election fraud made during meetings of state legislators at the Georgia Capitol in December 2020.

            — The copying of data and software from election equipment in rural Coffee County by a computer forensics team hired by Trump allies.

            — Alleged attempts to pressure Fulton County elections worker Ruby Freeman into falsely confessing to election fraud.

            — The abrupt resignation of the U.S. attorney in Atlanta in January 2021.ATLANTA (AP) — A Georgia judge on Monday ordered the partial release later this week of a report by a special grand jury that investigated efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss.The report’s introduction and conclusion, as well as a section in which the grand jurors expressed concerns that some witnesses may have lied under oath, will be released on Thursday, said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.Any recommendations on who should or should not be prosecuted will remain secret for now to protect their due process rights, McBurney wrote.McBurney's order came three weeks after hearing arguments from prosecutors, who urged the report be kept secret until they decide on charges, and a coalition of media organizations, which pressed for its release.The release is a significant development in one of several cases that threaten legal jeopardy for the former president as he ramps up a 2024 White House campaign. The special grand jury spent about seven months hearing testimony from witnesses including high-profile Trump allies, such as attorney Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and high-ranking Georgia officials, such as Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp.McBurney wrote that the report includes recommendations for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, including “a roster of who should (or should not) be indicted, and for what, in relation to the conduct (and aftermath) of the 2020 general election in Georgia.” The special grand jury did not have the power to issue indictments, and it will ultimately be up to Willis to decide whether to seek indictments from a regular grand jury.The special grand jury's final report was requested by Willis and is meant to inform her investigative decision-making process, McBurney wrote, adding that the panel's investigation was largely controlled by the district attorney and her team and was “a one-sided exploration.""There was “very limited due process” for people for whom the grand jurors recommended charges, McBurney wrote.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809172,"RIP Medical Debt seeks to buy, resolve more hospital debt","RIP Medical Debt has found a working formula to relieve medical debt for millions of people. It still has room to grow.

            The New York nonprofit uses donations to buy medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors for pennies on the dollar. It mostly targets the debt of people with low incomes and then forgives the amounts.

            Founded in 2014, the organization says that it has relieved more than $8.5 billion in medical debt so far.











            Researchers have estimated that there is well over $100 billion in collections in the U.S. 

            RIP Medical Debt named Allison Sesso CEO shortly before the pandemic hit in 2020. She wants to continue expanding the amount of debt her organization buys, especially from hospitals. She also wants to draw more attention to a system that keeps generating debt.

            The 47-year-old executive spoke recently with The Associated Press. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

            Q: How does most of the debt you relieve develop? Does it come from a certain type of care? 

            A: It can be from dental work. It can be from a hospital bill. It is more about how good your coverage is and how expensive the cost is and loopholes within the system than it is from the provider type.

            Q: Has anything surprised you about the nature of the debt you relieve?

            A: I had this assumption that medical debt was burdening people in large sums. And I’ve come to realize that a lot of the debt is deductible amounts, which means that people are underinsured, not uninsured. 

            Q: How small are these amounts that wind up in collections? 

            A: We relieve a lot of debts that are $500 to $5,000. 

            Q: You have started buying debt from hospitals that they are not trying to collect. Why bother?

            A: When the hospital stops collecting, they don’t notify the patients. … So in the patient’s mind, they still owe the debt. Then the patient doesn’t get the care that they need from that hospital. There’s a mental health component to having medical debt that is significant. It creates anxiety and stress. 

            Q: Why do you relieve debt randomly and not take requests?

            A: For efficiency and for lowering our costs. It would require a lot of individuals to look at those applications and sort through them. 

            Q: Are there new areas of debt collection you want to explore? 

            A: Our main goal is to get as much debt as possible from more and more hospitals, ideally, and other direct providers. But we also understand that our work is a stopgap. So, we’re increasingly using our ability to turn $1 into $100, on average, of medical debt relief to raise awareness about the issue and advocate for policy changes that fix this problem more fundamentally.RIP Medical Debt has found a working formula to relieve medical debt for millions of people.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809174,NATO chief says Ukraine's ammunition use outstripping supply,"BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned Monday that Ukraine is using up ammunition far faster than its allies can provide it and putting pressure on Western defense industries, just as Russia ramps up its military offensive.

            “The war in Ukraine is consuming an enormous amount of munitions and depleting allied stockpiles,” Stoltenberg said. “The current rate of Ukraine’s ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production. This puts our defense industries under strain.”

            According to some estimates, Ukraine is firing up to 6,000-7,000 artillery shells each day, around a third of the daily amount that Russia is using almost one year into the war.











            Speaking on the eve of a two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers, Stoltenberg said the waiting time for the supply of “large-caliber ammunition has increased from 12 to 28 months,” and that “orders placed today would only be delivered two-and-a-half years later.”

            The former Norwegian prime minister said that President Vladimir Putin has already begun Russia’s long-anticipated spring military offensive in Ukraine, “so we must continue to provide Ukraine with what it needs to win and to achieve a just and sustainable peace.”

            “It is clear that we are in a race of logistics. Key capabilities like ammunition, fuel, and spare parts must reach Ukraine before Russia can seize the initiative on the battlefield. Speed will save lives,” he told reporters in Brussels.

            NATO members and Ukraine’s other allies are meeting at the alliance’s headquarters on Tuesday under U.S. supervision to drum up more weapons and ammunition for the war-torn country. Many NATO allies are bilaterally supplying weapons to Ukraine, but NATO as an organization only provides non-lethal aid.

            On Tuesday evening, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his counterparts will separately hold talks with Ukraine’s defense minister. On Wednesday, they will discuss NATO’s defenses on its eastern flank, close to Russia. Moves to beef up military budgets are also on the agenda.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809178,Berlin election win boosts German conservatives,"Berlin's voting map after its repeated state election on Sunday night resembled a great leaf charred at the edges — a green patch for the urban center, where the environmentalist Green Party dominated, surrounded by suburbs all shaded in black, the color that traditionally represents the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU).Though the map was only an imperfect reflection of the actual result — in fact, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) appear to have come second overall by the number of votes — it did reflect the cultural divide entrenched in Germany: A young, center-left generation most concerned about the climate set against an older suburban generation whose main worry is criminality.The CDU, who won the election comfortably with over 28% of the vote, seems to have carried the day because of their focus on security and order: A voter survey carried out by infratest dimap showed that this was the most important issue for Berlin voters overall: 23% picked it as their biggest concern, ahead of housing (17%) and the climate (15%). And the CDU, most voters agreed, was the party best capable of addressing the problem.The chaotic and violent scenes on New Year's Eve in some of Berlin's urban centers almost certainly helped the CDU. Polls in November and December showed the SPD, the CDU, and Greens running a closer race, but in the first week of January, the same week that Berlin voters could begin sending in their mail ballots, stories about young men throwing fireworks at emergency workers dominated headlines across Germany.That fed a debate with racist overtones that the CDU's leading candidate Kai Wegner was able to capitalize on. Many of the areas that saw the most trouble had large immigrant communities, and Wegner promptly provoked a media debate by demanding that the Berlin government release the first names of German nationals suspected of causing trouble, so that the public could determine whether they were of Arab or Turkish origin.Though Wegner's suggestion was angrily criticized by his rivals, SPD Mayor Franziska Giffey and Green Party candidate Bettina Jarasch, it seems to have tapped into deep prejudices in the population: 83% of new CDU voters questioned by infratest dimap agreed with the line: ""I think it's good that they clearly name the problems with immigrants.""Frank Decker, a political scientist at the Rheinische Friedrichs Wilhelms University in Bonn, says that this particular issue could well come to bite Olaf Scholz's federal coalition. ""The CDU has made a point out of insisting that certain issued are being made taboo,"" he told DW. ""And what is interesting about Berlin is that this issue helped the CDU more than it did the AfD. This protest vote against migration policy normally drove the AfD.""As it happened, the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) took 9% of the vote at this election, but that was only one point more than in 2021, while the CDU was able to add over 10 points to its 2021 result.""The center-left parties, especially the Greens, will have to ask themselves how they address this issue,"" said Decker. ""And it's a permanent issue. This is a society of immigration, plus we'll be dealing with the issue of refugees for a while.""The prospect will perhaps give new impetus to Friedrich Merz, the CDU's national leader, who himself campaigned in Berlin and who kicked up his own racism debate in early January with his ""little pashas"" comment.On a national TV debate show, Merz drew a direct causal link between the trouble on New Year's Eve in Berlin and unruly eight-year-old Arab children in Germany's elementary schools who, he claimed, have no respect for their female teachers. ""That's where it begins,"" Merz said on the Markus Lanz TV show. ""These are predominantly young people from the Arab world who are not prepared to stick to the rules here in Germany.""The other issue in the Berlin election that is likely to become salutary for national politics is climate policy — and in particular traffic policy. Young German climate protesters have taken to directly confronting motorists across Germany by blocking roads, and the Green Party's plans to pedestrianize parts of the city have antagonized conservative voters.""Traffic plays a large part in emissions, and there is an objective need for something to be done, but it is highly controversial, especially in major cities,"" said Decker. ""It is very difficult to reduce traffic, and likely to cause many conflicts, and the federal coalition is going to have to address this issue too.""Wegner's victory seems to represent a vindication for Merz's conservative leadership: It is the first state parliament that the CDU has been able to wrestle from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD in the post-Merkel era. The problem is that no German government functions without a coalition and even a rightward-shifting CDU will have to make centrist compromises.As things stand, Berlin's current center-left coalition of SPD, the Greens, and the socialist Left Party still have a parliamentary majority — which means that any CDU-led government in the capital would have to make some good offers to the SPD or the Greens to lure them away.""This is obviously not a defeat for Merz, but it doesn't help him much either,"" said Decker. ""I think it's probable that the current coalition will continue, so the CDU doesn't gain much from this victory.""Chancellor Olaf Scholz appears to have emerged from Sunday night's results relatively unscathed. Though his Social Democrats scored one of their worst-ever results in the German capital, surveys suggest that voters blamed the SPD for the notoriously poor service in administrative offices. Berliners' frustration with the administration has become legendary in Germany, and that ire appears to be most directed at the SPD.Meanwhile, the CDU's natural coalition partners, the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), are in a nationwide slump that was reflected dramatically in Berlin on Sunday night when they dropped below the 5% threshold for entering parliament. With the FDP relegated to a minor party, the CDU will be forced — both in Berlin and potentially across the country at the next election — to find common ground either with the SPD or the Greens.There is also the prospect of a similar situation developing in Thuringia. In the eastern German state, the Left Party State Premier Bodo Ramelow has been leading a fragile left-wing minority government.The AfD, the second biggest group in parliament is currently leading Thuringian polls, raising the real possibility that it could become the biggest party at the next election in 2024, but will not be able to govern as no other party is willing to work with it yet.Edited by Rina Goldenberg",2023/02/13,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809179,Ukraine updates: NATO warns of donor ammunition shortages,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday that the transatlantic military alliance would be increasing its targets for ammunition stockpiles, amid rapid depletion of its inventory in the war in Ukraine.""The war in Ukraine is consuming an enormous amount of ammunition,"" Stoltenberg said. ""The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current production rates. This puts our defense industries under strain. (...) So we need to ramp up new production and invest in our production capacities.""Stoltenberg also said NATO members would ""step up and sustain"" support for Ukraine, saying: ""NATO stands with Ukraine for as long as it takes.""Ammunition resupply has been a concern for Ukrainian and Russian forces alike for months.DW's correspondent in Kyiv, Nick Connolly, said he had spoken with Ukrainian commanders who said they were having to make ""very tough choices"" about ammunition usage.""I've met commanders of howitzers, of artillery pieces, who've told me that they don't know how long they can keep on doing their job, if they will be forced to withdraw and move away from positions and wait for more artillery,"" Connolly said. ""This is a very real problem.""""Right now you're seeing Ukraine and its allies scrambling around the world — looking as far afield as Pakistan and South Korea for artillery munitions,"" Connolly said. ""We've had reports of Pakistani-made Soviet-caliber munitions heading this way, [and] of US troops being asked to send munitions that they had stockpiled in South Korea to Europe for Ukraine.""Meanwhile, at NATO's Brussels headquarters, Stoltenberg also touched on several other topics related to the war.Among other things, he said he expected the possible supply of NATO aircraft to Ukraine to be a topic of discussion when the alliance's defense ministers assemble on Tuesday. Kyiv has been calling for western-built combat aircraft on and off since the conflict began, and with renewed intensity since the most recent agreement on sending battle tanks was approved just a few weeks ago.The issue is also liable to be raised at this week's Munich Security Conference. The MSC's chairman Christoph Heusgen, formerly Chancellor Angela Merkel's foreign and security policy advisor, told DW ahead of the event that in his opinion it might be wise for politicians to ask for military advice on the matter.""Instead of putting red lines, I think we have to see what is needed,"" Heusgen said. ""When you talk to military experts, they say that when you fight a war like this, you need a combination of several weapons. (...) I think this should be a military decision.""Asked about a possible Russian offensive in Ukraine, NATO's Stoltenberg said it had already begun.""We see no sign whatsoever that [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin is preparing for peace,"" he said. ""We see how they are sending more troops, more weapons, more capabilities.""Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Monday, February 13.Ukrainian and Russian authorities both reported heavy fighting in the region around Bakhmut in Donetsk on Monday, although precise details differ between the parties.The Ukrainian military reported heavy shelling all along the frontline and said that 16 settlements near Bakhmut had been bombarded. It also said it had repelled a number of attacks near Bakhmut.Russia's military said its troops had managed to advance 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to the west in four days, without saying exactly which part of the long front lines in Ukraine had moved.Meanwhile, the head of the Russian Wagner Group militia, Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose comments the Kremlin has been known to later contradict in the past, said that his mercenary force had taken the village of Krasna Hora on the northern edge of Bakhmut.Donetsk is one of the regions partially occupied by Russia which Moscow has unilaterally declared part of its territory following referendums that were not recognized by the international community. Analysts believe Moscow is keen to claim control of the entire region, perhaps as a main goal for its expected offensive as the winter weather abates.Meanwhile, the British Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence report that there was evidence of Russia shoring up its southern front defensive fortifications, for instance around Zaporizhzhia, as another potential indication of plans for an offensive elsewhere on the front.The US Embassy in Moscow issued a travel advisory on Monday advising potential visitors to steer clear and urging US citizens in Russia to leave.""Do not travel to Russia due to the unpredictable consequences of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces, the potential for harrassment and the singling out of US citizens for detention by Russian government security officials, the arbitrary enforcement of local law, limited flights in and out of Russia, the Embassy's limited ability to assist US citizens in Russia, and the possibility of terrorism,"" the notice said.""US citizens residing in Russia should depart immediately. Exercise increased caution due to the risk of wrongful detentions,"" it said.The notice also warned that already-scant ""travel options may suddenly become even more limited"" for those seeking a flight out.Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is visiting Finland and Sweden on Monday and Tuesday, as the two Nordic countries seek to join NATO having remained neutral throughout the Cold War.""We are working towards this goal together,"" Baerbock said prior to departure on Monday. ""That's what I will underline in Finland and particularly in Sweden.""Joining NATO requires the approval of all exisitng members of the alliance. And ever since Finland and Sweden voiced an interest, Turkey has been calling their bids into question.Ankara accuses the two countries of harboring people it considers terrorists, often either Kurds or supporters of cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses of orchestrating the 2016 attempted coup.However, Turkey's objections to Sweden's bid, in particular, has ratcheted up in recent weeks. This follows a pair of public protests, the first by Kurdish activists and the next by far-right groups, that involved the burning of an effigy of Erdogan and of copies of the Quran.Baerbock was set to meet her Finnish counterpart Pekka Haavisto in Helsinki on Monday.Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto was in Belarus on Monday. He said he used the visit to urge peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.""Hungary expects all members off the international community to act for the sake of peace as soon as possible, and to avoid actions that risk prolonging or escalating the war,"" Szijjarto wrote on Facebook.Hungary has trodden an ambiguous line since the war broke out.Prime Minister Viktor Orban has condemned Russian aggression but stopped short of calling out President Vladimir Putin by name.Orban, who nurtured close ties with Minsk and Moscow before the war broke out, has also refused to send weapons to Ukraine, calling instead for an immediate ceasefire and peace talks.""Obviously, many people will attack the visit, but our position is clear: communication channels must be kept open,"" Szijjarto said after a meeting with his counterpart, Sergei Aleinik. ""Without communication channels there are no negotiations, without negotiations there is no peace.""Russian troops used Belarussian territory as a launchpad for their invasion of Ukraine last February. Also on Monday, Belarussian state media reported that the country would host three sets of military drills by the Collective Security Treat Organization — a Russian-dominated alliance of former Soviet states — in the course of 2023.Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the Russian region of Chechnya, told the state's flagship Rossiya-1 television channel in an interview aired on Monday that he believed Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine by the end of the year.Kadyrov said Russia had the forces necessary to take the capital Kyiv — despite having been driven back from the outskirts of the city in the opening phase of the conflict — and that it also needed to capture Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv and its main port, Odesa.""I believe that, by the end of the year, we will 100% complete the task set for us today,"" Kadyrov said.The former Chechen separatist fighter, who Putin installed as the region's leader in 2007, also told the chat show that he opposed negotiations with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Not unlike the Wagner Group's Prigozhin, Kadyrov has been known to make claims that contradict Moscow's in recent months. Both like to portray their forces as more effective on the battlefield and less soft, as they might characterize it, than Russia's regular military.msh/rs (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809181,Myanmar's military rulers to let 'loyal' citizens carry guns,"BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar's military government plans to allow people who are “loyal to the nation,” including government employees and retired military personnel, to carry licensed firearms, but they must comply with orders from local authorities to participate in security and law enforcement actions, the military and media reports said.

            The announcement fanned fears of even more violence in a country wracked by what some United Nations experts have called a civil war.

            The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi two years ago, triggering widespread peaceful protests that turned into armed resistance after security forces used lethal force to suppress all opposition.











            A 15-page document about the new gun policy attributed to the Ministry of Home Affairs was initially circulated on pro-military Facebook accounts and Telegram channels. It was also published by pro-military and independent news outlets, which stated that it had been issued on Jan. 31 after being approved in December at a Cabinet meeting.

            The new policy would allow people over the age of 18 to be licensed to carry several types of guns and ammunition. The document says recipients of gun permits must be “loyal to the nation, of good moral character” and not involved in disturbing state security. It also says license holders must comply when instructed by local authorities to participate in security and law enforcement actions.

            The military's spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, confirmed the policy Sunday to the BBC Burmese-language service, saying it needed to be issued because some people were asking to carry weapons to protect against attacks by anti-military groups.

            Two pro-military online news media quoted Police Brig.-Gen Kyaw Lin, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, as saying that the policy revives and modifies one introduced in 1977 by the government of the late dictator Gen. Ne Win. After a massive but unsuccessful popular pro-democracy uprising in 1988, the military revoked gun licenses for civilians and ordered people to turn in all firearms.

            The decision to license guns is widely seen as a way for the military government to arm its supporters to help state security forces battle pro-democracy opponents.

            Criminal activity has reportedly increased due to the chaos caused by the fighting and the government’s focus on battling its political opponents. Most violence, however, involves fighting between the army and guerrillas belonging to the pro-democracy People’s Defense Force, the loosely organized armed wing of the main opposition group, the National Unity Government, and their allies in ethnic minority militias. 

            The NUG was established by elected lawmakers who were prevented from taking their seats when the army seized power and serves as an underground parallel national administration.

            Nan Lin, a co-founder of the University Students’ Unions Alumni Force, a nonviolent pro-democracy activist group, said the military is taking the action because it is under great political and military pressure.

            “The military still can’t see the situation correctly. I think they are trying to create more conflict and break down society,” Nan Lin said Monday.BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar's military government plans to allow people who are “loyal to the nation,” including government employees and retired military personnel, to carry licensed firearms, but they must comply with orders from local authorities to participate in security and law enforcement actions, the military and media reports said.The announcement fanned fears of even more violence in a country wracked by what some United Nations experts have called a civil war.The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi two years ago, triggering widespread peaceful protests that turned into armed resistance after security forces used lethal force to suppress all opposition.A 15-page document about the new gun policy attributed to the Ministry of Home Affairs was initially circulated on pro-military Facebook accounts and Telegram channels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809182,Maine blueberries vs. fly: US senator files bill to help,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The wild blueberry, Maine's most important fruit, could get some help fighting off a pest under legislation proposed by the state's Republican U.S. senator. 

            Maine is the only state in the country with a significant harvest of wild blueberries, which are smaller cousins to the more ubiquitous cultivated berries. The wild blueberry, which grows in the sprawling barrens of Maine's rural east, is the state's official berry and one of its most significant exports.

            The berries are threatened by the spotted wing drosophila, a fruit fly from East Asia first detected in the United States in 2008. The fly was first located in Maine in 2011. 











            U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Monday that she has submitted a bill to establish a fund of $6.5 million per year for five years to advance research and reduce the fly's population.

            “Maine’s wild blueberries are an integral part of our state’s heritage and play a major role in our state’s economy,” Collins said. “The pervasiveness of the spotted wing drosophila has threatened the livelihoods of fruit farmers across the country.""

            The fly lays eggs in fruit crops such as blueberries and raspberries. It causes more than $700 million in estimated economic loss per year nationwide, Collins said. The fly has also caused increased use of insecticide in fruit crops, she said.

            The Collins proposal comes as Maine's wild bluebery crop has recently experienced improvement after a few years of downturn. Farmers harvested more than 100 million pounds (45 million kilograms) of the berries in 2021 after falling short of that number for four years in a row. The crop was also worth more per pound in 2021 than it had been in years, state records show.

            The Collins legislation, if approved, would “provide needed resources in the fight against a novel invasive pest insect,” said Eric Venturini, executive director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine.

            Collins introduced the legislation along with Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan and Republican U.S. Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809183,Washington Nationals owner Ted Lerner dies at 97,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Ted Lerner, the billionaire real estate developer whose family bought the Washington Nationals in 2006, has died, the team announced Monday. He was 97.

            A Nationals spokesperson said Lerner died Sunday of complications from pneumonia at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

            Lerner's group purchased the Nationals from Major League Baseball in 2006 for $450 million after the team was moved to the U.S. capital from Montreal. He was managing principal owner until ceding that role to son Mark in 2018.











            Under the Lerners’ ownership, the Nationals went from one of baseball’s worst teams in their first several seasons in Washington to World Series champions in 2019. The Lerners also are credited with revitalizing the city's Navy Yard area since Nationals Park opened in 2008.

            “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Founding Managing Principal Owner Theodore N. Lerner,” the team said in a statement. “The crowning achievement of his family business was bringing baseball back to the city he loved — and with it, bringing a championship home for the first time since 1924. He cherished the franchise and what it brought to his beloved hometown.”

            Lerner was born in 1925, the year after the Washington Senators beat the New York Giants in the World Series. That franchise left the city in 1960 to become the Minnesota Twins, and its expansion replacement lasted a decade before moving to Texas as the Rangers.

            Washington did not have a baseball team until MLB assumed control of the Expos and moved them there from Montreal in 2005. The group led by the Lerners was chosen as the winning bidder.

            Last year, the Lerners began exploring the possibility of selling the team, which is worth $2 billion, according to Forbes, which estimates the family's net worth is $6.6 billion thanks to the Nationals and Lerner Enterprises, one of the largest property-owning companies in the Washington area.

            MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement called Lerner “an extraordinary American success story"" — a former stadium usher who brought baseball back to prominence in the nation's capital.

            “I have great appreciation for Ted's impact on his hometown and the game he loved,” Manfred said. “The Nationals have always remained loyal to Ted's vision of unity, philanthropy and civic pride in Washington.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809184,Flint lifts 3-day boil water advisory caused by line break,"FLINT, Mich. (AP) — Flint, Michigan, lifted a three-day boil-water advisory Monday following the discovery last week of a break in a 24-inch transmission line.

            The advisory was lifted at 10:45 a.m. following two consecutive 24-hour testing rounds for bacteria, according to a news release from officials in the city of 80,000, whose water was famously tainted with lead nearly a decade ago.

            Additional testing was being done on the repaired transmission main. That line now is isolated from the rest of the water system and will remain out of service until two rounds of testing for that area have been completed.











            The advisory was announced late Friday morning, and residents and businesses were asked to boil water before using it for drinking, cooking, brushing teeth or washing dishes.

            City crews also have been flushing water mains around the city, which officials said could cause discoloration. Water customers should flush their plumbing, clean faucet aerators and change water filter cartridges, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

            “I want to thank residents for their patience over the weekend as we took precautions and completed mandated testing to protect public health and safety,” Mayor Sheldon Neeley said. “We will continue to aggressively pursue funding and resources to renovate our water infrastructure.”

            Flint’s water became tainted with lead in 2014 after officials started using the Flint River to save money while a new pipeline to Lake Huron was built. The water wasn’t treated to reduce its corrosive qualities, causing lead to break off from old pipes and contaminate the system for more than a year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809185,"U-Haul driver's NYC 'rampage' leaves 1 dead, 8 hurt","NEW YORK (AP) — A man driving a U-Haul truck swerved onto sidewalks and plowed into cyclists and scooter riders in New York City on Monday, killing one person and injuring eight others before police were able to pin the careening vehicle against a building following a mileslong pursuit through Brooklyn.

            The driver was arrested and taken to a police station. His son identified him as Weng Sor, 62, a troubled man with a history of harmful behavior and stints behind bars.

            The mayhem unfolded over a harrowing 48 minutes as the truck tore through Brooklyn's bustling Bay Ridge neighborhood, hitting people at several points along the way before veering on and off a highway as police gave chase.











            Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell described it as a “violent rampage,"" but said there was no evidence of “terrorism involvement.”

            The nine people struck by the vehicle ranged in age from 30 to 66. All were men. One of the injured people was a police officer. 

            The 44-year-old man who was killed suffered a head injury when he was hit by the truck roughly a half hour after it struck the first victim, the police department said in a statement. 

            The truck's winding route ended when a police cruiser cut it off and blocked it against a building near the entrance to a tunnel leading from Brooklyn to Manhattan, more than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from where the chase began.

            Weng Sor's son, Stephen Sor, 30, told The Associated Press that his father had a history of mental illness and, until recently, was living in Las Vegas, where records show he was convicted and served time for multiple acts of violence, including stabbing his own brother.

            “Very frequently he’ll choose to skip out on his medications and do something like this,"" Stephen Sor said in an interview outside his Brooklyn home. ""This isn’t the first time he’s been arrested. It’s not the first time he’s gone to jail.”

            The destruction shattered the late-morning routine and immediately evoked memories of other vehicle assaults on bikers and pedestrians in the crowded city, including a terrorist’s deadly 2017 attack that killed eight people on a Manhattan bike path and a disturbed motorist’s rampage through Times Square the same year that killed one and injured 20.

            The truck struck the first victim at 10:17 a.m., police said, and other reports followed as the vehicle moved through a busy section of Brooklyn, just north of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge along New York Harbor.

            The neighborhood, a melting pot of immigrants from Europe, Asia and the Middle East, is known as the setting of “Saturday Night Fever,” and parts of TV’s “Blue Bloods.” Each fall, it hosts a leg of the New York City Marathon.

            Katherine Aronova said she saw the U-Haul run a red light, hit a delivery worker on an e-bike in the middle of the road and drag him a short distance.

            “His face was covered with blood. He was unconscious,” and his shoes were scattered on the sidewalk, Aronova said. “The electric bicycle was destroyed completely.”

            A security camera captured the truck clipping a scooter, then swerving onto a sidewalk and nearly plowing into a pedestrian, who dived to safety just in time. A police patrol car then followed the truck down the sidewalk at high speed.

            “I was in shock and didn’t know what was happening until I saw the police patrol was chasing it,” a witness, Andrea Vasquez, said in Spanish. “Thank God that man saved himself,” she added of the person who narrowly escaped.

            After the chase ended, authorities examined the vehicle to make sure it didn't contain explosives.

            Sor rented the truck in West Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 1 and was due to return it there on March 3, U-Haul spokesperson Jeff Lockridge said. He provided a valid driver’s license and paid for a 30-day rental in advance. U-Haul had no record of Sor previously renting from the company, Lockridge said.

            Stephen Sor said he was surprised when Weng Sor showed up in Brooklyn in the middle of the night about a week ago. He said they didn't speak often and described their relationship as “rocky.”

            “I try to just distance, as long as he leaves us alone,"" Stephen Sor said. 

            In 2015, Weng Sor stabbed his brother in Las Vegas and served about 17 months in a Nevada prison, according to court and prison records. In 2020, he stabbed someone in the arm and chest with a knife and was sentenced to 364 days in county jail, with about 10 months of time already served.

            Before pleading guilty in that case, Sor underwent several months of evaluations at state psychiatric facilities until he was found competent to face charges, court records show. The records don’t list a possible diagnosis, but note that Sor was placed on medications.

            In an earlier Nevada case, Sor was ordered to undergo counseling and perform community service after pleading guilty to misdemeanor battery in 2005. The judge noted at the time that Sor was moving to New York and ordered him to submit to a mental health evaluation once there.

He was unconscious,” and his shoes were scattered on the sidewalk, Aronova said. “The electric bicycle was destroyed completely.”A security camera captured the truck clipping a scooter, then swerving onto a sidewalk and nearly plowing into a pedestrian, who dived to safety just in time. A police patrol car then followed the truck down the sidewalk at high speed.“I was in shock and didn’t know what was happening until I saw the police patrol was chasing it,” a witness, Andrea Vasquez, said in Spanish. “Thank God that man saved himself,” she added of the person who narrowly escaped.After the chase ended, authorities examined the vehicle to make sure it didn't contain explosives.Sor rented the truck in West Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 1 and was due to return it there on March 3, U-Haul spokesperson Jeff Lockridge said. He provided a valid driver’s license and paid for a 30-day rental in advance. U-Haul had no record of Sor previously renting from the company, Lockridge said.Stephen Sor said he was surprised when Weng Sor showed up in Brooklyn in the middle of the night about a week ago. He said they didn't speak often and described their relationship as “rocky.”“I try to just distance, as long as he leaves us alone,"" Stephen Sor said.In 2015, Weng Sor stabbed his brother in Las Vegas and served about 17 months in a Nevada prison, according to court and prison records. In 2020, he stabbed someone in the arm and chest with a knife and was sentenced to 364 days in county jail, with about 10 months of time already served.Before pleading guilty in that case, Sor underwent several months of evaluations at state psychiatric facilities until he was found competent to face charges, court records show. The records don’t list a possible diagnosis, but note that Sor was placed on medications.In an earlier Nevada case, Sor was ordered to undergo counseling and perform community service after pleading guilty to misdemeanor battery in 2005. The judge noted at the time that Sor was moving to New York and ordered him to submit to a mental health evaluation once there.___Associated Press journalists Julie Walker, David Martin, Michelle Price and Robert Bumsted in New York City; Olga Rodriguez in San Francisco; and Ken Ritter and Rio Yamat in Las Vegas, Nevada, contributed to this report.",2023/02/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809186,NFL takes no breaks as Chiefs' Super Bowl revelry wanes,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs awoke Monday still reveling in the glow of their second Super Bowl title in a four-year span, while the Philadelphia Eagles were left to lament how close they came to winning another Lombardi Trophy of their own.

            The rest of the league? Well, they've been looking toward the future for a while now.

            The day after the Super Bowl represents the first day of the offseason, though that's a bit of a misnomer — nobody around the NFL takes any time off. There are some hard business decisions to be made with current players, scouting that needs to be wrapped up and a game plan to formulate before the league holds its annual draft at the end of April.











            The draft, coincidentally, will be in Kansas City this year.

            Here's a look at what comes next now that the confetti has settled on State Farm Stadium:

            FRANCHISE SITUATION

            The first big date on the offseason calendar is Feb. 21, when teams can designate franchise or transition players. The tag can be given to one unrestricted free agent and guarantees another year under contract at a fixed contract.

            The Chiefs did that last season with left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. when the two sides couldn't agree on a long-term deal, and it's possible Brown gets tagged a second time. Other players that could get the tag include Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson and Commanders defensive lineman Daron Payne. The deadline for clubs to designate players is March 7.

            TIME TO STUDY

            The weeklong NFL scouting combine begins Feb. 28 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, where NFL teams will have a chance to test dozens of prospects in a single setting. Otherwise, scouts will fan out across the country beginning March 7, when individual colleges hold their pro days, and clubs can begin to host up to 30 draft-eligible players for visits.

            The Bears have the first pick, though happy with quarterback Justin Fields, it's possible they trade it to a team looking for one of the top QBs available. Those begin with Alabama's Bryce Young, Ohio State's C.J. Stroud and Will Levis of Kentucky. 

            Other potential No. 1 picks are Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter and Alabama pass rusher Will Anderson Jr.

            FREE AGENT FRENZY

            There is a three-day window beginning March 13 in which clubs can contact and begin negotiating with free agents, and qualifying offers for restricted free agents are due by March 15. That's also the date all clubs must be under the salary cap with the new league year — and signing of players — officially beginning at 4 p.m. ET.

            Jackson would be the most coveted player available if he's not franchised, though that is unlikely. Ravens linebacker Roquan Smith, Eagles defensive tackle Javon Hargrave and Bengals safety Jessie Bates III are among the top free agents on defense while Giants running back Saquon Barkley could be in line for a massive deal.

            PICK ME

            The next big party after the Super Bowl is the NFL draft, taking place from April 27-29 at Union Station in Kansas City. It's the first time the city will host the selection bonanza, and given the hometown Chiefs will still be celebrating a Lombardi Trophy, you can be sure the party downtown will last throughout the weekend.

            GET TO WORK

            Teams are allowed to hold a three-day rookie minicamp in early May, while voluntary offseason workouts last throughout the early summer. The teams will also hold a mandatory minicamp before taking a break ahead of training camp, which for most teams starts the last week of July — and ushers in the next season in earnest.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809187,Maersk sues Evergreen over 2021 blocking of Suez Canal,"CAIRO (AP) — The world’s biggest shipping company said Monday it sued a rival shipping line in a Danish court, seeking compensation for ship delays that resulted from the blocking of the Suez Canal by a hulking vessel two years ago.

            The Panama-flagged vessel Ever Given, operated by Evergreen Marine Corp., ran aground in March 2021, blocking the global waterway for nearly a week. The enormous vessel was released in a massive salvage operation.

            In an email to The Associated Press, shipping giant A.P. Moeller-Maersk said it filed a claim against Evergreen Marine, the vessel’s Japanese owner and its German technical manager, Bernhard Schulte Management, in the Danish Maritime and Commercial High Court in Copenhagen, Denmark.











            The Copenhagen-based shipping company said the claim is related to losses suffered during the canal’s blockage. It did not provide further details, including when it filed the claim.

            The ShippingWatch, a news outlet covering maritime industry, however, reported Monday that 50 of Maersk’s container ships were delayed because of the canal’s blockage.

            Maersk seeks millions of dollars in compensation to cover among other things costs it incurred from customers with goods being transported on the delayed ships, the report added.

            Evergreen Marine and Bernhard Schulte did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The ship's Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., was not immediately reachable.

            The Ever Given was on its way to the Dutch port of Rotterdam on March 23, 2021 when it slammed into the bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the Egyptian city of Suez.

            A massive salvage effort by a flotilla of tugboats helped by the tides freed the skyscraper-sized vessel six days later, ending the crisis, and allowing hundreds of waiting ships to pass through the canal.

            After it was freed, the Ever Given was held for more than three months in Egypt amid a financial dispute with authorities. Its release came after its owner reached a settlement with canal authorities over compensation following weeks of negotiations and a court standoff. Officials did not reveal details on the terms of the settlement but canal authorities had sought more than $900 million in compensation.

            The canal's blockage forced some ships at the time to take the lengthy alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip, requiring additional fuel and other costs. Hundreds of other ships waited in place for the blockage to end.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809188,Blast from gas leak in Ottawa suburb seriously injures two,"OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A morning gas explosion in an Ottawa suburb Monday injured 12 people, including two children. Two men were seriously hurt and had to be pulled out of the rubble, officials say.

            The blast destroyed four houses still under construction and damaged surrounding homes. 

            The two children were among six people taken to hospital immediately after the explosion, Ottawa Paramedic Services said. Two men had serious injuries, but all in hospital were in stable condition, paramedics said. Six injured people were treated and released at the scene.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809189,"Super Bowl top moments happened on, off and above the field","GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 in a memorable Super Bowl that included plenty of big plays on and off the field. Here's a look at some top moments from Sunday night's game:

            CHIEFS WIN

            Harrison Butker kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds remaining to lift the Chiefs to their 38-35 win over the Eagles. The Chiefs have won the Super Bowl in two of the past four seasons and their roll shows no sign of stopping, especially with Patrick Mahomes throwing the passes. Kansas City’s quarterback overcame a sprained ankle to earn Super Bowl MVP honors after throwing for 182 yards and three touchdowns. Coach Andy Reid also captured his second Super Bowl title and this one came at the expense of the franchise he coached for 14 seasons before coming to Kansas City.











            RIHANNA

            Rihanna provided a high-flying halftime performance in Arizona. The nine-time Grammy Award winner began and ended the halftime show suspended high above the field. She wore a puffy, bright red jumpsuit with tight, rubbery garb underneath as she stood on a transparent rectangular platform that raised and lowered as she belted out the lyrics to her hit songs over the turf.

            Oh yeah, and to top it off, she did the performance while pregnant, news that was revealed after the show.

            VALLEY OF FUN

            The Phoenix area is no stranger to hosting big events, but this was a huge weekend even by its standards. The winter and spring months are already tourist season in Arizona and the Super Bowl added another layer of revelry, adding tens of thousands of people who filled bars and restaurants and at times spilled into the streets. Throw in the Phoenix Open, the PGA Tour’s version of a boozy mosh pit on grass, and the Phoenix area transforms into a weeklong Valley of Fun. 

            “The buzz is definitely here,” said Jay Parry, president and CEO of the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee.

            BRADBERRY SEES YELLOW

            This could be a highlight or lowlight, depending on rooting allegiances, but James Bradberry’s penalty on the final drive was undeniably a huge moment. The Chiefs were driving and faced third-and-8 at the Eagles 15-yard line with 1:54 remaining when Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw incomplete to JuJu Smith-Schuster. But officials flagged Bradberry for defensive holding, which negated the incompletion and, more importantly, gave the Chiefs a first down. Replays showed Bradberry made light contact with Smith-Schuster, though it didn’t appear to affect the play much. Many fans — and some football commentators — disagreed with the call. The only person who didn’t seem upset with the call was Bradberry himself.

            “It was a holding. I tugged his jersey,” Bradberry said. “I was hoping they would let it slide.”

            BETTING BONANZA

            Mahomes rallied the Chiefs to victory and for that, casinos around the U.S. were pleased. Kansas City’s 38-35 win meant the books were winners on the betting line, which generally favored the Eagles by 1 1/2 points and drew plenty of wagering on the NFC champions. That victory by the casinos offset a loss on the total, which was 51 1/2 points at many places. Sports betting has become huge business in the U.S. now that two-thirds of the country can do so legally.

            TONEY’S EMERGENCE

            Kadarius Toney’s struggles with injuries and inconsistency prompted the New York Giants to give up on him midway through his second NFL season. The Kansas City Chiefs gave him a second chance and the talented receiver proved he’s no first-round bust. Toney made history and two of the biggest plays in the Chiefs’ win. His 65-yard punt return in the fourth quarter was a particularly big moment. It was the longest punt return in Super Bowl history.

            BOLTON'S SCOOP, SCORE

            The first hint it might be the Chiefs' night came in the second quarter when Hurts fumbled and Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton scooped up the football and ran 36 yards for the touchdown. It was at a pivotal moment in the evening: The Eagles were ahead 14-7 and driving at midfield when Bolton's game-changing play occurred. Suddenly, the game was tied and the drama was just beginning.

            STAPLETON’S ANTHEM

            The Super Bowl might be known for its extravagance, but country singer and songwriter Chris Stapleton didn’t need any high-tech help for a stellar performance during the national anthem. Stapleton stood at midfield with just a guitar and his smooth baritone voice, belting out an emotional rendition that had Eagles coach Nick Sirianni in tears by the end.

            HURTS SO GOOD

            Hurts wasn’t victorious in his first Super Bowl appearance, but the young quarterback has no reason to be ashamed. He was phenomenal in Arizona, setting a Super Bowl record with three rushing touchdowns. On top of that, he completed 27 of 38 passes for 304 yards and a touchdown, showing poise and perfect throwing touch on a number of occasions.

            SLICK FIELD

            The field at State Farm Stadium may have looked immaculate, but by the second half, it was clear that traction was not great. Said Eagles left tackle Jordan Mailata: “It was like playing on a water park.” The grass at State Farm Stadium is on a giant tray that is rolled in and out of the retractable roof stadium. The field sits out in the Arizona sun on warm days and is brought back inside when it gets cold. This particular batch of grass started growing in May of 2021, but even a nearly two-year process couldn’t produce a flawless field.

            HELLO HAMLIN

            Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin made it to the Super Bowl. He made three appearances during the week in Arizona, including on the field at State Farm Stadium prior to the game. It’s been a little more than a month since Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati. Sunday’s appearance was another milestone in his remarkable recovery. “I’m allowing that to be in God’s hands,” Hamlin said in an interview with Fox’s Michael Strahan. “I’m just thankful he gave me a second chance.”

            West Indies began the day on 133-4 and Chase was largely untroubled on a dry pitch before becoming one of three wickets for Zimbabwe seamer Victor Nyauchi at the Queens Sports Club.

            Chase had put on 60 for the fifth wicket with Kyle Mayers, who was then caught for 30 by Wellington Masakadza off leg-spinner Brandon Mavuta (3-73).











            Nyauchi ended Chase's innings when he bowled him with a full length, in-swinging delivery after he and Da Silva had shared a partnership of 85 for the sixth wicket.

            “Obviously I was looking for that century…it's disappointing,” Chase told reporters. “But that was a very good ball by the bowler. So credit goes to him.”

            Nyauchi went on to bowl Da Silva for 44 and had Alzarri Joseph caught splendidly for four at mid-wicket by Tanunurwa Makoni with a running effort.

            Nyauchi's first two wickets came from three balls and the Harare paceman believes the spin-friendly surface is now offering something for the quicker bowlers too.

            “It’s been a bit difficult…but it’s changing, it’s now nipping a bit,” said Nyauchi. “We’re happy to see that the ball is swinging now and getting to the keeper.”

            Zimbabwe, with a mainly second-string side, is without Gary Ballance. The former England batter, who scored a historic undefeated century on his debut for his native country last week, is missing through illness.

            Zimbabwe was skittled out for 115 in its first innings and the West Indies are hoping to post a commanding lead, probably aiming not to bat again in the test.

            “I’m happy with the position we are in,” Chase added. “If we can push the lead up to 250 that will be enough for us to bowl at Zimbabwe.”

            The first test ended in a draw.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809191,"Astros celebrate, Cubs-Cardinals in London mark schedule","CHICAGO (AP) — So many returns for baseball this summer. Some happy, some not so much.

            Here are some dates to remember for the coming season:

            THURSDAY, MARCH 30











            Chicago White Sox at Houston Astros: Jose Altuve and the Astros get another opportunity to celebrate the franchise's second World Series championship when they host Tim Anderson and the White Sox on opening day. Houston beat Philadelphia in six games to take home the title last year. It's also a reunion for first baseman José Abreu, who signed a three-year contract with the Astros in November after spending the past nine seasons with the White Sox.

            TUESDAY, APRIL 18

            Los Angeles Angels at New York Yankees: On the 100th anniversary of the opening of original Yankee Stadium, marked by a Babe Ruth home run, Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Angels open a three-game set at the new Yankee Stadium. Despite another stellar season by Ohtani, the Angels went 73-89 last year in the franchise's seventh consecutive losing season.

            FRIDAY, APRIL 28

            Atlanta Braves at New York Mets: The longtime rivals play for the first time since their NL East race last year. After Atlanta rallied for the division title and New York was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, Mets owner Steve Cohen went on an epic spending spree that included the additions of pitchers Justin Verlander and Kodai Senga. Atlanta lost All-Star shortstop Dansby Swanson in free agency, but it acquired catcher Sean Murphy in a three-team trade in December.

            MONDAY, MAY 1

            Philadelphia Phillies at Los Angeles Dodgers: Trea Turner and Philadelphia visit Freddie Freeman and Los Angeles for a matchup of NL contenders. Turner played for the Dodgers last year, batting .298 with 21 homers and a career-high 100 RBIs. The All-Star shortstop then signed a $300 million, 11-year contract with the Phillies in December. Philadelphia will begin the season without Bryce Harper after the slugger had right elbow surgery in November, but he is expected to return to the lineup by the All-Star break.

            FRIDAY, JUNE 16

            New York Yankees at Boston Red Sox: Aaron Judge and the Yankees make their first 2023 trip to Fenway Park for the opener of a weekend series against Rafael Devers and the Red Sox. New York went 13-6 against Boston last year, outscoring the Red Sox 109-76. But the rivals play 13 times this season because of baseball's new balanced schedule. New York added Carlos Rodón to its rotation in December, while Boston signed Japanese outfielder Masataka Yoshida during a relatively quiet winter.

            SATURDAY, JUNE 24

            Chicago Cubs at St. Louis Cardinals: Baseball returns to London Stadium when Ian Happ and the Cubs take on Willson Contreras and the Cardinals. The NL Central rivals were supposed to play in London in 2020, but the games were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Contreras signed an $87.5 million, five-year contract with St. Louis in December, joining one of Chicago's biggest rivals after spending his first seven seasons with the Cubs. The Cardinals' first game of the season at Wrigley Field is May 8. 

            TUESDAY, JULY 11

            All-Star Game at Seattle: The All-Star Game heads to Emerald City for the first time since 2001 and third time overall. The last time Seattle hosted the Midsummer Classic, Cal Ripken Jr. homered to lead the American League to a 4-1 victory over Barry Bonds and the National League. Mariners star Julio Rodríguez was the runner-up to Juan Soto in last year's Home Run Derby, and the dynamic outfielder will have plenty of support if he decides to try the event again this year at T-Mobile Park.

            MONDAY, AUG. 28

            Texas Rangers at New York Mets: Ace right-hander Jacob deGrom returns to New York after signing a $185 million, five-year contract with Texas over the winter. The 34-year-old deGrom spent his first nine seasons with the Mets, winning two Cy Young Awards while becoming one of the majors' most dominant pitchers. But he was hampered by injuries the past two years. With the addition of deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi, Texas is looking to challenge Houston for the AL West title.

            WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 6

            Minnesota Twins at Cleveland Guardians: The Twins and Guardians meet for the last time in the regular season in the afternoon finale of a three-game series. Minnesota is looking to return to the playoffs after an offseason highlighted by a $200 million, six-year deal with Carlos Correa. Cleveland won the AL Central last year for the first time since 2018, finishing 14 games ahead of the third-place Twins. The Guardians added some power to their lineup when they signed first baseman Josh Bell to a two-year contract.

            WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 13

            San Diego Padres at Los Angeles Dodgers: Manny Machado and San Diego conclude their season series against Mookie Betts and Los Angeles with the finale of a three-game set. The Dodgers won the NL West title in 2022 for the ninth time in 10 years, but they were eliminated by the second-place Padres in their NL Division Series. San Diego made one of the most surprising moves of the offseason, signing shortstop Xander Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year contract. Los Angeles was pretty quiet over the winter, but it still has one of the majors' deepest rosters.

            SUNDAY, OCT. 1

            Tampa Bay Rays at Toronto Blue Jays: Tampa Bay finishes the regular season with a three-game set at Toronto in an AL East matchup. The Rays made the playoffs in 2022 for the fourth straight year, but they were swept by Cleveland in the wild-card round. A healthy season from infielder Wander Franco could provide a big boost for Tampa Bay. Toronto also made the playoffs last year, and it could be even better this season after signing Chris Bassitt in free agency and acquiring slugger Daulton Varsho in a trade with Arizona.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809202,Review: Paranoia-racked thriller 'Bright and Deadly Things',"“Bright and Deadly Things” by Lexie Elliott (Berkley)

            A mysterious argument. A seductive student. A mystical clock. And a shocking series of break-ins that begin to seem less like a coincidence and more like a pattern. 

            Thriller author Lexie Elliott returns with a paranoia-racked mystery set at an academic retreat in the idyllic French Alps, aptly titled “Bright and Deadly Things.” Mostly taking place from the recently widowed Emily Rivers’ point of view, the novel is also scattered with diary entries revealing more about the party of Oxford professors, grads and undergrads, as well as the history of the chalet via previous parties’ journal entries. All are written in an urgent-yet-thoughtful first-person present tense that feels smooth and keeps pages flowing.











            When Emily misses her flight, she comes home in the midst of a break-in. Later, it seems someone is snooping through her things at the chalet. Emily begins to suspect her fellow “chaletites” as more and more strange behavior bubbles up among the cast of 13 academics. 

            In an added layer of peculiarity, this year's trip to the Chalet des Anglais coincides with the 100th anniversary of the remote cabin burning down. And the bewitching grandfather clock that somehow survived the fire has suddenly turned up after being missing for decades.

            Before long, there's a string of puzzling problems and disturbing discoveries coiled so thick it’s not even clear where to aim your fear. Elliott forces your eyes to glance down the page because you can’t wait a second longer to find out what happens next. 

            “Bright and Deadly Things” features a special kind of psychological horror that's just as terrifying in the dark of night as it is in the light of day, akin to Ari Aster's 2019 film “Midsommar.” Both are mainly set in a secluded, halcyon environment with a host of young academics and competing interests, peeling back reality and shaving away at the audience's touchstones to analyze psychology and human behavior. 

            Between Emily's uncertainty in her own mental state after the death of her husband, and the persistent intrusive thoughts peppered throughout, the novel is shrouded in doubt so thick it's hard to know as a reader what's real without flipping back to verify for yourself. 

            But if you’re worried Elliott will leave something hanging, have no fear: It’s pretty well wrapped by the end of the trip, and a couple of super-late twists tie up the remaining loose ends. Let that buoy you through the painstakingly brutal waiting periods when answers are just out of reach.“Bright and Deadly Things” by Lexie Elliott (Berkley)A mysterious argument. A seductive student.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809203,"T20 World Cup: England 2 from 2, South Africa back on track","CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — England made it two from two at the Women's T20 World Cup when 18-year-old Alice Capsey's rapid 51 from 22 balls set up a four-wicket win over Ireland in Paarl on Monday.

            Host South Africa put in a strong performance in the field to bowl New Zealand out for 67 and win by 65 runs to get back on track after surprisingly losing the tournament opener to Sri Lanka.

            England's victory kept it top of Group 2 ahead of India having played a game more. South Africa is third in Group 1 behind Sri Lanka and Australia and still has work to do to progress. The top two teams from each group go through to the semifinals.











            England's route to victory should have been much easier after bowling the Irish out for just 105 in 18.2 overs, spinners Sophie Ecclestone (3-13), Sarah Glenn (3-19) and Charlie Dean (2-26) collecting eight wickets.

            But England's chase stuttered straight away when Sophia Dunkley tried to heave one over the top in the first over and was caught at mid-on by Arlene Kelly.

            Capsey put England back on course as she raced to her half-century in just 21 balls, hammering 46 in boundaries with 10 fours and a six. It was a match-winning intervention by a player who looked likely to miss the World Cup when she broke her collarbone diving for a catch against West Indies in December.

            Her recovery — aided by screws and a metal plate in her shoulder — came quicker than expected and she did enough to set up the win, even when wickets fell after she was out.

            Capsey's dismissal, to a diving catch in the outfield by Leah Paul, sparked a run of five English wickets for 33 runs before Katherine Sciver-Brunt and Ecclestone saw their team home.

            No. 2-ranked England reached 107-6 in 14.2 overs for a scratchy win and faces a big test against No. 4 India in its next match on Saturday.

            South Africa was under pressure after Friday's failure on opening night against the Sri Lankans. And the home batting against New Zealand wasn't convincing, posting 132-6 as allrounder Chloe Tryon top-scored with 40 in the middle order.

            South Africa won it in the field. Left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba had New Zealand opener Bernadine Bezuidenhout stumped from the second ball of the innings and the home team picked up wickets regularly from there.

            Mlaba finished with 3-10 and fellow slow bowler Tryon 2-12 on Paarl's spin-friendly pitch.

            New Zealand's 67 came two days after it was bowled out for 76 to lose by 97 runs to defending champion Australia in its first game. South Africa plays the top-ranked Aussies next.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809204,Sheriff: Florida man fatally shoots clerk at Kentucky hotel,"PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) — A Florida man is accused of fatally shooting a clerk at a hotel in western Kentucky after assaulting two people outside the business who couldn't give him a cigarette lighter, authorities said.

            Robert Pannell, 55, was charged with murder, assault and other crimes at a Best Western hotel in Paducah, the McCracken County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Authorities responded to the business Saturday morning after several callers reported that a man was actively shooting in the hotel, which is located near Interstate 24.

            McCracken County Sheriff’s deputies and officers from the Paducah Police Department arrived first, and a deputy found the female victim on the first floor with multiple gunshot wounds to her head and body, officials said. A Paducah officer located a possible suspect outside the hotel and detained him in the parking lot.











            An investigation determined that Pannell, who was staying at the hotel, assaulted a couple in the parking lot over a denied request for a cigarette lighter and then went inside the building with a handgun and proceeded to shoot the victim and throw the gun into the lobby, the sheriff's statement said. Multiple people were in close proximity when the shots were fired. The victim's name wasn't released at the request of her family, the statement said.

            No motive for the shooting has been discovered, though the investigation is continuing, authorities said.

            The McCracken County Sheriff's Office said Pannell is from Palm Coast, Florida, and detectives were coordinating with the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office to determine why Pannell was in Kentucky.

            Pannell is being held at the McCracken County Jail. Online records don't indicate whether he has an attorney.PADUCAH, Ky.

A Paducah officer located a possible suspect outside the hotel and detained him in the parking lot.An investigation determined that Pannell, who was staying at the hotel, assaulted a couple in the parking lot over a denied request for a cigarette lighter and then went inside the building with a handgun and proceeded to shoot the victim and throw the gun into the lobby, the sheriff's statement said. Multiple people were in close proximity when the shots were fired. The victim's name wasn't released at the request of her family, the statement said.No motive for the shooting has been discovered, though the investigation is continuing, authorities said.The McCracken County Sheriff's Office said Pannell is from Palm Coast, Florida, and detectives were coordinating with the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office to determine why Pannell was in Kentucky.Pannell is being held at the McCracken County Jail. Online records don't indicate whether he has an attorney.",2023/02/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809206,Alabama hoops No. 1 in AP Top 25 for first time in 20 years,"Alabama is the new No. 1, rising to the top spot in The Associated Press Top 25 men's college basketball poll for the first time in 20 years.

            Purdue's loss to Northwestern last week caused a jumble at the top of the AP Top 25 and that helped the Crimson Tide.

            Alabama received 38 first-place votes from a 62-person media panel Monday, moving up two spots to leapfrog No. 2 Houston. The Cougars had 22 first-place votes to remain at No. 2 and Purdue, down to No. 3, still had two first-place votes.











            UCLA and Kansas rounded out the top five.

            Alabama has made a name for itself as more than just a football school since coach Nate Oats arrived from Buffalo in in 2019. The Crimson Tide reached the NCAA Tournament's Elite Eight two years ago and Oats pulled in one of the nation's best recruiting classes last year.

            Alabama is No. 1 for the first time since spending two weeks atop the poll midway through the 2002-03 season. It also is the first school to be No. 1 in the AP football and basketball polls in the same season since Ohio State in 2010-11.

            Alabama (22-3, 12-0 Southeastern Conference) beat Auburn and Florida last week, with its only loss since mid-December coming at Oklahoma in a nonconference game on Jan. 28.

            “Our team is playing good basketball right now,” Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said after a 77-69 loss to the Crimson Tide on Saturday. “We’re playing well. We’re just not playing well enough to beat the best team in the country.”

            BOUNCING BOILERMAKERS

            Purdue managed to remain at No. 1 last week despite losing to No. 14 Indiana. The Boilermakers weren't so fortunate after a 64-58 loss to Northwestern on Sunday.

            The Wildcats swarmed 7-foot-4 Purdue center Zach Edey, who had 24 points but committed six turnovers. The Boilermakers shot 36% from the field and missed their final 13 shots from 3-point range. 

            “Just got to show more poise and toughness than we did,” Purdue coach Matt Painter said.

            RISING/FALLING

            No. 9 Baylor and No. 18 Creighton made the biggest moves of the week, each gaining five spots.

            The Bears beat Oklahoma and picked up a road win at No. 22 TCU last week. The Bluejays beat Seton Hall and eked out a 56-53 win over No. 20 UConn to stretch their winning streak to eight games to remain in contention for the Big East regular-season title.

            No. 19 Iowa State had the biggest drop, losing eight places following losses to West Virginia and Oklahoma State.

            IN AND OUT

            Florida Atlantic was the only team to move into the poll, returning at No. 25 after dropping out last week. The Owls beat Rice and Louisiana Tech last week after being ranked for the first time in school history earlier this season.

            Rutgers fell out of the poll for the second time this season, dropping from No. 24 after losing to Indiana and Illinois.

            CONFERENCE WATCH

            The Big East and Big 12 conferences had the most teams in this week’s poll with five each. The ACC, SEC and Big Ten each had three ranked teams, with the Pac-12 and West Coast conferences two each.

            Conference USA, the Mountain West Conference and American Athletic Conference had one apiece.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809207,Super Bowl-winning combo will be leading Chiefs into future,"PHOENIX (AP) — Andy Reid posed with the Lombardi Trophy as he took the stage the morning after his second Super Bowl win and simply said: “It never gets old standing right here.”

            As long as Reid is dialing up plays and Patrick Mahomes is executing them, the Kansas City Chiefs will be in contention to get right back into this spot.

            The duo — an innovative play-caller and a young quarterback whose achievements already rival some of the game's greatest ever — won their second Super Bowl together in the past four seasons when Kansas City beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 on Sunday.











            ""As long as Andy Reid is coaching us, we'll always have a chance,” Mahomes said Monday at a news conference honoring the Super Bowl winning coach and MVP. “I’ll keep the big guy around a couple more years at least and we’ll try to be back at this game as many times as possible.”

            Since Mahomes became the starter in Kansas City in 2018, the Chiefs have made it to the AFC championship game every season, the Super Bowl three times and won it twice.

            This title might have been even sweeter than the first following the 2019 season as Mahomes overcame a high ankle sprain that limited him in the playoffs and quieted the skeptics who doubted whether he could have the same kind of success after the Chiefs traded away game-breaking wide receiver Tyreek Hill.

            But with a strong offensive line that held the Eagles' vaunted pass rush to no sacks, All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce and a cast of mostly young receivers who stepped up in the Super Bowl, the Chiefs still had the league's top offense thanks mostly to the combo of Reid and Mahomes.

            “It’s hard not to hear that stuff, especially in today’s age and social media and everything like that,” Mahomes said. “You hear how not good we’re going to be. All you can do is prove it on the football field. I’m not a guy that’s going to respond and say stuff back to people. I’m just going to go out there and prove it on the football field. Once you do that, there's nothing they can really say.""

            All that's left to ask about Mahomes after a week in which he won his second regular-season MVP award and second Super Bowl MVP is where he will eventually rank among the game's greatest quarterbacks.

            Mahomes is already on a pace no one else has set. 

            He joined Hall of Famer Joe Montana and Tom Brady — considered by many the best quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era — as the only players ever to win multiple MVP awards in the regular season and Super Bowl.

            Mahomes did it in his sixth season, while it took Brady 11 years and Montana 12 until they accomplished the feat.

            Mahomes became the seventh player to win the NFL regular season MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same season — with the first six already enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

            The Super Bowl win by Mahomes also broke some hexes as he became the first MVP to win the title since Kurt Warner in the 1999 season and the first player ever to lead the league in yards passing and win the Super Bowl in the same season.

            The decision to trade Hill has set the Chiefs up well as they head into the offseason in good shape on the salary cap, with 12 projected draft picks, and a strong rookie class from 2022 that only should improve.

            But most importantly, they have the coach and quarterback, with the 64-year-old Reid pointing to Mahomes when he said he has no plans to step down any time in the near future. 

            “I'm enjoying what I’m doing,” Reid said. “I have this guy over here who is a pretty good player, so I'm doing OK.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809209,Polygamy kidnapping suspect will be returned to Utah,"MINOT, N.D. (AP) — The nephew of imprisoned Utah polygamous leader Warren Jeffs will be returned to Utah to face charges that he kidnapped his niece, as he waived extradition at a court hearing Monday following his arrest in North Dakota.

            Heber Jeffs was arrested by federal agents on Saturday after he was tracked to the town of Minot, but authorities don't know why he was there, said Sheriff Marty Gleave of Piute County, Utah. He was arrested after a search warrant at a home, Gleave said.

            The 10-year-old niece, the daughter of Heber Jeffs’ sister, was apparently unharmed, Gleave said. 











            “Homeland Security is trying to arrange to get her back here and reunite with her mother,” he said.

            
                Heber Jeffs is jailed at the Ward County Jail, the county's Sheriff Bob Roed said. It wasn't immediately clear if he has an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

            Kidnapping charges were filed out of Utah against Heber Jeffs in December. Authorities said at the time that he and his niece had gone missing, apparently to keep the girl from her mother on orders issued by Warren Jeffsfrom prison in Texas.

            Court documents say Heber Jeffs had kept the girl in his home in Kingston, Utah, since his uncle said months earlier that he received a revelation from God directing his followers to “gather” the community’s women “and prepare to move to a location or locations as directed by Warren Jeffs,” or his son, Helaman Jeffs.

            Warren Jeffs is president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The faith is an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church, and espouses polygamy. It has historically been based in a small town that straddles the Utah-Arizona line. The mainstream church disavowed polygamy more than a century ago.

            Since being found guilty on child sexual abuse charges stemming from underage marriages, Warren Jeffs has continued to serve as the group’s prophet from a federal prison in Texas where he’s serving a life sentence.

            Prosecutors said that Heber Jeffs and his wife Sarah have cared for their niece since her parents split up when the girl was an infant. Rose Jeffs, the girl’s mother who is no longer an FLDS member, was allowed regular visitation and full access to her daughter until August. At that time, Heber Jeffs told her he would no longer allow visitation. The court documents point to the revelation as a primary reason.

            Court documents say Rose Jeffs then demanded to take her daughter back, at which point Heber Jeffs said he planned to cut off communication. Later, when law enforcement began pursuing Heber Jeffs, they couldn’t find him at his home or places he had worked, prompting a warrant for his arrest.MINOT, N.D.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809210,Greenpeace to appeal Spain-Saudi arms deal confidentiality,"MADRID (AP) — Greenpeace said Monday it will appeal a Spanish Supreme Court decision blocking public access, on national security grounds, to information on government export licenses for vehicle-mounted weapons systems sold to Saudi Arabia.

            The global environmental and human rights group argues that the Alakran 120 mm mortar system developed by the Madrid-based firm NTGS was deployed by the Saudi-led coalition on the border with Yemen, endangering civilian lives. The weapon’s use “not only violates the Spanish law on arms trade control, but also the international Arms Trade Treaty signed by Spain,” Greenpeace argued.

            Greenpeace asked the trade ministry in 2020 for copies of recent export licenses for the mortar system, but was denied on grounds of national security and official secrets laws. 











            The Supreme Court upheld the ministry’s decision on Feb. 7, arguing that the NGO had not demonstrated sufficient public interest to warrant declassifying the licenses. The court further argued that the right to access license details was “subjective,” and that Greenpeace had failed to prove that fundamental human rights would be harmed as a result of the ministry withholding the information.

            Greenpeace can appeal the decision before Spain's Constitutional Court, but vowed to take it to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

            “Only an informed citizenry can prevent human rights violations in any society,"" said Lorena Ruiz-Huerta, lawyer for Greenpeace Spain, in a statement. “It is time for judges and courts to recognize Spanish men and women as citizens with full rights to truthful information on issues that affect human rights,” she added. Spanish law prohibits weapons export licensing where human rights would be violated.

            As a longtime commercial ally of Saudi Arabia, Spain is the fourth largest provider of military equipment and weapons to the Gulf state, according to Amnesty International. Madrid canceled the delivery of 400 laser-guided bombs purchased by Saudi Arabia in 2018 following criticism from human rights groups.

            Yemen’s war began when the Iran-backed Houthis seized the country’s capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile. A Saudi-led coalition — armed with Western weaponry and intelligence — entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015. 

            Currently all sides appear to be looking for a solution after eight years of a war that has killed more than 150,000 people, fragmented Yemen and driven the Arab world’s poorest country into collapse and near starvation.MADRID (AP) — Greenpeace said Monday it will appeal a Spanish Supreme Court decision blocking public access, on national security grounds, to information on government export licenses for vehicle-mounted weapons systems sold to Saudi Arabia.The global environmental and human rights group argues that the Alakran 120 mm mortar system developed by the Madrid-based firm NTGS was deployed by the Saudi-led coalition on the border with Yemen, endangering civilian lives.

The court further argued that the right to access license details was “subjective,” and that Greenpeace had failed to prove that fundamental human rights would be harmed as a result of the ministry withholding the information.Greenpeace can appeal the decision before Spain's Constitutional Court, but vowed to take it to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.“Only an informed citizenry can prevent human rights violations in any society,"" said Lorena Ruiz-Huerta, lawyer for Greenpeace Spain, in a statement. “It is time for judges and courts to recognize Spanish men and women as citizens with full rights to truthful information on issues that affect human rights,” she added. Spanish law prohibits weapons export licensing where human rights would be violated.As a longtime commercial ally of Saudi Arabia, Spain is the fourth largest provider of military equipment and weapons to the Gulf state, according to Amnesty International. Madrid canceled the delivery of 400 laser-guided bombs purchased by Saudi Arabia in 2018 following criticism from human rights groups.Yemen’s war began when the Iran-backed Houthis seized the country’s capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile. A Saudi-led coalition — armed with Western weaponry and intelligence — entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015.Currently all sides appear to be looking for a solution after eight years of a war that has killed more than 150,000 people, fragmented Yemen and driven the Arab world’s poorest country into collapse and near starvation.",2023/02/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809211,Hungary FM's Belarus visit 1st from EU country since 2020,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Monday became the first senior official from a European Union country to visit Belarus since the authoritarian Belarusian regime imposed a harsh crackdown on opposition in 2020.

            His trip came as the EU is expected to consider a new package of sanctions against Belarus. The EU has slapped an array of sanctions on the country already, both for the repression that followed mass protests against the 2020 presidential election — widely seen as rigged — and for Belarus' hosting Russian troops during the war in Ukraine. 

            Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said that as a result of the sanctions Minsk is experiencing “huge” difficulties with the export of potash fertilizers — a key source of revenue — and oil products.











            “And the continuation of the war (in Ukraine) is tightening the economic knot around the neck of Belarus,” Karbalevich said. ""The Belarusian authorities are doing their best to ease this pressure.”

            Belarus has not deployed troops in Ukraine, but Russian soldiers based there have crossed the border into Ukraine's north. 

            After the 2020 election that gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a new term, massive protests broke out and persisted for weeks, the largest and most prolonged wave of unrest since Lukashenko came to power in 1994. 

            He unleashed a brutal crackdown on the protesters; more than 35,000 people were arrested and thousands were beaten by police. Among those arrested was human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, one of last year's Nobel Peace Prize laurates. He is on trial and faces 12 years in prison if convicted.

            Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in 2020 and left the country days after the election, condemned Szijjarto's vist.

            “At a time when a Nobel laureate is being tried, journalists are being tortured, Russian soldiers are being trained before going to fight in Ukraine, such actions are unacceptable,” she said.

            In closing remarks at his closed-door trial, Bialiatski said Monday that Lukashenko made “a political decision to crush and destroy the civil society of Belarus,” according to the Viasna human rights center that he founded.

            Bialiatski and two other Viasna figures are charged with tax evasion, smuggling and financing activities that undermine public order - charges linked to Viasna paying the legal fees of people it regards as political prisoners.TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Monday became the first senior official from a European Union country to visit Belarus since the authoritarian Belarusian regime imposed a harsh crackdown on opposition in 2020.His trip came as the EU is expected to consider a new package of sanctions against Belarus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809212,Cherokee Nation announces plans for $18M treatment center,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — As a child welfare specialist for the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma more than a decade ago, Juli Skinner saw firsthand the impact of the opioid crisis on Cherokee families.

            Parents who began using the powerful painkillers after a surgery or injury became hooked and were losing custody of their children, babies were being born addicted and young people who ended up in foster care were aging out of the system and becoming addicted themselves, resulting in a generational impact. 

            “We didn’t know what hit us. We were just floundering,” recalled Skinner, now the director of behavioral health for the Cherokee Nation, which is headquartered in Tahlequah in northeast Oklahoma. 











            Now, the nation's largest Native American tribe, with more than 440,000 enrolled citizens, plans to use a portion of its $98 million in opioid settlement funds to construct a 50-bed, 17,000-square-foot treatment facility in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, where the tribe is headquartered. The facility, which tribal officials announced on Monday, will be completely operated by the tribe and provide no-cost treatment for Cherokee Nation citizens struggling with substance abuse.

            The $18 million treatment center is part of $73 million the tribe plans to spend building facilities across its reservation to address behavioral health needs, including drug treatment and prevention. Another $5 million will go into a tribal endowment to help pay for Cherokees to go to college and grad school to become therapists and medical professionals needed to staff the facilities.

            “These will truly be drug treatment centers developed by Cherokees, for Cherokees,” said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin. ""It's not a federal government-imposed facility.

            “The symbolism is also important, which is we are paying for this over the next five years and making the opioid industry pay for everything. There's a real sense of justice just making that statement.”

            Native American tribes across the country settled with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and the nation's largest drug distribution companies for $590 million that will be divvied up among hundreds of tribal nations, but the Cherokee Nation negotiated its own separate settlement with drug manufacturers and distributors.

            One of the things Hoskin and other Cherokee Nation officials are excited about is incorporating aspects of the tribe's culture into the recovery program. In addition to having peer recovery specialists who are Cherokees, the recovery curriculum includes traditional activities like bead making, talking circles and stickball.

            “A person in recovery needs to know they’re not alone,” Hoskin said. “If you’re Cherokee, there’s a real cultural reason why you’re not alone. We share traditions, even if those traditions in some families haven’t been practiced in generations.”

            For Jennifer Lasiter, a 38-year-old Cherokee Nation citizen who struggled for years with opioid addiction after she began taking hydrocodone for a back injury, having a connection with other Cherokee citizens at her workplace has been an important part of her recovery.

            “Just from working here at the Cherokee Nation, I believe that Cherokees band together and lift each other up,” said Lasiter, a single mother of three children who works for the tribe's food distribution center and has been sober for five years. “As a tribe, we all feel connected in some way.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809221,"Roslyn Pope, author of 'Appeal for Human Rights,' dies at 84","ATLANTA (AP) — Roslyn Pope, a college professor and musician who wrote “An Appeal for Human Rights,” laying out the reasons for the Atlanta Student Movement against systemic racism in 1960, has died. She was 84.

            Pope died Jan. 18 in Arlington, Texas, where she moved from Atlanta to be with her daughters after her health began to fail in 2021, according to her family's obituary.

            The document Pope wrote as a 21-year-old senior at Spelman College launched a nonviolent campaign of boycotts and sit-ins by Black college students protesting discrimination not just in voting but in education, jobs, housing, hospitals, movies, concerts, restaurants and law enforcement.











            ""We do not intend to wait placidly for those rights, which are already legally and morally ours, to be meted out to us one at a time,” the Appeal declared. “We plan to use every legal and non-violent means at our disposal to secure full citizenship rights as members of this great Democracy of ours.”

            Atlanta's white-owned newspapers wouldn't publish it, and Georgia's segregationist leaders tried to dismiss it, saying it couldn't possibly be the work of college students. But The New York Times ran it on a full page, as did other publications across the U.S. It was read into the Congressional Record as a testament to how segregation was stifling the ability of people to coexist with equality and dignity.

            “She really kicked off our movement and made it acceptable,” Charles Black, who was a Morehouse College student when he joined Pope and others organizing the campaign, recalled Monday.

            Pope showed that change doesn’t depend on “great men” like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and that a few committed people can make a real difference, Black said. “Because of her words, everybody understood what we were trying to do, and that’s why we had such broad, community-wide support.”

            Born Oct. 29, 1938, in Atlanta, Pope was exceptional from an early age. She belonged to an all-Black Girl Scout troop and was sent as Georgia's representative to a national camp in Cody, Wyoming, that no Black Scout had attended before.

            “I was one little dark person among 50 white faces,” she recalled in an AP interview in 2020. “It became national news. Nobody in Atlanta could fathom that such a thing could happen.”

            Pope was elected student body president at her segregated Booker T. Washington high school and at college. Her piano playing at Friendship Baptist Church led to a performance with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and later, a Merrill scholarship to study music during her junior year in Paris.

            The experience was life-changing after growing up in a society where race laws restricted her every move, she told the AP.

            In Paris, “there were no boundaries — no places I couldn't go, no programs I couldn't take advantage of, no limits to my existence. I could eat where I wanted — I couldn't do that in Atlanta. It felt like shackles had been taken off me. It was just unbelievable.”

            Along with movement co-founder Lonnie King, a Morehouse student who had been in the Navy, she felt suffocated after returning to the segregated South. “We just could not pretend that being treated as inferior was all right,” she said.

            Pope said she was sharing her misery with future state lawmaker and NAACP chairman Julian Bond at an off-campus drugstore when King walked in waving a newspaper: Four Black students had been arrested at a sit-in the day before in Greensboro, North Carolina.

            “It just clicked,” she said. “'Why aren't we doing that?' we said to each other. And before the day was over, we decided to start a movement. We would no longer bear the mantle of inferiority.”

            Working in secret, they recruited other students at Morehouse, Spelman, Clark and Morris Brown colleges, Atlanta University and the Interdenominational Theological Center. The six university presidents got wind of their efforts and tried to quash it. When the students refused, they were told to write up a clear explanation of what they hoped to accomplish.

            King appointed Pope to a committee to draft the document, and after the young men let days pass without contributing, told her to “write the damn thing,” Black said.

            And so Pope did, longhand. She and Bond then spent the night at the dining room table of Spelman professor Howard Zinn, who offered his typewriter. “Julian Bond was typing while I handed him the pages,” Pope said. “We were there all night because we didn't have a lot of time.”

            While the students' campaign of civil disobedience would eventually break Atlanta's stalemate over civil rights and hasten the end of racist Jim Crow laws and policies across the U.S., Pope remained a mostly private figure.

            She earned a masters in English at Georgia State University and then a doctorate in humanities at Syracuse University, all while raising two daughters, Rhonda and Donna Walker, after a brief marriage to John W. Walker.

            She later taught religious studies and led the music department at Penn State University, but said she faced a losing battle there against white prejudice, so she moved to Bishop College in Dallas. After that historically Black college closed, she taught literature and humanities at the University of Texas at Arlington. She later worked in advertising for 20 years at Southwestern Bell before retiring to Atlanta.

            “She was a very quiet and unassuming person, not the kind of person you would expect to achieve that kind of status and leadership, necessarily, but she did,"" said Black, who described Pope as a “sage.""

            “The fact that she was able to put that document in the frame of human rights rather than civil rights was rather prophetic and very forward thinking. Civil rights can be voted in and out of existence, but human rights are inherent in our mere existence, and she recognized that early on,"" he said.

            Pope said she was thrilled in 2020 to share her experiences with students at Decatur High School as they researched the student movement and the related imprisonment of Martin Luther King for a Georgia Historical Society marker. The same students then campaigned to bring down a nearby Confederate monument.

            The Appeal “is just as relevant now as it was when I wrote it,” she told them. “I'm glad that I could do something. It might have been a small contribution, but I contributed.”

            The Friendship Baptist Church plans a Feb. 17 service in her memory, and a celebration of Pope's contributions to racial equality will be held at Spelman College on March 9, Black said.ATLANTA (AP) — Roslyn Pope, a college professor and musician who wrote “An Appeal for Human Rights,” laying out the reasons for the Atlanta Student Movement against systemic racism in 1960, has died.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809224,UNLV ranked for first time in 29 years; South Carolina No. 1,"UNLV coach Lindy La Rocque was 4 years old the last time the Lady Rebels were ranked in The Associated Press Top 25 women's basketball poll.

            Now the Las Vegas native has the team back in the Top 25 for the first time since 1994: UNLV entered the poll at No. 23 on Monday.

            “Obviously it means a lot. When I took the job I had a vision of what this place could be and what it once was,” La Rocque said. “That’s what I remember and I'm trying to put the pieces together to make that come to fruition.

            South Carolina earned the No. 1 ranking for the 34th consecutive week. That is tied for the third-longest run atop the poll with UConn. Only the Huskies (51 weeks) and Louisiana Tech (36) have had longer streaks at No. 1.

            The Gamecocks (25-0), who were again a unanimous choice from the 28-member national media panel, routed then-No. 3 LSU on Sunday in a showdown of unbeaten teams. The Tigers fell to fifth.

            Indiana, Stanford and Utah were behind South Carolina. It's the best ranking in school history for the Utes, who moved up three places this week.

            UConn dropped two spots to sixth after falling at Marquette, giving the Huskies their first losing streak in 30 years. Iowa fell two places to seventh after losing to Indiana.

            Maryland, Duke and Notre Dame rounded out the top 10.

            UNLV (24-2) has won 15 straight games, second to only South Carolina for the longest streak in the country. It is the team's best start since the 1989-90 team went 28-3.

            “It’s cool. If you look at our roster, the two best players are from Vegas,” said La Rocque, who played at Stanford. “There’s some good karma that we got working.”

            USC joined the Lady Rebels in the Top 25, entering the poll at No. 25. It's the first time since 2016 that the Trojans are ranked. They visit Stanford on Friday night.

            South Florida and N.C. State fell out of the poll. 

            STREAK BUSTED

            North Carolina State is not ranked for the first time since Feb. 5, 2018. The Wolfpack had been ranked for 96 consecutive weeks, which had been the fifth-longest active streak behind UConn, Maryland, South Carolina and Stanford.

            CRUISING WILDCATS

            Buoyed by star Maddy Siegrist, Villanova continues to climb up the AP Top 25. Siegrist scored a Big East-record 50 points in a win over Seton Hall on Saturday to become the conference's all-time leading scorer. With 1,550 conference regular-season points, Siegrist surpassed former Boston College standout Sarah Behn’s (1989-93) 1,546 points. Siegrist has the Wildcats at No. 14, the school's best ranking in 20 years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809227,"Ahead of 5th season in F1, Lando Norris says time has flown","WOKING, England (AP) — Lando Norris is becoming a Formula One veteran at the age of just 23 as he enters his fifth season with McLaren, but it doesn't feel that way.

            The British driver has always had more experienced teammates — first Carlos Sainz Jr., then Daniel Ricciardo. This season he will be joined by the youngest driver on the grid, 21-year-old Australian Oscar Piastri. 

            “A long journey, it feels like it’s gone extremely quickly,"" Norris said as McLaren launched its car Monday.











            ""It doesn’t feel like it’s been five years, or four and a half. Another new season, new car, new teammate, so a lot of new challenges this season.”

            Norris emphasized the new MCL60 car, named for the team's 60th anniversary, builds on last year's car rather than being a radical new design. 

            “Lovely to see the evolution from last year, subtle things but all to try and help it move in the right direction and help us take steps forward. So, looks good. The real question is answered in a few weeks when I get to be behind the wheel,” he said. 

            “To call this my first F1 car is going to be pretty special,” said Piastri, who makes his F1 debut with McLaren after an acrimonious contract dispute with Alpine last season. 

            In August, Alpine announced Piastri would drive for the team in 2023 only for the 2021 Formula Two champion to deny it in a social media post.

            McLaren was fifth in the constructors' championship last year with one podium finish for Norris as his then-teammate Ricciardo struggled to score more than a handful of top-10 finishes.

            New team principal Andrea Stella was cautious about the team's expectations for 2023.

            “In terms of performance expectations, we remain realistic for the short term. We will see where we are in Bahrain at the test and the first race. Independently of that, we have good developments in the pipeline, so we remain optimistic for the season ahead,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809228,Newborn saved from rubble in quake-hit Syria in good health,"BEIRUT (AP) — A baby girl born under the rubble of her family's home in northern Syria after last week’s devastating earthquake was in good health Monday and being breast-fed by the wife of the director of the hospital where she is being cared for, her doctor said.

            The infant, named Aya — Arabic for “a sign from God"" — by hospital workers, may be able to leave the hospital as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday, according to her great-uncle, Saleh al-Badran. He said the baby’s paternal aunt, who recently gave birth and survived the quake, will raise her. 

            The newborn's mother died after giving birth to her in the aftermath of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria. Her father and four siblings were also killed in the quake.











            Dr. Hani Maarouf, a pediatrician at Cihan Hospital in the northern Syrian city of Afrin, told The Associated Press that the wife of the hospital’s director has been breast-feeding the baby girl.

            “We have stopped all the medicines that we were giving Aya and now she is being breast-fed when she needs,” Maarouf said by telephone from Afrin. 

            Maarouf said local policemen were standing guard at the hospital to make sure that no one tries to kidnap the child after a series of people showed up falsely claiming to be her relatives. 

            Rescue workers in the northern Syrian town of Jinderis discovered the dark-haired baby girl more than 10 hours after the Feb. 6 quake hit, as they were digging through the wreckage of the five-story apartment building where her parents lived. 

            Buried under the concrete, the baby still was connected by her umbilical cord to her mother, Afraa Abu Hadiya. The baby was rushed to the hospital in nearby Afrin where she has been cared for since. 

            The devastating quake followed by a series of tremors that struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria reduced much of the towns and cities inhabited by millions to fragments of concrete and twisted metal. More than 35,000 people were killed, a toll expected to rise considerably as search teams find more bodies.

            The earthquake destroyed dozens of housing units in the town of Jinderis where Aya’s family had been living since 2018. 

            Aya’s father, Abdullah Turki Mleihan, was originally from the village of Khsham in eastern Deir el-Zour province, but left in 2014 after the Islamic State group captured their village, said al-Badran, an uncle of Aya's father.

More than 35,000 people were killed, a toll expected to rise considerably as search teams find more bodies.The earthquake destroyed dozens of housing units in the town of Jinderis where Aya’s family had been living since 2018.Aya’s father, Abdullah Turki Mleihan, was originally from the village of Khsham in eastern Deir el-Zour province, but left in 2014 after the Islamic State group captured their village, said al-Badran, an uncle of Aya's father.—-Associated Press writer Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report.",2023/02/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809231,Ford to build $3.5B electric vehicle battery plant in Mich.,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. plans to build a $3.5 billion factory in Michigan that would employ at least 2,500 people to make lower-cost batteries for a variety of new and existing electric vehicles.

            The plant, to be built on land being readied for industrial development about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Detroit, would start making batteries in 2026. It would crank out enough batteries to supply 400,000 vehicles per year, Ford said.

            The factory near the city of Marshall would produce batteries with a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which is cheaper than the current nickel-cobalt-manganese chemistry now used in many EV batteries.











            Consumers could then choose between a battery with lower range and cost, or pay more for higher range and power. The company wouldn’t give any prices just yet.

            “The whole intent here is to make EVs more affordable and accessible to customers,” said Marin Gjaja, chief marketing officer for Ford’s electric vehicles.

            Ford says a wholly owned subsidiary would own the factory and employ the workers. But China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, or CATL, which is known for its lithium-iron-phosphate expertise, would supply technology, some equipment and workers.

            The announcement comes at a time when U.S.-China relations are strained, and the Biden administration is offering tax credits for businesses to create a U.S. supply chain for EV batteries. To get a full $7,500 per vehicle U.S. tax credit to customers, EV batteries won’t be able to have metals or components from China in them.

            The structure of the deal allows Ford to take advantage of U.S. factory tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. Because it's not a joint venture, it could stem criticism about the company doing business with the Chinese. Last month the state of Virginia dropped out of the race for the same Ford plant after Gov. Glenn Youngkin characterized the project as a “front” for the Chinese Communist Party that would raise national security concerns. At the time Virginia had not offered an incentive package to Ford.

            The company says that buyers initially would get at least $3,750 in tax credits because the vehicles are produced in North America. Gjaja said that over time they could get the full $7,500 credit depending on sourcing of battery minerals.

            Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries would go into standard-range versions of Ford's EVs. For instance, the lowest price Mustang Mach-E electric SUV would get an LFP battery and would be able to travel 247 miles per charge. The long range version of the Mach-E will have a nickel-cobalt-manganese chemistry that takes it to 310 miles per charge. 

            The plant was revealed Monday at a meeting of the Michigan Strategic Fund, which approved a large tax incentive package for the project near the junction of Interstates 94 and 69.

            “We were looking not only in the U.S. We were looking outside of the U.S., as well,"" said Bill Ford, Ford Motor Co. executive chair. ""There were a lot of places in play, because, as you can imagine, a lot of states and even countries would like this kind of investment. But Michigan really stepped up.”

            “I was always biased in favor of Michigan, because my family’s been here for generations,"" he added. 

            About $210 million came from Michigan's Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, known as SOAR, set up to lure industry and jobs to the state. But the total size of the incentive package wasn't clear.

            The SOAR Fund has received nearly $1.8 billion from the state’s general fund since it was first created in December of 2021.

            A tax-relief bill passed in the Michigan House last week could send up to $1.5 billion over three fiscal years to the SOAR Fund in addition to an $800 million one-time deposit that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer outlined in her budget proposal last week.

            The tax-relief bill, which still needs state Senate approval, has been heavily criticized by Republicans for giving too little to taxpayers and too much to large corporations.

            Last summer, Ford announced that CATL will make lithium-iron-phosphate battery packs for Mustang Mach-E electric SUVs in North America this year and for F-150 Lightning electric trucks early in 2024. The batteries at first would come from China, then be switched to the Michigan plant in 2026, Ford said.

            The company expects to be able to produce electric vehicles at a rate of 600,000 per year by late this year.

            Whitmer said the plant will bring “generational opportunities” for west Michigan families. It will “make sure that production lines aren't stalled by global shocks or shipping delays,” she said.

            Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries already are in use in consumer electronics and some competitors’ vehicles, but all the batteries are imported, said Lisa Drake, vice president of industrialization for Ford’s electric vehicles.

            “This project is aimed at de-risking that by actually building out the capacity and capability to scale this technology in the United States,” with Ford controlling the manufacturing and the workforce.

            Conrad Layson, senior analyst with AutoForecast Solutions, says the new battery factory could supply multiple Ford models. “As Ford increases the number of all-electric nameplates, the output from this factory could be used to make lower-cost versions of those future all-electric Ford vehicles,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809232,Twitter's plan to charge for crucial tool prompts outcry,"In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, thousands of volunteer software developers have been using a crucial Twitter tool to comb the platform for calls for help — including from people trapped in collapsed buildings — and connect people with rescue organizations. 

            They could soon lose access unless they pay Twitter a monthly fee of at least $100 — prohibitive for many volunteers and nonprofits on shoestring budgets. 

            “That’s not just for rescue efforts which unfortunately we’re coming to the end of, but for logistics planning too as people go to Twitter to broadcast their needs,” said Sedat Kapanoglu, the founder of Eksi Sozluk, Turkey’s most popular social platform, who has been advising some of the volunteers in their efforts. 











            Nonprofits, researchers and others need the tool, known as the API, or Application Programming Interface, to analyze Twitter data because the sheer amount of information makes it impossible for a human to go through by hand.

            Kapanoglu says hundreds of “good Samaritans” have been giving out their own, premium paid API access keys (Twitter already offered a paid version with more features) for use in the rescue efforts. But he says this isn’t “sustainable or the right way” to do this. It might even be against Twitter’s rules. 

            The loss of free API access means an added challenge for the thousands of developers in Turkey and beyond who are working around the clock to harness Twitter’s unique, open ecosystem for disaster relief. 

            “For Turkish coders working with Twitter API for disaster monitoring purposes, this is particularly worrying — and I’d imagine it is similarly worrying for others around the world that are using Twitter data to monitor emergencies and politically contested events,” said Akin Unver, a professor of international relations at Ozyegin University in Istanbul.

            The new fees are just the latest complication for programmers, academics and others trying to use the API — and they say communicating with anyone at the company has become essentially impossible since Elon Musk took over. 

            Twitter had originally planned to introduce the changes last week, but delayed it until Monday. On Monday, the company tweeted that it was delaying the launch again ""by a few more days,” without providing more details. 

            The API paywall is Musk’s latest attempt to squeeze revenue out of Twitter, which is on the hook for about $1 billion in yearly interest payments from the billionaire’s acquisition, completed in October.

            It’s not just disaster relief groups that are concerned. Academic and non-governmental researchers for years have used Twitter to study the spread of misinformation and hate speech or research public health or how people behave online. 

            Rebekah Tromble, director of the Institute for Data, Democracy, and Politics at George Washington University, used the Twitter API to track conversations on Twitter to see what kinds of tweets elicited attacks from trolls — and what got them to go away — in one study. 

            “With so little information from Twitter about the practicalities of this new policy, the specifics of it, we just don’t know where to go. We have no way to do the planning. And for many of us who are in the field, running programs, running projects that have real world consequences, that’s pretty scary,” she said. 

            Twitter wasn’t alone but was unique among social media companies in making its API open and free. TikTok, for instance, is working on it now but so far has not released its API. Facebook's is more limited because the company is very protective of the data it collects.

            Tromble said social platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and others are taking steps to increase researcher access and transparency — largely due to new European regulations. Twitter, on the other hand, is moving in the opposite direction. 

            “They’ve gone from first in class to absolute dead last,"" she said. 

            It costs money to maintain an API. As a private company, Twitter is free to charge for its tools. But researchers and developers say it wouldn’t take much for Musk to carve out exceptions for academic research and nonprofits.

            “No other technology has changed society as quickly and as profoundly as social media. Having access to the thoughts and emotions of other people worldwide, that’s a fundamental change to society,” said Kristina Lerman, a computer science professor at the University of Southern California who studies misinformation. “And you can’t understand it without access to data, access to observe.” 

            Takeshi Kawamoto, a Japanese software developer who runs a popular earthquake alert bot with more than 3 million followers, created the account back in 2007 as a hobby. 

            There are an incredible number of such bots on Twitter — useful, friendly or quirky accounts set up by people or group with a specific interest. There are weather bots, tools that combine long Twitter threads into one easy-to-read file, bots that send quotes from famous books or people, bots that remind you to stand up and stretch at random intervals during the day, bots that insert a little bit of nonsense and weirdness into your Twitter scrolling. 

            The earthquake bot Kawamoto created didn’t take off until the devastating 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that hit Japan, when people turned to it for information about quakes and aftershocks.

            Kawamoto was ready to shut down the bot when Twitter first announced it was going to charge for API access. Paying $1,200 a year for an account that is decidedly not making a profit was not going to be possible. Last week, Twitter announced that it would make a small exception to offer “write-only” API access for free to accounts that send fewer than 1,500 tweets a month. 

            This might help, but Kawamoto says the 1,500 limit will present a problem after a big earthquake with a lot of aftershocks. He would like to ask Musk to allow accounts to post more than 1,500 tweets on a pay-as-you-go basis.

            So far, San Francisco-based Twitter has offered no other exceptions, although it’s possible that Musk will see one of the many tweets from developers working on earthquake relief who have been pleading for a solution. 

            For Mark Sample and his small army of Twitter bots, such as one that would send carefully curated quotes from Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick” at random intervals, it’s too late. The Moby Dick bot, as well as one that sent out computer clip art from 1994 and one called “weird satellite” have all left Twitter. Some have moved to Mastodon, the social platform that some discouraged Twitter users have been migrating to.

            Sample’s bots were part of “weird Twitter,” a quirky subculture of Twitter that peaked in the mid-2010s and included strange, fun, nonsensical bots sending bursts of randomness into people’s feeds. 

            “I’m kind of going through a mourning process, kind of grieving,"" said Sample, a professor of digital studies at Davidson College in North Carolina. With the API ""Twitter was doing something that none of the other social media platforms did, which is kind of like having this open playground. I mean, there were ways that people could take advantage of it and distort things and use it in malevolent ways. But it was also this terrific playground for hobbyists and creative people. None of the other social media platforms had that.” 

            For Sample, the breaking point was not the API announcement. It came last fall when Musk began mass firing Twitter workers and going after journalists who questioned or criticized him, he said. Building apps for a platform when someone just shut it all down on a whim, he said, is ""not a good use of our time and creative energy.” 

            “I mean, it had a good run,"" he said. ""It’s like 15 years or whatever. So it’s a pretty good run. And maybe it’s time for something else.”

            This story has been updated to correct that API stands for Application Programming Interface, not Application Developer Interface.In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, thousands of volunteer software developers have been using a crucial Twitter tool to comb the platform for calls for help — including from people trapped in collapsed buildings — and connect people with rescue organizations.They could soon lose access unless they pay Twitter a monthly fee of at least $100 — prohibitive for many volunteers and nonprofits on shoestring budgets.“That’s not just for rescue efforts which unfortunately we’re coming to the end of, but for logistics planning too as people go to Twitter to broadcast their needs,” said Sedat Kapanoglu, the founder of Eksi Sozluk, Turkey’s most popular social platform, who has been advising some of the volunteers in their efforts.Nonprofits, researchers and others need the tool, known as the API, or Application Programming Interface, to analyze Twitter data because the sheer amount of information makes it impossible for a human to go through by hand.Kapanoglu says hundreds of “good Samaritans” have been giving out their own, premium paid API access keys (Twitter already offered a paid version with more features) for use in the rescue efforts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809233,Feds probe United plane's December dip near ocean off Hawaii,"Federal investigators are seeking more information about an incident in which a United Airlines plane dropped to within about 800 feet (250 meters) of the ocean surface after taking off from Hawaii.

            United says the pilots are getting additional training.

            The Boeing 777 dropped more than 1,400 feet (470 meters) before climbing again, according to data from tracking service Flightradar24. The plane then continued on to San Francisco. No injuries were reported.











            A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday that the investigative agency is still seeking information about the Dec. 18 incident, which only recently came to public attention after a report in The Air Current, an aviation-industry publication.

            The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees airlines, said the United crew reported the incident under a voluntary safety-reporting program. The FAA said it reviewed the incident “and took appropriate action"" without providing further details.

            United said it worked with the FAA and the pilots' union on an investigation that led to additional training for the two pilots, which is still going on. The airline did not explain why the pilots chose to continue the long, overwater flight to San Francisco instead of returning to Kahului Airport on the island of Maui.Federal investigators are seeking more information about an incident in which a United Airlines plane dropped to within about 800 feet (250 meters) of the ocean surface after taking off from Hawaii.United says the pilots are getting additional training.The Boeing 777 dropped more than 1,400 feet (470 meters) before climbing again, according to data from tracking service Flightradar24.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809235,Moldova's president accuses Russia of planning coup,"Moldovan President Maia Sandu on Monday accused Russia of plotting to violently overthrow of the country's pro-European leadership in order to stop Moldova from joining the European Union and to use it in the war against Ukraine.Sandu made her comments after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week his country had uncovered a Russian intelligence plan ""for the destruction of Moldova,"" and days after the country's government resigned.According to Sandu, Moscow's alleged plan would involve ""saboteurs"" with military background, camouflaged in civilian clothes, to undertake violent actions, attacks on state institutions and taking hostages.Under the guise of ""protests by the so-called opposition,"" the saboteurs would aim to ""overthrow the constitutional order and replace the legitimate power of Chisinau with an illegitimate one,"" Sandu told journalists.Moldova, a country of 2.6 million people neighboring Romania and Ukraine, received EU candidate status in the summer of 2022, but over the past year has been faced with numerous anti-government protests organized by a fugitive oligarch named Ilan Shor.Alongside internal forces such as those controlled by Shor, Moscow planned to use foreign citizens from Russia, Belarus, Serbia and Montenegro to implement the coup, Sandu said.Moldova's parliament would therefore need to ""quickly adopt"" the laws that would provide the country's Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) and the prosecutors with ""the necessary means to fight more efficiently against national security threats,"" she urged.But the ""Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to Moldova will not work. Our main goal is the security of citizens and the state. Our goal is peace and public order in the country,"" Sandu added.Sandu has repeatedly expressed concern about Moscow's intentions towards the former Soviet republic and about the presence of Russian troops in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region.Over the past year, Russia's war on neighboring Ukraine has repeatedly caused security concerns in Moldova. Especially in the first months of the conflict, debris from Russian missiles landed on Moldovan territory after traversing the country's airspace.Moldova also suffered power outages after Ukraine halted electricity exports over Russian airstrikes on critical infrastructure.In early February, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has suggested that Moldova is the new ""anti-Russian project"" and declared that the West had now ""set its sights on the Republic of Moldova to have the role of the next Ukraine.""dh/rs (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809238,Albanian opposition disrupts parliament as supporters rally,"TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albanian opposition lawmakers blowing whistles disrupted a Parliament session on Monday to press home their demand for the government's resignation for alleged corruption, as hundreds of their supporters outside tried to push into the building.

            Police kept out the demonstrators, who threw smoke bombs and fireworks before dispersing. No arrests or injuries were reported.

            The tension followed a similar protest on Saturday in which thousands of opposition supporters took part.











            The protests are being organized by the center-right Democratic Party of former president and prime minister Sali Berisha, and the left-wing Freedom Party of former president Ilir Meta.

            Inside the hall Berisha and other lawmakers occupied the podium, and blew whistles to drown out anyone else trying to speak. The speaker ended the session without discussing any of the issues on the agenda.

            “The people will speak,” said Berisha after leaving the parliament hall, and pledged to continue the protests later this week.

            The opposition accuses the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Edi Rama of corruption and links to organized crime, and holds him responsible for the exodus of young Albanians who have left to pursue jobs in Western European countries.

            The government denies that, and says the Cabinet has kept inflation low compared to elsewhere in Europe, and has subsidized electricity for families and small businesses.

            The opposition also accuses Rama of corrupting Charles McGonigal, a former high-ranking FBI counterintelligence official, who is accused in the United States of hiding from the FBI key details of a 2017 trip he took to Albania with a former Albanian intelligence official who is alleged to have given him at least $225,000. 

            McGonigal met with Albania’s prime minister and urged caution in awarding oil field drilling licenses in the country to Russian front companies.

            Rama has acknowledged meeting with McGonigal but denied allegations of giving him money or preferential treatment. 

            Not all opposition Democrats were present at the protest as Berisha’s party has been plagued by infighting after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in 2021 barred Berisha and his close relatives from entering the U.S. for “corrupt acts that undermined democracy” during his 2005-2013 tenure as prime minister.

            
                Britain did the same last year.

            The Soyuz capsule was to be launched in automatic mode on Feb. 20 and dock with the orbiting outpost two days later, to serve as a lifeboat for crew evacuation in case of an emergency. Roscosmos director Yuri Borisov said the launch will be delayed, at most until early March.

            A Soyuz capsule that can accommodate an astronaut capsule and was already docked to the station developed a coolant leak in December.











            Russians Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio were supposed to return to Earth in March in that capsule, but Russian space officials said higher temperatures from the coolant leak could make that dangerous.

            Then another coolant leak was detected Saturday in a docked supply ship. The leak was detected after a second supply ship docked with the space station.

            Borisov said the unmanned Soyuz launch would be delayed “until we make sure and get to the site of a possible breakdown.”

            Because the new Soyuz will be launched in automatic mode, a replacement crew will now have to wait until late summer or fall when another capsule is ready. That means Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio will have to stay several extra months at the station, possibly pushing their mission to close to a year.

            Besides Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, the space station is home to NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada; Russian Anna Kikina; and Japan’s Koichi Wakata.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809243,UK presents evidence linking Iran in Houthi weapon supply,"LONDON (AP) — Britain says it has for the first time presented evidence that Iran is supplying advanced weapons to the Houthi rebels in Yemen, after finding images of tests conducted at the headquarters of the Revolutionary Guards in Tehran on the hard drive of an unmanned aircraft seized by the Royal Navy.

            Personnel from the British ship HMS Montrose seized the unmanned quadcopter along with a shipment of missiles and missile parts in February last year when they stopped and searched a number of fast-moving skiffs in the Gulf of Oman. The weapons and other evidence were presented to the United Nations as linking Iran to violations of Security Council resolutions barring weapons shipments to the Houthis, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Monday in London.

            “This is the first time we have been able to present evidence to the U.N. that indicates a direct link between the Iranian state and the supply of these weapons,” a ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with departmental policy.











            The UN has prohibited weapons transfers to the Houthis since 2014, when the rebels descended from their northern stronghold, toppled the internationally recognized government of Yemen and seized the capital, Sanaa. Iran has long denied arming the rebels.

            The commercial quadcopter seized by the Royal Navy is designed for reconnaissance flights, the ministry said.

            Investigators were able to decrypt the data on the aircraft’s internal memory, which hadn’t been wiped. That’s where they discovered the records of 22 test flights conducted at the Revolutionary Guards’ aerospace headquarters in western Tehran, the ministry said.

            The drone was in the same shipment as a number of surface-to-air missiles and components for Iranian Project 351 land attack cruise missiles.

            The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence of Iranian interference in the conflict in Yemen, which has spawned one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.

            Western nations, U.N. experts and others have traced Houthi weaponry ranging from night-vision scopes, rifles and missiles back to Tehran.

            Most recently, French naval forces in the Gulf of Oman in January seized thousands of assault rifles, machine guns and anti-tank missiles coming from Iran and heading to the Houthis.

            In November, the U.S. Navy announced that it had found 70 tons of a missile fuel component hidden among bags of fertilizer aboard a ship sailing to Yemen from Iran.

            “Once again the Iranian regime has been exposed for its reckless proliferation of weapons and destabilizing activity in the region,’’ said Tariq Ahmad, Britain’s minister of state for the Middle East. “Iran’s sustained military support to the Houthis and continued violation of the arms embargo has stoked further conflict and undermined U.N.-led peace efforts.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809244,Bruins' Ullmark is NHL's biggest goalie surprise this season,"Linus Ullmark moved to the Boston area in the summer of 2021 with his wife, their two young children and their dogs after signing with the Bruins. Settling in with his new team didn't happen right away.

            Fresh off signing a $20 million, four-year contract, Ullmark shared the net with rookie Jeremy Swayman and then, briefly, with Tuukka Rask, the organization cornerstone who was trying to come back from hip surgery. Ullmark allowed eight goals in two playoff games before losing the starting job to Swayman and went into an offseason of change unsure what his role would be.

            Turns out, it's a starring one as the best goaltender in the NHL.











            Ullmark leads the league in wins, save percentage and goals-against average, and is one of the biggest reasons the Bruins are atop the standings and on pace for the best regular season in NHL history. Along with fellow All-Stars Stuart Skinner and Logan Thompson, who respectively have the Edmonton Oilers and Vegas Golden Knights on track to make the playoffs, Ullmark tops the list of the biggest goalie surprises of the season.

            “He’s been standing on the head,” Bruins leading scorer and fellow MVP candidate David Pastrnak said. “He’s been playing unbelievable. It’s just fun to watch him, honestly, this year. He’s playing confident. He’s big. He’s very confident in the net, and he’s having a special year.”

            Ullmark credits being more comfortable in his new surroundings and it has shown in his play: He already has tied his career high with 26 victories, his .937 save percentage is more than 10 points higher than the next-closest competitor and his 1.90 GAA would be the lowest by a goalie with 40 or more games since Hall of Famer Martin Brodeur in 1997-98.

            The 29-year-old Swede has been thinking a lot about what changed in his game and finds it hard to pinpoint. Feeling more “at home” in Boston is one piece of many.

            “I just think it’s just small pieces here and there that are just falling into place,” Ullmark said. “We have a great team, as well, and it goes kind of hand in hand with my performance and also with Sway’s performance. It’s not just a one-man show. It’s a team effort.”

            The Bruins lead Eastern Conference behind Pastrnak's 38 goals, captain Patrice Bergeron's two-way dominance at the age of 37 and the coaching of newcomer Jim Montgomery. But Bruce Cassidy, who was fired after coaching Boston to six playoff appearances, called Ullmark's emergence “the big one” when asked about his former team's consistency.

            “He finished really well last year, and he’s carried that into this year,” Cassidy said. “Now you’re creating competition with Swayman at that position. I think that’s a great thing for Boston.”

            Cassidy, now behind the bench for the Golden Knights, has had Thompson on top of his game after Vegas learned late in the offseason Robin Lehner would be out for the season rehabbing from hip surgery. 

            Thrust into a leading role by injuries last season, Thompson won 20 of his first 35 starts this season before himself getting sidelined last week. Before that, the undrafted late bloomer earned All-Star honors and put himself in the conversation for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year.

            “There was a lot of times when I was really close to just quitting and giving up,” Thompson said. “That competitiveness in me never went away. That’s the biggest thing is never stop working hard at what you want.”

            Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft saw similar tendencies in Skinner when they were together in the minors last year. Edmonton's American Hockey League affiliate in Bakersfield, California, was desperate for a starter one night; Skinner rushed to the rink after travel issues, getting there 5 minutes before warmups and then backstopping a win.

            “He showed me something — he showed his teammates something in how serious he is about winning games for the Edmonton Oilers organization,” Woodcroft said. “He just kept getting better and better. ... As he’s working his way through his first year, the results he’s gotten is no accident.”

            But it wasn't expected: The Oilers signed Jack Campbell to a contract more lucrative than Ullmark's to be their starter and Skinner went into the season as the backup. He has since bumped Campbell as the starter and figures to be Edmonton's Game 1 playoff goalie this spring.

            “It was a bit of a surprise, I think, to everyone how well he’s doing,” defenseman Cody Ceci said. “He’s really proven himself.”

            Ullmark certainly has after six seasons in the Buffalo Sabres organization from 2015-21 showed flashes of his potential. Grateful for teammates and coaches past and present — “If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be here where I am"" — Ullmark hopes he can continue making them proud.

            “That’s what my line of work is: It’s about stopping pucks,” he said. “It’s been working so far, so hopefully I can keep it up.”

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLinus Ullmark moved to the Boston area in the summer of 2021 with his wife, their two young children and their dogs after signing with the Bruins. Settling in with his new team didn't happen right away.Fresh off signing a $20 million, four-year contract, Ullmark shared the net with rookie Jeremy Swayman and then, briefly, with Tuukka Rask, the organization cornerstone who was trying to come back from hip surgery. Ullmark allowed eight goals in two playoff games before losing the starting job to Swayman and went into an offseason of change unsure what his role would be.Turns out, it's a starring one as the best goaltender in the NHL.Ullmark leads the league in wins, save percentage and goals-against average, and is one of the biggest reasons the Bruins are atop the standings and on pace for the best regular season in NHL history. Along with fellow All-Stars Stuart Skinner and Logan Thompson, who respectively have the Edmonton Oilers and Vegas Golden Knights on track to make the playoffs, Ullmark tops the list of the biggest goalie surprises of the season.“He’s been standing on the head,” Bruins leading scorer and fellow MVP candidate David Pastrnak said. “He’s been playing unbelievable. It’s just fun to watch him, honestly, this year. He’s playing confident. He’s big. He’s very confident in the net, and he’s having a special year.”Ullmark credits being more comfortable in his new surroundings and it has shown in his play: He already has tied his career high with 26 victories, his .937 save percentage is more than 10 points higher than the next-closest competitor and his 1.90 GAA would be the lowest by a goalie with 40 or more games since Hall of Famer Martin Brodeur in 1997-98.The 29-year-old Swede has been thinking a lot about what changed in his game and finds it hard to pinpoint. Feeling more “at home” in Boston is one piece of many.“I just think it’s just small pieces here and there that are just falling into place,” Ullmark said. “We have a great team, as well, and it goes kind of hand in hand with my performance and also with Sway’s performance. It’s not just a one-man show. It’s a team effort.”The Bruins lead Eastern Conference behind Pastrnak's 38 goals, captain Patrice Bergeron's two-way dominance at the age of 37 and the coaching of newcomer Jim Montgomery. But Bruce Cassidy, who was fired after coaching Boston to six playoff appearances, called Ullmark's emergence “the big one” when asked about his former team's consistency.“He finished really well last year, and he’s carried that into this year,” Cassidy said. “Now you’re creating competition with Swayman at that position. I think that’s a great thing for Boston.”Cassidy, now behind the bench for the Golden Knights, has had Thompson on top of his game after Vegas learned late in the offseason Robin Lehner would be out for the season rehabbing from hip surgery.Thrust into a leading role by injuries last season, Thompson won 20 of his first 35 starts this season before himself getting sidelined last week. Before that, the undrafted late bloomer earned All-Star honors and put himself in the conversation for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year.“There was a lot of times when I was really close to just quitting and giving up,” Thompson said. “That competitiveness in me never went away. That’s the biggest thing is never stop working hard at what you want.”Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft saw similar tendencies in Skinner when they were together in the minors last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809246,WHO says Equatorial Guinea confirms 1st outbreak of Marburg,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — The World Health Organization says that Equatorial Guinea has confirmed its first-ever outbreak of Marburg disease, saying the Ebola-related virus is responsible for at least nine deaths in the tiny Western African country.

            In a statement on Monday, the U.N. health agency confirmed the epidemic after samples from Equatorial Guinea were sent to a lab in Senegal to pinpoint the cause of disease after an alert from a local health official last week.

            The WHO said there were currently nine deaths and 16 suspected cases with symptoms including fever, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting. The agency said it was sending medical experts to help officials in Equatorial Guinea stop the outbreak and was also sending protective equipment for hundreds of workers.











            Like Ebola, the Marburg virus originates in bats and spreads between people via close contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, or surfaces, like contaminated bed sheets. Without treatment, Marburg can be fatal in up to 88% of people.

            The rare virus was first identified in 1967 after it caused simultaneous outbreaks of disease in laboratories in Marburg, Germany and Belgrade, Serbia. Seven people died who were exposed to the virus while conducting research on monkeys.

            There are no authorized vaccines or drugs to treat Marburg, but rehydration treatment to alleviate symptoms can improve the chances of survival.

            In a 2004 outbreak in Angola, Marburg killed 90% of 252 people infected.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809247,"Colombian government, rebels resume peace talks in Mexico","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Colombia’s government and its largest remaining rebel group met in Mexico City on Monday to resume peace talks aimed at resolving a conflict dating back to the 1960s.

            It was the second round talks with the communist-inspired National Liberation Army, known as ELN, in negotiations launched in November shortly after President Gustavo Petro was elected as Colombia’s first leftist president. The first three weeks of talks in Venezulea’s capital yielded only modest results. 

            Negotiations between the sides had been suspended in 2019 following a rebel attack on a police academy in Bogota that killed 23 people.











            The Colombian government representative, José Otty Patiño, said the latest round should produce “permanent solutions ... not temporary truces.”

            Pablo Beltrán, the rebels’ chief negotiator, said the talks were aimed at a “temporary, nationwide cease-fire” and that any agreement should include “an alternative anti-drug policy that is no longer based on repression and war.”

            The ELN, founded in 1964 and present in about 200 Colombian townships, is based in areas where cocaine production is widespread.

            Petro has said that peace talks with the ELN are a cornerstone of his plan to bring “total peace” to the nation of 50 million people, where some rural areas are still under the grip of drug gangs and rebel groups despite a 2016 peace deal with the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

            The ELN has around 2,000 to 4,000 troops in Colombia and neighboring Venezuela, where human rights groups have reported the group runs drug trafficking routes and illegal gold mines.

            The rebel group was founded by intellectuals inspired by the Cuban revolution and was often smaller than the FARC. But in recent years, the ELN has become more influential in rural pockets of Colombia that were abandoned by the FARC rebels after they made peace with the government.

            The ELN leadership is concerned by Petro’s plan for “total peace” with drug cartels and rebels, saying the two groups should not be treated equally.

            Petro has said his administration would not negotiate politically with drug traffickers, and they would have to submit to justice.

            Andrés Macías, who studies armed conflicts at Colombia’s Externado University, said the ELN had political aims “at least when it was founded,” and is wary of being thrown into the same basket as powerful cartels like Colombia’s Gulf Clan.

            But separating the two is difficult.

            “The ELN needs the income generated by these illegal businesses,” Macías said.

            Mexico, Brazil, Norway, Venezuela, Chile and Cuba are acting as guarantor nations in the ELN peace talks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809249,Louisiana lawsuit alleges police killed fleeing Black man,"SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) — Family members of Alonzo Bagley, a Black man who was killed as he tried to flee police responding to a disturbance call, have filed a $10 million lawsuit against the officer who shot him.

            The federal lawsuit was filed last week in Shreveport by his wife, mother and stepdaughter of Bagley, 43. He was fatally shot on Feb. 3. The lawsuit said he had run from his apartment after refusing to talk to the officers.

            State police are investigating and said last week that no weapon was found on or near Bagley. The lawsuit says Bagley was unarmed and had his hands up when Officer Alexander Tyler shot him. 











            “The lethal force used against Mr. Bagley was unjustified, unreasonable, excessive, and in violation of Mr. Bagley’s rights under the United States Constitution and the laws of the State of Louisiana,” the lawsuit said.

            An email to police seeking comment from Tyler or the department did not receive an immediate response. The department has referred all questions to state police.

            Authorities said Bagley was killed after two officers responded to a call around 10:50 p.m. on Feb. 3. Col. Lamar Davis, the superintendent of Louisiana State Police, said during a news conference last week that it was a “domestic disturbance” call but no details have been released.

            Bagley went through a bedroom onto a balcony, jumped to the ground and ran, Davis said. The officers chased him.

            “Upon rounding a corner of the building, Officer Tyler observed Mr. Bagley and fired one shot from his service weapon, which struck Mr. Bagley in the chest,” Davis said. He added that both officers rendered immediate first aid but Bagley was later pronounced dead at a hospital. 

            Davis said the state police investigation would include interviews of witnesses and reviews of officers' body camera and car camera video — none of which has yet been made public.

(AP) — The executive director of Oregon’s liquor regulatory agency announced his resignation Monday amid a criminal investigation into allegations that he and other senior officials used their positions to divert rare, sought-after bourbons for personal use. 

            Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission Executive Director Steve Marks noted in his resignation letter that Gov. Tina Kotek asked him to step down. He said his resignation is effective at 5 p.m. Wednesday. The resignation letter to the OLCC's board of commissioners was first reported by The Oregonian/OregonLive.

            The liquor officials told an internal investigator they were paying for the whiskey, which can cost thousands of dollars a bottle, but they are accused of using their knowledge and connections at the commission to obtain the products. Marks and the other officials denied they resold the whiskeys they obtained.











            Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum on Friday announced a criminal investigation into the allegations that senior officials in the state’s alcohol and marijuana regulatory agency, which is the state’s third-largest revenue generator, violated ethics laws.

            The funneling of the top-end whiskey to leaders of the state agency deprived well-heeled whiskey aficionados of the bourbons and violated several Oregon statutes, including one that prohibits public officials from using confidential information for personal gain, according to the commission’s investigation.

            The officials purportedly had very limited bottles of top-shelf bourbon routed to a liquor store, often in the Portland suburb of Milwaukie where the commission headquarters is located, and would reserve them for pickup later. They said they used the whiskey for personal consumption or as gifts.

            During the OLCC internal probe, Marks denied that he had violated Oregon ethics laws and state policy. However, he acknowledged that he had received preferential treatment “to some extent” in obtaining the whiskey as a commission employee.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809263,Biden fires Architect of the Capitol over alleged abuses,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has fired embattled Architect of the Capitol Brett Blanton, who oversees the historic building that houses Congress and its expansive grounds, as pressure mounted for his removal following a scathing inspector general report of personal and management lapses.

            The White House said Monday that Blanton’s appointment was terminated. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Monday he’d lost confidence in Blanton’s ability to do the job. 

            An inspector general report released last year found “administrative, ethical and policy violations” by Blanton, a Trump-era appointee, including that he abused his government vehicle and misrepresented himself as a law enforcement official. A House hearing last week unearthed new questions and criticisms — including that he was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when it came under attack by former President Donald Trump's supporters.











            “The Architect of the Capitol, Brett Blanton, no longer has my confidence to continue in his job. He should resign or President Biden should remove him immediately,” McCarthy said Monday in a tweet.

            The speaker’s statement came as questions and criticism swirled around the architect, who is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the historic Capitol building and its surrounding 570-acre complex and grounds.

            Blanton came under intense criticism after the inspector general report found Blanton allowed unauthorized use of his work vehicle, including by his wife and adult daughter, racking up nearly 30,000 miles — about triple the estimate for his official use.

            At a House hearing last week, Blanton also came under fire when he testified that he was not at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack because it was a “telework” day under COVID-19 protocols.

            He also faced fierce questions about Capitol tours he allowed and sometimes conducted despite pandemic restrictions. 

            On Monday, the chairman of the House Administration Committee, Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., also called on Blanton to immediately resign.

            “The Inspector General’s report was highly concerning,” Steil said. He said at last week’s hearing, Blanton’s “refusal to be transparent and truthful has made clear that he can no longer lead the organization and must resign immediately.”

            The investigation grew from a hotline tip about unauthorized use of his work vehicle that drew attention to his office. 

            The Office of the Inspector General report issued in October 2022 found that Blanton had “Abused His Authority, Misused Government Property and Wasted Taxpayer Money, Among Other Substantiated Violations.”

            The inspector general said it received a hotline complaint on March 7, 2021, “concerning the misuse"" of an AOC (Architect of the Capitol) vehicle.

            It said the black Ford Explorer near the Walmart at Tyson’s Corner was driving “extremely reckless in the parking garage and swerving out of the garage at a high rate of speed, estimated to be about 65 miles per hour (mph) in a 30-mph zone.”

            The complainant said the driver, a woman later identified to be Blanton’s adult daughter, “made obscene gestures toward them while at the stop sign outside the parking garage.”

            The report said the family racked up miles on the vehicle beyond what was estimated for the architect’s official use, amounting to $13,926.56 in questioned costs. It said the daughter had referred to using the AOC’s fuel as “free gas.”

            “The AOC OIG found overwhelming evidence that Blanton and his family continually misused AOC vehicles” intended for home-to-work use, the report said. 

            The report also found that Blanton used his official SUV on another occasion in 2020 to pursue a vehicle “involved in a hit-and-run incident that took place in front of his residence.” It said he led the police and others involved during the court proceeding to believe he was law enforcement.

            The report also found “multiple social media posts” created by Blanton's wife about Capitol tours, including one reading “All PATRIOTS welcome.""

            The report said while the posts did not violate U.S. codes, “Offering private tours of the U.S. Capitol creates the appearance of impropriety and using a public position for private gain, which is a violation of AOC policy.”

            Blanton was nominated in December 2019 by Trump as the 12th Architect of the Capitol, and confirmed to the post by the U.S. Senate. 

            The architect’s job is sweeping and historic, responsible for maintenance and operation of the U.S. Capitol and its expansive grounds and building complex. Blanton, a former U.S. Naval officer, is a civil engineer and previously worked as deputy vice president at the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has fired embattled Architect of the Capitol Brett Blanton, who oversees the historic building that houses Congress and its expansive grounds, as pressure mounted for his removal following a scathing inspector general report of personal and management lapses.The White House said Monday that Blanton’s appointment was terminated. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Monday he’d lost confidence in Blanton’s ability to do the job.An inspector general report released last year found “administrative, ethical and policy violations” by Blanton, a Trump-era appointee, including that he abused his government vehicle and misrepresented himself as a law enforcement official. A House hearing last week unearthed new questions and criticisms — including that he was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when it came under attack by former President Donald Trump's supporters.“The Architect of the Capitol, Brett Blanton, no longer has my confidence to continue in his job. He should resign or President Biden should remove him immediately,” McCarthy said Monday in a tweet.The speaker’s statement came as questions and criticism swirled around the architect, who is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the historic Capitol building and its surrounding 570-acre complex and grounds.Blanton came under intense criticism after the inspector general report found Blanton allowed unauthorized use of his work vehicle, including by his wife and adult daughter, racking up nearly 30,000 miles — about triple the estimate for his official use.At a House hearing last week, Blanton also came under fire when he testified that he was not at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack because it was a “telework” day under COVID-19 protocols.He also faced fierce questions about Capitol tours he allowed and sometimes conducted despite pandemic restrictions.On Monday, the chairman of the House Administration Committee, Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., also called on Blanton to immediately resign.“The Inspector General’s report was highly concerning,” Steil said. He said at last week’s hearing, Blanton’s “refusal to be transparent and truthful has made clear that he can no longer lead the organization and must resign immediately.”The investigation grew from a hotline tip about unauthorized use of his work vehicle that drew attention to his office.The Office of the Inspector General report issued in October 2022 found that Blanton had “Abused His Authority, Misused Government Property and Wasted Taxpayer Money, Among Other Substantiated Violations.”The inspector general said it received a hotline complaint on March 7, 2021, “concerning the misuse"" of an AOC (Architect of the Capitol) vehicle.It said the black Ford Explorer near the Walmart at Tyson’s Corner was driving “extremely reckless in the parking garage and swerving out of the garage at a high rate of speed, estimated to be about 65 miles per hour (mph) in a 30-mph zone.”The complainant said the driver, a woman later identified to be Blanton’s adult daughter, “made obscene gestures toward them while at the stop sign outside the parking garage.”The report said the family racked up miles on the vehicle beyond what was estimated for the architect’s official use, amounting to $13,926.56 in questioned costs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809270,Wisconsin lawmakers seek to redefine illegal strip searches,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin introduced a bill Monday that would expand the definition of illegal strip searches after a school superintendent told six girls to remove their clothes during a search last year for vaping devices.

            Prosecutors charged Suring School District Superintendent Kelly Casper in February 2022 with six counts of false imprisonment after she took six female students into a bathroom and told them to disrobe so she could search for vaping devices. The girls, who were between ages 14 and 17, stripped to their underwear, and the search netted two vape cartridges. Another student admitted having a vape on her, the Green Bay Press-Gazette reported.

            State law defines a strip search as a search in which a person’s genitals or private areas are exposed to view or touched by the searcher. Any school district employee who strip-searches a student is guilty of a misdemeanor. But Oconto County District Edward Burke said the searches in this case didn't violate state law because the students were in their underwear.











            Casper resigned in June. A judge dismissed the false imprisonment charges in July, saying the girls likely knew they could have left the bathroom.

            The new bill, authored by Reps. David Steffen and Elijah Behnke, along with Sen. Eric Wimberger, would define a strip search as one in which a person's genitalia or private areas, or underwear-clad genitalia or private areas, are exposed or touched by the searcher.

            “We are committed to protecting the privacy of our students and this legislation reflects a common-sense change,” Steffen said in a statement.MADISON, Wis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809272,Warriors guard Payton II to be sidelined at least a month,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Newly acquired Golden State guard Gary Payton II will be out for at least a month as he fully recovers from offseason surgery for a core muscle injury, and Warriors general manager Bob Myers is awaiting a decision from the NBA on whether the Trail Blazers withheld anything on Payton's health before trading him.

            “What do I want? Whatever the NBA says is fair, just whatever that is,” Myers said Monday of receiving any potential compensation from Portland. ""I just want a fair result. I don't know, whatever it takes it takes, I don't know how long.”

            Myers is hopeful the defensive guard could return before the playoffs. Payton is listed on the injury report with right adductor soreness, stemming from the abdominal area — and there were no further details on whether that means the high-flying Payton's right leg is also compromised.











            “Gary’s going to be out. We’re going to evaluate him in a month. It is our determination he’s not ready to play right now,” Myers said.

            Myers wouldn't address any issues the Warriors had with how Portland handled the trade or whether they failed to share any details on Payton's health, citing legal constraints and medical privacy. Golden State did bring concerns about the process to the league before deciding Sunday to go through with the four-team swap that sent center James Wiseman to the Pistons.

            Myers said the team evaluated all options, including perhaps rescinding the trade altogether.

            “We had the time we had to make a decision, so it was just more thinking about it,” Myers said. “Probably by Saturday night we had a sense of the direction we going in.”

            While the defending champions were hopeful of having Payton play immediately, Myers still believes in the move over the long haul. Payton signed a $28 million, three-year contract with the Trail Blazers.

            “We still think it's helpful. We just have to wait till he gets healthy,"" Myers said.

            The 30-year-old Payton played against Golden State in a win Wednesday night at Portland before rejoining his former team ahead of the trade deadline a day later. Payton is averaging 4.1 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists over 15 games.

            “As far as Gary what he does for us I think you all know, you've seen what he does for us,"" Myers said. ""We're trying to help give this team a boost, near term, long term.”

            Myers added that it was difficult to part with Wiseman, the second overall pick in 2020 out of Memphis who missed all of last season while recovering from right knee surgery he had late in his rookie season. The Warriors didn't envision him making an impact this season if they were to have kept him and opted out of the trade — and Myers said he will be rooting for Wiseman's success and opportunities in Detroit.

            “He is a great kid and did everything we asked him to do, on time, worked hard, great attitude whether he was playing or not, G League and back and forth,” Myers said. “So it was a tough thing to do to move someone that we like that much as a person. I know that it's a business.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809274,US criticizes Israeli settlement plans but offers no action,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The U.S. on Monday criticized new Israeli plans to build thousands of new homes for Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, but gave no indication it would take any action against its close Middle Eastern ally.

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced the plans late Sunday, saying they were in response to recent deadly Palestinian violence.

            It said Israel would legalize nine settlement outposts that were built without authorization and convene a special planning committee in the coming days to approve additional settlement construction. 











            Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a hard-line settler whose responsibilities also include authority over settlement construction, said some 10,000 housing units were set to be approved. Netanyahu's new government is dominated by Israeli ultranationalists who support settlement construction and oppose Palestinian independence. 

            The United States opposes settlement construction on occupied territories claimed by the Palestinians. Over 700,000 Jewish Israelis now live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem — territories captured in the 1967 Mideast war and sought by the Palestinians for their future state. 

            In Washington, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. was “deeply troubled"" by the Israeli decision. “We strongly oppose such unilateral measures, which exacerbate tensions and undermind the prospects for a negotiated two-state solution.”

            But Blinken gave no indication that the Biden administration is prepared to take action.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809278,Rihanna's pregnancy reveal raises bar in all kinds of ways,"NEW YORK (AP) — When one becomes a mother, Rihanna mused before her epic Super Bowl halftime show, “there’s something that just happens where you feel like you could take on the world — you can do anything.”

            And so she did Sunday, on one of the biggest stages in the world. Live. Just about nine months after giving birth to her first child, a boy (whose name hasn't yet been revealed), with A$AP Rocky.

            While haters and stans debate Rihanna's performance, some of the former trashing the show overall, she joins a contingent of famous women to capture a cultural moment with a pregnancy reveal.











            And she did it while floating on a platform, in a fire-engine-red boiler suit zipped strategically down to reveal her substantial bump. Underneath was a matching bodysuit with a leather breastplate tied on.

            She did it wearing three vintage diamond brooches, in a pair of low sneakers. And halfway through, she did it in a huge red puffer coat and matching gloves.

            To her navy, she shined like a diamond.

            Rihanna didn’t talk about the pregnancy before the Super Bowl. Instead, she focused on the decision to spend time away from her son for the first time, and how difficult that was. If she was going to leave her baby to perform, she said, she was going to do it for something big.

            That alone turned the pre-Super Bowl discourse to working mothers, without her even mentioning she was having another child. 

            Rihanna fans were having none of it when it came to criticism of her performance. 

            “What I don’t wanna hear, and def not from ANY MAN was that Rihanna didn’t do enough during her #Superbowl performance. Y’all get a cold and you’ll think the Bubonic Plague got you. This woman is pregnant, performed and danced for 13 mins while suspended in the air,” tweeted the writer Luvvie Ajayi Jones.

            Added actor and writer Danielle Pinnock on Twitter: “My girl was pregnant and y’all still not happy with the performance?! The internet is wild. Preggers and probably swollen AF, Rihanna gave us choreography in the sky, dancers that look like the Michelin men, hit after HIT all while pregnant! Go AWF sis!”

            To be clear, women the world over have worked while pregnant since the beginning of time. So while social media sorts its feelings on Rihanna's show, here's a quick look back on a few other pregnancy reveals that played out while the expectant mothers were essentially at work.

            KEKE PALMER

            Palmer did it during her opening monologue Dec. 3 while hosting “Saturday Night Live.” She got right down to baby business. 

            “There’s some rumors going around, people have been in my comments saying, ‘Keke’s having a baby, Keke’s pregnant,’” she said. “And I wanna set the record straight — I am!”

            Palmer unbuttoned her long, roomy brown coat and slightly pushed down her trousers to proudly reveal her exposed bump under a matching crop top.

            She's currently expecting her first child, with boyfriend Darius Jackson. 

            BEYONCÉ

            Palmer's style move, according to Vogue, was “not dissimilar” to Beyoncé's famous pregnancy reveal with eldest Blue Ivy at the 2011 MTV VMAs. 

            After performing, a huge smile on her face, she dropped her mic (in the truest sense), unbuttoned her bedazzled purple blazer and stroked her belly under black trousers to massive cheers.

            For the twins Sir and Rumi, Bey took to Instagram to announce, wearing a long veil and kneeling in front of a floral display in lingerie while holding her bump.

            KATY PERRY

            Perry and Orlando Bloom welcomed their first child together , Daisy Dove, in August 2020 after she announced her pregnancy that March in a music video for “Never Worn White.”

            And Perry did it, yes, in white, while stroking her bump and singing about her love for Bloom. She later confirmed the pregnancy on social media.

            “omg so glad I don’t have to suck it in anymore,” Perry tweeted.

            Bloom has a son, Flynn, with his ex-wife, Miranda Kerr.

            JASMINE TOOKES

            Many others have leaned on Instagram to spread the baby word to their millions of followers

            The model did it in a series of Old Hollywood black-and-white video clips with husband Juan David Borrero on Nov. 22. 

            Wearing a creamy, elegant gown, Tookes caressed her bump and exposed the behind-the-scenes underpinnings of the pregnancy shoot, including projecting her own image on a computer screen in one clip. Another had Borrero embracing her from behind.

            ZAWE ASHTON

            Ashton was solo when she attended the “Mr. Malcolm’s List” premiere last June, walking the red carpet in a tan, floor-length gown that showcased her bump.

            Fiance Tom Hiddleston didn't attend, but the reveal came two weeks after Hiddleston confirmed he popped the question. Ashton, who played Julia Thistlewaite in the period drama, was accompanied by co-stars Theo James, Freida Pinto, Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù and Siânad Gregory.

            News outlets confirmed in October that the couple welcomed their child, but no name has been publicly announced.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809281,Moldova again at center of tug between Moscow and the West,"CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, the country of Moldova has often been at the center of a struggle between Moscow and the West. It finds itself in that uncomfortable position again.

            On Monday, its president alleged that Russia was plotting to overthrow her country's government by force to derail its aspirations of joining the European Union — plans first disclosed last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

            With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, tensions in Moldova have risen periodically, especially because of a Kremlin-backed breakaway region on its eastern border where Russia has stationed about 1,500 troops.











            A look at recent events in Moldova:

            WHAT ARE ITS TIES TO MOSCOW AND THE EU?

            Once part of the Soviet Union, Moldova declared its independence in 1991. One of Europe’s poorest countries with a population of about 2.6 million people, it has historic ties to Russia but wants to join the 27-nation EU. 

            The country has lurched from one political crisis to another, often caught in limbo between pro-Russian and pro-Western sentiments. In recent years, Moldova has seen widespread disillusionment with post-Soviet politics, and an exodus of hundreds of thousands of its citizens seeking a better life abroad.

            The situation is complicated following a separatist war that broke out in its eastern region of Transnistria in 1990 — a strip of land about 400 kilometers (249 miles) between the eastern bank of the Dniester River in Moldova and the border with Ukraine. As part of a cease-fire in 1992, a contingent of Russian troops remains there as nominal peacekeepers. Since then the region has insisted it is not part of Moldova, and most of its 470,000 people speak Russian, although residents identify themselves as ethnically Moldovan, Ukrainian or Russian.

            In 2021, after decades of largely oligarchic power structures and various Russia-friendly leaders, Moldovans elected pro-Western, pro-European leaders to put it on a more distinctly Western path.

            HOW HAS THE WAR IN UKRAINE AFFECTED MOLDOVA?

            Since the invasion nearly a year ago, Moldova has sought to forge closer ties with the West. Last June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine, but full membership will be a long road, contingent on tackling corruption and organized crime, and strengthening human rights and the rule of law.

            Over the past year, tensions in Moldova have periodically risen as it faced a string of unsettling problems and incidents. These include a severe energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supplies to the country. It also has seen skyrocketing inflation and a huge flow of refugees from the war next door. 

            In April, explosions were reported in Transnistria's de facto capital, Tiraspol, amid fears the war in Ukraine could spill over. In recent months, several missiles have traversed Moldova's skies, and rocket debris has also been found on its territory.

            WHAT HAS MOLDOVA'S PRESIDENT ALLEGED?

            On Monday, Moldova’s President Maia Sandu said in Moldova's capital of Chisinau that Moscow was plotting to overthrow her government via outside saboteurs ""with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will undertake violent actions, attack some state buildings, and even take hostages.”

            Its purpose, Sandu said, would be to install an illegitimate government “which would put our country at the disposal of Russia in order to stop the European integration process.”

            She claimed Russia wants to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine, without elaborating, and added that Parliament must adopt laws to equip its Intelligence and Security Service and prosecutors with the tools ""to combat more effectively the risks to the country’s security.”

            Zelenskyy said last week his country had intercepted plans by Russian security services to destroy Moldova, claims that were later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.

            There was no immediate reaction from Moscow, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this month that the West was considering turning Moldova into “another Ukraine.”

            Costin Ciobanu of the Royal Holloway University of London said it’s likely there was pressure on Moldovan officials to follow up to the public on Zelenskyy's statements last week. He said Sandu's remarks could be a preemptive bid to thwart Russian attempts to destabilize Moldova in the same way Western officials called out Moscow's war plans before it invaded Ukraine.

It finds itself in that uncomfortable position again.On Monday, its president alleged that Russia was plotting to overthrow her country's government by force to derail its aspirations of joining the European Union — plans first disclosed last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, tensions in Moldova have risen periodically, especially because of a Kremlin-backed breakaway region on its eastern border where Russia has stationed about 1,500 troops.A look at recent events in Moldova:WHAT ARE ITS TIES TO MOSCOW AND THE EU?Once part of the Soviet Union, Moldova declared its independence in 1991.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809290,"Alonso says Aston Martin ""will not be happy with second""","SILVERSTONE, England (AP) — Two-time Formula One champion Fernando Alonso said Monday his new Aston Martin team would “not be happy with second” as it tries to build toward a title challenge in future years.

            Alonso joins as a replacement for fellow former champion Sebastian Vettel, who retired at the end of last season. 

            Aston Martin was seventh in last year's constructors' standings with Vettel and Lance Stroll, son of the team's executive chairman Lawrence Stroll.











            “We have to make sure that we have a good baseline for Aston Martin cars that will come in the future. Last year, I think the team went through some difficulties during the first part of the year but they had a good second part of the year, so we have to see that progress also into 2023,"" Alonso said as the team launched its 2023 car.

            ""We will not be happy with fourth, we will not be happy with third, we will not be happy with second. So maybe we cannot win immediately, but that's something that we need to make sure, that this car is the baseline for future years.”

            The car was launched at Aston Martin's as-yet unfinished new factory, which Lawrence Stroll heralded as a “game changer” and a key part of its long-term plans. The team is due to move in later this year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809291,Yankees' Cortes to miss WBC with hamstring injury,"TAMPA, Fla, (AP) — New York Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes will miss next month's World Baseball Classic due to a strained right hamstring but hasn't ruled out being ready for the start of the regular season.

            Colorado left-hander Kyle Freeland replaced Cortes on the United States roster.

            “Came in on Wednesday and told the staff I was a little banged up,” Cortes said Monday at the Yankees' minor league complex. “After long talks, obviously, the best interest was to stay out of it. The biggest goal right here is to get healthy and be ready for the start of fhe season. I think it's something that's definitely doable to start the season off healthy and in the rotation.""











            Cortes said the injury is low grade two strain and there is no timeframe. He will not pitch for at least a couple weeks.

            Cortes first felt a tweak a week ago while running sprints at home.

            “Didn't think of it much,” Cortes said. “I thought it was just a cramp. Later that night went to put on a shoe and kind of felt a little pull there. Once I showed up here it was a little bruised. We’re taking it day by day. We’re seeing how I progress.”

            Cortes went 12-4 with a 2.44 ERA in 28 starts during an All-Star season last year.

            “I was very excited for it,” Cortes said. “Wanted to represent Team USA, a country that gave me a lot of opportunities to do a lot of the stuff I'm doing today, Very disappointed and obviously very sad I can't participate.”

            Cortes was sidelined fron Aug. 21 to Sept, 8, and pulled from Game 4 of the American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros last year because of groin injuries. 

            “Took care of it all offseason,"" Cortes said. ""Was down in Miami rehabbing it throughout the whole offseason. It feels great. No soreness.”

The biggest goal right here is to get healthy and be ready for the start of fhe season. I think it's something that's definitely doable to start the season off healthy and in the rotation.""Cortes said the injury is low grade two strain and there is no timeframe. He will not pitch for at least a couple weeks.Cortes first felt a tweak a week ago while running sprints at home.“Didn't think of it much,” Cortes said. “I thought it was just a cramp. Later that night went to put on a shoe and kind of felt a little pull there. Once I showed up here it was a little bruised. We’re taking it day by day. We’re seeing how I progress.”Cortes went 12-4 with a 2.44 ERA in 28 starts during an All-Star season last year.“I was very excited for it,” Cortes said. “Wanted to represent Team USA, a country that gave me a lot of opportunities to do a lot of the stuff I'm doing today, Very disappointed and obviously very sad I can't participate.”Cortes was sidelined fron Aug. 21 to Sept, 8, and pulled from Game 4 of the American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros last year because of groin injuries.“Took care of it all offseason,"" Cortes said. ""Was down in Miami rehabbing it throughout the whole offseason. It feels great. No soreness.”Another Yankees' starter, Frankie Montas, could miss the start of the season with right shoulder inflammation.Obtained from the Oakland Athletics in a trade deadline deal last season, the right-hander was slowed by the same issue.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809292,"NASCAR Preview: Drivers to watch include Harvick, JJ, Logano","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — This 75th season of NASCAR begins Sunday with the Daytona 500 and it comes after what has been a long exodus of sorts.

            Since 2016, Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Carl Edwards, Matt Kenseth, Danica Patrick and Jimmie Johnson have all retired (though Johnson is back). They all followed Mark Martin and the Labonte brothers, Dale Jarrett and Rusty Wallace.

            As Kevin Harvick prepares to depart, the stage is open to be seized by the likes of Noah Gragson, watermelon farmer Ross Chastain and Daniel Suarez, the only Mexican-born winner in NASCAR history. There is also Austin Cindric, a Team Penske fixture who won last year’s Daytona 500 as a rookie, and Bubba Wallace, the only Black driver competing at NASCAR’s top level.











            NASCAR’s trick is to get America to care about these new drivers.

            “Lack of Stars,” Denny Hamlin, a three-time Daytona 500 winner, cited that as NASCAR’s biggest challenge in a poll conducted by The Associated Press ahead of NASCAR’s 75th year. Hamlin enters the season needed two wins to reach 50 for his career, which would tie him with Hall of Famers Ned Jarrett and Junior Johnson for 13th on the all-time list.

            “No one even knows who the stars of our sport are now,” Hamlin wrote. ”They only know the old names (from NASCAR’s heyday). This comes from a list of issue, but until we actually have ‘superstars’ our sport will always be niche.”

            Joey Logano is a star and he just won a second Cup Series title for Team Penske last season. Others hoping to be in the mix include Tyler Reddick, whoch moves from Richard Childress Racing to 23XI to drive alongside new teammate Bubba Wallace.

            AJ Allmendinger returns to the Cup Series after a brief retirement followed by competing in the Xfinity Series for Kaulig Racing. And Ty Gibbs will make his debut driving for his grandfather’s team just three months after his father, Coy Gibbs, passed away in his sleep following his son’s Xfinity Series championship. 

            KEVIN HARVICK

            Harvick was thrust into the spotlight as Dale Earnhardt’s replacement just five days after the NASCAR hero was killed on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500. Harvick is making this season his farewell. He will move into the Fox broadcast booth next year for an unknown length of time: NASCAR is currently negotiating its television package for 2025 and beyond.

            Harvick is just 10 Cup Series starts away from 800, which would make him just the 10th driver in history to hit that milestone. But his move off the track completes an exodus of star power that brought NASCAR into living rooms across America during the healthiest days of the sport.

            JIMMIE JOHNSON

            The two-time Daytona 500 winner returns after two years in IndyCar and he turns 48 in September. He counts the 24 Hours of Le Mans among the handful of races he plans to run, and his involvement is primarily in making Legacy Motor Club, which he co-owns and was once Richard Petty’s storied team, a contender again.

            Driving for Legacy this year are Erik Jones, a promising young Michigan driver who had been run out at Joe Gibbs Racing after the 2020 season, and the feisty Gragson, a White Claw-swilling kid from Las Vegas with a big personality off the track and few cares on it.

            ROSS CHASTAIN

            Chastain grabbed global attention for a wall-riding gamble last October, a video game-style move now dubbed the “Hail Melon” that snagged him the final spot in last year’s championship race. The tactic he used — deliberately crashing into the wall for momentum — has since been banned by NASCAR.

            “That was the longest wreck of my life. It was successful, but I have no desire to ever do that again,” Chastain said after the ban was announced. “Selfishly, I’m glad I get to be the only one that goes down in history as the only driver to successfully do it. It really mattered and it really paid off.”

            Chastain was the championship runner-up to Logano, the father of three who celebrated by purchasing himself a new head of full hair.

            KYLE BUSCH

            All eyes will be on Kyle Busch, who left Joe Gibbs Racing after 15 seasons in a sponsorship snag. 

            He made his debut for Richard Childress Racing at last week’s Clash and finished third. Days later, Busch revealed he’d been detained in Mexico during an offseason vacation for having a handgun in his luggage. He then unretired from Xfinity Series competition.

            Busch and Logano are the only active drivers with multiple Cup championships, and a change of scenery has Busch poised for a very big year. One Cup victory this season would give Busch at least one win in 19 consecutive seasons, breaking a tie with Richard Petty.

            Ty Gibbs replaces Busch at Joe Gibbs Racing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809293,NASCAR Preview: 75th season one of celebration & transition,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Kevin Harvick is looking for the exit ramp as he enters his final season as a NASCAR driver while seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson is sliding back into stock cars.

            Harvick's farewell tour will come nine years after his only Cup Series title and ahead of a move into the broadcast booth. Johnson, after two years in IndyCar, has returned to NASCAR as its newest team owner. 

            Petty Enterprises, an emblem of NASCAR since shortly after the series' 1948 launch, has rebranded once again and is now Legacy Motor Club. Johnson will sometimes drive for the team he co-owns; this week, for example, he will attempt to qualify for Sunday's Daytona 500.











            This 75th season of NASCAR begins Sunday with the big race and it will be a year of celebration and transition.

            Veteran drivers are making room for potential new stars that the public must learn to love. Series leadership is negotiating with its current television partners with the $8.2 billion deal with Fox and NBC set to expire at the end of the 2024 season. NASCAR owners are also demanding a more stable financial model that makes their success less dependent on outside sponsorship.

            And then are the frantic changes NASCAR is making to protect its drivers in the second year of the Next Gen car. The rear of the car proved too stiff last year and the energy drivers absorbed in routine collisions led to concussions — including one that ended veteran Kurt Busch's career.

            Alterations made during the offseason lacked the desired effect at the preseason Busch Light Clash exhibition at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where low speed bumping and banging left drivers complaining about the “violence” of the race, including the jarring whiplash effect they felt each time their rear bumper was slammed.

            ""We think the changes are certainly heading in the right direction, but from an engineering perspective obviously there needs to be more attenuation in the rear of the car to absorb more of the energy,” David Wilson, president of Toyota Racing Development, told The Associated Press.

            “There’s no question that that they’ve made a steep change. The first car that gets backed in the wall, everyone’s going to be paying attention, right?"" Wilson added. ""(One) of the questions is: What impact will it have on the rest of the car, now that they’ve softened up the rear of the car?""

            A look at NASCAR’s upcoming season beyond Harvick, Johnson, Joey Logano, Austin Cindric and a host of other key drivers to watch:

            NEW RACES AND RULES

            NASCAR continued this year to tweak a schedule that went decades with little to no change. This year, the All-Star Race moves to North Wilkesboro Speedway for the first Cup race at the historic North Carolina track since 1996.

            NASCAR on July 2 will also run its first street course race, in downtown Chicago. And the first race of the year at Atlanta and the playoff race at Texas have both been reduced from 500 miles to 400 miles.

            Stage breaks have been removed from road course races. If a wheel comes off a car while on track it will now only be a two-race suspension. It was a four-race suspension last year that included the crew chief, who will no longer face punishment.

            FINANCIAL MODEL

            The top teams in NASCAR took an unprecedented step last year in publicly discussing their finances while arguing the sport's business model is not sustainable.

            Teams want a larger piece of the television package, the bulk of which is currently paid to the racetracks. NASCAR itself owns 11 facilities on the Cup schedule, not including the races it promotes at the LA Coliseum and in Chicago.

            “We'll get it figured out,” NASCAR president Steve Phelps told AP. “We need to have financially healthy teams, and financially healthy teams put a better product on the racetrack. The discussions that we are having with our race teams right now is: how do we look at four different areas that we think are important for the overall health of the sport? Increase revenue, some type of cost parameters around our sport, things that will aid from a governance standpoint, and then literally how do we grow the sport together. Those are what our discussions are centered on.”

            TELEVISION PACKAGE

            NASCAR has entered its exclusive negotiating period with current television partners Fox and NBC Sports, with its current deals with the networks set to expire at the end of the season.

            How much cash NASCAR secures in its next deal and its distribution is key to making peace with its ownership, a group that has expanded in the last two seasons to include Michael Jordan with 23XI Racing and Pitbull as part-owner with Justin Marks at Trackhouse Racing.

            The negotiating period with Fox and NBC began on Feb. 1, and NASCAR can begin talking to other suitors on May 1.

            “The great news for us is we have two media partners who are very interested in coming back,” Phelps told AP. “We do know that there are others who have expressed interest if we get to the third party window. A lot will depend on how this 90-day period goes with our existing partners to see when we get to a third party window. But it is comforting to know that the fruits of our labor over the last three or four years has taken root and that not only our existing partners are interested in returning, but there are a significant number of others who have expressed interest publicly. Which is fantastic.”

            No-one was injured in the incident in Monte Mor, a municipality of 56,000 residents about 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo, the city hall said in a statement. 

            Sao Paulo police said the 17-year-old was arrested with explosives and a hatchet, and that he had been filmed removing these items from a car parked outside the school. Police also said they seized an airsoft gun and Nazi propaganda at the teenager’s home.

            The agreement, announced Thursday, replaced the final season of a $126 million, six-year contract that was due to pay the 36-year-old right-hander $18 million this season.

            Darvish geta a $6 million signing bonus, of which $2 million is payable within 30 days' of the deal's approval by the commissioner's office, $2 million this June 1 and $2 million this Sept 1.











            He gets salaries of $24 million this year, $15 million in 2024, $20 million in 2025, $15 million in 2026 and $14 million each in 2027 and 2028.

            Darvish's 2028 salary would increase by $1 million for each Cy Young Award he wins from 2023-27.

            Darvish helped the Padres reach the NL Championship Series last season, which was one of the best in his 11-year big league career. He went 16-8 with a 3.10 ERA and 197 strikeouts. He was 2-1 in the postseason.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809299,Afridi and Rauf earn Lahore thrilling 1-run win over Multan,"MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — Shaheen Shah Afridi made a stunning return to competitive cricket after three months out as he led defending champions Lahore Qalandars to a thrilling one-run win over Multan Sultans in the opening game of the Pakistan Super League on Monday.

            Multan, which lost last year’s final to Lahore, couldn’t capitalize on captain Mohammad Rizwan’s 75 off 50 balls as it was restricted to 174-6 by brilliant death bowling from pacemen Afridi (1-27) and Haris Rauf (1-37).

            Earlier, Fakhar Zaman struck 66 off 42 balls with five sixes and three fours in Lahore’s total of 175-6.











            Afridi couldn’t pick up a wicket in the first two overs of his comeback game, after injuring his knee during the final of the T20 World Cup against England in Melbourne in November, but squeezed Multan in his last two.

            Rizwan and Shan Masood (35) shared a century opening stand before Masood fell to Hussain Talat and Afridi bowled Rizwan with a superb off-cutter.

            Rauf then bowled David Miller (25), leaving Multan needing 15 off the final six balls.

            Lahore’s young fast bowler Zaman Khan kept his cool in the last over as Kieron Pollard was run-out off the second ball and Khushdil Shah’s back-to-back boundaries off the final two deliveries couldn’t take Multan across the line.

            Both teams observed a minute's silence before the game for the thousands who have died in the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809300,Report: Officers justified in shooting at man near hospital,"Two Boston police officers who opened fire on a man who had what appeared to be a real gun near a city hospital three years ago, and who was later shot and killed by police following a car chase, were justified in their use of force and should not face criminal charges, according to the results of an investigation released Monday. 

            “Based on the evidence, we conclude that neither of the involved officers' actions were objectively unreasonable,” Special Assistant District Attorney John Dawley wrote in the 54-page report released by the office of Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden. “Accordingly, it is not appropriate to charge and the investigation should be closed without prosecution.""

            Hayden said he has reviewed the report and agrees with it.











            “These cases are always difficult and always tragic, both for the families of the wounded or deceased and for the officers involved,” Hayden said in a statement. “I thank Special ADA Dawley for his thorough investigation into all of the factors involved in this tragic incident.” 

            The chain of events that led to the death of Juston Root, 41, started just after 9 a.m. Feb. 7, 2020, when police received a 911 call about man with a gun near Brigham and Women's Hospital.

            Officers David Godin and Michael St. Peter responded and fired several shots at Root after he pointed what turned out to be a replica firearm at Godin, according to the investigation.

            One of the shots appeared to hit Root, who then limped to a car and drove from the area, according to the report. One of the shots fired by the officers struck a hospital valet, but he survived.

            Root led police on a 3-mile (5-kilometer) chase to Brookline, where he crashed his car near a shopping center and was shot to death by six officers, investigators said.

            The Norfolk district attorney’s office in a separate report released in March 2020 said those members of law enforcement were justified because Root did not show his hands and get on the ground as ordered and moved his hands inside his jacket in a manner “consistent with reaching for a handgun.” The gun turned out to be a BB pistol.

            Boston is in Suffolk County and Brookline is in Norfolk County.

            Root's family said in a statement Monday that they disagreed with the decision in the report and reiterated their call for an independent investigation by the state attorney general's office.

            “There are pending proceedings in the court and they expect that when all the facts are presented, the public will know everything that occurred and that those responsible for killing Juston will be held accountable,"" the family said.

            Root's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against police in August 2020. The complaint said Root, who had bipolar and schizoaffective disorders, posed no threat when police fired dozens of shots at him from just a few feet away. 

            The lawsuit was dismissed, but Root's family is appealing.Two Boston police officers who opened fire on a man who had what appeared to be a real gun near a city hospital three years ago, and who was later shot and killed by police following a car chase, were justified in their use of force and should not face criminal charges, according to the results of an investigation released Monday.“Based on the evidence, we conclude that neither of the involved officers' actions were objectively unreasonable,” Special Assistant District Attorney John Dawley wrote in the 54-page report released by the office of Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden. “Accordingly, it is not appropriate to charge and the investigation should be closed without prosecution.""Hayden said he has reviewed the report and agrees with it.“These cases are always difficult and always tragic, both for the families of the wounded or deceased and for the officers involved,” Hayden said in a statement. “I thank Special ADA Dawley for his thorough investigation into all of the factors involved in this tragic incident.”The chain of events that led to the death of Juston Root, 41, started just after 9 a.m. Feb. 7, 2020, when police received a 911 call about man with a gun near Brigham and Women's Hospital.Officers David Godin and Michael St. Peter responded and fired several shots at Root after he pointed what turned out to be a replica firearm at Godin, according to the investigation.One of the shots appeared to hit Root, who then limped to a car and drove from the area, according to the report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809302,'Ghost runner' in extra innings made permanent by MLB,"NEW YORK (AP) — Starting extra innings with a runner on second base during the regular season was made a permanent rules change by Major League Baseball on Monday after three seasons of use during the coronavirus pandemic.

            Known by some as the “Ghost Runner” and by others as the “Manfred Man” after baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, the rule was unanimously adopted by the sport’s 11-person competition committee.

            Use of position players as pitchers also was tightened by the committee. They will be limited to extra innings, when a player's team is losing by eight or more runs or is winning by 10 or more runs in the ninth inning. Last year, a position player could pitch only in extra innings or if his team was losing or winning by six or more runs.











            The joint competition committee, established in the lockout settlement last March, includes six management officials, four union representatives and one umpire.

            There were 216 extra-inning games last year, down from 233 in 2021 and 78 during the shortened 2020 season. The longest last year was Cleveland’s 7-6, 15-inning win over Minnesota in the second game of a doubleheader on Sept. 17. That was one inning shy of the longest in the three seasons of the rule, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 16-inning win at San Diego on Aug. 25, 2021.

            Home teams went 113-103 in extra-inning games last year and are 262-263 in extra innings since the runner on second rule started in 2020, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Home teams were 312-294 in extra-inning games from 2017-19, Elias said.

            The rule was adopted as a pandemic measure for the 2020 season and appears likely to stay.

            “Clubs have gotten used to the extra-innings rule,"" Manfred said Thursday after an owners' meeting. “I think it’s generally well-liked by players.”

            Use of position players as pitchers rose from 90 on 2019 to 89 in 2021 and 132 last year, according to the commissioner’s office. Use when trailing by six or seven runs increased from eight in 2019 to 16 in 2021 to 28 last year.

            Use when leading by six or more runs rose from 1 in 2019 and none in 2021 to 18 last season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809314,"Carolina Herrera finds royal drama, opulence at NYFW","NEW YORK (AP) — Carolina Herrera is a brand synonymous with elegance and class and in this year's fall/winter debut, the brand pushed the boundaries on high drama, romance and grandeur — while also showing restraint when necessary.

            In the shimmering, grand Plaza Hotel ballroom in New York on Monday, creative director Wes Gordon debuted a collection inspired by themes of elegance and opulence.

            The show opened with “I Say a Little Prayer for You,” and a whole slew of romantic songs served as a backdrop for the opening dress — a strapless structured satin black and white mini dress, signifying a regal and straightforward yet elevated look.











            Gordon's signature Herrera aesthetic was on display in a yellow tulle dress with a tiered skirt that bounced as the model strutted down the ballroom. Another look that bought drama and intrigue was yet again a tiered black and white tulle dress — some of the nylon tulle covered the model's face, giving mystery to the look. 

            Some of the most gasp-worthy looks were inspired by Empress Elisabeth of Austria, recently given a modern edge in the film “Corsage.” One model wore a chunky pearl necklace with a buttoned-down black silk full-length dress featuring gold embroidery. Another look featured a square-necked Cinderella dress in lilac satin with a peek of black tulle and matching lilac pumps. 

            “I wanted to develop pieces that were emotional — fabrics that you wanted to touch and really challenge the mills that we work with to come up with something extraordinary,” Gordon said.

            Celebrities in attendance at the show were Kelsea Ballerini, Rachel Zoe, Maddie Ziegler and Julianne Hough. Also in attendance at the front row was the creator of the brand, Carolina Herrera herself, and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour.

            Gordon delivered a multitude of looks that ranged from embroidered hot pink mini dresses to oversized color-blocked dresses with big peplums and chunky belts. The line also featured a plethora of floral and striped printed dresses — all playing with neckline silhouettes, sleeves and length.

            The brightness of the colors in the show really was necessary to put the joy back into the world, Gordon said. The brand just recently pledged that it would match all donations given to the Red Cross through its Heart for Hope program until next week to aid in the aftermath of the earthquake that recently devastated Turkey and Syria.

            “Even though we've been made numb almost by seeing a bombardment of just horrible things over the past decade, these are just beyond belief — so heartbreaking,"" Gordon said. “It's a moment that all of us around the world need to come together to do whatever we can to help.”NEW YORK (AP) — Carolina Herrera is a brand synonymous with elegance and class and in this year's fall/winter debut, the brand pushed the boundaries on high drama, romance and grandeur — while also showing restraint when necessary.In the shimmering, grand Plaza Hotel ballroom in New York on Monday, creative director Wes Gordon debuted a collection inspired by themes of elegance and opulence.The show opened with “I Say a Little Prayer for You,” and a whole slew of romantic songs served as a backdrop for the opening dress — a strapless structured satin black and white mini dress, signifying a regal and straightforward yet elevated look.Gordon's signature Herrera aesthetic was on display in a yellow tulle dress with a tiered skirt that bounced as the model strutted down the ballroom.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809316,Inter held 0-0 at Sampdoria; Hellas Verona beats Salernitana,"GENOA, Italy (AP) — Inter Milan was surprisingly held to a 0-0 draw at relegation-threatened Sampdoria on Monday but consolidated second spot in Serie A.

            The Nerazzurri moved three points above Atalanta, Roma and AC Milan in a tight battle for the Champions League spots but saw its faint title hopes diminish further.

            The result left Inter 15 points behind runaway leader Napoli, which looks set for its first Serie A crown since 1990.











            Inter had the best of the opportunities at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris and could be made to rue several wayward shots.

            Francesco Acerbi went closest in stoppage time but saw Samp goalkeeper Emilio Audero push the ball onto the crossbar.

            Hakan Çalhanoğlu had also almost snatched all three points for Inter seven minutes from time, but he curled an effort inches wide of the upright.

            Sampdoria, which had lost five of its last six matches, remained second from last in the standings but inched to within eight points of safety.

            Hellas Verona, which was also in the bottom three, continued to give itself hope of avoiding the drop as it beat fellow struggler Salernitana 1-0.

            Cyril Ngonge, who joined last month, netted his second goal in as many starts as Verona extended its unbeaten run to four matches and moved to within two points of safety.

            Salernitana is four points above the relegation zone.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809317,"Pandemic youth mental health toll unprecedented, data show","The pandemic took a harsh toll on U.S. teen girls’ mental health, with almost 60% reporting feelings of persistent sadness or hopelessness, according to a government survey released Monday that bolsters earlier data.

            Sexual violence, suicidal thoughts, suicidal behavior and other mental health woes affected many teens regardless of race or ethnicity, but girls and LGBTQ youth fared the worst on most measures, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. More than 17,000 U.S. high school students were surveyed in class in the fall of 2021.

            In 30 years of collecting similar data, “we’ve never seen this kind of devastating, consistent findings,"" said Kathleen Ethier, director of CDC’s adolescent and school health division. “There’s no question young people are telling us they are in crisis. The data really call on us to act.""











            The research found:

            — Among girls, 30% said they seriously considered attempting suicide, double the rate among boys and up almost 60% from a decade ago. 

            — Almost 20% of girls reported experiencing rape or other sexual violence in the previous year, also an increase over previous years.

            — Almost half of LGBTQ students said they had seriously considered a suicide attempt.

            — More than a quarter of American Indians and Alaska Natives said they had seriously considered a suicide attempt — higher than other races and ethnicities.

            — Feelings of persistent sadness and hopelessness affected more than one-third of kids of all races and ethnicities and increased over previous years.

            — Recent poor mental health was reported by half of LGBTQ kids and almost one-third of American Indian and Alaska Native youth.

            The results echo previous surveys and reports and many of the trends began before the pandemic. But isolation, online schooling and increased reliance on social media during the pandemic made things worse for many kids, mental health experts say.

            The results “reflect so many decades of neglect towards mental health, for kids in particular,"" said Mitch Prinstein, the American Psychological Association’s chief science officer. “Suicide has been the second- or third-leading cause of death for young people between 10 and 24 years for decades now,"" and attempts are typically more common in girls, he said.

            Prinstein noted that anxiety and depression tend to be more common in teen girls than boys, and pandemic isolation may have exacerbated that.

            Comprehensive reform in how society manages mental health is needed, Prinstein said. In schools, kids should be taught ways to manage stress and strife, just as they are taught about exercise for physical disease prevention, he said.

            In low-income areas, where adverse childhood experiences were high before the pandemic, the crisis has been compounded by a shortage of school staff and mental health professionals, experts say.

            School districts around the country have used federal pandemic money to hire more mental health specialists, if they can find them, but say they are stretched thin and that students who need expert care outside of school often can’t get it because therapists are overburdened and have long waitlists.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809318,UN says Syria agrees to open 2 new crossings for quake aid,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Syria’s president agreed to open two new crossing points from Turkey to the country’s rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment to help millions of earthquake victims, the United Nations announced Monday.

            U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the agreement by Syrian leader Bashar Assad to open crossing points at Bab Al-Salam and Al Raée for an initial period of three months. Currently, the U.N. has only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa, at Syrian ally Russia’s insistence.

            The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus earlier Monday between Assad and U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths, who spent the weekend viewing the devastation caused by the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that ravaged southern Turkey and northwestern Syria.











            Guterres’ official announcement came during a closed meeting of the U.N. Security Council where diplomats said Griffiths announced Assad’s agreement to open the two new crossings during a virtual briefing.

            Syria’s U.N. ambassador, Bassam Sabbagh, told reporters while the meeting was taking place that Assad held a “positive and constructive meeting” with Griffiths and “confirmed the need for urgent aid to enter all regions in Syria, including those under occupation and under control of the armed terrorist groups.”

            “Based on that, Syria supports the entry of humanitarian aid into the region through all possible cross points whatever — from inside Syria, or across the borders — for the period of three months to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid to our people in ... northwestern Syria,"" Sabbagh said.

            Brazil and Switzerland, which oversee Syria cross-border issues in the council, asked for “quick implementation"" of the agreement to open the two new crossings.

            “We certainly hope Assad is serious about this,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said. It would be “a good thing for the Syrian people,"" he said, noting the Syrian regime's previous opposition to additional humanitarian crossings. 

            The United Nations has been under intense pressure to get more aid and heavy equipment into Syria’s rebel-held northwest since the earthquake struck a week ago, with survivors lacking the means to dig for other survivors and the death toll mounting. 

            The toll in the northwestern rebel-held region has reached 2,166, according to the rescue group the White Helmets, while 1,414 people have died in government-held areas, according to the Syrian Health Ministry in Damascus. The overall death toll in Syria stands at 3,580.

            U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric cited difficulties of operating during Syria’s 12-year war. 

            To criticism that the U.N. hadn’t responded quickly enough to the quake, he said some aid is getting into the northwest, pointing to 58 trucks that arrived with aid through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing.

            But he stressed that the United Nations doesn’t have heavy equipment or search and rescue teams, “so the international community as a whole needs to step up to get that aid where it is needed.”

            Guterres said in a statement that with the rising death toll “delivering food, health, nutrition, protection, shelter, winter supplies and other life-saving supplies to all the millions of people affected is of the utmost urgency.”

            “Opening these crossing points — along with facilitating humanitarian access, accelerating visa approvals and easing travel between hubs — will allow more aid to go in, faster,” the U.N. chief said.

            In 2014, the Security Council authorized four border crossings to deliver aid to northwest Syria — two from Turkey, one from Jordan and one from Iraq. In January 2020, Syria’s close ally Russia used its veto threat to reduce the number of crossing to the two from Turkey. The following July, China and Russia used their veto power to reduce the number to just a single crossing.

            France’s U.N. ambassador, Nicolas De Riviere, told reporters before Monday’s council meeting that the earthquake is “a humanitarian tragedy that should not be politicized.”

            He said there were two options — either the Syrian government grant additional access to the northwest or the Security Council would try to adopt a resolution authorizing additional crossing points to the region.

            Syria’s Sabbagh said no council resolution was needed, telling reporters that “it’s a decision made by our leadership, and it’s an agreement between Syria and the United Nations.”

            De Riviere told reporters after the meeting that U.N. humanitarian officials said they were ready to send convoys through the three crossings.

            If the two new crossings work it will be fine, he said, but “if it doesn't work I think the Security Council should get back to work"" and look into a resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter that would be enforcible militarily to ensure aid gets through to the northwest.

            Asked why it took a week to get this agreement, when time to get to victims is critical, Sabbagh retorted: “Why are you asking me? We are not the ones controlling these borders.”

            He reiterated that Syria said from day one that it was ready to assist humanitarian workers to reach all Syrians “without any discrimination.”

            Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, told reporters Monday that the U.N. has been trying to send a convoy to the northwest across conflict lines within Syria, but is still trying to get a green light from all parties. The convoy reportedly was blocked by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group with ties to al-Qaida that controls part of the northwest.

            The S&P 500 rose 1.1% Monday. A report on Tuesday will show how bad inflation was at the consumer level in January. Economists expect a slowdown, and better-than-expected trends could reignite hopes that the Federal Reserve may be able to take it easier on interest rates. Treasury yields held relatively steady after jumping last week on rising expectations for the Fed to stay firm on rates.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809322,Crowder won't make Bucks debut until after All-Star break,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Milwaukee Bucks forward Jae Crowder got so frustrated during his layoff that he sometimes yelled or cursed while watching multiple games simultaneously on the four televisions he’d set up at his home.

            “I’d get mad,” Crowder said Monday while talking to reporters for the first time since the Bucks acquired him at last week’s trade deadline. “I’d get frustrated because I’d know I was supposed to be in those situations at some point now, and I’m three or four months of not being in that situation.”

            Crowder must wait a little longer before making his debut with his new team.











            Coach Mike Budenholzer said Monday that Crowder won’t start playing with Milwaukee until after the All-Star break. Crowder won’t be available when the Bucks put their 10-game winning streak on the line Tuesday against the NBA-leading Boston Celtics or when they visit Chicago two nights later.

            Crowder hasn’t played at all this season after making 67 starts and averaging 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.9 assists for the Phoenix Suns in 2021-22. The Suns announced in late September that Crowder wouldn’t be joining them for training camp in what was described as a mutual decision. They’d been working on a trade for him ever since.

            The 32-year-old Crowder wouldn’t specify what caused his issues with the Suns.

            “I just feel like it’s behind me now,” Crowder said. “We had some stuff happen internally that they asked me to keep inside, so I’m going to grant their wishes. Obviously I’ve been working with these guys for a trade partner for months now. I think give or take they did exactly what they said they was going to do. Took longer than what we all expected, but it got done.”

            The Suns moved him to the Brooklyn Nets in the deal that brought Kevin Durant to Phoenix. The Bucks acquired Crowder by sending three second-round picks plus forward Jordan Nwora, guard George Hill and center Serge Ibaka to the Indiana Pacers and shipping two second-round picks to Brooklyn. The Pacers later waived Ibaka.

            Crowder appreciated the opportunity to go to Milwaukee.

            After making NBA Finals appearances with Miami in 2020 and Phoenix in 2021, Crowder wanted to continue playing for a winning team. Heading back to the Midwest enables him to spend more time with his 9-year-old daughter, Jada, who lives in Chicago.

            This also represents a homecoming for Crowder, who played at Marquette from 2010-12. Crowder said he headed to Marquette’s downtown campus once he arrived in Milwaukee.

            “I just took a ride down memory lane,” he said. “I went to see where I used to stay at. I rolled through the town, through campus. I just embraced it and took it all in. I think it’s full circle for me in my life. Here we are 12 years later, 11 years later, I’m back where it all started for myself and this journey.”

            The Bucks believe Crowder’s presence as a 3-point shooter and big wing defender boosts their bid to win a second title in three seasons. The question is how soon he will be in peak form after not playing all season.

            Crowder says he’d been working out strenuously while awaiting a trade but noted that Monday’s practice marked the first time “in months” he’d participated in 5-on-5 drills against other NBA players.

            “My lungs are where they need to be,” Crowder said. “My legs are heavy.”

            The Bucks are quite familiar with Crowder’s ability to produce in the postseason.

            
                Crowder helped Miami knock off the top-seeded Bucks in five games in the 2020 Eastern Conference semifinals. Crowder was with Phoenix the following season when the Suns lost to the Bucks in the NBA Finals. He shot over 40% from 3-point range in each of those two series and has 107 career postseason appearances.

            “He does whatever it takes to win,” Budenholzer said. “He does so many little things on both ends of the court, defensively and offensively. He’s got kind of a toughness on the offensive end, sets screens. He understands spacing, understands timing. He’s won a ton.”

            Crowder is looking to make another deep playoff run with a different team now that he’s completed his extended farewell with the Suns.

            “I’m thankful for my time in Phoenix,” Crowder said. “I’m thankful for my teammates. I’m thankful for the organization embracing me the past two years – we had a great run and we did some great things in Phoenix and we turned their culture around. So I’m happy for those guys. I wish them luck moving forward. I’m moving on to my next chapter in my career here in Milwaukee.”

            SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, thousands of volunteer software developers have been using a crucial Twitter tool to comb the platform for calls for help — including people posting their location inside collapsed buildings — and connect people with rescue organizations to help them.

            Super Bowl ads use celebs, humor, lots of dogs

            NEW YORK (AP) — Advertisers bet big that viewers were turning to the Super Bowl for a comforting escape, and delivered a series of advertisements that relied on familiar celebrity faces, light humor, and plenty of cuddly dogs. This wasn’t a year for edgy humor or experimentation. After three years of a global pandemic, with economic uncertainty looming ahead and the war in Ukraine stretching on, advertisers just wanted people to feel good. Super Bowl advertisers each year try to reach the more than 100 million people tuning into the broadcast. It’s a pricey proposition: ads can cost as much as $7 million for 30 seconds.

            Google to expand misinformation ‘prebunking’ in Europe

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Google is expanding an initiative that shows promise in fighting online misinformation. The tech company announced Monday that it will roll out a new “prebunking” campaign in Germany. Prebunking works like a viral inoculation by priming a person’s critical thinking skills to make them more resistant to false claims. Last fall, Google tested the premise in Eastern Europe by airing short advertisement-length videos explaining how misinformation can trick the brain. Research shows that prebunking can be among the most effective tools to combat misinformation because it’s affordable and can be used on a large scale.

            EU foresees economy improving, but inflation still painful

            FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Europe’s economic prospects are looking up, at least a little. The European Union’s executive Commission on Monday raised its economic growth forecast for the year. It’s now up to 0.8% for the 20 countries using the euro currency. That means the commission expects the eurozone to scrape by without a technical recession in 2023. But things are not great either. Inflation may have passed its peak, but it’s still high at 8.5%. That’s going to keep holding back consumer spending. And the European Central Bank is raising interest rates, a step that’s aimed at getting inflation down but also makes it more expensive to get credit for purchases or business expansion.

            Ford to build $3.5B electric vehicle battery plant in Mich.

            DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. plans to build a $3.5 billion electric vehicle battery plant about 100 miles west of Detroit that would employ about 2,500 people. The plant was revealed Monday at a meeting of the Michigan Strategic Fund, which approved a large state tax incentive package for the project near the city of Marshall. It will be built on a site that’s being readied for industrial development near the junction of Interstates 94 and 69. Gabby Bruno, director of economic development for Ford, said there was “no lack of competition for this project.” She said Michigan “competed against numerous states and countries” to secure the investment. Ford has scheduled press conferences later Monday to make electric vehicle announcements.

            Report: Companies’ climate targets not what they claim to be

            BERLIN (AP) — A new report says climate commitments by companies aren’t always as green as they seem. The report published Monday concludes that major brands are exaggerating how ambitious their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions are, essentially misleading consumers, investors and governments. Europe-based environmental think tanks NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch examined 24 companies, including KitKat manufacturer Nestle, French retailer Carrefour and automaker Volkswagen. It found that only one company — shipping firm Maersk — had climate plans with “reasonable integrity” while the rest were assessed to be moderate to very low.

            BERLIN (AP) — The former CEO of payments company Wirecard has denied having known anything about false accounting at the firm as he testifies at his trial over its collapse in 2020. Wirecard was long the darling of Germany’s fintech scene until it filed for insolvency, saying that 1.9 billion euros ($2 billion) that had been on its balance sheet could not be found. The case exposed flaws in the country’s financial oversight bodies. Ex-CEO Markus Braun, along with two other ex-managers, is charged with fraud amid allegations that much of Wirecard’s revenue and assets were faked. They went on trial in December.

            11 states consider ‘right to repair’ for farming equipment

            DENVER (AP) — Lawmakers in Colorado and 10 other states have introduce bills that would force farming equipment manufacturers to provide the tools, software, parts and manuals needed for farmers to do their own repairs. The bills are a response to farmers unable to repair their own tractors and combines, forcing them to wait sometimes days and paying steep labor costs. The proposition has found pushback from manufacturers worried about releasing trade secrets, the safety of users who could more easily tinker with the software, and the operator’s ability to bypass the emissions controller.

            “We are excited to bring in such a gifted group of coaches to develop our players both on and off the field,” Saban said in a statement. “Kevin, Tommy and Austin have a great mix of energy, enthusiasm and experience that will be a tremendous asset to our program. They are all excellent teachers of the game and fantastic recruiters who bring a wealth of experience and resources to our staff.”











            Steele, a 39-year coaching veteran who ran Miami's defense last season, will start his third stint on the Alabama staff. He was defensive coordinator in 2007, Saban's first season in Tuscaloosa, and head defensive coach the following season before returning in an off-the-field role in 2013. 

            Steele coached inside linebackers in 2014.

            “My history with coach Saban goes back a long time and what he has built here at Alabama is truly amazing,” Steele said. “I understand the high expectations of both coach Saban and the program, and I am looking forward to helping continue that success.”

            He replaces Pete Golding, who left for the same position at Mississippi. Steele has also run the defenses at Clemson, LSU and Auburn and is a former Baylor head coach.

            Rees spent the past three seasons as Notre Dame's offensive coordinator and the past six as its quarterbacks coach. He replaces Bill O'Brien, who left to join Bill Belichick's staff with the New England Patriots.

            “I have the utmost respect for what coach Saban has built at Alabama and the tradition of this program,” said Rees, a former Notre Dame quarterback. “I’m excited to have this opportunity, and I’m looking forward to getting in the meeting room and on the practice field with this team.”

            The 29-year-old Armstrong comes from Southern Mississippi, where he had been the youngest FBS defensive coordinator.

            The financial terms of their deals are subject to approval by the Board of Trustees.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809326,"Liverpool beats Everton 2-0, Gakpo gets his first Reds goal","LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — With three fist pumps in front of the home fans, Jurgen Klopp celebrated his 250th win as Liverpool manager after beating Everton 2-0 on Monday. 

            Victory in the Merseyside derby is always something to savor in these parts. But such have been Liverpool’s troubles in recent weeks that a win of any description would have been gratefully received by the Anfield crowd. 

            Sitting ninth in the standings, this was a first victory in the Premier League in 2023 for Liverpool and only the second in eight games in all competitions. 











            While a Champions League-qualifying place in the top four is still nine points off, there were signs that the win in the 242nd Merseyside derby can provide a lift-off for manager Klopp’s faltering team. 

            January signing Cody Gakpo scored for the first time for his new club and there was good news on the injury front as fit-again Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino came off the bench in the second half. 

            Virgil van Dijk, who has also been out with injury, was an unused substitute. 

            “Tonight we were there and that has to be the sign for us what we have to do. We probably had 70% possession and scored from two counters, that makes it special,” Klopp said.

            This season has been quite the come down for a Liverpool team that challenged for an unprecedented quadruple last year. 

            There have, however, been mitigating circumstances, with Klopp having to cope with injuries to key players, while also learning to live without forward Sadio Mane, who left for Bayern Munich last summer. 

            Still, the team's erratic form has been hard for fans to take, with the Champions League their only realistic hope of a trophy this season. 

            In the league, fourth place remains a distant target, with a humbling 3-0 loss to Wolverhampton in Liverpool's previous match being a measure of its struggles. 

            Hardly surprising then that Klopp celebrated so enthusiastically in front of the Kop

            “We needed this game, we needed the performance, our people absolutely deserved it. I loved the atmosphere - it is an insane atmosphere people create here,” he said.

            There was nothing for new Everton manager Sean Dyche to cheer as he was consigned to defeat in his first Merseyside derby and couldn’t build on the morale-boosting win against league-leading Arsenal in his opening game in charge. 

            “All games are important, but it’s fair to say people were wondering if we would get a point from our first two games,"" Dyche said. ""To get three, I’m not too disappointed with that. I’m a realist and I know how tough the Premier League is.""

            It might have been different for Everton if James Tarkowski's first-half header had found the back of the net, rather than rebounding off the post. 

            Within moments it was the visitors who were behind as Liverpool immediately countered and Mo Salah opened the scoring in the 36th minute. 

            Gakpo sealed the win when he tapped in from close range in the 49th.

            The Netherlands forward, a $45 million signing from PSV Eindhoven last month, had failed to score in his previous six appearances for his new club, but he had no trouble converting after Trent Alexander-Arnold fired a cross to the far post. 

            Everton is in the relegation zone, one point behind 17th-placed Leeds, which it meets on the weekend.

            Liverpool travels to fourth-place Newcastle next, hoping to cut the gap further on its rival for that last Champions League qualifying position. 

            Before kick off Liverpool learned its fans had been cleared of blame after the events at last year’s Champions League final in Paris, where riot police fired tear gas at them outside the Stade de France.

            An independent review found UEFA mostly responsible for the security failures that saw supporters locked out of the stadium in crushed queues that “almost led to disaster.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809331,US probing if flying objects had a 'surveillance aspect',"In a press conference on Monday, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby justified shooting down three unidentified flying objects in recent days, as they posed a risk to civilian air travel.On February 4, the US first shot down what it believes was a Chinese ""spy balloon."" Over the weekend, the US military shot down another three unidentified flying objects that were discovered over North American airspace.Kirby provided more details on the recent operations, saying the US government ""couldn't rule out"" whether the unidentified objects were carrying out surveillance.""We don't know for sure whether they had a surveillance aspect to them, but we can't rule it out,"" he said. He said US decisions to shoot down unidentified objects were ""based purely and simply on what was in the best interests of the American people.""White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said there is ""no indication"" that alien activity is behind recent unidentified objects over the US.""There have been questions and concerns about this but there is no -- again, no -- indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity.""At an earlier press conference, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he views ""some sort of pattern"" in the downed aerial objects over North America. He said rescue efforts are underway after an aerial object was shot down over northwestern Yukon territory in Canada.Trudeau called the unidentified objects a ""very serious situation.""The first of the three recent unidentified objects was shot down over the northwestern US state of Alaska. A second was shot down over Canada on Saturday by the US military in coordination with Canadian authorities.The third object was taken out over Lake Huron which is bordered on one side by the US state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario on the other.That object has not yet been located, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police. ""I am not aware that we have located the debris at this point in the Lake Huron incident,"" Sean McGillis, RCMP acting deputy commissioner, said, adding that the search was in the ""very early stages.""When the massive Chinese spy balloon was discovered flying over the US earlier this month, concerns were sparked about surveillance activities over sensitive military sites on US soil.The White House said it has determined that China has an aerial surveillance program linked to the People's Liberation Army (PLA), but said it has not yet identified the most recently shot-down flying objects.Beijing, meanwhile, said the US deployed 10 balloons over Chinese airspace in the last year. Kirby said Monday that there ""is no US surveillance aircraft in Chinese airspace.""Reuters news agency reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken may meet with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi during this week's Munich Security Conference amid the balloon spat.Congress to review Chinese spy balloon incidentsMeanwhile, the Democratic leader of the US Senate Chuck Schumer announced that Congress will take a bipartisan view of unidentified aerial objects that have made their way into US and Canadian airspace.""Congress is going to conduct a careful bipartisan examination at these various incidents and also look into why US authorities didn't find these Chinese surveillance balloons sooner,"" Schumer said.Republicans and some of President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats in Congress have demanded more information, and expressed frustration after briefings by administration officials offered very little information.dh, wd/rs, js (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/13,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809335,"New Zealand loses Jamieson, Henry for 1st test vs England","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Kyle Jamieson has been forced out of New Zealand’s first cricket test against England that starts on Thursday because of a stress fracture of the back.

            Fellow fast bowler Matt Henry is also unavailable because of the birth of his first child. Uncapped seamers Scott Kuggeleijn and Jacob Duffy have been called in as replacements.

            Jamieson’s appearance for a New Zealand XI in a two-day tour match last week was his first since June, when he sustained the injury in England.











            The injury flared up again this week and the team confirmed Tuesday he will not be able to play at Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui. Scans showed up the fracture, which will require further examination and treatment.

            “It’s really gutting for Kyle to have this happen after he’d put so much hard work in to getting himself back on the park,” New Zealand coach Gary Stead said. “Since the injury in June we’ve certainly taken a cautious approach to managing his return with regular monitoring by our medical staff which has included scans.

            “While Kyle’s not feeling any pain, the evidence is pretty clear he has a stress fracture so he’ll return to Christchurch today and have a CT scan on Friday before we decide on the next steps.”

            Batsmen Tom Blundell and Henry Nicholls have also been delayed in joining the team because of travel problems caused by Cyclone Gabrielle, which continues to batter New Zealand’s North Island.

            Cyclone Gabrielle has affected the preparations of both teams, forcing them to practice indoors. The storm has brought high winds and flooding to most of the North Island and rain is expected on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809336,Aliens? Lack of US info on shootdowns breeds wild ideas,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With few confirmed details from President Joe Biden’s White House, the downing of three unknown aerial objects in as many days by U.S. fighter jets has prompted wild speculation about what they were and where they came from. It even fell to his press secretary on Monday to announce earnestly there was no indication of “aliens or extraterrestrial activity.”

            The president had no public events Monday and has offered little reassurance or explanation of what to make of it all, following the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon crossing the country and the unprecedented peacetime shootdowns that have followed. 

            U.S. officials said they still know little about the three objects downed Friday off the coast of Alaska, Saturday over Canada and Sunday over Lake Huron. But those shootdowns have been part of a more assertive response to aerial phenomena following the balloon episode blamed on an ongoing Beijing espionage program.











            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did have at least one definitive statement to try to tamp down unrestrained theories: “I know there's been questions and concerns about this, but there is no — again, no — indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity.”

            The U.S. government insists the three objects did not pose a threat to American security and that even the massive spy balloon provided “limited additive capabilities” to China's other surveillance programs. Still, they were shot out of the sky “out of an abundance of caution,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.

            Biden’s unparalleled decision to shoot down four objects over North America in eight days — when combined with U.S. officials’ efforts to publicly downplay the foreign threat — has furthered the dissonant messages being sent about sensitive efforts to protect the homeland.

            U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, acknowledge the confusion, saying the administration wants to keep the American public from becoming unnecessarily worried while also trying to maintain a tough posture toward China. 

            Kirby said that while the U.S. has no specific reasons to suspect the aerial objects were spying, ""we couldn’t rule that out.” He added that the most recent objects, flying between 20,000 and 40,000 feet, could have posed a remote risk to civilian planes.

            That legal justification for the downings — that the objects might imperil civilian flight — is viewed by some officials as such a remote possibility that it raises questions about whether it was a mere pretext for acting tough.

            Biden “wants to appear tough on China, and this is a good example of where actions speak louder than words,” said Brian Ott, co-author of “The Twitter Presidency: Donald J. Trump and the Politics of White Rage.” 

            “If we find ourselves next year in a presidential debate between the two of them, Trump will try to cast Biden as weak on national security, and Biden will be able turn to Trump and say, ‘How many of these Chinese balloons and unidentified objects did you shoot out of the sky?’”

            Ott, a professor of communications at Missouri State University, said Biden’s relative silence on the takedown of the Chinese balloon and other objects could be guided, at least in part, by his 2024 reelection considerations. Republicans, from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to right-wing firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, criticized Biden in the days after the Chinese balloon was spotted in U.S. airspace for being slow to act.

            When pressed on whether the decision to shoot the objects down came in response to such criticism, Kirby insisted, “These were decisions based purely and simply on what was in the best interests of the American people.” 

            With little information to go on, senators in both parties demanded answers as they returned to Washington on Monday.

            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that senators would receive a classified briefing Tuesday morning and that Congress would work in coming weeks to get the “full story of what happened.” Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat behind Schumer, said Biden “owes the country some answers.”

            Republican McConnell said Biden “needs to communicate and level with the American people."" He questioned what the administration knew about China’s surveillance efforts before the first balloon crossed the country.

            After the balloon was shot down, the White House revealed that such balloons had traversed U.S. territory at least three times during Trump’s administration unbeknownst to the former president or his aides — and that others have flown over dozens of nations across five continents. Kirby emphasized Monday that they were only detected by the Biden administration.

            Jim Ludes, a former national defense analyst who now leads the Pell Center for International Affairs and Public Policy at Salve Regina University, said political parrying is inevitable.

            “It doesn’t matter what the administration says. People are going to play politics with it and try to score points,"" he said. “Either they acted too slowly, or too hastily.”

            There’s good reason for the Biden administration to be cautious, Ludes added, noting that the blow-up over the aerial devices comes amid heightened tensions between China and Taiwan. The wrong statement from Biden could destabilize an already fraught situation.

            “Next time we fly a B-52 down the straits, what does China do?” Ludes said. “There are opportunities for this to become very complex very quickly.”

            Kirby on Monday sought to draw a distinction between the latest objects and the confirmed surveillance balloon, emphasizing their far smaller size, lack of maneuverability and the lack of any indication they were communicating before they were shot down. They were only detected, he said, because the U.S. had adjusted the sensitivity on air defense radars to detect high-flying, slow-moving objects like the surveillance balloon.

            Officials have yet to retrieve any parts of the three unidentified objects, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, citing the treacherous terrain, water and weather where they were brought down. U.S. officials could not even say whether they were balloons or some other type of aerial vehicle, and have thus far declined to share imagery taken before they were shot down.

            All that is clear, it seems, is that it wasn't ET.

            Kirby echoed Jean-Pierre on that: “I don’t think the American people need to be worried about aliens with respect to these craft.""

            ___ AP writers David Klepper and Tara Copp contributed.WASHINGTON (AP) — With few confirmed details from President Joe Biden’s White House, the downing of three unknown aerial objects in as many days by U.S. fighter jets has prompted wild speculation about what they were and where they came from. It even fell to his press secretary on Monday to announce earnestly there was no indication of “aliens or extraterrestrial activity.”The president had no public events Monday and has offered little reassurance or explanation of what to make of it all, following the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon crossing the country and the unprecedented peacetime shootdowns that have followed.U.S. officials said they still know little about the three objects downed Friday off the coast of Alaska, Saturday over Canada and Sunday over Lake Huron. But those shootdowns have been part of a more assertive response to aerial phenomena following the balloon episode blamed on an ongoing Beijing espionage program.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did have at least one definitive statement to try to tamp down unrestrained theories: “I know there's been questions and concerns about this, but there is no — again, no — indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity.”The U.S. government insists the three objects did not pose a threat to American security and that even the massive spy balloon provided “limited additive capabilities” to China's other surveillance programs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809340,Kubo scores as Sociedad beats Espanyol 3-2 in Spanish league,"MADRID (AP) — Japan forward Takefusa Kubo scored in the first half to lead third-place Real Sociedad to a 3-2 win at relegation-threatened Espanyol in the Spanish league on Monday.

            The result ended a three-game winless streak for Sociedad, which also scored in the second half through Alexander Sorloth and an own-goal by Espanyol defender Leandro Cabrera. 

            Sociedad moved within three points of second-place Real Madrid, which hosts last-place Elche on Wednesday. Barcelona sits 11 points ahead of Madrid at the top. It won 1-0 at Villarreal on Sunday for its 11th straight victory in all competitions.











            The 21-year-old Kubo netted with a left-footed shot from the corner of the area in the 23rd minute, his fourth goal this season and second since October.

            Espanyol, winless in three consecutive games and sitting one point clear of the relegation zone, scored through Sergio Darder and Brian Oliván late on. Cabrera was sent off in stoppage time for a second yellow card. 

            Espanyol has only two wins in its last seven games in all competitions.

            It was Sociedad's third straight win against Espanyol in the league, but it had lost three of its last four on the road against the Catalan club. 

            Espanyol next visits Elche, while Sociedad is at 14th-place Celta Vigo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809342,Biden to award Medal of Honor to Vietnam-era Army officer,"WASHINGTON (AP) — One of the first Black officers to lead a Special Forces team in combat will receive the nation's highest award for bravery in battle nearly 60 years after his commanding officer first recommended him for the prestigious Medal of Honor. 

            President Joe Biden called retired U.S. Army Col. Paris Davis on Monday “to inform him that he will receive the Medal of Honor for his remarkable heroism during the Vietnam War.” 

            In a statement issued afterward, Davis, 83, said the telephone call had “prompted a wave of memories of the men and women I served with in Vietnam.” He thanked his family, friends in the military and volunteers for keeping the story alive, along with Biden and military leaders. 











            “I think often of those fateful 19 hours on June 18, 1965, and what our team did to make sure we left no man behind on that battlefield,” said Davis, who is originally from Cleveland and currently lives in Alexandria, Virginia. 

            Davis, then a captain, was recommended for the Medal of Honor by his commanding officer for distinguishing himself on that June morning during a pre-dawn raid on a North Vietnamese army camp in Bong Son. Every American there was wounded during a major enemy counterattack.

            Davis repeatedly sprinted into an open rice paddy to rescue each member of his team, using his pinkie finger to fire his rifle after his hand was shattered by an enemy grenade, according to the ArmyTimes. His entire team survived.

            The paperwork recommending Davis for the Medal of Honor disappeared at least twice. He eventually was awarded a Silver Star Medal, the third-highest military combat medal, but members of Davis' team have long argued that race was a factor in his treatment.

            Davis retired in 1985, having attained the rank of colonel. 

            In early 2021, Christopher Miller, then the acting defense secretary, ordered an expedited review of the case. He argued in an opinion column in June 2021 that awarding Davis the Medal of Honor would address an injustice

            “Some issues in our nation rise above partisanship,"" Miller wrote. “The Davis case meets that standard.”

            The White House did not immediately announce a date for Davis' medal ceremony.WASHINGTON (AP) — One of the first Black officers to lead a Special Forces team in combat will receive the nation's highest award for bravery in battle nearly 60 years after his commanding officer first recommended him for the prestigious Medal of Honor.President Joe Biden called retired U.S. Army Col.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809343,Arkansas malpractice bill restricts trans youth medical care,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Nearly two years after Arkansas became the first state to enact a now-blocked ban on gender-affirming care for minors, Republican lawmakers are trying to effectively reinstate the ban with a proposal Monday to make it easier to file malpractice lawsuits against doctors who provide such care.

            The proposal, which has been endorsed by a Senate committee, would allow someone who received gender-affirming care as a minor to file a malpractice lawsuit against their doctor for up to 30 years after they turn 18. Under current Arkansas law, medical malpractice claims must be filed within two years of what the law refers to as an “injury.”

            The lawmaker behind Arkansas' legislation, which could go before the Senate as soon as Tuesday, said it's aimed at forcing medical providers to stop offering gender-affirming care to minors.











            “The idea that teenagers, let alone little children, are capable of making such life-altering decisions is not only brand new, but it's absurd,"" Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, the measure's sponsor, said. “A society that allows them to do this is a deeply broken society.""

            
                The ban prohibits doctors from providing gender-confirming hormone therapy or puberty blockers to anyone under 18 — or referring them to other doctors who can provide that care. No gender-affirming surgery is performed on minors in the state.

            The proposal, which other states are considering as part of broader bans on transgender care for children, would be a major change for how most malpractice claims are considered, legal experts said. By expanding the liability that doctors face for providing such care, the bill could make it nearly impossible for some providers to get malpractice insurance. 

            “For a doctor complying with the standard of care, they could still be held liable, which would be just a huge departure from the way malpractice works,"" said Stacey Lee, professor at law and ethics at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Essentially, what's happened is politicians have entered into the practice of medicine. It's almost tantamount to practicing without a medical license.""

            The move is another avenue for states to restrict transgender care, which GOP statehouse have targeted with dozens of bills this year. A federal judge who blocked Arkansas' ban on gender-affirming care for minors is now considering whether to strike down the law as unconstitutional. A similar ban in Alabama has also been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.

            A ban on gender-affirming care signed into law by Utah's governor last month also expands the ability to file malpractice suits against some providers, and a similar provision is included in a ban advancing through Oklahoma's Legislature.

            “We are playing a game of whack-a-mole in trying to stop these horrendous and dangerous attacks on people’s health care,” said Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, counsel and health care strategist for Lambda Legal. “At some point, it needs to stop because the costs are very real.”

            Opponents of such treatments argue that minors are too young to make decisions about their gender identities. But the bans are opposed by nearly every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, who say gender-affirming care is safe if properly administered.

            During the two-hour hearing Monday on Arkansas' malpractice proposal, some exchanges drew gasps and jeers in the committee room. At one point, Republican Sen. Matt McKee asked Gwendolyn Herzig, a transgender woman from Little Rock who testified against the ban, about her genitalia.

            Herzig called the question “highly inappropriate."" 

            McKee's question came after Herzig said that one of the biggest obstacles that transgender people face is a lack of empathy. “Bills like SB199 are designed to hinder, not help, Arkansans,"" she said.

            The malpractice legislation includes a “safe harbor"" provision that would give doctors a defense against malpractice lawsuits over providing gender-affirming care for children, but only if they follow restrictions that experts have said are inconsistent with the standard of care for the treatments. For example, the provision would effectively prevent doctors from administering the care to minors with several conditions, including depression, ADHD or eating disorders. 

            Health experts have said that minors with gender dysphoria who do not receive appropriate medical care face dramatically increased risk of suicide and serious depression.

            “I have yet to see a cardiologist or gastroenterologist who has to fight this hard in order to take care of their patients,"" said Dr. Stephanie Ho, a Fayetteville physician who provides hormone therapy to transgender youth. 

            The current and former medical directors of Arkansas Children's Hospital's Gender Spectrum Clinic testified last year that the hospital had changed its policy — and stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy to new patients. The clinic’s patients who were already on the medications continue to receive the treatment. The hospital did not respond to a request for comment about the malpractice proposal.

            The bill was endorsed as other measures restricting transgender people's rights have advanced in recent weeks, including another bill prohibiting trans people from using restrooms at public schools that match their gender identity. Another bill in the Legislature that restricted drag shows was scaled back after facing complaints that it was anti-LGBTQ.

            Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has also said an education bill she's advocating will include a measure similar to Florida's prohibition against instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Critics have called the Florida ban: “Don't Say Gay” law.

            “Every day, when I get off work, I hop online, I look at the recently filed bills to see what horror awaits me today,"" said Aaron Jennen, whose 17-year-old daughter Sabrina has been receiving hormone therapy for the past two years and is among the families challenging Arkansas' ban. “That's what we do every single day.""

            Arkansas' current and proposed restrictions on trans youth anger Sabrina Jennen, who said they've been a factor for her plans after high school of where to go to college.

            “They're just trying to paint an untrue picture about a very vulnerable group of people who are already struggling so much,"" she said. “They're just trying to make it harder for us to just be happy.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809348,GOP launches probe into COVID origins with letter to Fauci,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans are kicking off an investigation into the origins of COVID-19 by requesting documents and testimony for current and former Biden administration officials.

            The Republican chairmen of the House Oversight Committee and the Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic are seeking information, including from Dr. Anthony Fauci, concerning the idea that the coronavirus leaked accidentally from a Chinese lab. 

            “This investigation must begin with where and how this virus came about so that we can attempt to predict, prepare or prevent it from happening again,” Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, chair of the virus subcommittee, said in a statement on Monday.











            Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chairman of the oversight committee, said Republicans will “follow the facts” and ""hold U.S. government officials that took part in any sort of cover-up accountable.”

            The letters to Fauci, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines, Health Secretary Xavier Beccera and others are the latest effort by the new Republican majority to make good on promises made during the 2022 midterms campaign. 

            Wenstrup, who is also a longtime member of the House Intelligence Committee, has accused U.S. intelligence of withholding key facts about its investigation into the coronavirus. Republicans on the committee last year issued a staff report arguing that there are “indications” that the virus may have been developed as a bioweapon inside the China's Wuhan Institute of Virology.

            That would contradict a U.S. intelligence community assessment released in unclassified form in August 2021 that said analysts do not believe the virus was a bioweapon, though it may have leaked in a lab accident. 

            The letters sent Monday do not require the cooperation of recipients. But in announcing the Republican staff report in December, Wenstrup said that lawmakers would issue subpoenas if potential witnesses didn't cooperate.

            It is extremely difficult for scientists to establish definitively how diseases emerge, but studies by experts around the world have determined that COVID-19 most likely emerged from a live animal market in Wuhan, China.

            Initially dismissed by most public health experts and government officials, the hypothesis that COVID-19 originated from an accidental lab leak began to receive scrutiny after President Joe Biden ordered an investigation into the matter in May 2021. 

            The 90-day review was meant to push American intelligence agencies to collect more information and review what they already had. Former State Department officials under President Donald Trump had publicly pushed for further investigation into virus origins, as had scientists and the World Health Organization. But the review proved to be inconclusive, with intelligence agencies saying that barring an unforeseen breakthrough, they wouldn't be able to conclude the origin either way. 

            Many scientists, including Fauci, who until December served as Biden’s chief medical adviser, say they still believe the virus most likely emerged in nature and jumped from animals to humans, a well-documented phenomenon known as a spillover event. Virus researchers have not publicly identified any key new scientific evidence that might make the lab-leak hypothesis more likely.

            But Republicans have accused Fauci of lying to Congress when he denied in May that the National Institutes of Health funded “gain of function” research — the practice of enhancing a virus in a lab to study its potential impact in the real world — at a virology lab in Wuhan. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, even urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Fauci’s statements.

            Fauci, who served as the country’s top infectious disease expert under both Republican and Democratic presidents, has called the GOP criticism nonsense.

            Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., have previously said that an October 2021 letter from NIH to Congress contradicts Fauci. But no clear evidence or scientific consensus exists that “gain of function” research was funded by NIH, and there is no link between U.S.-funded research to the emergence of COVID-19. NIH has repeatedly maintained that its funding did not go to such research involving boosting the infectivity and lethality of a pathogen.

            Nonetheless, Fauci indicated in November that he would “cooperate fully and testify” if Republicans followed through with their plans to investigate COVID's origin. 

            “I have no trouble testifying — we can defend and explain everything that we’ve said,"" he told reporters during a White House briefing last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809359,Key witness testifies about bribing ex-Mexico security chief,"NEW YORK (AP) — A key prosecution witness testified Monday that he delivered millions of dollars in payoffs destined for former Mexican public safety chief Genaro García Luna but that the two didn't directly discuss what the money was allegedly buying: impunity for the infamous Sinaloa cartel.

            Former member Jesús “El Rey” Zambada testified at García Luna’s U.S. drug trafficking trial four years after catalyzing the case by airing allegations about García Luna at the trial of Sinaloa kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. García Luna was subsequently arrested; he denies the charges. 

            Zambada is the latest in a series of ex-cartel members and admittedly corrupt former law enforcement officials to testify against García Luna. The former cartel member echoed descriptions of cocaine shipments by planes, trains and even submarines, abetted by police and officials under García Luna’s oversight — and, Zambada said he was told, by the federal police leader-turned-presidential cabinet member himself.











            Zambada described an arm's-length quid pro quo. He said he made payments to García Luna through an intermediary who told him that the security chief would shield the cartel, which the witness' brother, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, helped lead.

            The relayed message: “He was going to provide protection to my brother. He’s not going to bother him. He was going to let him keep on working just as he had been,” Jesús Zambada testified, through an English-language interpreter. 

            He said he was told that when the cartel wanted friendly police commanders in various locales, García Luna would help. And indeed, the cartel was able to get its preferred commanders placed, Zambada said.

            The alleged intermediary died in 2010. Zambada didn't say he personally handed money to or got assurances from García Luna. 

            Indeed, Zambada said he quickly excused himself when García Luna showed up earlier than expected for a $2 million meeting with the go-between in a fancy Mexico City restaurant in 2006. Zambada told jurors it had cost another $3 million for a similar, earlier meeting.

            On both occasions, Zambada said, he gave the money to the intermediary, who met with García Luna in a private room at an upscale Mexico City eatery called Champs Élysées. Zambada said that at least the first time, he waited in a bar area while the discussions happened and watched the security chief leave with luggage that had been packed with cartel cash. 

            García Luna indicated Monday he doesn't plan to testify at his trial. His lawyers haven't yet had their turn to present witnesses. 

            The attorneys have argued that the prosecution is relying on untrustworthy criminals who are cooperating with the government to trim their own sentences or to avenge themselves on García Luna for trying to crack down on the drug trade. 

            In questioning Zambada, defense lawyer César de Castro emphasized that the witness admitted to conspiring in cartel killings. 

            “That makes you responsible for these people's deaths, right?” the attorney asked.

            “Partly, yes,” Zambada replied.

            Zambada was arrested in Mexico in 2008 and extradited to the U.S. four years later. He pleaded guilty to drug and other charges that could have gotten him life in prison. 

            He ultimately was sentenced to 12 years after cooperating with the government. He is now on supervised release. 

            De Castro noted that Zambada didn't mention García Luna until he'd met with U.S. prosecutors multiple times. 

            García Luna led Mexico’s Federal Investigation Agency from 2001 to 2005, then served as secretary of public security to then-President Felipe Calderón from 2006 to 2012. In the latter role, García Luna was in charge of fighting drug cartels.

            A defense request made last week in Santa Cruz County Justice Court asks that the $1 million bond set in the first-degree murder case against George Alan Kelly be lowered or lifted. Kelly, 73, on Monday remained in custody at the Santa Cruz County Jail in the Jan. 30 killing.

            A preliminary hearing in the case is set for Monday, Feb. 20. 











            Attorney Brenna Larkin, who was appointed by the court to represent Kelly, said in her request that her client “admitted to firing warning shots at the smugglers earlier in the day, but denied firing any shot at any person.

            “He does not believe that any of his warning shots could have possibly hit the person or caused the death,"" she continued. “All the shooting that Mr. Kelly did on the date of the incident was in self-defense and justified.”

            Kelly's ranch is located just outside Nogales, Arizona, city limits in the Kino Springs area.

            The victim, Gabriel Cuen-Butimea, lived just south of the border in Nogales, Mexico. U.S. court records show Cuen-Butimea was convicted of illegal entry and deported back to Mexico several times, most recently in 2016. 

            The Mexican consulate in Nogales has not returned several calls seeking additional information about Cuen-Butimea. 

            Kelly apparently drew on his borderlands ranching life in the self-published novel “Far Beyond the Border Fence,” which is described on Amazon.com as a “contemporary novel which brings the Mexican Border/Drug conflict into the 21st century.” 

            Authored by a man with the same name, the 57-page novel focuses on George and his wife, Wanda. George Alan Kelly's wife is also named Wanda. 

            “Several times each week illegal immigrants would cross the VMR ranch,” reads one part. “They were led by armed human smugglers called Coyotes. George and his foreman had to patrol the ranch daily, armed with AK-47's.”PHOENIX (AP) — The lawyer for an Arizona rancher being held on $1 million bond says her client did not shoot and kill the Mexican man whose body was found on his property last month near the U.S.-Mexico border, but earlier that day fired warning shots at smugglers carrying AK-47 rifles and big backpacks on his land.A defense request made last week in Santa Cruz County Justice Court asks that the $1 million bond set in the first-degree murder case against George Alan Kelly be lowered or lifted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809361,Turkey earthquake rescuers find 'miracle' survivors but frustration grows,"KAHRAMANMARAS/ANTAKYA, Turkey, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Rescuers in Turkey pulled several people alive from collapsed buildings on Monday, a week after the country's worst earthquake in modern history, but hopes of many more survivors were fading and criticism of the authorities grew.In hard-hit Kahramanmaras, rescuers were attempting to reach a grandmother, mother and daughter, all from one family, who appeared to have survived the 7.8 magnitude Feb. 6 quake and aftershock which killed more than 37,000 in Turkey and Syria.But others were bracing for the inevitable scaling down of operations as low temperatures reduced the already slim chances of survival, with some Polish rescuers announcing they would leave on Wednesday.In the shattered Syrian city of Aleppo, U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths said the rescue phase was ""coming to a close"", with the focus switching to shelter, food and schooling. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had agreed to allow more U.N. aid to access the war-torn country from Turkey, diplomats said late Monday.There were still glimmers of hope. A 13-year-old was pulled out alive after spending 182 hours under the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey's southern Hatay province on Monday, his head braced, and covered for warmth, before he was moved into an ambulance.A young girl named Miray was recovered alive in the southeastern Turkish city of Adiyaman, officials said, while state broadcaster TRT Haber said a 10-year-old girl was rescued in Kahramanmaras.At least two other children and three adults were also reported to have been rescued.THREE GENERATIONS TRAPPEDIn the city of Kahramanmaras, rescuers said they had contact with a grandmother, mother and baby trapped in a room in the remains of a three-storey building. Rescuers were digging a second tunnel to reach them, after a first route was blocked, and a human chain was formed to carry out the rubble in buckets.""I have a very strong feeling we are going to get them,"" said Burcu Baldauf, head of the Turkish voluntary healthcare team. ""It's already a miracle. After seven days, they are there with no water, no food and in good condition.""On the same street, emergency workers covered a body in a black bag. ""This is your brother,"" one grieving woman said, with another wailing, ""no, no.""The Turkish toll now exceeds the 31,643 killed in a quake in 1939, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said, making it the worst quake in Turkey's modern history.The total death toll in Syria, a nation ravaged by more than a decade of civil war, has reached 5,714, including those who died in both the rebel enclave and government-held areas.It is the sixth most deadly natural disaster this century, behind the 2005 tremor that killed at least 73,000 in Pakistan.Turkey faces a bill of as much as $84 billion, a business group said. Turkey's Urbanisation Minister Murat Kurum said some 42,000 buildings had either collapsed, were in urgent need of demolition, or severely damaged across ten cities.Dozens of residents and overwhelmed first responders who spoke to Reuters expressed bewilderment at a lack of water, food, medicine, body bags and cranes in the disaster zone, with many criticising an overly slow and centralised response by Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD).""God knows what will happen next,"" said Ismail Yuvarlak, 42. He said he was living in a tent after his house in Kahramanmaras had been condemned by authorities who in his words had left his family to figure things out on their own.Said Qudsi travelled to Kahramanmaras from Istanbul and buried his uncle, aunt and their two sons, while their two daughters were still missing.""People are not dead because of the earthquake, they are dead because of precautions that weren't taken earlier,"" he said.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who faces an election scheduled for June that is expected to be the toughest of his two decades in power, acknowledged problems in the initial response but said the situation was now under control.SYRIA AIDThe earthquake has fanned resentment among some Turks towards the millions of Syrian refugees who have fled their country's civil war in recent years to relocate to Turkey. Syrians said they had been accused of looting, kicked out of camps, and called names.Syria's rebel-held northwest has itself received little aid. A source from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist group which controls much of the region, told Reuters the group would not let in shipments from government-held areas and aid would come from Turkey.Assad has agreed to allow three border crossings to operate between Turkey and Syria for a three-month period, U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths told a closed-door Security Council meeting on Monday, according to diplomats. To date, there has been only one open, which has slowed the flow of necessary aid.",2023/02/14,292,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809368,Japan averts recession but Q4 GDP rebound much weaker than expected,"TOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Japan's economy averted recession but rebounded much less than expected in October-December as business investment slumped, a sign of the challenge the central bank faces in phasing out its massive stimulus programme.
While private consumption is holding up against headwinds from rising living costs, uncertainties over the global economic outlook will weigh on Japan's delayed recovery from the scars of the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts say.
The world's third-largest economy expanded an annualised 0.6% in the final quarter of last year after slumping a revised 1.0% in July-September, government data showed on Tuesday.
The increase in gross domestic product (GDP) was much smaller than a median market forecast for a 2.0% rise, due to a downswing in capital expenditure and inventory.
""With other advanced economies heading into recessions, we still expect net trade to drag Japan into a recession as well in the first half, especially since business investment is weakening faster than we had expected,"" said Darren Tay, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's GDP, rose 0.5% in the fourth quarter, matching a median market forecast.
But capital expenditure fell 0.5%, more than market forecasts for a 0.2% decline, the data showed.
External demand added 0.3 percentage point to growth, against a 0.4 point contribution projected by analysts.
""From a negative growth in July-September, the rebound isn't very impressive,"" said Toru Suehiro, chief economist at Daiwa Securities.
""We can expect consumption to pick up as service spending stabilises. But it's difficult to project a strong recovery partly due to pressure from rising inflation,"" he said.
Japan has seen an increase in the number of overseas visitors since ending in October some of the world's strictest border controls to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Policymakers hope a rebound in domestic consumption, driven by savings accumulated during the pandemic, will last long enough for wages to pick up and cushion the blow on households from rising food and fuel costs.
With inflation exceeding the Bank of Japan's 2% target, the outlook for the economy and wages will be key to how soon the central bank could phase out its massive stimulus programme.TOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Japan's economy averted recession but rebounded much less than expected in October-December as business investment slumped, a sign of the challenge the central bank faces in phasing out its massive stimulus programme.While private consumption is holding up against headwinds from rising living costs, uncertainties over the global economic outlook will weigh on Japan's delayed recovery from the scars of the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts say.The world's third-largest economy expanded an annualised 0.6% in the final quarter of last year after slumping a revised 1.0% in July-September, government data showed on Tuesday.The increase in gross domestic product (GDP) was much smaller than a median market forecast for a 2.0% rise, due to a downswing in capital expenditure and inventory.""With other advanced economies heading into recessions, we still expect net trade to drag Japan into a recession as well in the first half, especially since business investment is weakening faster than we had expected,"" said Darren Tay, Japan economist at Capital Economics.Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's GDP, rose 0.5% in the fourth quarter, matching a median market forecast.But capital expenditure fell 0.5%, more than market forecasts for a 0.2% decline, the data showed.External demand added 0.3 percentage point to growth, against a 0.4 point contribution projected by analysts.""From a negative growth in July-September, the rebound isn't very impressive,"" said Toru Suehiro, chief economist at Daiwa Securities.""We can expect consumption to pick up as service spending stabilises.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809370,Tennessee closes in on trans youth care ban; lawsuit pledged,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee's Republican-led Senate approved a measure Monday that would ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors, spurring civil rights groups to promise an immediate lawsuit if and when it becomes law.

            The Senate's 26-6 vote keeps the bill on a fast track to passage even though there's more work to be done on the House side. GOP legislative leaders and Republican Gov. Bill Lee spoke favorably about the ban even before a bill was filed.

            “I believe that every Tennessean should have an opportunity to live a life of purpose and dignity in a lawful manner that they choose. And if that involves seeking permanent, irreversible alterations to your body, I support your right to do so — when you are an adult,” said Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Republican.











            The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Tennessee, and Lambda Legal on Monday promised they were prepping a lawsuit. 

            The push in Tennessee comes as state lawmakers across the United States are advancing attacks on gender-affirming medical care for young people. Similar bills are being advanced in Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Dakota. In Utah, the Republican governor recently signed a ban into law, and judges have temporarily blocked similar laws in Arkansas and Alabama.

            Yet Tennessee in particular has been caught in the center of this conflict ever since video surfaced on social media last year of a Nashville doctor touting that gender-affirming procedures are “huge money makers” for hospitals. 

            The video prompted calls by Tennessee’s Republican leaders for an investigation into Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but to date, it’s unknown if any authorities have done so. The private nonprofit hospital said it had provided only a handful of gender-affirming surgeries to minors over the years but has put a temporary pause on the procedures to review its policies.

            On average, VUMC has provided five gender affirming surgeries to minors every year since its transgender clinic opened in 2018. All were over the age of 16 and had parental consent, and none received genital procedures.

            Meanwhile, GOP leaders have used the incident to try to expand Tennessee’s ban on transgender medical treatment for children. These services have been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and are endorsed by major medical associations. 

            “We are bringing up issues that take away people’s freedoms and focusing on things that people then have to then fight for so they can just be who they are,"" said Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell

            If the Senate's version is enacted, doctors would be prohibited from providing gender-affirming care to anyone under the age of 18, including prescribing puberty blockers and hormones. 

            However, the legislation spells out some exceptions, including allowing doctors to perform these medical services if the patient’s care had begun prior to July 1, 2023 which is when the ban is proposed to go into effect. The bill then states that that care must end March 31, 2024.

            “Tennessee legislators seem hellbent on joining the growing roster of states determined to jeopardize the health and lives of transgender youth, in direct opposition to the overwhelming body of scientific and medical evidence supporting this care as appropriate and necessary,” said Lambda Legal Staff Attorney for Youth Sruti Swaminathan in a statement. “And, just as we have done in other states engaging in this anti-science and discriminatory fear-mongering, so too we will do in Tennessee and challenge this bill should it be signed into law.”NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809371,Spotlight turns to baseball and Padres' weighty expectations,"Just hours after confetti fell on the NFL champion Kansas City Chiefs in Glendale, Arizona, the sports spotlight shifted to pitchers and catchers who began reporting to spring training complexes Monday ahead of the World Baseball Classic

            A few miles up the freeway from Glendale, San Diego Padres skipper Bob Melvin spoke about managing expectations with his star-laden club, which has its long-suffering fans whipped into a frenzy after a stirring run to the NL Championship Series last fall.

            Once Fernando Tatis Jr. rejoins the active roster on April 20 following a drug suspension, Melvin will roll out a lineup that figures to include Manny Machado, who finished second in NL MVP voting; Juan Soto, who came over in a blockbuster trade with Washington on Aug. 2; and Xander Bogaerts, who signed a $280 million, 11-year deal on Dec. 8.











            “We have a lot of star players here. We seem to bring another one in every few weeks or so,” Melvin quipped. “It’s been neat to see because the fanbase has really followed it and embraced it. When you have this many household names, it just adds to the excitement coming into spring training.”

            Padres owner Peter Seidler hasn’t been afraid to add hefty contracts, and many fans expect nothing less than the franchise’s first World Series title. The team estimated 48,000 people turned out for FanFest on Feb. 4, waiting in long lines, sometimes for hours, for autographs and photos, and jamming a grassy knoll beyond the center field fence to hear players speak.

            “You have to embrace it,” Melvin said. “It’s going to be there regardless. You have to understand that’s the position we’ve put ourselves in. That’s a good thing, right? … I think everybody here understands what the expectations are.”

            Position players headed for the WBC aren’t due in camp until Thursday, but Bogaerts already was taking swings on Monday. He'll play for the Netherlands before returning to the Padres to play shortstop, with Tatis slated to play in the outfield. Right-hander Yu Darvish, who signed a $108 million, six-year contract on Thursday, flew to Japan on Sunday for his country’s pre-WBC camp.

            TATIS’ TEASE

            Tatis posted a brief video on his Instagram story showing a locker full of Nike cleats and trainers. Adidas ended its deal with Tatis after MLB suspended him for 80 games on Aug. 12 after he tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug. Neither Nike nor Tatis’ agent returned messages seeking comment. Tatis hasn’t played since 2021. He was on the cusp of returning from surgery on his broken left wrist when he was suspended. The video also shows a Rawlings glove. Rawlings is owned by Seidler Equity Partners and MLB Properties. Peter Seidler is founder and managing partner of Seidler Equity Properties. 

            METS MUSINGS

            Veteran reliever Adam Ottavino, who re-signed with the New York Mets for $14.5 million over two years, is looking forward to pitching for the U.S. in the WBC. 

            “It’s going to be cool,” he said in Port St. Lucie, Florida. “I played in ’09 for Italy and I always wanted another opportunity to play in it again. It was a really fun tournament for me that first time and I also knew that I wasn’t going to play for anybody but, you know, USA if I got the chance. It’s always been a kind of a dream. So excited to join the team and see if we can bring it home.”

            Also in camp was outfielder Brandon Nimmo, who was re-signed at $162 million over eight years. “My work ethic doesn’t change. Who I am doesn’t change. What I expect out of myself doesn’t change,” Nimmo said. “I just get to focus on baseball and winning. And I’m really, really happy to be able to do that.”

            The Mets, who won 101 games last season, were eliminated in the wild-card round by the Padres. 

            CORTES OUT OF WBC

            
                New York Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes will miss the WBC due to a strained right hamstring but hasn’t ruled out being ready for the start of the regular season. 

            “Came in on Wednesday and told the staff I was a little banged up,” Cortes said at the Yankees’ minor league complex in Tampa, Florida. “After long talks, obviously, the best interest was to stay out of it. The biggest goal right here is to get healthy and be ready for the start of the season. I think it’s something that’s definitely doable to start the season off healthy and in the rotation.”

            GHOST RUNNERS HERE TO STAY

            Starting extra innings with a runner on second base during the regular season is now permanent after being unanimously adopted by MLB’s 11-person competition committee on Monday. Used for the last three seasons during the coronavirus pandemic, the rule is known by some as “Ghost Runner” and by others as the “Manfred Man” after Commissioner Rob Manfred.

And I’m really, really happy to be able to do that.”The Mets, who won 101 games last season, were eliminated in the wild-card round by the Padres.CORTES OUT OF WBCNew York Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes will miss the WBC due to a strained right hamstring but hasn’t ruled out being ready for the start of the regular season.“Came in on Wednesday and told the staff I was a little banged up,” Cortes said at the Yankees’ minor league complex in Tampa, Florida. “After long talks, obviously, the best interest was to stay out of it. The biggest goal right here is to get healthy and be ready for the start of the season. I think it’s something that’s definitely doable to start the season off healthy and in the rotation.”GHOST RUNNERS HERE TO STAYStarting extra innings with a runner on second base during the regular season is now permanent after being unanimously adopted by MLB’s 11-person competition committee on Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809372,"Super Bowl averages 113 million, 3rd most-watched in history","Fox was hoping the matchup of two top teams in the Super Bowl and a close game would lead to a record night.

            Even though Sunday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles came down to a field goal with 8 seconds remaining, Fox fell just short of its goal.

            The Chiefs' rally to defeat the Eagles 38-35 was the third most-watched television show in history, with an average of 113.1 million people watching, according to final numbers released Tuesday by Nielsen.











            The total includes the broadcasts on Fox and Fox Deportes as well as streaming on Fox and the NFL's digital sites. The figures are via Nielsen and Adobe Analytics.

            The 2015 game between New England and Seattle on NBC holds the record at 114,442,000 viewers (not including streaming), followed by Super Bowl 51 in 2017 on Fox between Atlanta and New England (113,668,000).

            This was Fox's 10th Super Bowl since it began airing NFL games in 1994 and the second most-watched program in Fox Sports history.

            It is a slight increase over the 112.3 million average for last year's Super Bowl. The Los Angeles Rams' victory over the Cincinnati Bengals was broadcast by NBC and Telemundo and streamed on Peacock and NFL digital sites.

            The Fox average this year of 112,173,000 marked the first time in three years the TV-only audience was above 100 million. It was also an 11.6% increase over NBC's average from last year. It is the first time since 2015 there have been two straight years of increases.

            According to Adobe Analytics, this year's digital feed averaged a Super Bowl-record 7 million streams, an 18% increase over last year (6 million) and more than double Fox's last Super Bowl in 2020 (3.4 million). 

            It was the third straight year the streaming average has surpassed 5 million. The first Super Bowl to be streamed, in 2012, averaged 346,000.

            
                Rihanna's halftime show averaged 118.7 million viewers, making it the second most-watched in Super Bowl history. Katy Perry's 2015 performance holds the top mark at 121 million.

            The Spanish-language audience average for the game was 951,000, a record for the most-watched Super Bowl game in Spanish-language cable television history. It was also the most watched non-soccer event in Spanish-language cable history.

            The Spanish-language number is down from last year's record of 1.9 million on Telemundo, which unlike Fox Deportes has broadcast affiliates in 90 markets.

            The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014.

            After Super Bowls averaged over 100 million viewers from 2010-18, four of the five games before this year had fallen short of that number because of cord-cutting. That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game's lowest TV-only average since 2007.

            Unsurprisingly, Kansas City and Philadelphia were the two highest-ranked markets. Kansas City led the way with a 52.0 rating and 87 share followed by Philadelphia’s 46.3/77. 

            The rating is the percentage of television households tuned in. The share refers to a percentage of the TV-watching audience viewing a particular program at the time.

            Cincinnati, which lost to the Chiefs in the AFC championship game, and Minneapolis also recorded 77 shares.

            The flood of ads during what is easily television’s most-watched event of the year was heavy on celebrities — Ben Affleck, Ozzy Osbourne, Matt Damon, Maya Rudolph, Martha Stewart and “Breaking Bad” cast members.

            Steve Williamson, senior vice president of the market research firm GWI. said surveys show that trust in brands is down this year and companies were looking for well-known names for a boost.

            “There wasn’t a primary brand that took over the Super Bowl,” he said. “There were all sorts of brands from alcohol to gambling to Jesus.”

            Fox also said 15.5 million people watched the season premiere of Gordon Ramsay's competition show “Next Level Chef” following the game. The spot after the Super Bowl is usually the most coveted time slot on television.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809373,North Carolina AG won't defend abortion pill restrictions,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein won't defend state restrictions on dispensing abortion pills that are being challenged in a lawsuit and instead will argue the restrictions are preempted by federal regulations protecting access to the pills, Stein's office said Monday.

            The decision by Stein, a Democrat, means Republican legislative leaders who want to keep the restrictions would have to seek to formally intervene in the federal lawsuit, which was filed by Amy Bryant, a physician who prescribes the drug mifepristone.

            The lawsuit filed in January in U.S. District Court in Durham, and a separate lawsuit challenging limits on abortion pills in West Virginia, are considered the openings of legal battles over access to the medications. A Texas lawsuit poses a threat to the nationwide availability of medication abortion, which now accounts for the majority of abortions in the U.S. The case filed by abortion opponents seeks to reverse FDA approval of mifepristone.











            
                Bryant's lawsuit seeks to block enforcement of state laws and rules that it says interferes with the ability to provide mifepristone to patients. The lawsuit cites the authority that Congress gave to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate the FDA-approved drug. 

            North Carolina laws require the pill must be dispensed in person after a 72-hour waiting period, the lawsuit says, and only after patients receive state-mandated counseling and in some cases an ultrasound.

            Stein, who supports abortion rights and is running for governor next year, is a defendant in the lawsuit along with a district attorney and state health and medical officials. Stein and state Department of Justice attorneys are tasked with defending state laws in court. 

            In this case, Bryant's federal preemption arguments ""are legally correct,” Sarah Boyce, general counsel at the state Department of Justice, wrote in a letter to legislative lawyers for House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger.

            “Consistent with its statutory authority, the FDA has determined that restrictions like the ones imposed under North Carolina state law would unduly burden patients’ access to a safe and effective drug,” Boyce wrote. “The department’s filings in the (lawsuit) on behalf of Attorney General Stein will reflect this legal analysis on the merits.”

            Spokespeople for Berger and Moore didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

            The U.S. Supreme Court decision last June that overturned Roe v. Wade — turning decision-making over abortion to the states — has brought renewed focus on medication abortions. Nineteen states — including North Carolina and West Virginia — have laws controlling how, when and where physicians can prescribe and dispense abortion drugs. 

            In a written statement related to Monday's letter, Stein said North Carolina’s “restriction of women’s use of the prescriptions they need to exercise their reproductive freedoms violates federal law and the Constitution.”

            The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 to end pregnancy, when used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol. The combination is approved for use up to the 10th week of pregnancy. The FDA eliminated an in-person requirement for the pill, which can be shipped by mail-order or picked up at brick-and-mortar pharmacies.RALEIGH, N.C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809374,New Zealand declares emergency as Cyclone Gabrielle eases,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The New Zealand government declared a national state of emergency Tuesday after Cyclone Gabrielle battered the country’s north in what officials described as the nation’s most severe weather event in years.

            A firefighter was missing and another was rescued with critical injuries after they were caught in a landslide overnight near the country’s largest city, Auckland, authorities said.

            Auckland was swamped two weeks ago by a record-breaking storm that killed four people.











            The national emergency declaration enables the government to support affected regions and provide additional resources, the government said. It is only the third national emergency ever declared.

            The country was lashed by intense rainfall overnight that forced evacuations of 2,500 people and brought widespread flooding, road closures including the main route between Auckland and the capital Wellington, and left communities isolated and without telecommunications.

            Weather conditions eased Tuesday as the weather system tracked southeast over ocean away from New Zealand, a nation of 5 million people.

            But 225,000 homes and businesses remained without power and people were continuing to be evacuated, emergency services reported.

            The power grid had not experienced such damage since 1988, when Cyclone Bola became one of the most destructive storms to ever hit New Zealand, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said.

            Hipkins could not yet say how the scale of the latest destruction compared to Cyclone Bola.

            “Certainly, the reports that we’ve had is that it’s the most extreme weather event that we’ve experienced in a very long time,” Hipkins told reporters in Wellington. “In the fullness of time, we’ll know how it compares with Cyclone Bola.""

            Hipkins said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had phoned offering his country’s support and assistance. The Australian government also said New Zealand’s near-neighbor was ready to provide support where and if needed, Hipkins said.

            The national state of emergency includes six regions where local emergencies had already been declared. They are Auckland, as well as the regions of Northland, Tairawhiti, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Hawke’s Bay.

            A weather station in the Hawke’s Bay and Napier region recorded three times more rain overnight than usually falls for the entire month of February, MetService meteorologist Lewis Ferris said.

            “It’s going to be wet, sodden devastation around there,” Ferris said. “We’ve seen the worst of the storm now. We’ve just got to get through today.” 

            Hipkins said the military was already on the ground on the hardest-hit northern reaches of the North Island helping with evacuations and keeping essential supplies moving.

            “I want to acknowledge the situation New Zealanders have been waking up to this morning,” Hipkins told reporters. “A lot of families displaced. A lot of homes without power. Extensive damage done across the country.” 

            “It will take us a wee while to get a handle on exactly what’s happened and, in due course, helping with the clean-up when we get to that point,” Hipkins added.

            
                Much of Auckland ground to a halt Monday as train services were canceled, libraries and most schools were closed, and authorities asked people to make only essential trips. 

            Air New Zealand canceled all domestic flights to and from Auckland through Tuesday morning, as well as many international flights. 

            International and domestic flights had resumed Tuesday afternoon at Auckland Airport, but disruptions and delays were expected for the next few days, Hipkins said.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the published epitope mapping, structural studies, and sequence analyses which defendants had used to claim ADG20 was effective against Omicron were insufficient, unreliable, and inadequate to make claims of effectiveness of ADG20 against Omicron; (2) claims regarding ADG20's efficacy against Omicron lacked a reasonable factual basis; (3) ADG20 was over 300 times less effective against the Omicron variant as compared to its effectiveness against previous variants; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809385,Bridges' consecutive games streak lives despite missing game,"NEW YORK (AP) — Mikal Bridges' consecutive games played streak lives on, even after he was forced to miss a game last week for the first time in his NBA career.

            Bridges was acquired by the Brooklyn Nets from Phoenix last Thursday in the blockbuster trade for Kevin Durant. The deal was approved by the league too late for Bridges to play that night in the Nets' game against Chicago, so he had to watch from the bench and was listed as “inactive — trade pending” in the official box score.

            But the league determined that because Bridges wasn’t eligible to play, it shouldn’t count as a missed game. So his streak, the longest active one in the league, reached 367 games when the Nets lost to the New York Knicks on Monday night.











            Bridges said he wasn't sure at the time what would happen to the streak.

            “I wouldn’t really have cared, because I just would have been available for every game I was able to play in. So not like I missed a game where I could play,” Bridges said. “Maybe I’d have looked back and been hot, but I wasn’t really tripping too much.”

            Bridges also never missed a game in college, playing in all 116 at Villanova. Cam Johnson, Bridges' close friend in Phoenix who came with him in the trade, joked that Bridges was “shaking” at the idea of not being able to play Thursday. 

            “He was like, ’I’ve got to get out there, I’ve got to get out there,'” Johnson said. 

            Bridges can still play in 83 games this season, one more than an NBA team's schedule. He had already played in 56 games with the Suns and the Nets had 27 remaining beginning Saturday.

            Nets coach Jacque Vaughn recently said he wanted players to view themselves like Cal Ripken Jr., baseball's career leader in consecutive games played, and be able to have their name written in pen in the lineup every night.

            Now he has the NBA's current version of Ripken.

            “Some things as a coach you want don’t want to think about and that’s one of the things,” Vaughn said. “Like, you want your dudes available on a nightly basis and Mikal Bridges is a guy that takes pride in that. He’s done it his whole career, so when you’re thinking about game planning and what’s next for the team, when you can pen a guy in on a nightly basis, that eases the mind of a coach.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809386,Former Cardinals lineman Conrad Dobler dies at 72,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Conrad Dobler, one of the NFL's top offensive linemen and fiercest players in the 1970s, has died. He was 72.

            The Arizona Cardinals announced Dobler died Monday in Pueblo, Colorado. No cause of death was given.

            Dobler played left guard on an offensive line that included Hall of Famer Dan Dierdorf for a St. Louis team that became known as the “Cardiac Cardinals."" 











            Dobler also was known for his dirty play and even titled his autobiography “They Call Me Dirty” after 10 years of eye gouging, leg whipping and finger biting in the trenches of the 1970s NFL. Dobler also embraced his troublemaking persona in a 1987 Miller Lite commercial by riling up by getting them to argue the beer's “Tastes great/Less filling” tag line.

            “Our hearts go out to the family, friends and former teammates of Conrad Dobler,” Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill said in a statement. “He was the kind of tough, physical and fierce player that you love to line up with as a teammate and hate to line up against as an opponent. On the field, Conrad was a big reason for the success of the Cardiac Cards of the 1970s. Away from it, he brought authentic joy and caring to everyone who had the privilege of being his friend and that is what I will remember most.”

            Dobler earned three consecutive Pro Bowl appearances from 1975-77 while playing under Hall of Fame coach Don Coryell. The 1975 offensive set what was then an NFL record by allowing eight sacks. He played for the Cardinals from 1972-77 before moving on to play two seasons each with New Orleans and Buffalo.

            Dobler was a fifth-round pick out of Wyoming in the 1972 NFL draft. He is survived by six children and 12 grandchildren.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809387,Officer fired in Tyre Nichols case had minor reprimands,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A Memphis police officer who hit Tyre Nichols with a stun gun during a traffic stop that preceded Nichols' brutal beating by other officers had a prior record of minor infractions before he was fired, records released Monday showed.

            
                Preston Hemphill was terminated Feb. 3 after an internal Memphis Police Department investigation showed he violated multiple department policies for his role in the Jan. 7 arrest of Nichols, who died in a hospital three days later. 

            Nichols was beaten after police stopped him for what they said was a traffic violation and he fled the stop. Video released after pressure from Nichols’ family shows officers holding him down and repeatedly punching, kicking and striking him with a baton as he screamed for his mother.











            Nichols' death at the hands of police is the latest to prompt nationwide protests and an intense public conversation about how police treat Black people. 

            Hemphill, who is white, was the third officer at the traffic stop that preceded the arrest but was not at the location where Nichols was beaten after he ran away.

            On body camera footage from the initial stop, Hemphill is heard saying that he used a stun gun against Nichols and declaring, “I hope they stomp his ass.”

            Personnel files for Hemphill, released after a public records request by The Associated Press, showed a negative report on an evaluation; a written reprimand issued after he broke his assigned ticket printer; and another written reprimand issued after he crashed a police car.

            Records showed the negative “observed behavior report” was cited in a 2021 evaluation of Hemphill, who was hired in 2018 and was a member of the Scorpion unit, which has been disbanded by the department in the aftermath of Nichols' death. The evaluation said Hemphill mishandled a call related to parental custodial issues, but no further details of the call were provided in the documents.

            Hemphill was reprimanded for rough or careless handling of equipment after he left his ticket printer on the trunk of his car and drove away after a June 2019 traffic stop. Hemphill returned to the scene and found the broken printer, the records showed.

            Hemphill crashed a police car into a ditch and caused minor damage to the vehicle in January 2022, records showed. He received a written reprimand and was ordered to complete eight hours of defensive driving class. 

            In a statement noted on the evaluation, one of Hemphill’s supervisors said he was a top performer on his shift who should take advantage of more training classes and could eventually provide leadership for junior officers.

            A lawyer for Hemphill declined to comment Monday.

            Five Memphis officers, all of whom are Black and were also were members of the Scorpion unit, have already been fired and charged with second-degree murder in Nichols’ death. One other officer has been suspended, but has not been identified.

            Hemphill’s own body camera showed that from the very beginning of the traffic stop he and two other officers approached Nichols with force that was disproportionate for the alleged offense of reckless driving, according to a statement from the disciplinary hearing that took place before he was fired.

            Along with breaking rules regarding the use of a stun gun, Hemphill was also fired for violations of personal conduct and truthfulness, police said in a statement.

            The department is still seeking to have Hemphill stripped of his police certification so that he can't work in law enforcement again.

            Nichols’ family, their lawyers, community leaders and activists have called for changes within the Memphis Police Department concerning issues related to traffic stops, use of force, improving transparency and other policies.MEMPHIS, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809388,"Oscars response to Smith slap inadequate, academy head says","BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — The slap sat front and center at Monday's Oscar nominees luncheon.

            So much so that motion picture academy president Janet Yang neither had to describe it nor say the names Will Smith or Chris Rock for the ballroom full of award hopefuls to know what she was talking about when she aired her regrets.

            “I’m sure you all remember we experienced an unprecedented event at the Oscars,” Yang told a crowd that included Tom Cruise, Angela Bassett, Cate Blanchett and Steven Spielberg during her opening remarks. “What happened onstage was wholly unacceptable and the response from our organization was inadequate.”











            The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did little in response to Smith storming the stage and slapping Rock during last year's Oscars telecast or in the immediate aftermath. It was nearly two weeks before its board of governors voted to ban Smith from the Oscars and all other academy events for 10 years. Smith had already preemptively resigned as an academy member.

            “We learned from this that the academy must be fully transparent and accountable in our actions,” Yang said, ""and particularly in times of crisis you must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively for ourselves and for our industry. You should and can expect no less form us going forward.”

            Yang, who was not president at the time, was interrupted by a mild round of applause, and did not elaborate further, moving on to happier topics.

            She was met with whooping applause when told the nominees that all categories will be shown live on the March 12 ABC telecast. Last year, in a controversy largely eclipsed by the slap, several Oscars were handed out in a pre-telecast ceremony and edited versions of winners' speeches were squeezed into the main show.

            The luncheon is a warm, feel-good affair where nominees are in general treated with equality, and a relative unknown up for best animated short might be seated next to an A-lister up for best actor.

            Some, of course, attract more attention than others, and don't need to wear the nametags handed out to all.

            Tom Cruise, nominated as a producer for best picture candidate “Top Gun: Maverick,” managed briefly to mix in with the crowd in a ballroom at the Beverly Hilton before he attracted a crowd of gawkers.

            He and Jamie Lee Curtis, up for best supporting actress for “Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" pressed their foreheads together and giggled when they bumped into each other.

            He smiled widely as he posed for photos with his old “War of the Worlds” and “Minority Report” collaborator Steven Spielberg, up for best director for “The Fabelmans,” and Michelle Yeoh, up for best actress for “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the year's most nominated film.

            In a pairing representative of the random-seeming seating chart, Odessa Rae, producer of the nominated documentary feature “Navalny,” chatted with table-mate and best actor nominee Colin Farrell during the lunch of risotto and oyster mushrooms cut to resemble scallops.

            At another table nearby, Brian Tyree Henry, best supporting actor nominee for “Causeway,” laughed with Jenny Slate, voice star of animated feature nominee “Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.""

            The centerpiece of the luncheon is the class picture, the staging of which feels like a high school graduation. An academy governor read off the names of 182 nominees and their peers cheered as they walked up and took their spots on the risers.

            “Jamie Lee Curtis,” producer DeVon Franklin enunciated loudly into the mic. Curtis leapt up and got a big ovation as she climbed alone to the top tier.

            Henry, a first-time nominee, stood at his table, raised an arm in the air and yelped when his name was called.

            
                Ke Huy Quan, another first-timer, up for best supporting actor for “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” ran up to his spot in front and shook his fists in triumph. He hugged “Babylon” composer Justin Hurwitz, assigned to stand next to him.

            Bassett, nominated for best supporting actress for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” got one of the afternoon's biggest cheers when her name was called, and hugged Cruise when she got to her spot next to him.

            The luncheon also functions as an Oscars orientation for would-be winners. Yang emphasized that acceptance speeches at next month's ceremony have to be kept to 45 seconds.

            ""Let's say it together, 45 seconds,"" she told the crowd.

            They repeated it back to her in unison, though at least a few are sure to forget — or ignore her — once they get the statue in their hands.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809389,Bid to keep California reactors running faces time squeeze,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A late-hour attempt to extend the life of California’s last nuclear power plant has run into a predicament that will be difficult to resolve: a shortage of time.

            A state analysis Monday predicted it will take federal regulators until late 2026 to act on an application to extend the operating run of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. The problem is that the plant is scheduled to shut down permanently by mid-2025.

            The future of the state’s remaining reactors could hinge on operator Pacific Gas & Electric’s request to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for an unusual exemption that would allow the decades-old reactors to continue making electricity while the NRC reviews the application – not yet filed -- to extend its licenses for as much as two decades. 











            One reactor is scheduled to close in November 2024, and its twin in August 2025. The plant is located on a seaside bluff, midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

            On Monday, anti-nuclear activists and national environmental groups urged the federal agency to reject the request, saying in a petition that the exemption would amount to a dangerous, unprecedented shortcut that would expose the public to safety risks from reactors that began operating in the mid-1980s.

            “There is absolutely no precedent for the exemption requested by PG&E. The NRC has never allowed a reactor to operate past its license expiration dates without thoroughly assessing the safety and environmental risks,"" Diane Curran, an attorney for the anti-nuclear advocacy group Mothers for Peace, said in a statement.

            The dispute over the potential exemption is the latest battlefront in a long-running fight over the safety of the reactors. Construction of the Diablo Canyon plant began in the 1960s and critics say potential shaking from nearby earthquake faults, not recognized when the design was first approved, could damage equipment and release radiation. One nearby fault was not discovered until 2008. PG&E has long said the plant is seismically safe; federal regulators have agreed.

            Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom — who once supported closing the plant — did a turnaround last year and argued it needed to keep running beyond the scheduled closure to ward off possible blackouts as the state transitions to solar and other renewable sources. At his urging, the Legislature dissolved a complex 2016 agreement among environmentalists, plant worker unions and the utility to close the plant by 2025, opening a pathway to keep it running longer. The utility said it changed direction given the energy policies adopted by the state. 

            PG&E officials have said they are eager for certainty about the plant’s future because of the difficulty of reversing course on a plant that was headed for permanent retirement, but now needs to prepare for a potentially longer lifespan. 

            In October, the utility asked the NRC to resume consideration of an application initially submitted in 2009 to extend the plant’s life, which later was withdrawn after PG&E in 2016 announced plans to shutter the reactors when the licenses expired. 

            But the idea of going back in time to resume consideration of the previous filing was rejected by the agency, leaving PG&E with the time-consuming task of submitting a new application that it expects to file by the end of the year.

            Reviewing a request for an extended license typically takes two years or more. Without extended licenses, that means one reactor, or both, might have to close while the NRC reviews the applications.

            That led to a separate request: PG&E wants the NRC to allow the plant to continue running beyond its current, authorized term while the federal agency considers the license extensions. That ruling is not expected until next month.

            Typically, if a nuclear plant files for a license extension at least five years before the expiration of the existing license, the existing license remains in effect until the NRC's application review is complete, even if it technically passes the expiration date. But PG&E would not meet the usual five-year benchmark.

            In documents submitted to the NRC, the company said the change it's seeking “will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety."" 

            Without the exemption, the NRC would have less than a year to conduct the license-extension review — far less time than is typical — before the current license expires and the plant would be required to close.

            The environmental groups said conducting a truncated review in just months “would be difficult if not impossible” and raise safety risks for a plant that until recently was headed for closure. 

            Completion of the NRC review, before a longer run is permitted, is needed “to assure that continued operation of the reactors will be safe,” they wrote.LOS ANGELES (AP) — A late-hour attempt to extend the life of California’s last nuclear power plant has run into a predicament that will be difficult to resolve: a shortage of time.A state analysis Monday predicted it will take federal regulators until late 2026 to act on an application to extend the operating run of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. The problem is that the plant is scheduled to shut down permanently by mid-2025.The future of the state’s remaining reactors could hinge on operator Pacific Gas & Electric’s request to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for an unusual exemption that would allow the decades-old reactors to continue making electricity while the NRC reviews the application – not yet filed -- to extend its licenses for as much as two decades.One reactor is scheduled to close in November 2024, and its twin in August 2025. The plant is located on a seaside bluff, midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco.On Monday, anti-nuclear activists and national environmental groups urged the federal agency to reject the request, saying in a petition that the exemption would amount to a dangerous, unprecedented shortcut that would expose the public to safety risks from reactors that began operating in the mid-1980s.“There is absolutely no precedent for the exemption requested by PG&E. The NRC has never allowed a reactor to operate past its license expiration dates without thoroughly assessing the safety and environmental risks,"" Diane Curran, an attorney for the anti-nuclear advocacy group Mothers for Peace, said in a statement.The dispute over the potential exemption is the latest battlefront in a long-running fight over the safety of the reactors. Construction of the Diablo Canyon plant began in the 1960s and critics say potential shaking from nearby earthquake faults, not recognized when the design was first approved, could damage equipment and release radiation. One nearby fault was not discovered until 2008. PG&E has long said the plant is seismically safe; federal regulators have agreed.Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom — who once supported closing the plant — did a turnaround last year and argued it needed to keep running beyond the scheduled closure to ward off possible blackouts as the state transitions to solar and other renewable sources. At his urging, the Legislature dissolved a complex 2016 agreement among environmentalists, plant worker unions and the utility to close the plant by 2025, opening a pathway to keep it running longer. The utility said it changed direction given the energy policies adopted by the state.PG&E officials have said they are eager for certainty about the plant’s future because of the difficulty of reversing course on a plant that was headed for permanent retirement, but now needs to prepare for a potentially longer lifespan.In October, the utility asked the NRC to resume consideration of an application initially submitted in 2009 to extend the plant’s life, which later was withdrawn after PG&E in 2016 announced plans to shutter the reactors when the licenses expired.But the idea of going back in time to resume consideration of the previous filing was rejected by the agency, leaving PG&E with the time-consuming task of submitting a new application that it expects to file by the end of the year.Reviewing a request for an extended license typically takes two years or more.

(AP) — A Native American attorney who oversaw New Mexico’s Indian Affairs Department has been tapped to serve as a top policy adviser to U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland.

            The department announced the appointment of Lynn Trujillo as senior counselor to the secretary Friday.

            Trujillo is a tribal member of Sandia Pueblo on the outskirts of Albuquerque and has ties to Acoma and Taos pueblos. Haaland is the first Native American to serve as a U.S. Cabinet secretary.











            Trujillo worked as a state Cabinet secretary for nearly four years under Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham as a crucial liaison with Native American communities during the upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Initiatives during Trujillo’s tenure provided increased funding for local school districts on Native American lands held in trust by the federal government — where property taxes cannot be levied.

            She also promoted the pursuit of justice for missing and murdered Indigenous people across New Mexico and agreements authorizing tribal cannabis programs to spur economic development in Native American communities. New Mexico legalized recreational cannabis sales last year amid concerns about conflicts with federal prohibition.

            Trujillo previously worked as a national Native American coordinator at the U.S. Department of Agriculture on its rural development programs and as general counsel to Sandia Pueblo.

            Haaland and Trujillo are both graduates of the University of New Mexico School of Law.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809391,SIBUR secures international verification of certified emission reductions (CERs) earned by its climate project at ZapSibNeftekhim,"SIBUR has secured international verification of a climate project completed at ZapSibNeftekhim, Russia’s largest petrochemical facility.

MOSCOW, RUSSIA -  Media OutReach - 14 February 2023 - Verico SCE, Europe's leading validation and verification body, has confirmed that SIBUR's climate project meets ISO 14064-2:2019. This helped SIBUR earn certified emission reductions (CERs) totalling some 3 million tonnes of CO2-eq. by 2022.   Under the climate project, by-products of ZapSibNeftekhim will be recycled for heat and power generation. Feedstock residues that cannot be brought back into the core production cycle are fed to HPPs' power boilers rather than flared, thus significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the project, SIBUR has built a gas-mixing unit for making a fuel mixture.   This is Russia's first GHG emission reduction project verified by an international body for compliance with ISO 14064-2:2019 and requirements pertaining to quantification, monitoring, and reporting. The climate project development and validation process was supported by Kept, an audit and advisory firm.   Mikhail Karisalov, Chairman of the Management Board and CEO of SIBUR: ""Decarbonisation is a priority area of SIBUR's Sustainable Development Strategy, which sets out the Company's targets to reduce GHG emissions and achieve carbon neutrality of at least one of our facilities by 2025. For some years now, we have been assessing the impact of our investment projects on GHG emissions of each facility and the Company as a whole. We expect the implementation of this internationally validated climate project in Tobolsk to help our Group facilities intensify their decarbonisation efforts, and make a major contribution to solidifying SIBUR's position among leaders of the national climate agenda.""   Vladimir Lukin, Partner, Operational Risks and Sustainability, Kept: ""The validation of the ZapSibNeftekhim project for compliance with ISO 14064-2:2019 is a milestone for the national carbon market development as it basically recognises the quality of Russian climate projects. This opens up opportunities for further integration of Russia's climate policy into the global climate action. The validation process confirmed the project's compliance with international requirements and also, importantly, with the practical criteria applied to climate projects by verifying and validating bodies, including additionality, baseline justification, and monitoring approaches.""   Vyacheslav Vekovtsev, Verico SCE representative in Russia and director general in Ecopolis Certification & Service: ""Despite the current situation we continue working on the Russian market and contribute to improving the quality of verification institutions in the Russian Federation as we as acknowledgement of Russian climate projects and carbon credits on the international level. We are very pleased to take part in the project of examination and certification of the first gas emission reduction project in Russia, in accordance with the ISO 14064-2:2019 standard. Congratulations to the SIBUR and ZapSibNeftekhim team on the successful positive verification!""  Hashtag: #SIBUR

            As travel operators around Taiwan book new tour packages for spring and summer, they are discovering a shortage of around 3,000 tour bus drivers, according to Liberty Times. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has been made aware of the problem and promised a two-part subsidy program for tour bus drivers beginning in March.

            MOTC Minister Wang Kwo-tsai (王國材) said that the past two years have been particularly difficult for the tourist bus industry with the COVID pandemic inducing layoffs and idle fleets. In order to get back lost manpower, a special program has been crafted to encourage new drivers to enter the industry.

            The subsidized training plan will include the full payment of training fees for drivers hired by tour bus operators. Also, a daily living allowance will be provided during training to reduce the financial burden on aspiring drivers, according to MOTC Directorate General of Highways, Transportation Management Section Head Liang Kuo-Kuo(梁郭國).











            In addition, Liang outlined another subsidy plan to entice former drivers back. The plan includes the provision of cash incentives ranging between NT$30,000-NT$60,000 (US$1,000-US$2,000).

            Liang said the cash incentive plan would also begin in March, and last for exactly one year. During this period, licensed tour bus drivers with a minimum of two years of experience will be paid NT$30,000 after completing half a year of employment, and potentially qualify for NT$60,000 after completing a full year of service.

            Funding for both the tour bus driver training program and cash enticements for licensed drivers will come from a special budget associated with the government’s newly passed bill aimed to boost post-COVID economic recovery and social resilience.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The tourism industry is finally getting back to normal after two years of pandemic disruption, which has led to a shortage of tour bus drivers.As travel operators around Taiwan book new tour packages for spring and summer, they are discovering a shortage of around 3,000 tour bus drivers, according to Liberty Times.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809400,"Indonesia promises move to clean energy, but challenges loom","SAMARINDA, Indonesia (AP) — In Indonesia’s region of East Kalimantan, the country’s dependence on coal is on full display. 

            Driving on the region's toll road, passersby can watch excavators digging coal from shallow pits as trucks filled with the carbon-rich rocks rush by. Under a bridge in Samarinda, the region's capital, hundreds of mammoth, jet-black mountains of coal sit in barges being pulled along the waterway, headed to plants across Indonesia or other countries. 

            They're sights that Indonesia has pledged to phase out — or at least drastically reduce — by agreeing to some five schemes with international stakeholders, including the largest-signed $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership deal. While the deals aim to turn one of the largest coal-producing countries toward its vast greener energy sources, experts warn that financial, policy, infrastructure and other challenges need to be overcome.











            Indonesia's energy transition is “very unique” because of high economic growth, geography, population centers and clean energy potential, said David Elzinga, a principal energy specialist at the Asian Development Bank.

            Despite Indonesia's energy potential from solar, hydropower, geothermal, wind and other sources, only some 12% of them are tapped, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Nearly all energy demand is met by fossil fuels, with 60% coming from highly-polluting coal.

            That means people like boat maker Jembong, 55, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, can rely on solar for a lightbulb or to watch television. But for the energy-intensive power tools he uses to handcraft boats from his home on Karampuang Island, he needs diesel. 

            “If I can't use the diesel engine, I can't work,” he said.

            It’s impacted the environment: In 2021, Indonesia's energy sector emissions were around 600 million tons of carbon dioxide, the world’s ninth highest, according to the International Energy Agency. And population and economic growth are expected to triple the country's energy consumption by 2050.

            “It’s a challenging environment to make change while you have such substantial growth,"" said Elzinga. “It is different than a developed country which is characterized by having significant financial resources and low economic growth.” Many more-developed economies have stronger renewable ambitions, though researchers say no country is currently in line with global climate goals.

            Indonesian officials have signaled they've started the shift: They've announced new regulations around solar, set a goal to raise the market share of electric vehicles in Indonesia to 25% of total vehicle sales by 2030 and have deployed charging stations. But experts warn Indonesia is lagging behind its Southeast Asian peers.

            Indonesia has voiced it needs help from more-developed nations. 

            “We don't want to be limited in terms of our ability to grow economically,” said Deputy Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Rachmat Kaimuddin. “Industrialized nations can support us.""

            With the new JETP deal, Indonesia will aim to reach net zero emissions from the power sector by 2050, bringing forward its target by a decade, and reach a peak in those emissions by 2030. It's increasing its target for renewable energy to make up over a third of all power generation by 2030, which would mean doubling the pace of current deployment.

            But financing remains an obstacle, said Elrika Hamdi, an Indonesia-based energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. By one estimate, Indonesia will need up to $2.4 trillion in cumulative investment across the energy system by 2050 — a number far larger than the money currently pledged. 

            “We still have a long way to go to find out ... how we could gather up the financing to do this,” said Hamdi.

            How the money is provided — be it loans, grants or other funding schemes — is also a concern, said Grita Anindarini, a program director at the Indonesian Center for Environmental Law.

            “We just want to make sure that these funds won’t lead to a debt trap,” said Anindarini. 

            Hamdi raised concerns over how money from transition schemes could be spent. In a recent report, she critiqued “a lack of disclosure on the selection criteria” for plants selected for early retirement buyouts by Indonesia's state-owned electric company, PLN, including some plants that will be “beyond their economic useful life by 2055."" JETP funding could be used to support the buyouts.

            “PLN should retire them within the next couple of years and write them off,” Hamdi wrote in the report.

            Another concern raised by activists is that the JETP deal doesn't make clear what, if any, restrictions it will put in place regarding Indonesia building new coal plants, or whether Indonesia would be required to decrease coal exports. A 2022 presidential regulation provides an exemption to build previously planned coal plants or those attached to nationally strategic projects.

            Coal is a valuable part of Indonesia's economy, with the country being the largest exporter by tonnage in the world. Customers include China, India and Japan. The war in Ukraine has caused a spike in energy costs, with the increased price likely to remain for the next two or three years, said Hamdi.

            “You can understand the rationale for them wanting to develop their industries and their natural resources,” said Elzinga. ""The responsibility of the development community and those who want to support Indonesia is very much to come up with solutions that allow them to do both.""

            In a written statement sent to The Associated Press, Darmawan Prasodjo, the CEO of PLN, wrote that the company has already cancelled some coal-fired plants in their near-term business plan and is “committed to lead the energy transition in Indonesia.”

            Muliawan Margadana, vice chairman of the Indonesia Mining Association, and experts raised concerns over the future of communities reliant on the coal industry, which makes up 35% of East Kalimantan’s GDP and employs nearly 9% of its population.

            “More than 250,000 people are directly employed by coal mining. If we calculate their families, about 1 million people are impacted,” said Margadana.

            But he said that reskilling workers is possible — something Hamdi agrees with.

            “What’s important, and will be considered as just, is how the transition funding will be allocated to help these impacted workers, whether through upskilling, reskilling, or community development,” said Hamdi.

            Domestic energy policy is also not up to speed with the transition — especially for solar energy, which is a key source on Indonesia's pathway to net zero — noted Daniel Kurniawan, a researcher who focuses on solar for the Institute for Essential Services Reform. 

            There is a lack of a solid policy-making environment and political commitment for Indonesia to “transition to clean energy amidst the overcapacity, driven by overreliance on coal power,” he said. “Although that is bound to change with JETP.”

            Geography presents another challenge. Indonesia is a large archipelago with significant differences in energy resources, distribution and populations centers, said Elzinga. For example Java, the country's administrative center, accounts for around 60% of the population and some 75% of electricity consumption, but only a small percent of renewable potential.

            While the challenges are varied, they're not insurmountable, said Hamdi. Her organization and others are monitoring developments with Indonesia's energy transition.

            “We have to watch as well how this energy transition will create a better impact and a better future for our communities,” said Hamdi. “It has to be for the whole range of citizens.”

But experts warn Indonesia is lagging behind its Southeast Asian peers.Indonesia has voiced it needs help from more-developed nations.“We don't want to be limited in terms of our ability to grow economically,” said Deputy Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Rachmat Kaimuddin. “Industrialized nations can support us.""With the new JETP deal, Indonesia will aim to reach net zero emissions from the power sector by 2050, bringing forward its target by a decade, and reach a peak in those emissions by 2030. It's increasing its target for renewable energy to make up over a third of all power generation by 2030, which would mean doubling the pace of current deployment.But financing remains an obstacle, said Elrika Hamdi, an Indonesia-based energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. By one estimate, Indonesia will need up to $2.4 trillion in cumulative investment across the energy system by 2050 — a number far larger than the money currently pledged.“We still have a long way to go to find out ... how we could gather up the financing to do this,” said Hamdi.How the money is provided — be it loans, grants or other funding schemes — is also a concern, said Grita Anindarini, a program director at the Indonesian Center for Environmental Law.“We just want to make sure that these funds won’t lead to a debt trap,” said Anindarini.Hamdi raised concerns over how money from transition schemes could be spent. In a recent report, she critiqued “a lack of disclosure on the selection criteria” for plants selected for early retirement buyouts by Indonesia's state-owned electric company, PLN, including some plants that will be “beyond their economic useful life by 2055."" JETP funding could be used to support the buyouts.“PLN should retire them within the next couple of years and write them off,” Hamdi wrote in the report.Another concern raised by activists is that the JETP deal doesn't make clear what, if any, restrictions it will put in place regarding Indonesia building new coal plants, or whether Indonesia would be required to decrease coal exports. A 2022 presidential regulation provides an exemption to build previously planned coal plants or those attached to nationally strategic projects.Coal is a valuable part of Indonesia's economy, with the country being the largest exporter by tonnage in the world. Customers include China, India and Japan. The war in Ukraine has caused a spike in energy costs, with the increased price likely to remain for the next two or three years, said Hamdi.“You can understand the rationale for them wanting to develop their industries and their natural resources,” said Elzinga. ""The responsibility of the development community and those who want to support Indonesia is very much to come up with solutions that allow them to do both.""In a written statement sent to The Associated Press, Darmawan Prasodjo, the CEO of PLN, wrote that the company has already cancelled some coal-fired plants in their near-term business plan and is “committed to lead the energy transition in Indonesia.”Muliawan Margadana, vice chairman of the Indonesia Mining Association, and experts raised concerns over the future of communities reliant on the coal industry, which makes up 35% of East Kalimantan’s GDP and employs nearly 9% of its population.“More than 250,000 people are directly employed by coal mining. If we calculate their families, about 1 million people are impacted,” said Margadana.But he said that reskilling workers is possible — something Hamdi agrees with.“What’s important, and will be considered as just, is how the transition funding will be allocated to help these impacted workers, whether through upskilling, reskilling, or community development,” said Hamdi.Domestic energy policy is also not up to speed with the transition — especially for solar energy, which is a key source on Indonesia's pathway to net zero — noted Daniel Kurniawan, a researcher who focuses on solar for the Institute for Essential Services Reform.There is a lack of a solid policy-making environment and political commitment for Indonesia to “transition to clean energy amidst the overcapacity, driven by overreliance on coal power,” he said. “Although that is bound to change with JETP.”Geography presents another challenge. Indonesia is a large archipelago with significant differences in energy resources, distribution and populations centers, said Elzinga. For example Java, the country's administrative center, accounts for around 60% of the population and some 75% of electricity consumption, but only a small percent of renewable potential.While the challenges are varied, they're not insurmountable, said Hamdi. Her organization and others are monitoring developments with Indonesia's energy transition.“We have to watch as well how this energy transition will create a better impact and a better future for our communities,” said Hamdi. “It has to be for the whole range of citizens.”___Sibi Arasu reported from Bengaluru, India.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809401,Ukrainian Peewees playing through reminders of war at home,"QUEBEC CITY (AP) — If Mykyta Staskevich needed another reminder of what his boys hockey team of Ukrainian refugees was playing for back home, it came in the poignant form of the nation’s flag unfolded in the locker room before its game against Romania on Monday.

            In blue, representing the sky, were the nicknames of a player’s father and the father of a player’s friend, who have died on the front lines in the war with Russia. In yellow, representing the ground, were the nicknames of two of the player’s fathers — including Staskevich — who are still fighting.

            Speaking in Ukrainian, Staskevich’s eyes welled as he provided an answer to what the flag symbolized. 











            “He wants Ukraine to win the war and to stop the war,” Ukrainian Selects coach Evgheniy Pysarenko said, translating his team's captain. “Peace.”

            The flag was brought to Pysarenko by one of the player’s parents, and served as both motivation and a poignant reminder of why the team is competing in the International Peewee Tournament in Quebec City. The Selects are more than just a hockey team of 11- and 12-year-olds. They’ve come to represent a symbol of peace and a far more hopeful future for a battle-torn nation nearly a year since Russia invaded Ukraine.

            “You can imagine a kid, he saw the name of his father, and he start to cry. And the whole team come to him and give big hug. It was quiet a couple of minutes,” Pysarenko said, following a 2-0 victory over Team Romania Wolves. 

            “It was more than a hockey game,” he said. “This game we dedicated to these people.” 

            Tears turned to smiles by the end of the game, when Ivan Bilozerov capped the scoring by converting a rebound with 61 seconds remaining. And the excitement in the locker room grew when word got around that the Selects were boarding a bus headed for Montreal, where the team will be the special guests of the Canadiens for their game against Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday night.

            One of the team’s dreams was having a chance to attend an NHL game during what’s now growing into a three-week stay in Canada.

            The Selects extended their stay by beating Romania in an elimination game. Maksym Kukharenko scored a power-play goal and Matvii Kulish earned the shutout (shot totals are not tracked at the tournament).

            The Ukrainians, who have been celebrated around town since their arrival some two weeks ago, are three wins from clinching a spot in the tournament Class AA championship on Sunday. They advanced to play the Vermont Flames Academy on Friday.

            “It’s a special story, special kids,” Pysarenko said of the resilience his players have shown. “They’re a lot more grown up than everyone else.”

            The Selects blamed nerves and the pressure of playing in front of a near-capacity crowd of 18,000 blue-and-white flag-waving fans as a factor in their slow start to a tournament-opening 3-1 win over the Boston Junior Bruins. Ukraine overcame a 1-0 deficit by scoring three times in the final five minutes.

            On Monday, the Selects had pre-game emotions to overcome.

            This time, they got an early lead with Kukharenko scoring 4:37 into the 10-minute first period off a shot from the left point that appeared to deflect in off a Romanian defender. The Selects weren’t able to exhale until Bilozerov scored by slapping in a shot from the right circle.

            The Ukrainians once again celebrated with a victory lap, while paying tribute to their supporters, who made up a majority of the fans who filled about half of the lower bowl of the arena. 

            A smaller contingent of Romanian fans were gathered in one section, and made their presence known with chants, songs and the banging of cowbells. 

            Tournament officials don’t release attendance figures, but the crowd on Monday was still far larger than the 20 or so people Selects forward Zahar Kovalenko said he was used to playing in front of in Ukraine. 

            The Ukrainian’s presence has placed a larger global spotlight on the 63-year-old tournament with the war in Ukraine showing signs of once again escalating. The Selects are regarded as symbol of peace for Ukraine and hope for a better future, and they’ve merited mention from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

            The matchup of teams from bordering nations featured several coincidences. Romania is where the Selects held training camp, because that’s where Pysarenko now lives, and began holding camps for players after watching many youth fleeing Ukraine with hockey equipment in tow.

            And the Romanian team’s presence in the tournament stems from Pysarenko, who recommended to the nation’s hockey officials to seek sending a team to the Quebec City tournament four years ago. 

            “I know these kids and I saw them crying after the game and I was so sorry for them because I work with them, too. And know, personally them, and parents and coach,” Pysarenko said. “But the situation was we need this win probably more than them.”

The weather bureau predicted that moisture from south China will bring rainfall to northern, central and eastern Taiwan on Tuesday, while conditions will be drier on Wednesday and Thursday.At 6:27 a.m., the CWB issued an orange alert for temperatures around 10 C in New Taipei City and Keelung City. It issued a yellow alert for temperatures dropping below 10 C in Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, Miaoli County, Kinmen County, and Lienchiang County, the latter of which could see temperatures below 6 C.Meteorologist Daniel Wu (吳德榮) said that as of 7:03 a.m. on Tuesday, the lowest temperature recorded in Taiwan's flat areas was 8.3 C in New Taipei City's Shimen District, followed by 9.6 C in Keelung City's Qidu District, 9.7 C in Taoyuan Citys Yangmei District, and 9.9 C in Hsinchu City's Hukou District.Wu said the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model shows northern Taiwan will see temperatures between 8 and 14 C, central Taiwan 10 to 20 C, southern Taiwan 13 to 27 C, and eastern Taiwan 10 to 24 C.On Wednesday (Feb. 15), conditions in western Taiwan will gradually become drier, but there will still be some brief rain in Greater Taipei and eastern Taiwan. On Thursday, the weather is expected to improve, with western Taiwan seeing partly cloudy to sunny skies, eastern Taiwan with cloudy skies, and occasional showers likely in the northeast.Temperatures on Wednesday and Thursday will continue to be cold, while Taipei weather station is likely to see 12 C. The lowest temperature in flat areas during this period could dip below 8 C.According to the model, Friday, Saturday (Feb. 18), and Sunday (Feb. 19) will see sunny and stable conditions. However, eastern Taiwan could see localized rains on Sunday.From Sunday evening to Tuesday (Feb. 21), another wave of cold air is expected to arrive in Taiwan, said Wu.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809424,From excessive pessimism to excessive optimism - Coface Barometer Q4 2022,"Hong Kong S.A.R -    Media OutReach - 14 February 2023 - The year 2023 starts with good news on the macroeconomic front. First, Europe has avoided a recession that looked long promised. Efficiency gains and the slowdown in activity have led to a sharp drop in energy prices and thus a welcome slowdown in inflation. Finally, the prospect of a rebound in China in the second half of the year, albeit very uncertain, also raises hopes for the global economy. This was enough for the financial markets to go wild, reassured by the fact that the worst-case scenario is for the time being, at bay.        While we fundamentally concur, we must be careful not to become complacent. The challenges facing the global economy last year remain relevant and the multidimensional crisis we are experiencing is not about to disappear: geopolitical fragmentation, the energy crisis, climate change, epidemic risks... The transformation of the world is accelerating and generating risks that could derail the best-crafted scenarios.   In this context, Coface's risk assessments have changed only slightly, with 5 changes for country risks and 16 changes for sector risks. In net terms, the trend remains towards downgrades.   Recession retreats, stagflation takes hold     2022 ended on a positive economic note. Mild temperatures and substantial gas reserves have removed the specter of forced rationing for Europe this winter and European economies should thus avoid a sharp contraction in activity. This has led Coface to keep its global growth forecast for 2023 unchanged at 1.9%. Our scenario of stagflation in the advanced economies and the overall resilience of the emerging countries has also been confirmed.                This continuity is reflected in our risk assessments: only 3 countries and 10 sectors are downgraded this quarter, after 95 in June 2022 and over 50 in October 2022. Meanwhile, Coface has also revised positively the assessments for India and Burundi, and six sector assessments, mainly in the automotive industry, thanks to the gradual easing of tensions in the supply chains.     Towards a (mechanical) decrease in inflation in the first half of 2023     While the surge in energy prices was at the root of the spike in consumer prices in the advanced economies, their moderation led to a mechanical decline in inflation by the end of 2022. Inflation thus seems to have passed its peak in the euro zone. This is also the case in the United States, where it reached 6.5% in December after peaking at 9.1%. Beyond the moderation of commodity prices, the fall in inflation is also attributable to the lower contribution of goods. The slowdown in inflation is expected to continue in the first half of 2023 simply due to base effects, insofar as commodity prices will remain below the levels recorded the previous year.      Against this backdrop of relative resistance in activity, labor markets continue to show resilience, with unemployment levels still historically low. The unemployment rate even continued to fall at the end of 2022 in the Eurozone, while remaining at its lowest level for over 50 years in the US (3.5%), and has risen only slightly (from 3.5% to 3.7%) in the UK. This resilience could continue in the first half of 2023: companies, having faced historically high recruitment difficulties in 2022, may be tempted to keep their employees in spite of sluggish demand, while waiting for activity to pick up.   Risks to the global economy remain   The outlook for the global economy remains bleak for 2023, in an environment that remains both risky and uncertain. The main source of concern is the inflation trajectory. While a disinflationary trend seems to be underway, the crucial question of its landing remains. The scenario of a return to the 2% target set by the central banks in the advanced countries has not been completely buried, but the possibility of inflation stabilizing at a higher level is looming. The disinflation expected in the first part of the year could be interrupted before it reaches the levels targeted by the monetary authorities, and a resurgence of inflation in the second half of the year cannot be excluded.   The recovery in China is also a source of uncertainty. The easing of restrictions against COVID-19 in the country should lead to a recovery in Chinese consumption. But, as the sudden reopening was accompanied by a surge in infections, the rebound should be gradual. The normalization of activity could thus start at the end of the first quarter of 2023 and a firmer recovery should take place in the second half of the year, creating the perfect conditions for a new storm on the energy front and, hence, on inflation.   Sector reclassifications are back   Our sectoral assessments have changed little compared to the last barometers. However, if there are few negative changes, we have also decided to make a few upgrades that reflect the relative improvement in our economic scenario. These upgrades are in the Middle East automotive sector, where demand remains strong. In India, the improvement in the country's economic situation has led to a reclassification of the country risk assessment.   Some companies in sectors previously considered resilient - ICT and pharmaceuticals - are also experiencing difficulties. The structural issues facing pharmaceutical companies in Europe are becoming more pronounced, partly as a result of increasing pressure on government finances. ICT companies are being ""caught up"" by the global economic situation and remain at the heart of the trade tensions between China and the United States.   Finally, Western Europe is once again the region with the highest number of sector downgrades (5 out of 11 in total). While the near-term outlook appears less bleak, it is clearly not yet time for upgrades.     Click here to download the full barometer   Hashtag: #Coface

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809427,International tech startups finding their way in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — International tech startups are finding their way into the Taiwan market with help from the non-profit startup incubator Garage+.Ken Law is the CEO of PowerArena, a Hong Kong-based company using AI to monitor tech and automotive production sites, and he participated in a Garage+ startup accelerator program in 2018. He said the eight-day program helped him build his list of business contacts from nothing to now employing about 20 people in Taiwan.Law recently joined Garage+ Director May Yang at the Startup Island Taiwan Podcast with host Uly Su to discuss the relevance of Taiwan to tech startups globally.Garage+ is the only overseas incubator partner of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence lab, according to Yang, and has facilitated more than 400 startups with 75% successfully securing funding. Yang said that the main goal of the startup accelerator programs is to support entrepreneurs to discover businesses, investors, and markets in Asia.During the eight-day course, Garage+ arranges one on one meetings between business partners, investors, and entrepreneurs. “We think (that’s) a very efficient way for startups to directly talk with their potential partners, buyers, or investors,” Yang said.She said for Law, his one-week program saw him attending 14 one on one meetings. “It was very intensive,” Yang said.After the course is complete, Yang said Garage+ continues to provide startups with support they need to gain a foothold in Taiwan. When Law recruited his first staff in Taiwan, they were able to work at Garage+ headquarters free for three months, a perk offered to all of the programs’ participants.Garage+ also provides extra exposure for startups after the program is over, said Yang. “When we held our MIT bi-annual symposium in 2019, our topic was related to AI, so we invited (Law) to speak and share his business in front of three hundred corporations and top executives,” she said.Law said he has joined many startup accelerator programs, but that the Garage+ program was useful because of the focus on building connections rather than just raising funds. “I think sometimes there are things that are more important than money, (such as) important business relationships, and I think Garage+ helped us a lot with that aspect.”",2023/02/14,891,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809436,Japan manages growth in final quarter as tourism returns,"TOKYO (AP) — The Japanese economy grew at an annual pace of 0.6% in October-December, the government reported Tuesday, managing to eke out growth after a contraction in the previous quarter. 

            The world’s third-largest economy has struggled amid restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic, a shortage of imported parts from China and rising prices — especially energy — worsened by inflationary pressures and the war in Ukraine. 

            But the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, both abroad and in Japan, has helped a recovery in tourism and other economic activity. 











            The Cabinet Office reported the economy grew 0.2% in the last quarter, compared with July-September, when it contracted 0.3%. It grew 1.1% in April-June. 

            For the whole year of 2022, the seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the value of goods and services a nation produces, grew 1.1% from the year before. 

            Both household consumer demand and government spending grew in the final quarter of last year. Exports grew but imports fell, data showed. The numbers suggest a gradual economic rebound. 

            In October, Japan eased its tough restrictions on inbound travel, imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19. Optimism has been growing about a return to normal. 

            Wage increases have been slow to come, despite recent signs of growing inflation even in deflation-prone Japan.

            “Japan saw moderate growth,” said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior economist at SuMi TRUST, noting consumer services got a boost from increasing domestic travel and tourism. “Exports were resilient, reflecting the easing of supply constraints on automotive-related goods and moves to restore inventories overseas.” 

            The weakening yen tends to help growth, as it boosts the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters when they are converted into yen. The yen’s weakening reversed course somewhat in the last quarter, helping to alleviate the burden of soaring costs for imports. 

            The yen sank to about 150 yen to the dollar last year, but has recently been trading at about 130 yen. 

            As inflation stabilizes in the U.S. and Europe, price increases are expected to ease in Japan.

            “I miss you,” Peter Jerving's brother, Drew, said during the funeral at Elmbrook Church in Brookfield. “And for all of those who now stand watch on Earth in your place, I salute you.”

            The 37-year-old officer was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire early Feb. 7. The suspect also died from a gunshot wound, police said.











            The officer's mother asked God to bless Milwaukee police officers and their families and asked them to forgive the man who killed her son.

            “I ask for you to wipe away any bitterness they may have in their hearts toward the young man that cut down Peter,” Patty Jerving said. “I also ask for you to please bless the family of that young man and especially his mother. She also lost a son on Feb. 7. Please, please help them to see that Peter was not their enemy, nor am I.”

            Jerving’s father, Doug, told officers to grieve his son, “but then when your grieving is over, get up, wash your face and put on your uniform of your chosen profession.”

            Miles of police vehicles joined the funeral procession for Jerving to his burial site in Wisconsin Memorial Park.

            On the day of the shooting, Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said the suspect ignored officers' commands and fled on foot after they arrived at the robbery scene about 1:15 a.m. on the city's south side. Jerving then caught up with the suspect, a struggle ensued and both men fired their weapons. 

            Jerving, died at a hospital, Norman said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809440,Irving debuts in Dallas not wanting to talk about future,"DALLAS (AP) — Kyrie Irving isn’t interested in talking about what his long-term future could be with the Dallas Mavericks, and he doesn’t understand why people don’t think he can play well off the ball.

            “All I know, this is really playing basketball with a lot of high-level, high-IQ players and making it work,” Irving said before his first home game Monday with the Mavericks and All-Star teammate Luka Doncic. “Every single time I step foot out there, I get a chance to prove it to myself that I can play with anybody and everybody and still be efficient and be myself.”

            Irving’s home debut in Dallas came a week after the blockbuster deal became official to bring the potential free agent from the Brooklyn Nets. The Mavericks lost 124-121 to the Minnesota Timberwolves, who held on even as Irving scored 26 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter. 











            The first three games for Irving with the Mavs were on the road, and he played with Doncic for the first time Saturday night — Irving had 28 points and Doncic 27 in an overtime loss at Sacramento. Doncic had 33 points against Minnesota.

            As for what happens after this season, the talented and enigmatic eight-time All-Star said that question constantly getting asked just puts unwanted distractions on him and the team.

            “I’ve dealt with it before and it’s very emotionally draining to ask questions about what’s the long term,” Irving said. “What the future holds is really only going to be dictated on what I do right now, and how I prepare for those next steps, and that’s being the best teammate that I can in that locker room and a great leader out here, I think within the Dallas community. ... So we’re just putting that to bed and just focus on what we have ahead as a team.”

            The Mavericks, with 23 games remaining, are part of a crowded mix for a playoff spot. They are tied for fifth in the Western Conference, only 2 1/2 games ahead of 11th place — the first spot left out of the postseason.

            When Dallas general manager Nico Harrison was asked his response to people who viewed the acquisition of Irving and his expiring contract as a risk, the former Nike executive, who already had a relationship with the player, said that wasn’t the case.

            “I don’t see any risk involved at all. I’ve known Kyrie for a long time, I know his core, I know what what type of person is. I think anybody who’s ever watched him play basketball knows the type of basketball player he is,” Harrison said. “So I don’t see risk. I actually see a risk in not doing it.”

            Irving smiled and responded, “touché,” then adding that he appreciated their relationship and that it was now up to him to prove it “and control what I can control.”

            
                Dallas also got Markieff Morris in the trade that sent Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 2029 first-round pick and two second-round choices to the Nets.

            Irving had a relationship with Nike for the entirety of his NBA career until earlier this season, when the sneaker giant dropped him — and canceled the planned release of his next signature shoe just before it came out — after Irving tweeted a link to an antisemitic film.

            “I would love to be well-liked by everybody. ... Oh, that’s just not it. That’s just not for I think anyone in this room,” Irving said. “But the genuine love that you have in your heart is the only thing that you can really control. I have open dialogue with everybody that spends time with me, wants to have conversation, wants to ask me questions.”

            For those who don’t like him, he said he wishes them well.

            “But I have a life to live and I have kids to raise,” he said. “So I don’t really have the energy to sit and focus on things I can’t control.”

            Joens completed a three-point play with 2:37 left to give Iowa State a 61-55 lead, but she missed two free throws at 1:45 and Texas took advantage when Rori Harmon sank a baseline jumper to make it 61-57. Iowa State had two chances at the other end following an offensive rebound and Denae Fritz made a 3-pointer from the corner for a seven-point lead. Joens added two free throws with 14.2 seconds left to seal it.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809442,"Miller, Pack lead No. 15 Miami to win at North Carolina","CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) — Miami coach Jim Larrañaga went into halftime Monday night knowing his 15th-ranked Hurricanes couldn't keep letting North Carolina attack off the dribble and get to the rim.

            So the Hurricanes turned an opponent that struggles from 3-point range into a jump-shooting team.

            Jordan Miller and Nijel Pack combined for 47 points to lead the offense, while the Hurrricanes' second-half shutdown of driving lanes helped Miami beat UNC 80-72 to stay at the top of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title chase.











            Miller had 24 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Hurricanes (21-5, 12-4), who led 35-34 at halftime but shot 52% after the break to take control and build a 14-point lead. Yet it was more about Miami's defense, which closed off the avenues that had helped the Tar Heels (16-10, 8-7) score 26 points in the paint before the break.

            The Hurricanes hedged even harder on screens after halftime to drive UNC ballhandlers farther from the basket and take that away. UNC managed just 14 points in the paint after halftime.

            “They were making layups on us,” Larrañaga said. “We had to take that away. The guys did a great job of doing that. Again, when you fall behind, oftentimes that leads to teams looking for 3s.""

            And UNC wasn't up to the challenge of making them. The Tar Heels came in ranked 14th of 15 league teams in 3-point percentage (31.4%) and made just 5 of 31 attempts from behind the arc.

            “In the second half, we tried to do (attack) and they just did a better job of closing down that paint,” UNC coach Hubert Davis said. ""The only way that you can open that up is to make some perimeter jump shots, and we just weren't able to do it.”

            R.J. Davis scored 23 points while Caleb Love had 20 for the Tar Heels, who trailed by 11 in the final 2 1/2 minutes before making a frantic comeback. UNC got within 73-69 on Love’s 3-pointer with 34.9 seconds left, but the Hurricanes made 11 of 14 free throws in the last 63 seconds to stay in control.

            BIG PICTURE

            Miami: The Hurricanes entered with four straight wins including a 32-point romp against Duke at home. That run had pushed Miami to within a game in the loss column of Pittsburgh and No. 7 Virginia for the league lead. Now they have a fifth road win in ACC play.

            UNC: The Tar Heels have had a strange journey from preseason No. 1-ranked team with four starters back from last year's unexpected ride to the NCAA title game to unranked and working to shore up their NCAA Tournament resume in mid-February. After a humbling loss at Wake Forest, the Tar Heels responded with a spirited effort to beat Clemson on Saturday — only to squander this chance to help their postseason resume. 

            “We all know, everybody in the building knows what's at stake,” said big man Armando Bacot, who had 12 points and sat with four fouls for a key second-half stretch.

            NIFTY MOVES

            Miller scored at least four times inside against different defenders with the same move: turning toward the middle in the paint with a pump fake and then spinning back toward the baseline to get a step under a defender for a layup.

            Larrañaga chuckled when Miller was asked about repeatedly using the same move successfully.

            “It's definitely something I practice, but it's also what the defense gives me,” Miller said. “I just like getting in the paint and taking my time, seeing what's there, whether a score, an assist, whatever it is. And I love the pump-fake — I do, I really do.”

            UP NEXT

            Miami: Hosting Wake Forest on Saturday.

(AP) — Miami coach Jim Larrañaga went into halftime Monday night knowing his 15th-ranked Hurricanes couldn't keep letting North Carolina attack off the dribble and get to the rim.So the Hurricanes turned an opponent that struggles from 3-point range into a jump-shooting team.Jordan Miller and Nijel Pack combined for 47 points to lead the offense, while the Hurrricanes' second-half shutdown of driving lanes helped Miami beat UNC 80-72 to stay at the top of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title chase.Miller had 24 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Hurricanes (21-5, 12-4), who led 35-34 at halftime but shot 52% after the break to take control and build a 14-point lead. Yet it was more about Miami's defense, which closed off the avenues that had helped the Tar Heels (16-10, 8-7) score 26 points in the paint before the break.The Hurricanes hedged even harder on screens after halftime to drive UNC ballhandlers farther from the basket and take that away. UNC managed just 14 points in the paint after halftime.“They were making layups on us,” Larrañaga said. “We had to take that away. The guys did a great job of doing that. Again, when you fall behind, oftentimes that leads to teams looking for 3s.""And UNC wasn't up to the challenge of making them. The Tar Heels came in ranked 14th of 15 league teams in 3-point percentage (31.4%) and made just 5 of 31 attempts from behind the arc.“In the second half, we tried to do (attack) and they just did a better job of closing down that paint,” UNC coach Hubert Davis said. ""The only way that you can open that up is to make some perimeter jump shots, and we just weren't able to do it.”R.J. Davis scored 23 points while Caleb Love had 20 for the Tar Heels, who trailed by 11 in the final 2 1/2 minutes before making a frantic comeback. UNC got within 73-69 on Love’s 3-pointer with 34.9 seconds left, but the Hurricanes made 11 of 14 free throws in the last 63 seconds to stay in control.BIG PICTUREMiami: The Hurricanes entered with four straight wins including a 32-point romp against Duke at home. That run had pushed Miami to within a game in the loss column of Pittsburgh and No. 7 Virginia for the league lead. Now they have a fifth road win in ACC play.UNC: The Tar Heels have had a strange journey from preseason No. 1-ranked team with four starters back from last year's unexpected ride to the NCAA title game to unranked and working to shore up their NCAA Tournament resume in mid-February. After a humbling loss at Wake Forest, the Tar Heels responded with a spirited effort to beat Clemson on Saturday — only to squander this chance to help their postseason resume.“We all know, everybody in the building knows what's at stake,” said big man Armando Bacot, who had 12 points and sat with four fouls for a key second-half stretch.NIFTY MOVESMiller scored at least four times inside against different defenders with the same move: turning toward the middle in the paint with a pump fake and then spinning back toward the baseline to get a step under a defender for a layup.Larrañaga chuckled when Miller was asked about repeatedly using the same move successfully.“It's definitely something I practice, but it's also what the defense gives me,” Miller said. “I just like getting in the paint and taking my time, seeing what's there, whether a score, an assist, whatever it is. And I love the pump-fake — I do, I really do.”UP NEXTMiami: Hosting Wake Forest on Saturday.UNC: At No. 23 North Carolina State on Sunday.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/14,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809449,Sin Kang TCM Singapore Expands Its Outlets Islandwide,"Trusted by many with a wealth of experience accumulated over its two decades of operations, Sin Kang TCM Clinic plans to expand to 8 clinics islandwide by the end of 2023. 

SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 14 February 2023 - With health and wellness at the forefront of the public consciousness,  Sin Kang TCM is proud to announce that it will expand up to 8 clinics islandwide by the end of 2023, with a new outlet having opened just at the end of 2022 in the bustling heart of Orchard. The other locations will be established by the end of 2023, creating greater accessibility to the reliable and trustworthy service that Sin Kang TCM Clinic has come to be regarded as.            A Renewed Interest In Healthcare   Recently, there has been a significant rise in the public’s efforts to maintain good health. This comes in the wake of the preventive mindsets that the public has adopted to guard themselves against the spread of Covid-19. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has proven reliable and effective for improving overall health and wellness. With a history dating back over a thousand years, TCM has stood the test of time as a valuable means of promoting wellness. As such, Sin Kang TCM’s management believed it was time to expand their services to be more accessible throughout Singapore so that more people could benefit from the time-honoured practices of TCM and experience its efficacy for themselves.   Suite of Specialised Offerings    Understanding the importance of a thorough diagnosis to address their clients' health concerns effectively, Sin Kang TCM only takes a prescriptive approach that privileges proper consultation first. Furthermore, Sin Kang TCM  offers a whole suite of specialised health treatments and services to promote wellness for its clientele. Take its prescribed massage, for instance. Unlike regular massages, a licensed medical practitioner from Sin Kang TCM will carefully customise and prescribe the necessary massage techniques required to stimulate specific acupressure points,  lymphatic system, and meridian channels. The result is a range of benefits, including  slimming, improved sleep, and  pain management/relief. What's more, Sin Kang TCM plays host to a team of licensed TCM physicians and experienced therapists who also provide consultation and therapy services. These clinics have also incorporated modern elements such as hospital–grade curtains and ventilation systems to set them apart from traditional TCM clinics and enhance the patient experience, ensuring the best possible outcomes for their clientele.   Prevention is Better than Cure   TCM should be considered a complementary treatment to any existing solutions, and not a replacement of Western Medicine, as the two fields can exist concurrently in improving the health of its patients. At its core, TCM takes a proactive approach to healthcare. It is through the understanding that when it comes to matters of health, it is better to address and solve any issues before the troubles compound and get worse. Sin Kang TCM strives to empower its clientele to proactively maintain their health and well-being with the same mindset. With the pending expansion, Sin Kang TCM expects that more of the public will be able to experience the effectiveness and benefits of TCM firsthand with the increased accessibility.

Most of the catch purchased consisted of narrow-barred Spanish mackerel and grouper.However, what caught her eye was a rare albino giant grouper with the hook from the longline still in its mouth. The fishmonger told the news agency that although she has been selling fish for decades, this was the first time she had seen an albino of that species.She said that once she put it up for sale, it immediately attracted everyone's attention in the fish market. She described it as having a snow-white body and weighing 14 kg.Ultimately, she said that a seafood connoisseur bought the fish for a price of NT$500 per kilogram, which amounted to NT$7,000 in total. The customer reportedly looked forward to feasting on the fish as a ""special treat.""Hsieh Heng-i (謝恆毅), the director of the Penghu Marine Biology Research Center, told the news agency that giant groupers generally have black and brown spots, but the white one caught by fishermen is still edible.Hsieh said that albino giant groupers are quite rare, and it may be caused by a genetic mutation or the environment. Generally speaking, Hsieh said that there would only be one such albino out of hundreds of thousands of fish from a given species.He said that the cause of albinism in fish is not yet fully understood and more research is needed.(CNA photo)",2023/02/14,5833,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809473,"Experts found Chilean poet Neruda was poisoned, nephew says","SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Forensic experts have determined that Chilean poet Pablo Neruda died of poisoning nearly 50 years ago, a family member of the Nobel Prize winner said Monday.

            The revelation by Rodolfo Reyes, a Neruda nephew, is the latest turn in one of the great debates of post-coup Chile. The long-stated official position has been that Neruda died of complications from prostate cancer, but the poet's driver argued for decades that he was poisoned. 

            There was no confirmation of Reyes' comments from forensic experts from Canada, Denmark and Chile who are scheduled to publicly release a report Wednesday on the cause of Neruda's death.











            The public release of the group's finding has been delayed twice this year, first due to internet connectivity issues of one of the experts and then again because a judge said the panel had yet to reach a consensus.

            International forensics experts several years ago rejected the official cause of death as cachexia, or weakness and wasting of the body due to chronic illness — in this case cancer. But at that time they said they had not determined what did kill Neruda.

            In an interview with The Associated Press, Reyes said forensic tests carried out in Danish and Canadian labs indicated a presence of “a great quantity of Cloristridium botulinum, which is incompatible with human life.” The powerful toxin can cause paralysis in the nervous system and death.

            Reyes first revealed the information to the Spanish news agency EFE earlier Monday.

            As a lawyer in the judicial case over his uncle’s death, Reyes said he has access to the forensic report, which was carried out after the same group of experts said in 2017 that there were indications of a toxin in the late poet’s bones and a molar. 

            The lab tests concluded that the toxin was administered when the poet was alive, Reyes said.

            The report is set to be released almost 50 years after the death of the poet and Communist Party member and 12 years after the start of a judicial investigation into whether he was poisoned, as his driver Manuel Araya maintains.

            Araya told AP earlier this month he was confident that the forensic findings would support his assertion the poet died after being given “an injection in the stomach” at the clinic where he was hospitalized. Araya said he first heard that version of events from a nurse.

            Neruda, who was 69 and suffering from prostate cancer, died in the chaos that followed Chile’s Sept. 11, 1973, coup that overthrew President Salvador Allende and put Gen. Augusto Pinochet in power.

            Neruda’s body was exhumed in 2013 to determine the cause of his death but those tests showed no toxic agents or poisons in his bone. His family and driver demanded further investigation.

            In 2015, Chile’s government said it was “highly probable that a third party” was responsible for Neruda's death. Neruda was reburied in his favorite home overlooking the Pacific Coast last year.

            In 2017, a team of international scientists determined that Neruda did not die of cancer or malnutrition, rejecting the official cause of death but not saying what he did die of. 

            “The fundamental conclusions are the invalidity of the death certificate when it comes to cachexia as a cause of death,” Aurelio Luna, one of the panel’s experts, said at that time. “We still can’t exclude nor affirm the natural or violent cause of Pablo Neruda’s death.”

            Neruda, who was best known for his love poems, was a friend of Allende, who killed himself rather than surrender to troops during the coup led by Pinochet.

            Neruda was traumatized by the military takeover and the persecution and killing of his friends. He planned to go into exile, where he would have been an influential voice against the dictatorship.

            But a day before his planned departure, he was taken by ambulance to a clinic in Chile's capital of Santiago where he had been treated for cancer and other ailments. Neruda officially died there Sept. 23, 1973, from natural causes. 

            But suspicions that the dictatorship had a hand in the death remained long after Chile returned to democracy in 1990.

            The former Mexican ambassador to Chile at the time of the bloody military coup, Gonzalo Martínez Corbalá, told AP on two occasions that he saw Neruda the day before his death and that his body weight was close to 100 kilos (220 pounds). Martínez spoke to AP by phone in 2017, a few days before his death.

            Araya told AP last month he still thinks that if Neruda “hadn’t been left alone in the clinic, they wouldn’t have killed him.”

            He recalled that on Neruda’s instructions, on Sunday, Sept. 23, the poet’s wife, Matilde Urrutia, and he were at the mansion to pick up the suitcases that would be taken to Mexico the following day. In the middle of the afternoon Neruda asked them to come back quickly. He died that same night.

            During his life, Neruda accumulated dozens of prizes, including the 1971 Nobel Prize for Literature, but in recent years criticism has appeared from feminist groups over a rape he committed in the 1930s and which he recounted in his book “I Confess That I Have Lived.” He also is criticized for abandoning his only daughter, Malva Marina, because she was born with hydrocephalus.SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Forensic experts have determined that Chilean poet Pablo Neruda died of poisoning nearly 50 years ago, a family member of the Nobel Prize winner said Monday.The revelation by Rodolfo Reyes, a Neruda nephew, is the latest turn in one of the great debates of post-coup Chile.

But at that time they said they had not determined what did kill Neruda.In an interview with The Associated Press, Reyes said forensic tests carried out in Danish and Canadian labs indicated a presence of “a great quantity of Cloristridium botulinum, which is incompatible with human life.” The powerful toxin can cause paralysis in the nervous system and death.Reyes first revealed the information to the Spanish news agency EFE earlier Monday.As a lawyer in the judicial case over his uncle’s death, Reyes said he has access to the forensic report, which was carried out after the same group of experts said in 2017 that there were indications of a toxin in the late poet’s bones and a molar.The lab tests concluded that the toxin was administered when the poet was alive, Reyes said.The report is set to be released almost 50 years after the death of the poet and Communist Party member and 12 years after the start of a judicial investigation into whether he was poisoned, as his driver Manuel Araya maintains.Araya told AP earlier this month he was confident that the forensic findings would support his assertion the poet died after being given “an injection in the stomach” at the clinic where he was hospitalized. Araya said he first heard that version of events from a nurse.Neruda, who was 69 and suffering from prostate cancer, died in the chaos that followed Chile’s Sept. 11, 1973, coup that overthrew President Salvador Allende and put Gen. Augusto Pinochet in power.Neruda’s body was exhumed in 2013 to determine the cause of his death but those tests showed no toxic agents or poisons in his bone. His family and driver demanded further investigation.In 2015, Chile’s government said it was “highly probable that a third party” was responsible for Neruda's death. Neruda was reburied in his favorite home overlooking the Pacific Coast last year.In 2017, a team of international scientists determined that Neruda did not die of cancer or malnutrition, rejecting the official cause of death but not saying what he did die of.“The fundamental conclusions are the invalidity of the death certificate when it comes to cachexia as a cause of death,” Aurelio Luna, one of the panel’s experts, said at that time. “We still can’t exclude nor affirm the natural or violent cause of Pablo Neruda’s death.”Neruda, who was best known for his love poems, was a friend of Allende, who killed himself rather than surrender to troops during the coup led by Pinochet.Neruda was traumatized by the military takeover and the persecution and killing of his friends. He planned to go into exile, where he would have been an influential voice against the dictatorship.But a day before his planned departure, he was taken by ambulance to a clinic in Chile's capital of Santiago where he had been treated for cancer and other ailments. Neruda officially died there Sept. 23, 1973, from natural causes.But suspicions that the dictatorship had a hand in the death remained long after Chile returned to democracy in 1990.The former Mexican ambassador to Chile at the time of the bloody military coup, Gonzalo Martínez Corbalá, told AP on two occasions that he saw Neruda the day before his death and that his body weight was close to 100 kilos (220 pounds). Martínez spoke to AP by phone in 2017, a few days before his death.Araya told AP last month he still thinks that if Neruda “hadn’t been left alone in the clinic, they wouldn’t have killed him.”He recalled that on Neruda’s instructions, on Sunday, Sept. 23, the poet’s wife, Matilde Urrutia, and he were at the mansion to pick up the suitcases that would be taken to Mexico the following day. In the middle of the afternoon Neruda asked them to come back quickly. He died that same night.During his life, Neruda accumulated dozens of prizes, including the 1971 Nobel Prize for Literature, but in recent years criticism has appeared from feminist groups over a rape he committed in the 1930s and which he recounted in his book “I Confess That I Have Lived.” He also is criticized for abandoning his only daughter, Malva Marina, because she was born with hydrocephalus.",2023/02/14,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809474,Hypothermia death exposes hole in Fairbanks' homeless care,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The case of a homeless man who froze to death in Alaska’s second-largest city of Fairbanks has exposed a hole in the safety net of care provided to a vulnerable population in one of the coldest places in the country.

            The city has no low-barrier shelter to provide help and a warm place to stay on an unconditional basis.

            The body of Charles Ahkiviana, 55, was discovered frozen in a snowbank near a busy department store, the Anchorage Daily News reported.











            The day his body was found, two days before Christmas, it was minus 32 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 35 degrees Celsius) and at one point, the wind chill was minus 54 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 47 Celsius). Ahkiviana died of hypothermia, Alaska State Troopers said.

            Among U.S. cities with 25,000 or more people, Fairbanks — with a population of about 32,500 — is the coldest in the nation, said Rick Thoman, a climate expert at the International Arctic Research Center.

            Ahkiviana’s death was a moment for community reflection, and for “fury and shame,” Jennifer Jolis, the former director of a soup kitchen, wrote in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.

            It’s estimated there are up to 100 people who are homeless in Fairbanks, where activists say a caring, creative community helps those in need.

            However, the city lacks a low-barrier emergency shelter, a place that consistently and unconditionally offers an open door and a warm cot. That leaves those who are homeless to walk the streets at night, crowd into motel rooms 10 at a time and sleep in abandoned houses, cars or even dig snow caves.

            The Fairbanks Rescue Mission is the largest provider of emergency shelter in Fairbanks. It can house up to 200 people in an emergency, and about 90 people, including women and families with children, were there on a recent night, said John Coghill, a former state lawmaker who runs the day-to-day operations at the mission.

            However, the mission requires that a person pass a breathalyzer test and submit to a urinalysis for drugs to enter, leaving some to say it’s not sheltering the people who need help the most. 

            The mission’s clients are expected to move through a structured program toward self-sufficiency.

            “If you’re willing to help yourself, we’re willing to help you,” said Pete Kelly, the executive director and another former state lawmaker.

            The rules are necessary because the shelter needs to be an orderly, secure place, especially for people newly in recovery. 

            The mission can’t help everyone, Kelly and Coghill said.

            “We have been criticized because there’s a level of mental illness that we just can’t take care of,” Kelly said.

            Advocates say the mission does important work, but it shouldn’t be the only option and a low-barrier shelter is needed. In Anchorage, the city-owned Sullivan Arena has been turned into such a facility.

            “I really wish that we had something like that here,” said Lynda Purvis, a case manager with the Tanana Chiefs Conference, a consortium of 42 Athabascan tribes in Interior Alaska that among its responsibilities is providing health and social service needs for tribal members. “Somewhere you could throw cots down, give you something warm to drink and just get out of the cold.”

            About 100 people showed up for apricot oatmeal one recent morning at the Stone Soup Café, a grassroots soup kitchen in Fairbanks. Besides oatmeal, lentil stew and pork chops were available for carry out. 

            The philosophy of The Bread Line, which operates Stone Soup Cafe, is to offer a come-as-you-are place, with minimal rules. It also offers a place to be indoors for the two hours every morning it’s open.

            Ahkiviana’s death may have momentarily raised community consciousness about the lack of shelter, but Matt Davis, a longtime cook at the Stone Soup Café, wondered if it would last long enough for action.

            He said concerns with the adequacy of shelter are brought to local governments. “And every time we do, it’s, ‘Well, we have a rescue mission,’” he said.

            Kenneth Cooper said he’s no longer welcome at the mission and at times will stay with friends. He doesn’t like to stay more than a night at a time, however.

            During the coldest weather, he will sometimes make a shelter by burrowing into a snowbank, just big enough for himself. He runs a PVC pipe through the snow to create a vent and burns a candle for heat. Other times, he will nurse a cup of coffee at the city’s only diner open all night.

            Brynn Butler, the city’s housing director who was once homeless herself, senses there’s momentum for change. She doesn’t see Fairbanks opening a low-barrier shelter like Anchorage but said they could develop a cold-weather plan that might allow it to activate emergency shelters in extreme weather.

            If a funding source could be secured, a site located and workers hired, she says it could become a reality, maybe by next winter.

            “That’s my hope,” she said.ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The case of a homeless man who froze to death in Alaska’s second-largest city of Fairbanks has exposed a hole in the safety net of care provided to a vulnerable population in one of the coldest places in the country.The city has no low-barrier shelter to provide help and a warm place to stay on an unconditional basis.The body of Charles Ahkiviana, 55, was discovered frozen in a snowbank near a busy department store, the Anchorage Daily News reported.The day his body was found, two days before Christmas, it was minus 32 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 35 degrees Celsius) and at one point, the wind chill was minus 54 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 47 Celsius).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809475,Mexico softens plan to ban imports of US GM feed corn,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico appeared to have backed down Monday on plans to ban imports of U.S. genetically modified corn for animal feed. 

            Mexico’s Economy Department said a new decree on the issue was published Monday that drops any date for substituting imports of GM feed corn. Some imported corn is also ground into meal for use in corn chips or other snacks. 

            After a previous decree, some U.S. growers worried a GM feed corn ban could happen as soon as 2024 or 2025. Mexico argued that GM corn could represent a health risk, but has presented no evidence so far.











            U.S. farmers have worried about the potential loss of the single biggest export market for U.S. corn. Mexico has been importing GM feed corn from the U.S. for years, buying about $3 billion worth annually.

            The new decree still says Mexican authorities will carry out “the gradual substitution” of GM feed and milled corn, but sets no date for doing so and says potential health issues will be the subject of study by Mexican experts “with health authorities from other countries.”

            “Regarding the use of genetically modified corn for animal feed and industrial use, the date for prohibiting its use has been eliminated,” the Economy Department said in the statement. “Working groups will be set up with the domestic and international private sector to achieve an orderly transition.”

            Mexico was where corn was first domesticated starting around 9,000 years ago, and the country will still ban imports of GM seed corn to protect native varieties.

            Mexico will also prohibit the use of GM corn for direct human consumption, which in Mexico consists mainly of fresh white corn and white corn tortilla flour. Mexico has no need to import white corn from the United States, where most corn is yellow or sweet corn. 

            The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Mexico's earlier position was “not grounded in science” and “threatens to disrupt billions of dollars in bilateral agricultural trade, cause serious economic harm to U.S. farmers and Mexican livestock producers.”

            The U.S. trade office did not respond to requests for comment on the revised decree published Monday.

            There had been fears the ban could violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. Mexico hopes to stave off a full-fledged trade complaint under the agreement on the corn issue as well as a dispute over Mexico’s energy sector. 

            The United States says Mexico is unfairly favoring its state-owned electricity and oil companies over American competitors and clean-energy suppliers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809476,3 people killed at Michigan State University; gunman dead,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A gunman opened fire Monday night at Michigan State University, killing three people and wounding five more, before fatally shooting himself miles away after an hours-long manhunt that forced frightened students to hide in the dark.

            Police announced the man's death early Tuesday, four hours after shootings broke out at Berkey Hall, an academic building, and later nearby at the MSU Union, a popular hub to eat or study.

            “This truly has been a nightmare we’re living tonight,” said Chris Rozman, interim deputy chief of the campus police department.











            Hundreds of officers had scoured the East Lansing campus, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, for the suspect, whom police described as a short Black man with red shoes, a jean jacket and a ball cap.

            The 43-year-old man was confronted by police off campus before killing himself with a ""self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" Rozman said. 

            His name was not immediately released, nor any details about the gun or what police found at the scene. Rozman said the man was not a student or employee and had no affiliation with Michigan State.

            “We have no idea why he came to campus to do this tonight. That is part of our ongoing investigation,” the deputy chief said.

            The shooting at Michigan State is the latest in what has become a deadly new year in the U.S. Dozens of people have died in mass shootings so far in 2023, most notably in California where 11 people were killed as they welcomed the Lunar New Year at a dance hall popular with older Asian Americans.

            In 2022, there were more than 600 mass shootings in the U.S. in which at least four people were killed or injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive. 

            “This is a uniquely American problem,"" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lamented. 

            Rozman said two people were killed at Berkey and another was killed at the MSU Union, while five people were in critical condition at Sparrow Hospital.

            By 10:15 p.m., police said Berkey, as well as nearby residence halls, were secured.

            Ted Zimbo said he was walking to his residence hall when he encountered a woman with a “ton of blood on her.”

            “She told me, ‘Someone came in our classroom and started shooting,’” Zimbo told The Associated Press. “Her hands were completely covered in blood. It was on her pants and her shoes. She said, ‘It’s my friend’s blood.’”

            Zimbo said the woman left to find a friend’s car while he returned to his SUV in a parking deck and threw a blanket over himself to hide for three hours.

            Ryan Kunkel, 22, was attending a class in the Engineering Building when he became aware of the shooting from a university email. Kunkel and about 13 other students turned off the lights and acted like there “was a shooter right outside the door,” he said. 

            “Nothing came out of anyone’s mouth” for over four hours, he said.

            “I wasn’t ready to accept that this is really going on next door, like right next to me. It’s on my campus,” Kunkel said. “This is supposed to be a place where I’m coming, learning and bettering myself. And instead, students are getting hurt.”

            Before the gunman was found dead, WDIV-TV meteorologist Kim Adams, whose daughter attends Michigan State, told viewers that students were worn down by the hourslong saga.

            “They’ve been hiding, all the lights off in a dark room,” Adams said. 

            Aedan Kelley, a junior who lives a half-mile (less than a kilometer) east of campus, said he locked his doors and covered his windows “just in case.” Sirens were constant, and a helicopter hovered overhead.

            “It’s all very frightening,” Kelley said. “And then I have all these people texting me wondering if I’m OK, which is overwhelming.”

            Michigan State has about 50,000 students, including 19,000 who live on campus. All classes, sports and other activities were canceled for 48 hours.

            Interim university President Teresa Woodruff said it would be a time “to think and grieve and come together.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809477,"Harden scores 29 to help 76ers throttle Rockets, 123-104","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — James Harden had 29 points and 10 assists against his former team while Tyrese Maxey scored 26 off the bench as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Houston Rockets 123-104 on Monday night.

            Joel Embiid scored 23 points in 31 minutes for the Sixers, who have won three in a row and improved to 22-8 at home.

            “Once you hit shots and make 3s, it kind of opens up everything,” said Maxey, who is averaging 16 points and 28.6 minutes in 15 games since being placed in a reserve role. 











            Jalen Green scored 29 points for the Rockets, who have lost six straight to fall to a league-worst 13-44. KJ Martin added 15 for Houston.

            “To me, it's about being more decisive and trying to make the play instead of reading the play,"" Rockets coach Steven Silas said. “We have to do a better job of that.”

            It was Harden's fifth game against the Rockets since he forced a trade with Brooklyn at the beginning of the 2020-21 season. Harden had played nine seasons with Houston, winning three scoring titles and the 2017-18 MVP award. In those five games, Harden is averaging 24.2 points. nine assists and seven rebounds. Harden now has 218 games in which he's scored at least 20 points and recorded 10 or more assists. 

            Harden declined to speak to reporters after the game. 

            The Sixers controlled the action from the outside, shooting 15 for 34 (44.3%) from beyond the arc while holding the Rockets to 6 for 24 (25%) from 3-point range. Maxey helped kick-start an 18-3 fourth-quarter scoring run that stretched Philadelphia's lead to 26 points.

            “I feel like I've fixed my spirit, talked to my people and back in the space of having fun,” Maxey said. “That's what helps me help my teammates. The spirit is contagious when I am out there, having fun and being energetic. And I think it helps my teammates as well.”

            Houston entered the game as the second-worst 3-point shooting team in the NBA, converting only 32.8% from beyond the arc.

            “We don't have a way to do kick-out 3s and guys are feeling pressure when they are trying to shoot 3s, it seems,” Silas said. “Shot creation is what I'm most concerned about.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809478,Mitchell scores 41 as Cavs hand Spurs 13th straight loss,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell scored 41 points and led the Cleveland Cavaliers to their seventh straight win, 117-109 on Monday night over the nose-diving San Antonio Spurs, who matched a team record with their 13th consecutive loss.

            Mitchell made five 3-pointers and scored 23 in the first half, helping the Cavs build an 18-point lead. Cleveland's advantage grew to 21, but the Spurs fought back and got within four in the fourth before fading.

            Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff was not happy with his team's performance.











            “We didn't play to our standard, it's that simple,” he said. “We didn't do the things we needed to to do at the level we're used to doing them at. We got lucky to get away with a win. We've been better in these moments, tonight just wasn't our best.”

            San Antonio’s slide equals the longest in club history. The Spurs also lost 13 straight during the 1988-89 season. Coincidentally, that streak also reached 13 with a loss at Cleveland on March 2, 1989.

            “We played a hell of a team,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""They play really strong defense, which is going to suit them well in the playoffs. There is no magic (solution) out there. We played the right way for three quarters. I’m really proud of our guys.”

            Voted an Eastern Conference starter for this week's All-Star Game in Salt Lake City, where he spent five seasons with the Jazz, Mitchell, who sat out last year's event in Cleveland due to an illness, finished 16 of 26 from the field.

            Like his coach, Mitchell didn't like the way the Cavs played.

            “Sometimes when you have success, you have lapses,"" he said. “We played a team to their record and that can't happen. So for us, take this as a learning lesson. We can't really play around. We came here just expecting things to go well.”

            Jarrett Allen added 17 points and had 11 rebounds as Cleveland improved to 25-6 at home. Evan Mobley had 15 points and 10 boards.

            Keldon Johnson scored 25 and rookie Malaki Branham 18 to pace the Spurs, who are just 2-20 in 2023.

            The Spurs, who haven't won since Jan. 17, stunned the Cavs at home in December, beating Cleveland 112-111.

            But the Cavs weren't taking any chances for a repeat, and as has been the case during this winning streak, Cleveland's starters set the tone early.

            Mitchell, Allen (13) and Mobley (10) combined for 46 of Cleveland's 65 points in the first half.

            GOING GREEN

            Once Danny Green clears waivers, the veteran will sign with the Cavaliers, who didn't make a move at the trade deadline but jumped at the chance to grab the three-time NBA champion.

            Green was drafted by Cleveland in 2009.

            Bickerstaff couldn't comment specifically on Green, but said adding a player with postseason experience (165 games) to a young team is invaluable.

            “You listen to those guys, guys who have been to the mountaintop and won championships and played in those type of games,” he said.

            Following the game, Green, who spent eight seasons with the Spurs, visited with some of his former colleagues.

            Clarkson hit a 3-pointer for a 115-110 lead with 2:03 remaining, and added a 13-foot baseline jumper to extend the lead to 117-113 in the final minute. 

            “Jordan was in the zone tonight,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said. “I wish I could take credit for any of that. We just try to make sure in those moments when he has that going that we're executing from a spacing standpoint as a team, making sure we give him enough space to operate when he gets in those grooves. He's incredibly capable of getting as hot as anybody in the league.”











            Clarkson scored 22 in the second half and finished with six 3-pointers.

            “I know when my shots are there, what shots I can get to in a game, and I'm very confident that I'll make those,” Clarkson said. “At the end of the game, (coach) called everybody off, so I knew what to go to. Baseline jump shot, tough shot, but I knocked it in.”

            Markkanen sealed the win with four free throws in the final 14.2 seconds. He hit 10 of 20 shots and had 11 rebounds for the Jazz, who had lost four of their last five games.

            The Pacers, who rallied from a 12-point deficit to within two with 3:06 remaining, have lost five in a row and 16 of 18.

            Clarkson and Tyrese Haliburton dueled in the third quarter. Haliburton scored 13 points, while Clarkson had four 3-pointers and 15 points to help the Jazz to an 89-88 lead heading into the final quarter.

            “I'm cool with Tyrese, he's good people,” Clarkson said. “It's good to see him come into his own, being an All-Star this year. He works out with the same people I have worked out with forever. He's just a good kid, really talented. I talk to him, give him (crap) during the game, just having fun.”

            Haliburton finished with 30 points and 12 assists. Bennedict Mathurin scored 21 and Aaron Nesmith 19 for Indiana.

            “There was high-level shot-making down the stretch,” Haliburton was quoted as saying by The Indianapolis Star. “I thought Jordan made some tough shots down the end there. They got to the free throw line and the start of that fourth really hurt us. I think they attacked us in different ways. Obviously Lauri and Jordan both had good games. I don’t know what they did specifically, I gotta watch film, but they did a good job of getting their guys going.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809480,"Taiwan parents rarely have moral, religious opposition to LGBT issues: research","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese parents rarely have religious reasons for opposing their non-heterosexual children’s sexual orientation, and feel that increasing visibility of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people in society is reducing discrimination, according to a recent study out of the University of Hong Kong (HKU).Speaking to Taiwan News, Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Work and Social Administration HKU and author of the research Dr. Huang Yu-Te (黃昱得) said that Taiwanese parents’ concerns stem largely from anxieties about their child living in a society dominated by heterosexual norms and anti-LGBTQ stereotypes. He said that unlike in some western countries where Christian values dominate, his research shows that moral opposition to LGB people amongst parents in Taiwan is rare.“I think it’s relatively rare to hear things like ‘our religion thinks this is wrong,’"" Huang said. “The parents won’t even form their opposition on the basis of ‘right or wrong?’”Huang said that parents will more likely be concerned about the impact coming out will have on their children’s future, along with interpersonal issues. He said that respondents often spoke of concerns about how they would tell their families and friends, and how this would affect other peoples' perceptions of them and their children.“One of the main arguments I want to put forward is that our understanding of parental attitudes towards LGBT issues needs to be situated in a family context, particularly in Taiwanese society,” Huang said.Taiwanese parents’ initial reaction to their children coming out was often confusion and anxiety, according to the research paper. However, once parents were introduced to the concept that being born gay was normal, some became more accepting. “If you are wired like that, what’s the point of changing, right? I think this (idea) helped me accept fate and made me realize that my son’s sexual orientation is unchangeable,” one interviewee, a 58-year-old mother said.The research results also showed that some of the distress parents experienced when discovering their child’s sexual orientation was due to the lack of exposure to these issues throughout their lives. Huang says that greater LGBT representation in the media can help address this issue while also getting rid of pervading negative stereotypes.“One side of it would be to say that LGBT people and straight people really aren’t that different,” Huang said. “They’re students, working people, they do all the things heterosexual people do, it’s pretty much all the same. The only difference is their choice of their partner’s gender.”Secretary General of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) Chih-chieh Chien (簡至潔) agrees, saying that in a year, a viewer might only see 4 or 5 stories about LGBTQ+ people on mainstream Taiwan TV.Chien said many of the cultural stereotypes about LGBTQ people in Taiwan are the result of discriminatory government policy and media coverage that was common when many older Taiwanese grew up. She said between 1950-1990 it was common to read headlines suggesting homosexuality was an illness, that it was morally wrong, and that it should be stopped.Dr. Huang Yu-Te (黃昱得) says understandings of Taiwanese parental attitudes towards LGBT issues need to be situated in a family context. (Supplied, Huang Yu-Te photo)“When I was in university, the instructors would say that LGBTQ people were perverted, so (anti-LGBTQ discrimination was normal) not that long ago,” Chien said.Chien also said that continuing the family line is very important in traditional Chinese culture, so Taiwanese society will likely find it harder to accept gay people than other members of the LGBTQ+ community. “There’s research in Taiwan to show that parents will more likely accept their daughters if they are gay than their sons,” she said.According to Chien, during the early years of the LGBTQ+ rights movement, campaigners thought it best for members of the movement to avoid being overtly non-heterosexual in their appearance and attitude, and that this in turn has impacted the visibility of LGBTQ+ people in society.“Early on in Taiwan society, and in the gay movement, it wasn’t encouraged to come out of the closet,” and because of this, LGBTQ people are not presently as visible in society as they could be, Chien said.Huang said that another barrier to acceptance is the way people view the concept of discrimination, and says that people need to be aware that discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is pervasive in Taiwanese society.He said that while some believe that discrimination is defined by a verbal or physical attack, this is not the reality for many LGBT people in their everyday life.“In the research we’d often hear interviewees say ‘I don’t discriminate against them, but I don’t approve of their behavior,’” Huang said. “(In reality) your attitude toward and your treatment of LGBT people can also constitute discrimination.”",2023/02/14,2395,Society

            Jalen Brunson scored 40 points, Josh Hart added a season-high 27 in his second game with his new team and the Knicks snapped a nine-game losing streak against Brooklyn with a 124-106 victory Monday night.

            Julius Randle had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who beat the Nets for the first time in three years. Brooklyn never lost to the Knicks when Durant or Irving played.











            “You’ve got to give them credit. They’ve been really good the past couple of years and they were great tonight,” Brunson said, “but I think we just had the upper hand in the second half and we kind of just turned it up a little bit and came away with a win.” 

            The seventh-place Knicks pulled within two games of the Nets for fifth place in the Eastern Conference. The top six teams are guaranteed playoff spots.

            Spencer Dinwiddie scored 28 points for the Nets, who showed again how much of a struggle scoring could be after trading their two All-Stars last week. Cam Johnson had 14, but Mikal Bridges, who came with him from Phoenix in the Durant trade, was 2 of 8 for seven points. 

            “That was the overall challenge, just to be able to put the ball in the basket,” Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said. “And it’s something we’re going to work on and stress as a group.”

            The Knicks beat the Nets twice in the 2019-20 season, which Durant missed while recovering from Achilles tendon surgery. Irving was injured for one Knicks victory, then left Madison Square Garden after learning of Kobe Bryant’s death before the most recent one on Jan. 26, 2020.

            Brunson scored 17 in the decisive third quarter on his way to his third 40-point game of the season after never having one in the regular season during his first four years with Dallas.

            “Obviously seeing him play in college and he was amazing and I knew he would have a long career in the NBA, but I didn’t think it was going to be how he’s playing now,"" said Hart, Brunson's teammate at Villanova. “And he’s someone who should be an All-Star and he’s playing at an All-Star level.”

            Brunson turned the game in the Knicks' favor for good after it was tied at 80 late in the third quarter. Brunson had a basket and 3-pointer that started a 13-3 finish to the period for the Knicks, with his 3 making it 93-83.

            Hart, acquired from Portland last week, converted a three-point play to push the lead to 12 with 7:05 remaining and the Knicks were never in jeopardy again.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809519,New Mexico may seek veto power over spent nuke fuel storage,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — The New Mexico Senate on Monday approved a proposed ban on the local disposal of spent nuclear fuel, unless the state provides its consent first.

            The bill from Democratic state Sen. Jeff Steinborn, of Las Cruces, could impact a proposed multibillion-dollar facility in southeastern New Mexico that is expected to temporarily store spent nuclear fuel from commercial power plants across the nation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission may announce a decision as soon as March on whether to grant a license to that project from Holtec International.

            The Senate endorsed the bill on a 21-13 vote with Republicans and two Albuquerque-based Democrats in opposition to the proposed ban. The bill moves next to the state House for consideration, amid backing from Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.











            Steinborn said New Mexico residents should be wary of becoming “guinea pigs” for temporary storage projects before the federal government decides on a permanent storage site.

            His proposal found support among Democratic legislators, including Sen. Brenda McKenna, of Corrales, who noted New Mexico already grapples with the impacts of Uranium mining.

            “What I'm really tired of is hearing over the decades of how our resources have been excavated and then things get dumped here,"" she said. “I'm tired of New Mexico being exploited this way.""

            Several legislators expressed concern that the bill from Steinborn would challenge longstanding federal authority over nuclear safety matters and lead to new court challenges.

            “We'll find out where the state's authority ends,” said Democratic state Sen. Joseph Cervantes, of Las Cruces, an attorney who voted in support.

            New Mexico and neighboring Texas already have sued in federal court over two proposed multibillion-dollar interim storage facilities for spent fuel— the one in southeastern New Mexico and another in Andrews County, Texas.

            New Mexico Republican Sen. Craig Brandt, of Rio Rancho, voted against the bill and expressed confidence in the safety vetting of proposed transportation and storage containers that would be used to bring spent nuclear fuel to New Mexico by rail. 

            Democratic state Sen. Jerry Ortiz y Pino, of Albuquerque, also voted no, saying it was wrong to overrule significant local community support at close range to a proposed storage site.

            Nuclear reactors across the country produce more than 2,000 metric tons of radioactive waste a year, with most of it remaining on-site because there’s nowhere else to put it, according to the Department of Energy. The federal government pays to house the fuel, and the cost is expected to stretch into the tens of billions over the next decade, according to a review by independent government auditors.SANTA FE, N.M.

            Nikola Jokic wasn't bothered.

            The two-time reigning MVP made the most of every opportunity, finishing with 27 points on 12-of-14 shooting and leading the Denver Nuggets past the Heat 112-108 — snapping Miami's eight-game home winning streak.











            “Nikola did what he does,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said.

            Jokic also had 12 rebounds and eight assists for Denver, which shot 58%. The Nuggets moved five games ahead of idle Memphis atop the Western Conference standings and joined Boston as the only teams to reach the 40-win mark this season.

            “He’s a great player. He makes everybody around him better,” Miami’s Max Strus said. “They stepped up and made shots. Tough team to beat. Obviously, they’re No. 1 in the West for a reason.”

            The Nuggets were 29 of 40 inside the paint, good for 58 points. Miami came into the night allowing an average of 44.9 paint points.

            Michael Porter Jr. scored 17, Bruce Brown added 16, Jeff Green scored 12 and three Nuggets — Vlatko Cancar, Christian Braun and Thomas Bryant — each finished with 10 points.

            “It speaks to the quality of our depth,"" Malone said.

            Jimmy Butler had 24 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for the Heat. Strus scored 23, Bam Adebayo had 19, Gabe Vincent 15 and Jamaree Bouyea added 10 for Miami.

            Denver was without its second- and third-leading scorers — Jamal Murray (right knee inflammation) and Aaron Gordon (left rib contusion). It was the fifth consecutive game missed for Murray, and the third in a span of five games for Gordon.

            Malone said “hopefully, maybe” they could return in Denver’s game against Dallas on Wednesday, the team’s finale before the All-Star break.

            Brown, who played his college ball at Miami, made a 3-pointer with 9:07 left in the third to put Denver up 70-69 — and the Nuggets held the lead the rest of the way. Denver eventually led by as many as 10. Miami got within one point on three occasions from there.

            “People don't win here a lot, especially because there's a lot of festivities, obviously,"" Brown said. “But they're also a great team ... glad we got the win.""

            It was the 40th double-double of the season for Jokic. Only Sacramento’s Domantas Sabonis, with 44, has more.

            TIP-INS

            Nuggets: Denver's 40-18 record matches the best 58-game start in franchise history. The Nuggets also were 40-18 in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons. ... Jokic got a technical with 16.7 seconds left in the half, arguing that he was fouled as he scored. It was his third technical of the season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809523,LaMelo Ball leads Hornets to wire-to-wire victory over Hawks,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — LaMelo Ball had 30 points and 15 assists, Terry Rozier added 29 points and the Charlotte Hornets held off the Atlanta Hawks 144-138 on Monday night to snap a seven-game losing streak.

            Gordon Hayward scored 26 points and P.J. Washington chipped in with 22 as the Hornets shot 63% from the field. Ball had six 3-pointers and Rozier hit five as Charlotte tied a season high with 20 made 3s.

            Rookie center Mark Williams finished with 15 points and a huge block on Trae Young's 3-point attempt in the final minute.











            Ball put on a show, finishing 12 of 19 from the field and 6 of 10 from beyond the arc. When he wasn't scoring, he was creating off the dribble and finding open teammates. He had four turnovers, but the good far outweighed the bad.

            “One thing about Melo is he’s a gamer,” Rozier said. “He can be having any type of day, good or bad, but once he’s in that game he just hoops. Nothing that he does surprises me anymore. He’s a true gamer.”

            It was the second-highest point total in Hornets franchise history, behind the 158 they scored against Indiana last season.

            “I thought they were the more aggressive team from start to finish,"" Hawks coach Nate McMillan said. ""They averaged 30-plus points each quarter. We never really established defensively that we could get stops consistently, and 21 fast-break points, they basically just got to their tempo and were the aggressive team.” 

            Young finished with 25 points and 14 assists for the Hawks, who had their two-game win streak snapped. Clint Capela added 22 points, DeAndre Hunter had 21 and Dejounte Murray scored 20 for Atlanta.

            Charlotte entered tied for the most losses in the NBA with 43, but the Hornets never trailed in this one as they raced to a 14-point lead behind 21 first-half points from Hayward.

            Charlotte extended its advantage to 17 early in the fourth quarter when Ball found Washington in the left corner for a wide-open 3. But the Hawks wouldn't quit, cutting the deficit to two with 2:22 left when Young knocked down a 3 from the right wing.

            A few possessions later, Young had a chance to tie the game on a step-back 3, but the 7-foot Williams stepped out to block the shot with his long wingspan.

            Hayward gathered the loose ball and fired a lookahead pass to Williams, who avoided a defender and scored on a Euro step with 52.8 seconds to go, bringing the crowd to its feet.

            “He has great hands and great agility for a man his size,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. “That was a big-time play.”

            Williams entered the starting lineup when the team traded Mason Plumlee to the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday. Williams has become a solid shot blocker, but Clifford wants to see him continue to improve on the defensive end.

            “He just has to keep learning,” Clifford said. “He is super talented. The hardest thing for him (and backup Nick Richardson) in a game like this is the pick-and-roll stuff where they tattooed us.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809549,"Banchero, Wagner, Fultz lead Magic over Bulls 100-91","CHICAGO (AP) — The Orlando Magic were sailing along with what appeared to be a comfortable lead before things tightened up in the closing minutes.

            Just when it looked like they might be in trouble, they regrouped and found a way to pull out a win over Chicago.

            Paolo Banchero scored 22 points, Franz Wagner and Markelle Fultz added 18 points apiece and the Magic beat the cold-shooting Bulls 100-91 on Monday night.











            Fultz just missed a triple-double with 10 rebounds and nine assists. Wendell Carter Jr. scored 15 points against his former team as the Magic won for the fourth time in six games.

            Coming off an overtime loss at home to Miami, Orlando led by 13 midway through the fourth and hung on after Chicago got within five. 

            “We know what we need to do,” Fultz said. “I think today we did a great job as players, just talking amongst each other and understanding that we're gonna be in a situation and we've got to find a way to get through it. I think that's what you saw tonight. We just all talked to each other, continued to push each other and not get too frustrated when they got it down to five.""

            The Bulls matched a season high by dropping their fourth in a row, thanks to another horrendous shooting performance. They missed their first 16 3-pointers before Coby White hit one late in the third and 18 of 21 in all. Chicago is 26 of 125 from long range over its past five games.

            Coach Billy Donovan said all those misses led to some poor decisions and, in turn, difficulties hanging onto the ball. The Bulls committed 16 turnovers.

            “I think it's just normal instinct — let's just drive the ball in there, let's drive it to the basket,” Donovan said. “What happened is two times we had charges and a few times we had spray-outs that weren't there, that weren't open, that we turned the ball over.""

            Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 26 points, and DeMar DeRozan scored 19 even though a hip issue that's been bothering him the past six weeks or so flared up.

            “It's been bad,” he said. “I'm never gonna want to complain or make any type of excuses. It's just been something I've been dealing with for a while.”

            Former Magic star Nikola Vucevic finished with 13 points and 13 rebounds.

            MAGIC HANG ON

            Orlando led 89-76 after Banchero hit a 12-footer with just over five minutes remaining. DeRozan cut for a layup to pull Chicago within 91-86 with 3:34 left. But Carter answered with a three-point play following a timeout and the Magic remained in control the rest of the way.

            “We had that problem in two of the last couple games, where we had the lead the whole game and gave it away in the last couple minutes,"" Wagner said. “All (coach Jamahl Mosley) said was stay composed, keep pushing the pace because that's what helped us early on in the game.”

            TAKING CONTROL

            Orlando took control early in the third, when 3-pointers by Gary Harris Jr. and Wagner made it 60-50.

            The Bulls' next three possessions ended with Patrick Williams missing badly on a tip-in, Ayo Dosunmu getting blocked by Fultz on a fast-break layup and LaVine getting called for traveling. DeRozan then made a turnaround jumper. But Wagner nailed a 3 and Carter scored, making it 65-52 midway through the third.

            It was 73-63 with less than two minutes remaining in the quarter when White hit the first 3 for Chicago. A reverse layup by Dalen Terry pulled Chicago within five. Orlando's Moritz Wagner hit a 3 to make it 76-68 with 30 seconds remaining in the quarter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809550,Stephen Curry hopes to return shortly after All-Star break,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Stephen Curry hopes to get back to some on-court work during the All-Star break but will miss time afterward as he recovers from a left leg injury.

            The reigning NBA Finals MVP missed his fourth straight game after getting injured against Dallas on Feb. 4 in a collision while defending McKinley Wright IV as he drove to the basket. Wright's knee hit Curry's shin.

            “It was pretty big knock that kind of jolted the bone and ligaments in there, which was all terms I didn't know existed before,” Curry said. “It was just a timing thing. If my foot's elevated and it's just more like a contusion you can kind of deal with it but because my foot was planted and a lot of weight on it, the force of the impact was a little more serious than I wanted it to be.” 











            Curry said he will likely have a better idea of the timeline and a possible target date for his return once he actually tests the leg on the court. An MRI exam showed partial tears to his superior tibiofibular ligament and interosseous membrane in his left leg. He also had a bruise.

            Because of the ligament damage, Curry said it's hard to know how long his healing will take.

            “At first it felt like it was a normal contusion, just a real serious one, that's why I went to the bench and thought I could kind of just shake it off, then I got up from the bench and felt something different and was like ‘Nah, that’s not right,'"" Curry said. “I knew it was something more than just a normal contusion because I couldn't put any weight on it and was hobbling around. Thankfully there weren't any broken bones or anything.”

            Curry is looking forward to welcoming back newly acquired guard Gary Payton II and having everyone healthy to try to make a run at another title. Curry is averaging 29.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 6.4 assists. He will miss the All-Star game but posed with his No. 30 West jersey. 

            Curry sat out his 19th game overall this season for the defending champions, 11 of those with a partially dislocated left shoulder. He remains confident about Golden State's chances despite its struggles and inconsistency.

            “I know we're a different team than we were, I know we have different challenges than we did last year but it still has been proven that if we're healthy come playoff time and we have a shot to get into a series, that we're a tough out,” Curry said. “That's where all the optimism is until proven differently.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809551,UN report: Sayf al-’Adl widely seen as new al-Qaida leader,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — U.N. experts say the predominant view among member nations is that the leadership of al-Qaida has passed to Sayf al-’Adl, who was responsible for Osama bin Laden's security and trained some of the hijackers involved in the 9/11 attack on the U.S.

            The panel of experts said in a report to the U.N. Security Council circulated Monday that no announcement has been made of Sayf al-’Adl replacing Ayman al-Zawahri, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Kabul last August.

            “But in discussions in November and December many U.N. member states took the view that Sayf al-’Adl is already operating as the de facto and uncontested leader of the group,” the report says.











            Assessments vary as to why al-’Adl's leadership hasn’t been declared, it said.

            Some countries feel that al-Zawahri’s presence in Kabul embarrassed the country’s Taliban rulers who are seeking legitimacy “and that al-Qaida chose not to exacerbate this by acknowledging the death,” the experts said.

            “However, most judged a key factor to be the continued presence of Sayf al-’Adl in the Islamic Republic of Iran (which) raised difficult theological and operational questions for al-Qaida,” they said.

            While noting that one country rejected claims that any al-Qaida affiliate is in Iran, the panel said that the location of Sayf al-’Adl'a ""raises questions that have a bearing on al-Qaida’s ambitions to assert leadership of a global movement in the face of challenges” from the Islamic State extremist group.

            Sayf al-’Adl has been listed on the U.N. sanctions blacklist as Egyptian-born Mohammed Salahaldin Abd El Halim Zidan since January 2001, the panel said. He is described in the U.N. listing as taking over as military commander of al-Qaida following the death of Mohammed Atef — one of bin Laden’s top aides — in a U.S. attack in November 2001.

            In addition to being bin Laden’s security chief, the U.N. says, Sayf al-’Adl taught militants to use explosives and trained some of the hijackers involved in the attack in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. It says he also trained Somali fighters who killed 18 U.S. servicemen in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993. 

            Sayf al-’Adl is wanted by U.S. authorities in connection with the August 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya.

            According to the report, the threat from al-Qaida, the Islamic State extremist group and their affiliates “remains high in conflict zones and neighboring countries,” with Africa emerging in recent years “as the continent where the harm done by terrorism is developing most rapidly and extensively.”

            The panel said the Islamic State’s leadership has also become a question following the group’s Nov. 30 announcement that Abu al-Hassan al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi had died in a battle the previous month, the group's second leader to be killed in 2022.

            “The new leader was announced as Abu al-Husain al-Husaini al-Qurashi, and his true identity is not yet known,” the experts said.

            Member states noted numerous pledges of allegiance to Abu al-Husain by Islamic Stater ""affiliates far and wide without specific knowledge of his identity or qualities as a leader,” they said.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — U.N. experts say the predominant view among member nations is that the leadership of al-Qaida has passed to Sayf al-’Adl, who was responsible for Osama bin Laden's security and trained some of the hijackers involved in the 9/11 attack on the U.S.The panel of experts said in a report to the U.N. Security Council circulated Monday that no announcement has been made of Sayf al-’Adl replacing Ayman al-Zawahri, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Kabul last August.“But in discussions in November and December many U.N. member states took the view that Sayf al-’Adl is already operating as the de facto and uncontested leader of the group,” the report says.Assessments vary as to why al-’Adl's leadership hasn’t been declared, it said.Some countries feel that al-Zawahri’s presence in Kabul embarrassed the country’s Taliban rulers who are seeking legitimacy “and that al-Qaida chose not to exacerbate this by acknowledging the death,” the experts said.“However, most judged a key factor to be the continued presence of Sayf al-’Adl in the Islamic Republic of Iran (which) raised difficult theological and operational questions for al-Qaida,” they said.While noting that one country rejected claims that any al-Qaida affiliate is in Iran, the panel said that the location of Sayf al-’Adl'a ""raises questions that have a bearing on al-Qaida’s ambitions to assert leadership of a global movement in the face of challenges” from the Islamic State extremist group.Sayf al-’Adl has been listed on the U.N. sanctions blacklist as Egyptian-born Mohammed Salahaldin Abd El Halim Zidan since January 2001, the panel said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809555,WAC deems New Mexico State's remaining games as forfeits,"LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) — The Western Athletic Conference has deemed New Mexico State's remaining men's basketball games as forfeits after the program canceled its season amid hazing allegations.

            The conference said in a statement Monday night the forfeits will be used for conference standings and seedings because the NCAA doesn't recognize forfeited games in a team's overall record.

            “While there is no perfect solution to this unfortunate situation, I believe we landed in the right place,” WAC Commissioner Brian Thornton said in the statement. “I applaud our Athletic Directors for working collaboratively with our staff to reach this decision.”











            New Mexico State canceled the rest of its season on Sunday after the release of a police report that detailed three players ganging up on a teammate and attacking him in a case that includes allegations of false imprisonment, harassment and criminal sexual contact.

            On Tuesday, university regents will hold a closed meeting to discuss “limited personnel matters concerning individual employees.” It did not name the employees who were to be discussed. The scheduling of the meeting came Saturday, the day after chancellor Dan Arvizu placed coach Greg Heiar and his staff on administrative leave at the same time he suspended the season. 

            The allegations come less than three months after the suspension of forward Mike Peake, who is being investigated in the case of the fatal shooting of a student from rival school, University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque on Nov. 19.

            Peake has not been charged in that case, which included state police stopping the team bus on Interstate-25 as it headed back to Las Cruces shortly after the shooting. Missing from the bus were Peake and three of his teammates, who had taken him to the hospital with an injured leg.

Australia and China have recently sought to repair diplomatic ties and Beijing has begun to ease trade blocks on Australian coal and agricultural products. Read full storyShe said foreign interference was not hypothetical, and was being seen as ""foreign governments try to win over elected leaders and party activists push for changes in everything from planning laws to foreign and national security policy, or simply to build a picture of how decisions are made"".Australia would not tolerate incidents where foreign governments were collecting sensitive personal information on dissidents, or the surveillance of peaceful protesters in Australia, and would do more to counter it, she added.A University Foreign Interference Taskforce was working with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to deal with ""real and increasingly sophisticated"" threats, she said.""It should be no secret or surprise the university sector is a target of foreign interference,"" O'Neil said.""ASIO has stated that foreign intelligence services and their proxies 'are all too willing to take advantage of the openness that is integral to our universities and research institutions to steal intellectual property and cutting-edge technologies.'""(Reporting by Kirsty Needham; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",2023/02/14,139,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809582,Crouse scores 2 goals as Coyotes beat Preds 4-2 for road win,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Lawson Crouse scored his second goal at 4:20 of the third period, and the Arizona Coyotes beat the Nashville Predators 4-2 on Monday night to snap an 18-game road skid.

            Crouse nearly had a hat trick but missed an empty net wide with 1:11 left. Christian Fischer didn't miss with 52.9 remaining. 

            Nick Schmaltz also scored a goal as the Coyotes won for the first time on the road since a 4-0 win at Carolina on Nov. 23, a span that saw them go 0-13-5 until capping this three-game road swing that started with back-to-back overtime losses. 











            Matias Maccelli, J.J. Moser and Clayton Keller each had two assists.

            Goalie Karel Vejmelka made 29 saves for his first win against the team that drafted him in the fifth round in 2015. 

            “It’s more special than the other games,” Vejmelka said. “But I don’t care who plays against us. I just want to give us a chance to win. We had big points tonight.”

             Arizona now is 3-0-3 without a regulation loss over the past six games, and coach Andre Tourigny said he thinks that says something about the character of a team trailing all but two teams in the Western Conference. 

            “We’re obviously not the level of a Tampa Bay or something like that,” Tourigny said. “But character wise, you could see even in the second period, when the wind was against us, we still battled and worked really hard. So, proud of the boys.”

            Captain Roman Josi and Colton Sissons scored a goal apiece as Nashville started a three-game home stand with its second loss in three games since the All-Star Game break. Nashville slipped five points back of Calgary for the West's second wild-card slot.

            “It’s definitely a frustrating loss,"" Josi said.

            The Coyotes improved to 7-20-6 on the road despite being outshot 10-2 in the second. Crouse not only tied it up at 2 with Arizona's only power play of the game, it was the Coyotes' first shot of the period. Keller hit off the crossbar with 36.4 seconds left for their other shot.

            Then Arizona opened the third taking five of the first seven shots, including Crouse's game-winner. Maccelli passed a backhander from near the boards to Crouse for his 19th goal.

            “(I) just tried to get open in that soft spot, and (Maccelli) put it right on my tape,” Crouse said. “I think it squeaked in somehow, so obviously a good feeling.”

            The Predators had a fifth and final power play when Crouse put the puck over the glass with 4:36 remaining. Coach John Hynes took his timeout with 51 seconds left on the man advantage, not that it helped as Nashville finished 1-of-5 on the power play.

            
                Nashville honored P.K. Subban before the game as the three-time All-Star defenseman handled the ceremonial puck drop.

            Subban announced his retirement in September after 13 NHL seasons. The 2013 Norris Trophy winner helped Nashville reach the 2017 Stanley Cup Final and played all 82 games in winning the 2018 Presidents’ Trophy.

            When Predators forward Nino Niederreiter turned it over, Schmaltz quickly took advantage with his 14th goal this season and third in as many games. He scored on a one-timer from the left circle off a pass from Keller for a 1-0 lead with 2:45 left in the first period. He now has seven points in three games. 

            MIA

            Nashville played without second-leading scorer Filip Forsberg who went down in the first period of a 2-1 overtime win in Philadelphia on Saturday. He’s listed as day to day with an upper-body injury after being checked into the boards.

            Hynes said earlier Monday the injury might not be as serious as it first appeared. Philip Tomasino was called up from AHL Milwaukee and replaced Forsberg on the top line with Ryan Johansen and Mikael Granlund.

            Arizona played its second game with defenseman Jakob Chychrun a healthy scratch for “trade related reasons.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809584,"Bobrovsky, Panthers beat Wild 2-1 in shootout","ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Anton Lundell and Aleksander Barkov scored in the shootout to send the Florida Panthers to a 2-1 win against the Minnesota Wild on Monday night.

            Eetu Luostarinen scored in regulation for Florida, which has won four of its past five games. Sergei Bobrovsky made 27 saves for the Panthers in a low-scoring game with plenty of scoring opportunities.

            Bobrovsky stopped two of the three players he faced in the shootout.











            “Bob was unbelievable today,” Lundell said. “He kept us in the game, took some big saves and gave us, pretty much, two points today.”

            Filip Gustavsson nearly matched Bobrovsky save for save, making 33 saves for Minnesota. Kirill Kaprizov scored in regulation for the Wild, who have lost four of five since the All-Star break.

            “We’ve had a couple of games like that now and to be honest, we have to go and get some of the dirty goals,” Kaprizov said through a translator. “Find a way to win some ugly battles and get some ugly goals and that’ll open up some space for us to be able to make some plays and score some nicer goals. But myself included, I think I need to go and get some dirty goals and find a way have things open up in the ice and to start winning games.”

            The goaltenders shined as Florida outshot Minnesota 34-28 and had a 14-3 advantage in shots at one point in the first period.

            Both teams had their chances. They went a combined 0 of 12 on the power play, with the Panthers unable to score on seven man-advantage opportunities.

            They had entered the day with a 33.3% scoring rate on the power play since the start of 2023, the best mark in the NHL. Florida had a power-play goal in seven of its previous 10 games.

            “I don’t want to get fined,” Wild coach Dean Evason said. “You guys see it. We all see it. It’s tough. It was tough tonight. But having said that, we’ve been praising, our group’s been so good, disciplined, only one penalty here, and then that happens. And it’s hard because we obviously can’t take seven minors but we really liked our composure.”

            On the defensive side, the Panthers have now killed 18 of 19 penalties in the past six games.

            “There wasn’t a lot of flow in that game,” Florida coach Paul Maurice said. “Both team’s penalty kill was really good. Both team’s goalies were really good on the penalty kill. That’s the important part.”

            Luostarinen opened the scoring 2:06 into the second period, deflecting a point shot from Gustav Forsling for his 12th goal of the season.

            Minnesota answered back three minutes later when Kaprizov scored his 30th of the season. Kaprizov was finally able to control a bouncing puck entering the offensive zone and wristed a quick shot high past Bobrovsky.

            “The only thing I can say is it’s big points for us,” Bobrovsky said. “This time of year, it’s already like a playoff spot kind of. It’s a huge point.”

            THIRD’S A CHARM

            Lundell was Florida’s first shooter in the shootout and was seen working on his stick prior to the shootout attempt.

            “I don’t know what happened today,” Lundell said. “I broke two sticks in the game, which is not normal for me. So, I had to take a new stick for the shootout and it worked pretty well.”

            OUCH

            Wild forward Marcus Foligno left the game in the second period after taking a shot off the inside of his left knee. Foligno never returned and the team said he’s dealing with a lower-body injury. Foligno had to be helped off the ice and couldn’t put any weight on his left leg as he left.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809585,"Stutzle scores in OT, Senators rally to beat Flames 4-3","OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Tim Stutzle scored at 1:55 of overtime to cap Ottawa's comeback from two goals down as the Senators beat the Calgary Flames 4-3 Monday night.

            Brady Tkachuk, Drake Batherson and Alex DeBrincat also scored for Ottawa and Stutlze had assists on all three goals. Mads Sogaard, appearing in his fourth NHL game, made 34 saves.

            “A lot of pucks bobbling in the slot and on the power play, too,” Stutzle said. “We had some good looks and the puck bobbled every time we wanted to shoot. … I got really mad there a couple of times, but in the end we figured it out. We did a great job staying with it.











            The 22-year-old Sogaard got the start with Cam Talbot and Anton Forsberg sidelined. He had 10 saves in the first period, 15 in the second, eight in the third and one in overtime.

            “It’s awesome to be here and awesome to get a win in front of our fans and you know it’s my first win here,” Sogaard said. “I lost the last time I played against Winnipeg so it was a very special moment and something I won’t forget.”

            Senators coach D.J. Smith gave Sogaard plenty of credit.

            “He looked really calm,” Smith said. “I mean he’s big, obviously, pucks hit him and he made the saves he had to make. They had plenty of chances and he looked good.”

            Dillon Dube had two goals and Tyler Toffoli had a goal and an assist for the Flames. Jacob Markstrom finished with 21 saves.

            “We had chances throughout the entire game to essentially put them away, and we didn’t,” Toffoli said. “We let them hang around. They’re a team with a lot of skill and can do what they did.”

            The Senators trailed 3-1 late in the third period before Batherson scored on the rebound of a shot by Stutzle with 2:14 left and DeBrincat tied it 46 seconds later. Both goals came with Sogaard pulled for an extra skater.

            “There’s four, five minutes left and you see a few people leaving and before you know it, it’s tied up,” Batherson said. “It’s awesome. We haven’t scored many 6-on-5 goals since I’ve been here and the place went nuts so it was great to get the win.”

            The Senators got off to a bit of a slow start, but were first on the scoreboard when Stutzle fed Tkachuk a great pass to spring him loose for a breakaway goal 6:10 into the first period. It was his 21st goal of the season.

            Dube tied it on a power play when he deflected Noah Hanifin’s shot past Sogaard with 5:13 left in the opening period.

            Toffoli put Calgary ahead at 5:55 of the second — just seconds after a power play expired — when he beat Sogaard on the glove side with his 22nd.

            Dube put the Flames up 3-1 with his second of the night and 15th of the season by tipping Toffoli's shot past Sogaard.

            “I thought we dominated the game,” Flames coach Darryl Sutter said. “I thought we totally dominated puck possession. Whether it’s the next goal or the next save, I thought we were in total control of the game.”

            Ingram made 14 of 24 field goal attempts and helped New Orleans win even though high-scoring guard CJ McCollum sat out with a sprained right ankle. 

            “Brandon was phenomenal,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""He can get his shot anywhere on the floor. You know, he was patient. ... At the end of the day, he had a dominant performance, and we needed his scoring tonight.”











            Oklahoma City had a chance to tie in the closing seconds, but Isaiah Joe’s 3-pointer bounced away at the buzzer.

            Josh Richardson scored 10 points and made five steals in his first game with the Pelicans since being traded from San Antonio.

            “J-Rich was good,"" Green said. “You can see his veteran savviness on the floor. Makes great decisions defensively. ... That’s part of what we wanted when we acquired him is bringing in another veteran who can score but who can defend who’s smart on the floor.”

            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 24 points and 10 rebounds, Jalen Williams scored 22 points and Joe added 16 for the Thunder.

            Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said his players will need to adjust now that opponents are taking them more seriously.

            “They know they have to show up against us, and that’s a good thing, but we’re going to get heavier and heavier punches, and we need to understand the mentality of the opponent for that,"" he said. 

            Ingram scored 23 points in the first half to help the Pelicans take a 60-51 lead at the break. New Orleans led by 20 in the second quarter.

            “They were more ready to play,"" Daigneault said. ""I thought they threw the first punch. They were more physical, more alert in the first quarter. And it took us a long time to get it going.”

            Oklahoma City chipped away in the third. A steal by Josh Giddey led to a fast break, and Williams' perfect behind-the-back pass to Gilgeous-Alexander led to a two-handed dunk that cut New Orleans' lead to 72-71. The Pelicans took a 76-73 advantage into the fourth.

            New Orleans scored the first eight points of the final quarter, but the Thunder rallied again. Oklahoma City gained possession trailing 101-98 with 35 seconds remaining, but the Thunder turned it over.

            The Pelicans took a 103-98 lead with 9.5 seconds to play on a pair of free throws by Trey Murphy III. Williams went downcourt for a quick dunk with 5.3 seconds left, then the Thunder forced a turnover on the inbounds pass to gain possession and set up the final sequence.

            Daigneault said it all came down to the way the Thunder started the game.

            “You want to focus on controllables and the things that we can control and how we start the game, how physical we are, how alert we are from the onset,” he said. “We can control that, and we allowed them to get into a pretty good rhythm there early.”

                Neither one of them got a shot off in the closing seconds, and the Mavs' big comeback attempt came up short against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

            “Man. I’m still trying to emotionally recover ... still so raw,” Irving said. “Oh, man. I would have liked to at least get a shot up.”











            Irving had the highest-scoring fourth quarter of his career, scoring 26 of his 36 points in the final 12 minutes Monday night. But he made a bad pass after stepping inside the 3-point line on the final possession after Minnesota had thrown off the timing between him and Doncic by knocking the inbound pass into the backcourt. The Timberwolves nearly blew a 26-point lead but held on to win 124-121.

            After Doncic tracked down the tipped inbound pass, he passed to Irving before crossing midcourt. Irving pump-faked a 3 and passed back to Doncic, who almost immediately gave it back to him on a bounce pass before the final turnover.

            “Great stop. Guys wanted to play it out. Trust the defense in that moment,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “Did a really good job of kind of disrupting their play, pressuring and denying the catch. Forced it out. It became a broken play.”

            Doncic, who finished with 33 points, said it was a great defensive play at the end for the visitors. 

            “We didn’t get a clear shot, we just passed (to) each other, but I think it was a great defense,"" Doncic said. ""I was trying to get him a shot, he was trying to give me a shot, At the end, nobody got a shot, but he was going off.”

            It was the second game Irving and Doncic played together. The Mavs have lost both, falling in overtime at Sacramento on Saturday night. Irving, acquired a week ago from the Brooklyn Nets, had played two road games for Dallas before that — both victories.

            “I really wanted this win,” Irving said. 

            First-time All-Star guard Anthony Edwards scored 32 points and Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who had their biggest lead at 89-63 on a long step-back jumper by Edwards midway through the third quarter.

            Dallas had that deficit down to 107-97 with about nine minutes left after a 25-foot shot by Irving, who on their previous possession tipped in Josh Green’s miss of a reverse layup.

            Irving, who made 11 of 12 shots in the fourth quarter, had a 3 in the final half-minute, soon after a turnover by Doncic.

            There was a stretch a couple of minutes before that when Irving made a bounce pass to Theo Pinson, who missed the layup — but the newly acquired eight-time All-Star was there for the rebound and putback. Doncic added a 3-pointer right after that. 

            “I’ve got to get a shot up, if anything, or allow Luca to have some space to get a shot and not turn the ball over in that situation,” Irving said of the closing seconds. “So it’s on me, just be smart in those situations. But if you look at the overall game, you know, I’m just grateful we were even in that position.""

            Christian Wood added 24 points for the Mavericks. He had 18 of those in the second quarter, including 13 in a row at one point

            Gobert was 9 of 9 from the field, and Jaden McDaniels was 7 of 8 while scoring 19 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809600,US renews warning it'll defend Philippines after China spat,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States renewed a warning that it would defend its treaty ally if Filipino forces come under attack in the disputed South China Sea, after a Chinese coast guard ship allegedly hit a Philippine patrol vessel with military-grade laser that briefly blinded some of its crew.

            President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. summoned Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian in Manila on Tuesday to express his serious concern “over the increasing frequency and intensity of actions by China against the Philippine coast guard and fishermen,"" Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said without elaborating.

            The Department of Foreign Affairs separately sent a strongly worded diplomatic protest to the Chinese Embassy that “condemned the shadowing, harassment, dangerous maneuvers, directing of military-grade laser, and illegal radio challenges” by the Chinese ship. 











            The incident took place Feb. 6. when the Chinese coast guard ship beamed high-grade lasers to block the Philippine patrol vessel BRP Malapascua from approaching Second Thomas Shoal on a resupply mission to Filipino forces there, according to Philippine officials. 

            China claims the South China Sea virtually in its entirety, putting it on a collision course with other claimants. Chinese naval forces have been accused of using military-grade lasers previously against Australian military aircraft on patrol in the South China Sea and other spots in the Pacific. 

            Despite friendly overtures to Beijing by former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in January in Beijing, tensions have persisted, drawing in closer military alliance between the Philippines and the U.S. 

            Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Monday that a Philippine coast guard vessel trespassed into Chinese waters without permission. Chinese coast guard vessels responded “professionally and with restraint at the site in accordance with China’s law and international law,” he said, without elaborating or mentioning the use of laser.

            U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said China’s “dangerous operational behavior directly threatens regional peace and stability, infringes upon freedom of navigation in the South China Sea as guaranteed under international law and undermines the rules-based international order.""

            “The United States stands with our Philippine allies,” Price said in a statement. 

            He said that an armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft, including those of the coast guard in the South China Sea, would invoke U.S. mutual defense commitments under a 1951 treaty. The treaty obligates the allies to help defend one another in case of an external attack.

            Aside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping claims in the resource-rich and busy waterway, where a bulk of the world’s commerce and oil transits.

            Washington lays no claims to the disputed sea but has deployed forces to patrol the waters to promote freedom of navigation and overflight — moves that have angered Beijing, which has warned Washington to stop meddling in what it says is a purely Asian dispute.

            The contested waters have become a volatile front in the broader rivalry between the U.S. and China in Asia and beyond.

            Price said the Chinese coast guard’s “provocative and unsafe” conduct interfered with the Philippines’ “lawful operations” in and around Second Thomas Shoal.

            In July, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on China to comply with a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated Beijing’s vast territorial claims in the South China Sea and warned that Washington was obligated to defend the Philippines under the Mutual Defense Treaty.

            On Monday, Price reiterated that the “legally binding decision” underscored that China “has no lawful maritime claims to the Second Thomas Shoal.” China has long rejected the ruling and continues to defy it. 

            The Philippines filed nearly 200 diplomatic protests against China’s aggressive actions in the disputed waters in 2022 alone.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809601,Scholar nominated to follow Kuroda as Bank of Japan chief,"TOKYO (AP) — An economist was nominated Tuesday to head Japan's central bank and take on the daunting task of guiding the world's third-largest economy to stronger, stable growth. 

            The government's choice of Kazuo Ueda, who earlier served on the central bank's policy board, to succeed Haruhiko Kuroda  came as a surprise to many when it was leaked to Japanese media last week. Most Bank of Japan governors have hailed from the Finance Ministry or the bank itself. 

            Kuroda will be stepping down on April 8 after serving two five-year terms, during which he pushed an unprecedented ultra-easy credit strategy meant to vanquish deflation, or chronically falling prices. While other major central banks have aggressively raised interest rates to cool decades-high inflation, the BOJ has stuck to monetary easing. Its key interest rate remains at minus 0.1%. 











            Some observers see choosing Ueda, 71, as a way for Kishida to differentiate his policies from the “Abenomics” strategy of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, mainly centered around near-zero interest rates and massive asset purchases by the central bank meant to combat stagnation. 

            Much of the burden for trying to jolt Japan out of its doldrums has fallen to the central bank. The Abenomics strategy also involved heavy government spending, but it made limited headway in enacting sweeping reforms to help Japan raise productivity and streamline bottlenecks in the economy. 

            The economy continued to meander between spells of modest growth and recession and then the pandemic and slowdowns in other major economies hobbled growth. The government reported Tuesday that the economy grew at an annual pace of 0.6% in October-December, after contracting 0.3% in previous quarter. 

            Disruptions from the pandemic, a shortage of imported parts from China and rising prices — especially for energy — have weighed on Japan's recovery even after Tokyo loosened precautions meant to keep COVID-19 outbreaks under control, allowing foreign tourists to enter after more than two years of stringent controls. 

            The economy grew at a 1.1% pace for full-year 2022.

            The government of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, whose support ratings have sagged, presented Ueda and other nominees for top BOJ posts to parliament Tuesday. Ueda will face questioning by lawmakers, but approval of his nomination is likely given that both houses of parliament are controlled by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. 

            “I plan to do my best to properly answer all the questioning in Parliament,” Ueda said on nationally televised news.

            Ueda is a graduate of the prestigious University of Tokyo and holds a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has taught at Japanese and foreign universities and has connections in international academic circles. Ueda was on the BOJ’s board of governors from 1998-2005. 

            Opposition parties raised objections, saying Ueda will likely stick to the Abenomics approach. 

            “What needs to be confronted instead is that Abenomics was a big mistake,” opposition lawmaker Akira Nagatsuma said on public broadcaster NHK TV. 

            Kuroda has described the policies he championed as a “big bazooka"" of monetary easing that was meant to force Japan out of a cycle of falling prices and stagnant growth. The BOJ now has gigantic holdings of Japanese government bonds and scant room to maneuver while moving toward a more neutral monetary stance. 

            The next BOJ chief will be grappling with inflationary pressures and potential slowdowns in other major economies where central banks are still raising rates to try to tame rising prices. Japan's consumer inflation rate is about 4% now, though much of that is due to soaring prices for imports of oil and other goods. 

            While the economy resumed growing in the last quarter, business investment remained weak and rising prices were straining both corporate and consumer budgets, Darren Tay of Capital Economics said in a report. 

            “With business investment slowing even quicker than we anticipated and a lower savings rate leaving less room for households to absorb rising prices, the coming exports slowdown due to likely recessions in other advanced economies should tip Japan into recession in the first half as well,"" he said.

            It's possible that Japan's growth may not be restored that easily, no matter what Ueda does. Other potential candidates for the BOJ governor post reportedly declined to be nominated for the job. 

            “One way to look at it is that there is just way too much for fiscal policy to solve on its own,” said Takashi Kozu, a director at the Securities Analysts Association of Japan. 

            “The question should be about how productivity is going to be improved,” he said in an interview with JB Press, an online business news outlet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809629,"Who should lead? Democrats, Republicans struggle to decide","WASHINGTON (AP) — While President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, are preparing for a possible rematch in 2024, a new poll finds a notable lack of enthusiasm within the parties for either man as his party's leader and a clear opening for new standard-bearers.

            About a third of both Democrats and Republicans are unsure of who they want leading their party, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

            No single Democrat captures significant support when asked who should be their party's leader; instead, Democrats sprinkle their attention across more than a dozen politicians. Yet they also feel more hopeful than dejected about their party. Some Republicans, meanwhile, coalesce around a couple of individuals — Trump included. But a majority remain uncommitted to him despite his grip on the party, and Republicans have grown somewhat more pessimistic about the GOP’s future.











            The findings reflect a deep sense of uncertainty about the future of the nation’s political parties and the challenges both face in tethering their frayed — and perhaps disenchanted — coalitions. 

            For Democrats, it's anotherwarning sign about the depth of Biden’s support amid concerns about nominating someone who would be 86 at the end of a second term. 

            “He’s certainly at an age where he’s not going to run for office, he’s gonna walk,” said David Townsend, a 58-year-old veteran services manager in Indianapolis who leans toward the Democratic Party. 

            Townsend said he would support Biden if he were the nominee, but he wants a new voice to lead with vigor and energy. He suggests Biden could have a role in shaping the future.

            “He needs to be on the lookout for a standard-bearer, someone that could carry his message forward,” Townsend said.

            Despite his status as an incumbent president who has accomplished many of the party's long-sought priorities, fewer than half of Democrats — 41% — identify Biden as the current leader of the party in an open-ended question. Just 12% said they want Biden in the role. 

            But Democrats are far from rallying behind someone else. They lack consensus on one individual — or even two or three — to lead them. Instead, in the open-ended question, 15 people are each mentioned by between 1% and 5% of Democrats. Thirty-seven percent say they don’t know or don’t answer the question.

            By contrast, among Republicans, 22% name Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and 20% name Trump as the individual they want to lead the party. 

            Republican Daniel Alvarez, 30, of Lakeland, Florida, likes both his governor, DeSantis, and Trump.

            “I would preferably take either one of those guys,” said Alvarez, a lineman for a telephone company. But if it came down to it, he’d choose Trump in a primary.

            “The country was better"" when Trump was president, he said.

            Still, there appears to be openness to a new face among Republicans, as there is among Democrats, even if there isn’t someone specific in mind.

            A majority of Republicans don’t choose Trump or DeSantis, though no other individual comes close to their level of support. Eleven others — including former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who launched her 2024 bid Tuesday — are each named by just 1% of Republicans.

            Angela Foster became emotional talking about how she feels the country is going in the wrong direction under Biden’s leadership. The 66-year-old Republican-leaning independent voted for Trump in 2020.

            “I would love to see Trump back in the Oval Office to straighten things up. Followed by DeSantis. That’s what I want. I want an eight-year plan,” she said with a laugh.

            But Foster, who lives in Gallipolis, Ohio, and works part-time as a cashier, said she wants to see the Republican Party get back to its traditional values and quit the infighting.

            Only 38% of Republicans say they are optimistic about the future of the Republican Party, while 36% are pessimistic and 24% say they feel neither. Pessimism has grown since October, when 27% said they were.

            By comparison, more Democrats look ahead with hope. Forty-four percent of Democrats say they are optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party, while 26% are pessimistic. An additional 30% say they are neither.

            Republicans who are pessimistic are less likely than optimistic ones to name a chosen leader. Overall, 34% of Republicans — more than either Trump or DeSantis get individually — say they don’t know or didn’t respond to the question.

            Hugh Lawing considers himself an independent who leans toward the Republican Party. He doesn’t want Trump to run and isn’t sure about DeSantis, who he said “wants to be “Trump Jr.” The 59-year-old retiree in Marietta, Georgia, hopes that more options will come forward.

            “It’s a long way away and it’s up in the air,” Lawing said.

            For Democrats, there’s no shortage of options, including lawmakers and others unlikely to seek the nomination. Trailing Biden at 12% as the preferred leader, new House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez each earn 5%. 

            Greg Davis, 34, voted for Biden in the 2020 general election. But as a self-identified social Democrat, he was “not impressed” with Biden during the primary campaign and would prefer a progressive candidate.

            “I would rather he not,” the Hilliard, Ohio resident said of Biden running for reelection. “But I don’t really have a specific candidate in mind.”

            Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and even former President Barack Obama are each named as the preferred party leader by 3% of Democrats.

            “I can’t admire that man enough,” Darlene Zwolinski said of Obama.

            Zwolinski, a 63-year-old acupuncturist in Lakewood, Colorado, said she’s happy with what Biden has done, but he was mainly the one “to get the win” against Trump and, for that reason, might have to be the one again.

            “If there was somebody in the wings that was like (Obama) that could step in, I would love to see Biden bless that person and maybe graciously bow out,"" she said. ""However, I don’t see anybody right now.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809631,Nicaragua's vote to strip opponents of citizenship,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Last week Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega packed off 222 political leaders, priests, students, activists and other dissidents to the United States, their release long demanded by the international community.

            Shortly after, Ortega’s government voted to strip the former prisoners of Nicaraguan citizenship. Analysts, legal experts and human rights groups are calling it a political ploy but also a violation of international law that they say is unprecedented — at least in the Western Hemisphere — in terms of scale and impact.

            A look at what has happened:











            ——-

            WHY DID NICARAGUA KICK THE DISSIDENTS OUT?

            The expulsion comes amid a broader push by the Ortega government to quash political dissent dating back to 2018 anti-government street protests that were met by a violent response from Nicaraguan security forces.

            Ortega has called his imprisoned opponents “traitors” and maintains they were behind the protests, which he claims were a foreign-funded plot to overthrow him. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have fled the government’s crackdown.

            The incarceration of government opponents became a sticking point internationally, particularly with the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, which used their detention to justify sanctions on the Central American nation.

            The release of the prisoners was, in part, a tactic to “minimize the public costs of his repression,” particularly in the eyes of the international community, said Ivan Briscoe of International Crisis Group, a nonprofit research group focused on resolving conflicts around the world.

            “He would prefer to revert to a steady, low-level authoritarian government in which there are no, perhaps none of the more visible forms of abuses, but continuing political control,” Briscoe said.

            U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters in Washington on Monday that the release of the prisoners was considered “a constructive step,” and is something Biden officials have said would open a door to a dialogue between the two countries.

            But Ortega’s Congress simultaneously voting to strip the citizenship of the expelled prisoners is drawing criticism.

            “This was in no way a panacea for the many concerns we have with the Nicaraguan regime, including the repression and oppression it continues to wield against its own people,” Price said.

            While Nicaragua’s Congress still needs to carry out a second vote to approve the constitutional change to formally strip those expelled of their nationality, it was unanimously approved in the initial vote. Ortega’s firm hold on power leaves any other outcome highly unlikely.

            “I think the message is very clear: On my land, there will be no opposition,” said Briscoe.

            ___

            WHY DO EXPERTS SAY IT VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL LAW?

            Peter J. Spiro, an international law professor at Temple University, and others say stripping away citizenship in this context violates a treaty adopted in 1961 by countries in the United Nations, including Nicaragua, which sets clear rules meant to prevent statelessness.

            The treaty states that governments cannot “deprive any person or group of persons of their nationality on racial, ethnic, religious or political grounds.”

            Spiro noted there are some circumstances when governments can terminate citizenship, such as ending nationality for someone who acquires citizenship in another country when the first nation prohibits dual citizenship. But, he said, ending citizenship is not allowed when it is used as a political weapon.

            “This is banishment, and banishment is antithetical to modern conceptions of human rights,” he said.

            Spain has offered its citizenship to the 222 exiles, while the U.S. granted the Nicaraguans a two-year temporary protection.

            But many of the former prisoners in the United States are left in a state of legal and mental flux, said Jennie Lincoln, senior adviser on Latin America for the Carter Center who is in touch with many of the dissidents.

            “Psychologically they are stateless,” Lincoln said. “They’re in shock, going from one day being in prison, then hours later on a plane to the United States. Imagine the psychological impact of that, and then being stripped of your citizenship.”

            ___

            HOW COMMON IS THE REVOCATION OF CITIZENSHIP?

            The move by Ortega is unprecedented in the Western Hemisphere, in both its size and reach, according to analysts and legal experts.

            Previous cases of states in the region moving to strip citizenship of political actors have always been limited in scale.

            In Chile in the 1970s, the Pinochet dictatorship stripped the citizenship of Orlando Letelier, who was living in exile where leading opposition to political repression in the South American nation.

            Spiro, at Temple University, said Ortega's action does bear some resemblance to what has been done in Bahrain, in the Middle East.

            Over the course of years, the Bahrain government has stripped hundreds of human rights and political activists, journalists and religious scholars of their nationalities, leaving them stateless. In 2018, a court stripped 115 people of their citizenship in one mass trial on accusations of terrorism, according to Human Rights Watch.

            “But Ortega’s move is more high-visibility,” Spiro said.

            ___

            WHAT ABOUT PRISONERS WHO DIDN'T GO TO THE U.S.?

            Experts are especially concerned about Roman Catholic Bishop Rolando Álvarez, a vocal critic of Ortega who refused to board the plane to the U.S. with the other prisoners.

            He told those close to him that if he got on the plane, it would be like admitting to a crime he never committed.

            Shortly after, Álvarez was sentenced to 26 years in prison — famous for their poor conditions — and stripped of his citizenship within Nicaragua, something sharply condemned by State Department officials.

            It left him in a legal limbo more extreme than his counterparts in the U.S. 

            Until now, no one has been able to contact Álvarez, nor confirm for themselves where he is or if the he is safe, said a person close to Álvarez, who asked not to be quoted by name out of fear of reprisal.

            “From a legal point of view, his future looks completely grim, and he knows it,” the man said.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Last week Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega packed off 222 political leaders, priests, students, activists and other dissidents to the United States, their release long demanded by the international community.Shortly after, Ortega’s government voted to strip the former prisoners of Nicaraguan citizenship.

            Both teams continued to integrate players acquired at the trade deadline last week. Matisse Thybulle, acquired from Philadelphia in a four-team trade, made his debut for the Blazers and started. He had 14 points and four 3-pointers. 

            D’Angelo Russell, who the Lakers got as part of the trade that sent Russell Westbrook to Utah, started for the second straight game and finished with 16 points. Malik Beasley, who came from the Jazz, had 22 points off the bench. 

            Mo Bamba, who was traded to the Lakers from the Orlando Magic at the deadline, continues to serve a four-game suspension for an on-court altercation with Minnesota's Austin Rivers during a game on Feb. 3. 

            The Blazers went on a 20-2 run in the opening quarter that ended with Nassir Little's 3-pointer that made it 25-16. Portland made 10 3-pointers in the quarter, including Lillard's 3 from distance at the buzzer that stretched the lead to 34-19. 

            Lillard had 30 points and eight 3-pointer to lead all scorers at halftime, and the Blazers led 65-46. 

            Portland led 101-79 going into the final quarter.

            Fardaws Aimaq had a season-high 12 points for the Red Raiders, who led by 13 in the second half before fending off the Longhorns down the stretch.

            Texas Tech (14-12, 3-10 Big 12) also topped No. 12 Kansas State on Saturday. 











            “Obviously, I’m extremely excited for these guys,” Red Raiders coach Mark Adams said. “It was a great team effort. That is a good basketball team that we beat. Texas plays hard. We matched their intensity and played, I thought, 40 minutes of great basketball.”

            Texas (20-6, 9-4) tied the game at 64 on a 3-pointer by Dylan Disu, but Tech responded by scoring the next six points as Obanor had two dunks and Aimaq converted a tip-in. Harmon added a driving basket with 35.1 seconds remaining, and the Red Raiders held on.

            “Give them credit,” Texas interim coach Rodney Terry said. “They made shots. Our guys had great effort. We just didn’t do enough to put ourselves in position to win. In our league, anybody can beat anybody.”

            Marcus Carr led the Longhorns with 23 points, and Disu scored 11.

            “We’re a team that has been through a lot of adversity this season,” Obanor said. “It’s like being in a boxing match, and you get beat up, but it speaks to your character when you get back up, have a sense of urgency and refuse to give up.”

            Texas Tech scored on seven consecutive possessions spanning halftime, taking a 51-38 lead. Texas used a 12-4 spurt to get within 59-54, and a 3 by Tyrese Hunter trimmed it to 64-61 before Disu’s tying shot.

            Harmon had 21 points in the first half and scored his team’s final seven as the Red Raiders took a 44-35 lead at the break. Both teams connected on more than 45% of their shots. Tech went 7 of 12 from 3-point range, and Texas countered by shooting 6 for 11 from beyond the arc.

            After the Longhorns pulled to 37-35 on Carr's 3-pointer with 1:40 remaining in the half, Harmon answered with a short jumper in the lane, two free throws and a 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded. 

            Texas’ shooting cooled in the second half as the Longhorns connected on 10 of 30 shots overall and went 5 of 16 from 3-point range. Texas Tech tightened its defense after halftime, forcing the Longhorns to work on every possession. 

            “They play well here,” Terry said. “Texas Tech has good personnel and a coach who does a great job getting them in position.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809634,"Rumors swirl about balloons, UFOs as officials stay mum","WASHINGTON (AP) — Maybe they came from China. Maybe from somewhere farther away. A lot farther away.

            The downing of four aerial devices by U.S. warplanes has touched off rampant misinformation about the objects, their origin and their purpose, showing how complicated world events and a lack of information can quickly create the perfect conditions for unchecked conjecture and misinformation.

            The presence of mysterious objects high in the sky doesn't help.











            “There will be an investigation and we will learn more, but until then this story has created a playground for people interested in speculating or stirring the pot for their own reasons,"" said Jim Ludes, a former national defense analyst who now leads the Pell Center for International Relations at Salve Regina University. 

            “In part,"" Ludes added, ""because it feeds into so many narratives about government secrecy.”

            President Joe Biden and other top Washington officials have said little about the repeated shootdowns, which began with a suspected Chinese spy balloon earlier this month. Three more unidentified devices have been shot down, with the latest Sunday over Lake Huron. Pentagon officials said they posed no security threats but have not disclosed their origins or purpose.

            On Monday, many social media sites in the U.S. lit up with theories that Biden had deployed the aerial devices as a way to distract Americans from other, more pressing issues. Those concerns included immigration, inflation, the war in Ukraine and Republican investigations into Hunter Biden, the president's son.

            While the concentration of claims was highest on fringe sites popular with far-right Americans, the unfounded rumors and conspiracy theories popped up on bigger platforms like Twitter and Facebook, too. 

            One of the most popular theories suggested the White House and Pentagon are using the airborne devices to divert attention from a chemical spill earlier this month in Ohio.

            That incident, caused by a train derailment, occurred several days before the most recent devices were shot down, and was covered extensively. Nonetheless, the spill remained the top subject searched on Google on Monday, showing continued public interest in the story.

            China's government apparently took notice. On Tuesday Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted a link to news coverage of the Ohio chemical leak and added #OhioChernobyl, a hashtag used in many posts that suggest the incident is being covered up.

            “Apparently some in the US take a wandering civilian balloon as a big threat while the explosive train derailment and toxic chemical leak not,” she wrote in the tweet, which racked up tens of thousands of views within hours Tuesday.

            Misleading claims about the airborne devices have also prompted violent threats, according to an analysis by the SITE Intelligence Group, a firm that tracks extremist rhetoric online. After the White House said earlier surveillance flights went undetected during Donald Trump's presidency, an article circulated on far-right sites urging the execution of any Trump administration officials who may have withheld the information.

            Trump administration officials have said they knew of no such surveillance craft.

            Some commenters said Biden’s decision to wait until the balloon had reached the East Coast before shooting it down showed he was in league with China. Others, meanwhile, chastised Biden for shooting down foreign aircraft that they imagined could be carrying bioweapons or nuclear weapons.

            Alongside the political conspiracy theories were suggestions that the aerial objects were extraterrestrial in origin. Photos of alleged UFOs were shared online and web searches for the term “UFO” soared around the world Sunday, according to information from Google Trends.

            Online posts mentioning extraterrestrials increased by nearly 300% since the first balloon was identified, according to an analysis conducted for The Associated Press by Zignal Labs, a San Francisco-based media intelligence firm. Zignal’s review included millions of posts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit.

            “Don’t worry, just some of my friends of mine stopping by,” Elon Musk, the CEO of Twitter, Tesla and SpaceX, joked in a tweet Sunday.

            Humor aside, while the details of the different claims vary, they have two things in common: a lack of evidence and a strong distrust of America’s elected leaders.

            “Maybe Joe built the balloon & had Hunter launch it to scare we the people!” wrote one Facebook user. “How do WE know??? We don’t!”

            The federal government must balance the public's desire to know the details with the need for secrecy regarding national security and defense, Ludes said. That's not likely to satisfy Biden's critics, Ludes said, or prevent misleading explanations from going viral.

            High-profile news stories and events often precede a spike in false and misleading claims as people turn to the internet for explanations. Conspiracy theories about Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin spread quickly after his dramatic on-field collapse in January. Something similar happened last year when the Nord Stream pipelines in the North Sea were damaged. 

            In that instance, Russia spread conspiracy theories blaming the U.S. for the sabotage. The baseless theories were quickly amplified by far-right users in the U.S. It's not the first time America's authoritarian adversaries have seized on global events to portray the U.S. as belligerent.

            China has claimed the balloon shot down Feb. 4 was engaged in meteorological research. On Monday, China’s foreign ministry said 10 U.S. balloons had entered Chinese airspace without permission in the past year.

            Beijing's response to this latest diplomatic row seeks to portray China as the responsible actor, while sidestepping surveillance allegations made by the U.S., according to Kenton Thibaut, a China expert at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, a Washington-based organization that tracks foreign disinformation and propaganda.

            “It’s about projecting an image of responsibility and rationality, of being the adult in the room,” Thibaut said of China's response. “It's a clear signal to nations in the developing world that the U.S. is selfish, untrustworthy and hypocritical.”

            On Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did refute one viral claim to have emerged from the balloon saga. 

            “I know there have been questions and concerns about this, but there is no — again no indication — of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent takedowns,” Jean-Pierre told reporters. “I wanted to make sure that the American people knew that, all of you knew that and it was important for us to say that from here because we’ve been hearing a lot about it.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Maybe they came from China.

Harmon added a driving basket with 35.1 seconds remaining, and the Red Raiders held on.Marcus Carr led the Longhorns with 23 points, and Disu scored 11.NO. 9 BAYLOR 79, WEST VIRGINIA 65WACO, Texas (AP) — LJ Cryer scored 26 points to lead four players in double figures, and Baylor won its fourth straight game.Cryer was 8 for 11 from 3-point range to lead the Bears (20-6, 9-4 Big 12), who have won 10 of their last 11 after an 0-3 start in the conference.Adam Flagler added 13 points and Jalen Bridges had 12 for Baylor, which shot 51% from the floor and was 14 for 27 from 3-point range.

The combination helped Miami stretch out the lead to as many as 14 points, with Miller and Pack leading the way from either behind the arc or with Miller’s nifty moves inside.R.J. Davis scored 23 points while Caleb Love had 20 for UNC (16-10, 8-7), which shot 43.9%.

The second chip, named Cypress, is expected to be handed over to TSMC in the second quarter of this year.Google’s in-house chip production is part of a wider trend over recent years that has seen big tech companies increasingly producing their own chips for use in their own personal electronics, web hosting, and other electronics products.",2023/02/14,5091,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809685,"Warriors beat Wizards 135-126, snap two-game losing streak","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — After illness and injury twice interrupted his season and threw off his rhythm, Andrew Wiggins sure needed a dominant game like this.

            JaMychal Green did, too, because he has also been through the wringer dealing first with COVID-19 then an infection in his lower right leg. Now, he's dealing with a tender wrist.

            Wiggins had 29 points and seven rebounds, Klay Thompson scored 27 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Washington Wizards 135-126 on Monday night in their final home game before the All-Star break.











            “Definitely his best game since he's been back, he had a lot of good games early in the season but I loved his aggressiveness, he was attacking the rim all night and got it going from the mid-range and just got us a lot of key buckets when we were starting to fade a little bit,” coach Steve Kerr said of Wiggins. 

            Green went 4 of 4 from deep and made all five of his field goals for 14 points to go with five assists and backup point guard Ty Jerome had nine points, seven assists and one turnover. 

            Jerome praised Green's efforts through it all, staying upbeat even the days he doesn't get in the game. 

            “I don't care how many years you've been in the league, I don't care how old you are, it's not easy,” Jerome said. “So to be perfect from the field tonight, to be good on defense, he always brings a toughness factor for us every night. That's who he is as a shooter, so it's good to see them fall like that. Wiggs looked like an All-Star tonight. That's who he is.”

            Fellow reserve Donte DiVincenzo added 17 points off the bench, while Kevon Looney contributed 13 points and 13 rebounds as the Warriors snapped a two-game skid. The defending champions played without Stephen Curry for a fourth straight game because of a left leg injury that will keep him out until sometime after the All-Star break.

            Kristaps Porzingis scored 34 points on 12-of-16 shooting for a Wizards team that had won 8 of 11 and five of its previous six road games. Bradley Beal added 33 points and reach 15,000 career points. He received a $25,000 from the NBA earlier in the day for making contact with a game official in the third quarter Saturday against Indiana.

            The Warriors swept the season series after winning 127-118 in Washington last month.

            The Wizards used a 14-3 run late in the first to build a 39-29 lead after the opening period, but Golden State’s 42-point second quarter put the Warriors ahead 71-66 at the break.

            PAYTON'S HEALTH

            Newly acquired Golden State guard Gary Payton II will be out for at least a month as he fully recovers from offseason surgery for a core muscle injury, and Warriors general manager Bob Myers is awaiting a decision from the NBA on whether Portland withheld anything on Payton’s health before trading him last week. 

            Myers is hopeful the defensive guard returns before the playoffs. Payton is listed on the injury report with right adductor soreness, stemming from the abdominal area. 

            ""What do I want? Whatever the NBA says is fair, just whatever that is,” Myers said Monday of receiving any potential compensation from the Trail Blazers. “I just want a fair result. I don’t know, whatever it takes, it takes, I don’t know how long.”

            Payton received a rousing ovation when welcomed back on the big screen in the first half.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — After illness and injury twice interrupted his season and threw off his rhythm, Andrew Wiggins sure needed a dominant game like this.JaMychal Green did, too, because he has also been through the wringer dealing first with COVID-19 then an infection in his lower right leg. Now, he's dealing with a tender wrist.Wiggins had 29 points and seven rebounds, Klay Thompson scored 27 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Washington Wizards 135-126 on Monday night in their final home game before the All-Star break.“Definitely his best game since he's been back, he had a lot of good games early in the season but I loved his aggressiveness, he was attacking the rim all night and got it going from the mid-range and just got us a lot of key buckets when we were starting to fade a little bit,” coach Steve Kerr said of Wiggins.Green went 4 of 4 from deep and made all five of his field goals for 14 points to go with five assists and backup point guard Ty Jerome had nine points, seven assists and one turnover.Jerome praised Green's efforts through it all, staying upbeat even the days he doesn't get in the game.“I don't care how many years you've been in the league, I don't care how old you are, it's not easy,” Jerome said. “So to be perfect from the field tonight, to be good on defense, he always brings a toughness factor for us every night. That's who he is as a shooter, so it's good to see them fall like that. Wiggs looked like an All-Star tonight. That's who he is.”Fellow reserve Donte DiVincenzo added 17 points off the bench, while Kevon Looney contributed 13 points and 13 rebounds as the Warriors snapped a two-game skid. The defending champions played without Stephen Curry for a fourth straight game because of a left leg injury that will keep him out until sometime after the All-Star break.Kristaps Porzingis scored 34 points on 12-of-16 shooting for a Wizards team that had won 8 of 11 and five of its previous six road games. Bradley Beal added 33 points and reach 15,000 career points. He received a $25,000 from the NBA earlier in the day for making contact with a game official in the third quarter Saturday against Indiana.The Warriors swept the season series after winning 127-118 in Washington last month.The Wizards used a 14-3 run late in the first to build a 39-29 lead after the opening period, but Golden State’s 42-point second quarter put the Warriors ahead 71-66 at the break.PAYTON'S HEALTHNewly acquired Golden State guard Gary Payton II will be out for at least a month as he fully recovers from offseason surgery for a core muscle injury, and Warriors general manager Bob Myers is awaiting a decision from the NBA on whether Portland withheld anything on Payton’s health before trading him last week.Myers is hopeful the defensive guard returns before the playoffs.
