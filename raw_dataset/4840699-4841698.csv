""I think he would have fought me on it if the score was different.”Arenado, the St. Louis Cardinals third baseman, grimaced then flexed and unflexed his right hand after being struck by an 88.9 mph fastball thrown by Cuba pitcher Elian Leyva.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840718,Bratt scores 3 as Devils rally for 5-2 win over Lightning,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Jesper Bratt scored three goals for his first NHL hat trick as the New Jersey Devils rallied from two goals down and beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 5-2 on Sunday night to end a three-game skid.Nico Hischier and Nolan Foote also scored to help the Devils improve their league-leading road record to 26-5-4. Vitek Vanecek finished with 22 saves to help New Jersey get a win after losing at home to the Lightning on Tuesday and Thursday before blowing a 2-0 lead in a 4-2 loss at Florida on Saturday.“We played way better today,” Hischier said. “It would have been a tough one to swallow if we’d given up the lead again, but we all-around played our game. You just have to learn from those games. We know that if we play our game, we can beat those teams. That’s what we have to understand.”Nikita Kucherov reached the 100-point mark for the third time in his career with a goal in the first period and Alex Killorn also scored for the Lightning, who had won three straight. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 34 saves.“We have to go back to keeping it simple,” defenseman Zach Bogosian said after the Lightning committed 16 turnovers. “We are a very successful team on the forecheck and getting pucks behind them and then going to work.”Kucherov put Tampa Bay ahead 1-0 at 3:26 of the first period, one-timing a power-play feed from Steven Stamkos past Vanecek to reach the 100-point mark. Kucherov previously had 100 points in 2017-18 and then led the NHL with 128 in 2018-19.Killorn made it 2-0 at 6:30 of the second, drifting unchecked into the slot before beating Vanecek. But the Devils responded 9 seconds later when Bratt took a pass from Hischier and beat Vasilevskiy with a wrist shot from the slot.Devils coach Lindy Ruff said Bratt scoring so quickly after Killorn’s goal was huge.“We talked this morning about momentum, capturing momentum,” Ruff said. “They can either keep it after scoring their second goal, or we can answer. I thought the quick answer with Bratt’s goal was probably the turning point of the game.”Lightning coach Jon Cooper agreed.“I really liked our first period and the first eight minutes of the second,” he said. “We scored that second goal after they had a couple of chances ... then an inexcusable goal off a faceoff right away. That never should have happened. That just triggered their momentum. Then it was just senseless turnovers and managing the puck.“They are a pretty young, fast, skilled team and they were feeling it.”Bratt tied it another 2:43 later when his straightaway shot from just inside the blue line sailed through traffic and past Vasilevskiy.Hischier, the first played taken in the 2017 NHL Draft, became a 30-goal scorer for the first time and put New Jersey ahead with just under eight minutes left in the middle period by beating Vasilevskiy from the high slot.Foote made it 4-2 at 9:51 of the third with his first of the season, and Bratt completed his hat trick with an empty-netter with 11.6 seconds remaining for his 30th.Bratt said getting his 30th goal on the same night as Hischier meant a little extra. The two entered the NHL with the Devils in 2017-18 and have spent a lot of time on the same line since then.“For us to both hit 30 on such a special win for us as a group was awesome,” he said. “I’m happy for us both.”HONORING PALATThe Lightning honored forward Ondrej Palat with a video tribute during the first media timeout in his first visit to Amalie Arena since signing with New Jersey as a free agent last summer. Palat played his first 10 NHL seasons with the Lightning, helping them win the Stanley Cup in 2020 and 2021.UP NEXTDevils: Host Minnesota on Tuesday night.Lightning: At Montreal on Tuesday night.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840719,Florida Atlantic ends Fairleigh Dickinson's run for Sweet 16,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Fairleigh Dickinson came up just a little short this time.Johnell Davis scored 29 points, Alijah Martin added 14 and Florida Atlantic ended underdog FDU's magical March by outlasting the No. 16 seed 78-70 on Sunday night in the NCAA Tournament.The ninth-seeded Owls (33-3) needed everything they had to put away the Knights (21-16), the nation's smallest team and a surprise winner Friday night over 7-foot-4 center Zach Edey and top-seeded Purdue in just the second 16-over-1 upset in tournament history.It will be FAU, not FDU, which will play Tennessee in the East Region semifinals on Thursday at Madison Square Garden in New York.“It’s a nice place,” Davis said of the world's most famous arena. “But we’ve still got to go in and put the work in as every other gym.”Davis certainly put in the work against FDU, finishing with 12 rebounds, five assists and five steals in 34 minutes.The Knights couldn't come up with an encore after eliminating Purdue, but not before fighting to the finish.When their tourney ended, first-year coach Tobin Anderson and FDU's players walked across the floor of Nationwide Arena to thank their fans, most of whom never expected to spend five days in Ohio watching their team make history.Demetre Roberts scored 20 points and Sean Moore had 14 for FDU, which didn't even win the Northeast Conference tournament before becoming an NCAA team that won't soon be forgotten. The Knights followed up a win in the play-in game at Dayton by ousting the Big Ten champion Boilermakers and taking FAU to the wire.“We always talk about 6-0 runs, we were one 6-0 run away from the Sweet 16,"" Anderson said. ""We went toe to toe with a top-five team in the country, and this team is a top 25 team in the country. We went toe to toe the last few days with two great teams and didn’t back down, didn’t go away.""We’re not just happy to be here.”FAU, which edged Memphis on Friday for the school's first NCAA tourney win, finally took control late in the second half of a game that was played at high speeds and at times looked more like a playground pickup game.FDU was still within 67-64 when Davis fought for a rebound and made a put-back. After Roberts missed a long 3, FAU’s Bryan Greenlee knocked down a 3-pointer and the Owls pushed their lead to 10.The Knights got within 76-70, and still had a chance when Greenlee missed two free throws. But Roberts, FDU's lightning-quick 5-foot-8 guard, misfired on a layup, and the graduate student who followed Anderson to FDU from Division II St. Thomas Aquinas began to untuck his jersey, knowing his tournament was over.Anderson, who turned around a program that went 4-22 a year ago, told his players not to foul and let the final seconds run off.But FAU’s Martin tried and missed a 360-degree dunk, leading to an awkward exchange and tense postgame handshake between Anderson and Owls coach Dusty May.“I apologized to him for that but also reminded him we’re the adults,"" May said. ""We’ve got to fix that behavior. It’s part of the game. I apologized to him.”FDU came up short in its bid to become the first No. 16 to win twice in the tournament. The same thing happened to UMBC five years ago. After shocking No. 1 overall seed Virginia, the Retrievers lost to Kansas State in the second round.Strikingly similar in their playing styles on the floor, there was also a commonality between the fan bases as “F-D-U” chants from one side of the court were met with cries of “F-A-U” from the other as the teams traded baskets.May was proud of his team's composure and ability to perform when it felt like the world was in FDU's corner.“We never felt like we were a Cinderella team,” said May, who got his hoops start as a student manager at Indiana under coach Bob Knight. ""We went into an SEC school and won and have been in some very tough environments.“But obviously when you’re playing FDU and they’re on the run they’re on, they’re easy to root for.”For Anderson and the Knights, the tournament is over. The memories will carry them.“Last year, we were 4-22,” he said, “and we’re right there to go to the Sweet 16. If that’s not one of the most amazing things I’ve seen in my life or anybody else has seen, that’s crazy. So every part of this I’ll remember forever and they will too.”BIG PICTUREFAU: The Owls will carry a nine-game winning streak into their matchup against the fourth-seeded Volunteers, who took out Duke on Saturday. FAU does have some experience against SEC schools this season, losing at Ole Miss and winning at Florida.FDU: The Knights seemingly came out of nowhere to become the tourney’s biggest story. Anderson said he and his assistant coaches have already heard from players interested in joining them in Teaneck, New Jersey.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840720,"Pettersson, Hughes shine in Canucks' 2-1 win over Ducks","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Elias Pettersson had a power-play goal and an assist to extend his point streak to eight games, Quinn Hughes had two assists to give him 60 for the season, and the Vancouver Canucks beat the Anaheim Ducks 2-1 on Sunday night.J.T. Miller had a goal and an assist, and Collin Delia made 17 saves to help the Canucks win for the seventh time in eight games.“We were pretty relentless from the get go,” Delia said. “I think that’s got to be our M.O., you know. Just keep our feet moving, be hard on pucks, supporting each other. Give credit, you saw it all night, the guys were working for each other.”Ryan Strome scored to spoil Delia’s shutout bid with 6:50 left in the third and John Gibson had 38 saves for the Ducks, who were eliminated from playoff contention.“In the third period, we had some desperation and we put some pucks towards the net and forechecked hard and were competitive,” Strome said. “Unfortunate we didn’t get a 60-minute effort.”After Pettersson, Miller and Hughes combined for five points in a 3-2 shootout win at Los Angeles on Saturday, they continued their torrid production by working together to generate the opening two goals.“We play fast, we play skilled. We can make plays,” Pettersson said.Miller buried a slap shot from above the left circle off a pass from Hughes midway through the first.Pettersson made it 2-0 at 1:31 of the second with a wrist shot in the right circle on the Canucks’ first power play, giving him five goals and seven assist during his streak.Hughes had the primary assist to become the first NHL defenseman in nearly 30 years with consecutive 60-assist seasons. Ray Bourque had five such campaigns from 1989-90 through 1993-94, and Paul Coffey had back-to-back seasons in 1992-93 and 1993-94.“His breakouts are incredible,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said of Hughes, who has 20 assists in his past 20 games. “The Coffeys of the world, the (Scott) Niedermayers, Bourque, they’re great breakout guys. … And I don’t want to give it to him yet, but he’s climbing that ladder.”Hughes and Henrik Sedin are the only players in Canucks history with multiple 60-assist seasons. Sedin did it six times.Pettersson said Hughes’ contributions go well beyond creating offense from the blue line.“His numbers shows it, but he has made plays all over the ice. And then, I mean, this year he’s taken more of a leadership role. Playing a lot better, playing a lot on the PK, and he’s good for us all over the ice,” Pettersson said.STAYING HOMEThe Ducks will miss the postseason for the fifth straight year, extending the longest drought in franchise history. Prior to this stretch, they had not gone longer than three years without playoff hockey, starting with their first three seasons as an expansion team in 1993-94 through 1995-96 and again from 1999-2000 to 2001-02.“I think everyone understands where we are as a club, a team that’s retooling and trying to shape things for the future. But the guys in the locker room had high expectations for ourselves this year and fell short for that. It’s not a spot that we want to be in, but we have to do things the right way to prepare for the future,” defenseman Cam Fowler said.NOTES: Pettersson picked up a point for the 10th straight road game, the longest run by a Vancouver player since Sedin opened the 2013-14 season with two goals and 10 assists in the first 10 games away from home. ...

Antetokounmpo had his 33rd career triple-double, making all nine of his field goal attempts.Lopez scored the first eight points of the fourth quarter on a pair of 3-point plays and a dunk to put Milwaukee in front 97-95. Middleton’s free throw capped the 15-2 run that put the Bucks up 104-97.“We settled down, we got back in control,” said Lopez, who outscored Toronto 17-16 in the fourth quarter. “We talked about the third quarter-fourth quarter break. They just shot more times than us. We were shooting just as well, or better than them from two and three. We just had to take care of the ball and keep them off the offensive glass.”A dunk by Jakob Poeltl brought Toronto within 110-107, but Lopez scored underneath and Jrue Holiday hit two free throws to make it 114-107 with 1:29 remaining.Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said Lopez’s outburst to start the fourth quarter was key.“It changed the game,” Budenholzer said. “I think what he did offensively was important, and then the defense always stands out. It was a little bit muddy, not a pretty game there, and he stepped up and kind of just changed our feel and changed the momentum for us, particularly offensively, which we needed tonight.”Fred VanVleet had 23 points and O.G. Anunoby added 22 for the Raptors, who had won their three previous games. Toronto missed a chance to move into eighth in the East Conference ahead of Atlanta, which lost to San Antonio 126-118.“All these games are important to us, that’s for sure,” said Toronto coach Nick Nurse, whose team plays their next four at home. “I like, kind of, how we’re playing. I think we’re very well for long stretches of games. Hopefully, we can just keep building on that.”Anunoby and Gary Trent Jr. hit back-to-back 3-pointers to put the Raptors up 83-76 with just under 4 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. Toronto led 95-89 entering the final period.“There was just two little probably bad stretches,” Nurse said. “In those stretches, they kind of got a couple of at the rim ... a couple of and-ones. We just kind of lost our rim protection, and then kicked out and made a couple 3s after we kind of got that fixed. Give them credit, they made a couple big ones down the stretch when they needed them.”The Bucks hit seven of their 16 3-pointers in the first period en route to a 33-29 lead.TIP-INS Raptors: F Scottie Barnes exited in the second quarter with a left wrist injury and did not return.Bucks: F Jae Crowder missed his second straight game with left calf soreness. C Meyers Leonard was a late scratch, also with left calf soreness.GIANNIS MOST BUCKS GAMES PLAYEDAntetokounmpo, in his 10th season with the Bucks, played in his franchise-record 712th game, surpassing Junior Bridgeman. Antetokounmpo already was the franchise leader in points, assists, triple-doubles, free throws and minutes played. “It’s a great feeling. I wasn’t aware of it coming into the game,” Antetokounmpo said. “It’s been a long, long journey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840722,US routs Cuba 14-2 to reach World Baseball Classic final,"MIAMI (AP) — Trea Turner, Paul Goldschmidt and an unrelenting U.S. lineup kept putting crooked numbers on the scoreboard, a dynamic display of the huge gap between an American team of major leaguers and Cubans struggling on the world stage as top players have left the island nation.Turner homered twice to give him a tournament-leading four, driving in four runs to lead the U.S. to a 14-2 rout Sunday night and advance the defending champion Americans to the World Baseball Classic final.Goldschmidt also homered and had four RBIs and Cedric Mullins went deep in a game interrupted three times by fans running on the field to display protest signs.“The team kind of represents the government over there, and people aren’t too happy about it,” U.S. manager Mark DeRosa said.The U.S. plays Japan or Mexico in Tuesday night’s championship, trying to join the Samurai Warriors as the only nations to win the title twice.“I think it took us a little bit of time, but now we kind of found our stride a little bit,” Turner said.Turner has a tournament-leading 10 RBIs. He followed his go-ahead, eighth-inning grand slam a night earlier against Venezuela with a solo homer in the second inning off Roenis Elias (0-1) and a three-run drive in the sixth against Elian Leyva.“I kept saying every time he went deep, who is the idiot that’s hitting him ninth?” DeRosa said.Cuba went ahead when its first four batters reached off Adam Wainwright (2-0) without getting a ball out of the infield. After forcing in a run with a walk to Alfredo Despaigne, the 41-year-old right-hander recovered to strand the bases loaded.“I put myself in that situation in the first place by making horrible PFP plays — or not making PFP plays,” Wainwright said in a reference to pitchers' fielding practice and two grounders he failed to come up with.American batters had 14 hits, including eight for extra bases, and seven walks as they scored in seven of eight innings — five with multiple runs. Goldschmidt hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the first on a 112 mph rocket high over the left-field wall. He added a two-run single in the fifth.“For me that was one of my favorite home runs I’ve ever hit in my entire life,” Goldschmidt said.St. Louis third baseman Nolan Arenado left after he was hit on his right hand by a pitch in the fifth inning, briefly raising another injury concern before X-rays came back as negative. Mets closer Edwin Díaz sustained a season-ending knee injury during the celebration that followed Puerto Rico’s win on Wednesday and Houston second baseman Jose Altuve broke a thumb when hit by a pitch while playing for Venezuela on Saturday.Fans in the sellout crowd of 35,779 at loanDepot Park sounded evenly split between the U.S. and Cuba. Several hundred people gathered before the game outside the ballpark in Miami’s Little Havana section to protest the presence of the Cuban team, whose country has been under communist rule since 1959.Play was briefly interrupted in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings when fans ran onto the field. The first held a banner that read “Libertad Para Los Presos Cubanos del 11 de Julio (Freedom for the Cuban Prisoners of July 11)” referring to the date of 2021 demonstrations.“There were provocations, but we never paid attention to it,” Cuba manager Armando Johnson said.Cuban fans roared in the early going when their team’s first four batters strung together three infield hits and a bases-loaded walk. Wainwright allowed one run and five hits in four innings. Cardinals teammate Miles Mikolas followed with four innings and Aaron Loup finished.An Olympic gold medalist in 1992, 1996 and 2004, Cuba’s national team has faltered as many top players left for MLB. Cuba failed to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Games.Cuba this year is for the first using some players under contract to MLB clubs, including Chicago White Sox Gold Glove centerfielder Luis Robert and third baseman Yoán Moncada — who were booed. But many Cuban big leaguers were absent.“We would like for the other players to join,” Johnson said. “They should think about it and return to Cuba.”SECOND GUESSEDDeRosa on what he did after Saturday night’s come-from-behind quarterfinal win over Venezuela.""I was reading how horrible a manager I was on social media first,” he said.OTHER SIDE OF THE BRACKETIn the other semifinal, Japan starts 21-year-old sensation Roki Sasaki against Mexico and the Los Angeles Angels’ Patrick Sandoval on Monday night.TRAINER'S ROOMMoncada left after the third baseman collided in the sixth inning with left fielder Roel Santos, who caught Kyle Schwarber's fly.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840741,Upcoming German minister's trip to Taiwan will deepen bilateral ties,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — German Minister of Education and Research Bettina Stark-Watzinger’s upcoming visit to Taiwan will bolster bilateral ties, German scholars have said.
Stark-Watzinger will be in Taiwan from March 21-22 and is scheduled to meet with National Science and Technology Council Chair Wu Tsung-tsong (吳政忠), Minister of Education Pan Wen-chung (潘文忠), and Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang (唐鳳). Her trip will focus on cooperation in semiconductors, green energy, EV batteries, and Mandarin education.
Stark-Watzinger is the highest-level German official to visit Taiwan since former Minister of Economy Gunter Rexrodt came in 1997, according to the Daily Mirror.
Gudrun Wacker, an expert on Taiwan Strait affairs at the Berlin-based government think tank German Institute for International and Security Affairs (Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik), said that German ministers have stopped visiting Taiwan since the 1990s due to “intensified” political and economic ties with China. Though unofficial exchanges with Taiwan continued, Germany was intent on avoiding any actions that might “annoy” China, Wacker said.










She pointed out that Stark-Watzinger's trip to Taiwan symbolizes Germany’s return to normalcy after decades of self-censorship. She said that “From a Western and German perspective, Taiwan is a valued partner in every sense of the word—a model democracy in Asia that also behaves responsibly internationally.""
Wacker added that deepening exchanges with Taiwan does not violate Germany’s ""one China” policy.
Janka Oertel, Asia director at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, praised the education minister’s visit as “exactly the type of cooperation” that Germany wants with Taiwan. “It is a clear signal that these are two progressive governments that want to expand cooperation in the areas of economic innovation, high-tech, and research cooperation,"" she said.
Oertel said the trip also creates awareness in Germany that “Taiwan is a place of freedom, democracy, and innovation whose existence is in danger.” Public attention can help protect it, she said.
“Germany must be clear about the signals it is sending to Taiwan and China,” the director said. Any action should be about ""ensuring Taiwan's security, integrating it internationally, and protecting it from violent annexation by China,"" she added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840762,Taiwan vows heavy penalties for scalping in wake of Blackpink concerts,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The cultural authorities of Taiwan pledged on Monday (March 20) the imposition of heavy penalties for scalpers amid complaints about rampant scams following the K-pop concerts by Blackpink over the past weekend.Culture Minister Shih Che (史哲) promised on a radio show that the government would amend the Development of the Cultural and Creative Industries Act (文化創意產業發展法) to punish ticket scalping.Shih acknowledged that many young fans of the South Korean girl group must have been upset with the scams and soaring ticket prices they encountered in the run-up to concerts. Shih added that it is obligatory for the government to act, according to CNA.While it is not likely to stop scalper bots, the regulatory changes expected to be approved by April will seek to introduce harsh punitive measures for profiteering resellers as long as the sales are made public, he said. Ticket distributors and event organizers will also be asked to help counteract scalping through moves such as offering ticket exchange platforms, he added.Some scalpers were found to be selling Blackpink tickets for four times the official prices, and in one case even charging NT$400,000 (US$13,089) for a seat. Ticket scalping is common for concerts featuring popular artists like A-Mei and Mayday, as well as sports events, while the Consumers’ Foundation also flagged hospitals falling prey to “registration scalping” for those seeking an appointment with popular doctors.",2023/03/20,2684,Society

(AP) — After nearly getting upset in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Miami had a point to prove. Indiana paid the price.Isaiah Wong and Jordan Miller led a decisive second-half spurt and Miami stormed into the Sweet 16 for the second straight year Sunday night with an 85-69 win over the Hoosiers.“Our guys were disappointed about the way they played Friday, so we were really ready to show that this is Miami basketball,"" Hurricanes coach Jim Larrañaga said. “We’re very hard to guard.”Wong, the Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year who was limited to five points in a first-round win over Drake, had 27 points and eight rebounds for the Hurricanes (27-7), the only ACC team left in March Madness.Miller, who had seven points on Friday, scored 19, and Indianapolis native Nijel Pack had 10 of his 12 points in the first half as fifth-seeded Miami got off to a fast start, led most of the game and ended Indiana’s hopes of a sixth national title.Miami will face top-seeded Houston in the Midwest Region semifinals in Kansas City, Missouri, on Friday.“I told the team beforehand the ACC needs to be well represented today. And we did,” Larrañaga said.All-American Trayce Jackson-Davis had 23 points and eight rebounds for the Hoosiers (23-12), who have not been to the Sweet 16 since 2016. Freshman Jalen Hood-Schifino added 19 points and Race Thompson had 11.Miami needed 16-1 run in the final five minutes to beat Drake. There was another late run this time but it was more composed and not as desperate.Indiana coach Mike Woodson — who called a timeout less than two minutes into the game with his team trailing 6-0 — gave all the credit to Miami, which held a 42-26 rebounding advantage.“They played their butts off tonight,” he said. “It was a well-coached game, and I thought they were the better team. They showed it first half and second half. I thought when we got back in it, we didn’t do the things to put us in position once we got the lead to win this game.”Miami didn’t lose the lead until Indiana went on a 13-0 run bridging the halves to push ahead 43-40. The game was tied at 49-all when Miller, who spent a great deal of time denying Jackson-Davis the ball, hit a layup to ignite a 16-4 burst. Wong hit two 3-pointers and Miller had seven points during that stretch.Miami led 69-60 when Wong drilled a 3 late in the shot clock, Bensley Joseph followed with a steal, and Miller fed Joseph in the corner for a wide-open 3 that made it 75-60 with 3:23 left.""We won the game two days ago, and today I performed well,"" said Wong, who was 7 of 15 from the field and 4 of 6 from long range. “I appreciate the team for that helping me out, getting me passes and getting me in the rhythm.”Miller downplayed the feeling of some that Miami is underappreciated.“At the end of the day, all we can do is just come out and win basketball games,” he said. “I feel like winning a game in itself is a way to get recognition. We’re going to the Sweet 16. That’s a lot of recognition.”BIG PICTUREMiami: The Hurricanes shared the ACC regular-season title with Virginia, which lost to Furman in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Miami fell in the conference tournament to Duke, which was beaten by Tennessee in the second round Saturday. Pittsburgh was eliminated by Xavier earlier Sunday, making Miami the lone ACC team.Indiana: Woodson has taken the Hoosiers to the NCAA Tournament in both years on the job. It might be tough next year without Jackson-Davis, Thompson and Miller Kopp.“Just two years ago, we were getting booed in our home city, Indianapolis, off the court in the Big Ten Tournament,” Jackson-Davis said. “Just being in this moment two years later, it’s really special. It’s really special to me to have the Indiana fans on your back and just cheering for you and giving them hope.”UP NEXTAnother win would put Miami in its second straight Elite Eight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840772,China's Xi meeting Putin in boost for isolated Russia leader,"BEIJING (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping is due to meet with Vladimir Putin in a political boost for the isolated Russian president after the International Criminal Court charged him with war crimes in Ukraine.Xi’s government gave no details of what the Chinese leader hoped to accomplish. Xi and Putin declared they had a “no-limits friendship” before the February 2022 attack on Ukraine, but China has tried to portray itself as neutral. Beijing called for a cease-fire last month, but Washington said that would ratify the Kremlin’s battlefield gains.The Chinese government said Xi would visit Moscow from Monday to Wednesday but gave no indication whether he had left. The Russian government said Xi was due to arrive at midday and meet later with Putin.Ahead of the meeting, China's foreign ministry called on the ICC to “respect the jurisdictional immunity” of a head of state and “avoid politicization and double standards.”China looks to Russia as a source of oil and gas for its energy-hungry economy and as a partner in opposing what both see as American domination of global affairs.The meeting gives Putin and Xi a chance to show they have “powerful partners” at a time of strained relations with Washington, said Joseph Torigian, an expert in Chinese-Russian relations at American University in Washington.“China can signal that it could even do more to help Russia, and that if relations with the United States continue to deteriorate, they could do a lot more to enable Russia and help Russia in its war against Ukraine,” Torigian said.Beijing's relations with Washington, Europe and its neighbors are strained by disputes over technology, security, human rights and the ruling Communist Party's treatment of Hong Kong and Muslim minorities.Some commentators draw a parallel between Russia's claims to Ukrainian territory and Beijing's claim to Taiwan. The Communist Party says the self-ruled island democracy, which split with China in 1949 after a civil war, is obliged to unite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Xi's government has been stepping up efforts to intimidate the island by flying fighter jets nearby and firing missiles into the sea.China has stepped up purchases of Russian oil and gas, helping to top up the Kremlin's revenue in the face of Western sanctions. But it has avoided doing anything visible that crosses the red lines laid down by Washington and European governments in regard to financial sanctions and the provision of military aid.This week's meeting follows the ICC announcement Friday of charges that Putin is personally responsible for the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine. Governments that recognize the court's jurisdiction would be obligated to arrest Putin if he visits.Putin has yet to comment on the announcement, but the Kremlin rejected the move as “outrageous and unacceptable.”In a show of defiance, Putin visited Crimea and the occupied Ukrainian port city of Mariupol to mark the ninth anniversary of Russia's seizure of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. Russian news reports showed him chatting with Mariupol residents and visiting an art school and a children’s center in Sevastopol in Crimea.The ICC should “uphold an objective and impartial stance, respect the jurisdictional immunity enjoyed by the head of state in accordance” and “avoid politicization and double standards,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.“China will uphold its objective and fair position on the Ukrainian crisis and play a constructive role in promoting peace talks,” Wang said.Xi said in an article published Monday in the Russian newspaper Russian Gazette that China has “actively promoted peace talks” but announced no initiatives.“My upcoming visit to Russia will be a journey of friendship, cooperation and peace,” Xi wrote, according to text released by the official Xinhua News Agency.“A reasonable way to resolve the crisis” can be found if “all parties embrace the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,” Xi wrote.The trip follows the surprise announcement of a diplomatic thaw between Iran and Saudi Arabia after a meeting in Beijing, a propaganda coup for Xi’s government.Xi wants to be seen as a global statesman who is “playing a constructive role” by talking about peace but is unlikely to press Putin to end the war, said Torigian. He said Beijing worries about possible Russian battlefield losses but doesn’t want to be seen to “enable Russia’s aggression.""“They won’t spend political capital” on pressing Moscow to make peace, “especially if they don’t think it will get them anything,” he said.",2023/03/20,,World

(AP) — Paul George had 29 points and the Los Angeles Clippers handed the Portland Trail Blazers their sixth straight loss with a 117-102 victory on Sunday night.,Kawhi Leonard added 24 for the Clippers as they fight for home-court advantage in the playoffs. Los Angeles was sitting at fifth in the Western Conference standings just a half-game behind of the Phoenix Suns. The Clippers have won five of their last six games.“We expect to win. We come in and we expect to win, that's really the key,” George said. “We expect to play well, we know what we need to do and we know what it looks like when we're at our peak. We're dialed in, we're getting on guys if we're blowing coverage, if we're not where we need to be. I think we're holding each other accountable.”Jusuf Nurkic finished with 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Blazers, who were in 13th in the West, well outside of playoff contention. Damian Lillard had 21 points and nine assists.Portland never led in the game but pulled within 103-97 on Nurkic's layup in the fourth quarter. Leonard's jumper and George's 3-pointer pushed the Clippers' lead back to 108-97 and many Portland fans started heading for the exits.“We've still got to get better,” Leonard said. “There's a lot of things — a lot of mistakes that we're making at times. So we've got to clean that up a little bit and see if we can just keep making leaps.”Assistant coach Dan Craig was the acting head coach for the Clippers because Tyronn Lue had a non-COVID illness and did not travel with the team. It was Craig's third time standing in as head coach, and his first win.Los Angeles was coming off a 113-108 loss at home to Orlando the night before, snapping a four-game winning streak.“Feels pretty good. We needed a win and I thought it was just a good team contribution to come in here on the second night of a back-to-back,” Craig said.The Clippers led by as many as 15 points in the first half but the Blazers closed the gap to 44-42 on Drew Eubanks' basket before Trendon Watford tied it with a layup. Portland was not able to pull in front and the Clippers led 59-55 at the break.Paul George's dunk put Los Angeles up 76-66 midway through the third quarter but the Blazers hung around, pulling within 79-74 on another Eubanks basket.“I thought the third quarter kind of hurt us a little bit but it was still nip and tuck in there the whole time, but just could never really pick up momentum,” Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said. “I thought we had so many stretches where we had good looks, just knock them down”TIP INSClippers: Leonard started after sitting out the Clippers' loss to Orlando on Saturday because of injury management. ... The Clippers have won three straight against the Blazers, including a 118-112 victory on Nov. 29. The two teams play once more, on April 8 in Los Angeles.Trail Blazers: Nassir Little returned after missed Portland's last game, a 126-112 loss to the Boston Celtics on Friday, because of a non-COVID illness. ... Lillard has scored 20 or more points in 31 straight games, an ongoing career record and the longest active streak in the NBA.LISTEN TO THE KIDCraig said his 7-year-old son Brody is a “hoop junkie” who steals the team reports out of his dad's bag to study them. So when asked before the game if Brody had any advice for his father ahead of Sunday night's meeting with the Blazers, Craig laughed: “He's worried about Lillard.”It was a valid concern, given that Lillard went into the game averaging 32.4 points, third in the league behind Philadelphia's Joel Embiid (33.5) and Dallas' Luka Doncic (33).UP NEXTClippers: Host the first of two games against Oklahoma City on Tuesday night.Trail Blazers: Visit the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840783,Lawyer: Former US pilot could have been lured to Australia,"SYDNEY (AP) — A former United States military pilot accused of training Chinese aviators could have been lured from China to Australia as part of a U.S. plan to extradite him to his homeland, his lawyer said Monday.In a 2016 indictment from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., unsealed late 2022, prosecutors say Daniel Duggan conspired with others to provide training to Chinese military pilots in 2010 and 2012, and possibly at other times, without applying for an appropriate license.Prosecutors say Duggan received about nine payments totaling around 88,000 Australian dollars ($61,000) and international travel from another conspirator for what was sometimes described as “personal development training.”Boston-born Duggan, 54, has been in custody in Australia since October and appeared in a Sydney court Monday by video link from a prison cell for a brief hearing about a U.S. application to extradite him.His lawyer, Dennis Miralis, told reporters outside the court that Duggan returned from China in 2022 to work in Australia after he received an Australian security clearance for an aviation license. A few days after his arrival, the clearance granted by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the nation’s main domestic spy agency, was removed, Miralis said.“It’s striking to us that a sequence of events like that could occur,” Miralis said. “We are exploring at this stage whether he was lured back to Australia by the U.S., where the U.S. knew he would be in a jurisdiction where he would be capable of being extradited back.""Duggan served in the U.S. Marines for 12 years before immigrating to Australia in 2002. In January 2012, he gained Australian citizenship, choosing to give up his U.S. citizenship in the process.The indictment says Duggan traveled to the U.S., China and South Africa, and provided some training to Chinese pilots in South Africa.Duggan has denied the allegations, saying they were political posturing by the United States, which unfairly singled him out.His next court appearance is set for May 1.",2023/03/20,,World

(AP) — Sobbing as she received hugs from friends, family and administrators, Mississippi coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin tried to grasp the magnitude of her team's stunning win against top-seeded Stanford when someone reminded her there's more basketball to be played.Her two young daughters danced for joy on the floor.Her proud father provided a shoutout to everybody back home in The Bahamas.Her team posed at midcourt and shouted, “Seattle!” That's where the Rebels are headed next.Madison Scott hit a pair of free throws with 23 seconds left that gave Mississippi the lead for good, Angel Baker scored 13 points, and the Rebels delivered on their declaration to get defensive, stunning top-seeded Stanford 54-49 on Sunday night to reach the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16 for the first time in 16 years.“First of all just incredibly grateful. I have a lot of mentors in my life and one of my mentors would always say to me that the person with the experience is at the mercy of the one with the anointing,” the 40-year-old McPhee-McCuin said in reference to Hall of Famer and winningest women's coach Tara VanDerveer. “He spoke that over my life maybe 10 years ago. And so to be in this situation right now, to take down an historical program like Stanford, a coach and a woman that I admire I have watched is incredible.”Behind the entire game and never with a lead, Stanford called timeout with 28 seconds left then Hannah Jump turned the ball over and Scott converted. Haley Jones lost the ball out of bounds on the Cardinal's last possession with a chance to tie then again in the waning moments.Marquesha Davis hit a pair of free throws with 15.4 seconds to play as Ole Miss overcame not making a field goal over the final 5:47, going 0 for 8.“This is such a big accomplishment. A lot of us came here to make history and that’s what we’re doing,” freshman Ayanna Thompson said.These upstart Rebels (25-8) advance to the Seattle Regional semifinal next weekend, while VanDerveer's Stanford team (29-6) is eliminated far earlier than this group envisioned — the season ending on the Cardinal's home floor. Jones fought tears after her final game, finishing with 16 points and eight rebounds but five turnovers.“Some of the things we did were self-inflicted. The turnovers really hurt us,” VanDerveer said. “They’re really a tough team, they’re a lot better than (No.) 8 teams we’ve played before. Sometimes you don’t have a really good matchup.”Only four No. 1 seeds had lost before the Sweet 16 since 1994, with Duke the last one in 2009. Stanford did so once before, falling to 16th-seeded Harvard in the first round of the 1998 tournament.The Cardinal had reached 14 straight Sweet 16s and hadn’t lost in the first or second rounds since No. 10 seed Florida State shocked the fifth-seeded Cardinal 68-61 at Maples Pavilion in the second round exactly 16 years ago to the day before on March 19, 2007.Cameron Brink came back from a one-game absence because of a stomach bug to finish with 20 points, 13 rebounds and seven blocked shots, but Stanford never led and tried to come from behind all night. The program's career blocks leader, the junior star finished with 118 on the season and has 297 total.“Cam wasn’t 100% today but I thought she really battled,” VanDerveer said.Stanford had won 21 consecutive NCAA games on its home floor and is 41-5 all-time at Maples during March Madness.Ole Miss led the entire first half on the way to a 29-20 advantage at the break at raucous Maples Pavilion, where the crowd went wild when Brink blocked three straight shots in the same sequence by Rita Igbokwe midway through the second quarter. About two minutes later, Igbokwe grabbed at her mouth after being hit.The Rebels got a scare when senior guard Myah Taylor went down hard grabbing at her chest with 6:41 left in the third after colliding with Francesca Belibi while moving to defend Indya Nivar. After a short break to catch her breath, Taylor was back running the point.The Rebels declared from Day 1 arriving in the Bay Area they were ready to play their tenacious defense to make a mark on the NCAA Tournament. Stanford’s layups regularly rolled out. The Cardinal got called for repeated offensive fouls. They made mistakes when it mattered most.“It brought tears to my eyes,” said Gladstone McPhee, coach McPhee-McCuin's father. “It's beautiful. This is what you wait for.”BIG PICTURE Ole Miss: Parents Gladstone and Daisy cheered on fifth-year coach McPhee-McCuin as her team reached the second round after last year’s first-round exit by South Dakota. Her daughters, 10-year-old Yasmine and Yuri, 5, rooted the team all the way, with Yasmine yelling, “That's my mom!” when Ole Miss came out before tipoff. ...

So far, the U.S. lags many other democracies in waging this battle, and the consequences of inaction are clear.But for teachers already facing myriad demands in the classroom, incorporating internet literacy can be a challenge — especially given how politicized misinformation about vaccines, public health, voting, climate change and Russia's war in Ukraine has become. The title of a talk for a recent gathering of Lee's group: “How to talk about conspiracy theories without getting fired.”“It’s not teaching what to think, but how to think,” said Julie Smith, an expert on media literacy who teaches at Webster University in Webster Groves, Missouri. “It's engaging about engaging your brain. It's asking, ‘Who created this? Why? Why am I seeing it now? How does it make me feel and why?’”New laws and algorithm changes are often offered as the most promising ways of combating online misinformation, even as tech companies study their own solutions.Teaching internet literacy, however, may be the most effective method. New Jersey, Illinois and Texas are among states that have recently implemented new standards for teaching internet literacy, a broad category that can include lessons about how the internet and social media work, along with a focus on how to spot misinformation by cross-checking multiple sources and staying wary of claims with missing context or highly emotional headlines.Media literacy lessons are often included in history, government or other social studies classes, and typically offered at the high school level, though experts say it's never too early — or late — to help people become better users of the internet.Finnish children begin to learn about the internet in preschool, part of a robust anti-misinformation program that aims to make the country's residents more resistant to false online claims. Finland has a long history of combating propaganda and misinformation spread by one of its neighbors, Russia, and expanded its current efforts after Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea set off another wave of disinformation.“Media literacy was one of our priorities before the time of the internet,” Petri Honkonen, Finland's minister of science and culture, said in a recent interview. “The point is critical thinking, and that is a skill that everybody needs more and more. We have to somehow protect people. We also must protect democracy.""Honkonen spoke with The Associated Press earlier this year during a trip to Washington that included meetings to discuss Finland's work to fight online misinformation. One recent report on media literacy efforts in western democracies placed Finland at the top. Canada ranked seventh, while the U.S. came in at No. 18.In Finland the lessons don't end with primary school. Public service announcements offer tips on avoiding false online claims and checking multiple sources. Additional programs are geared toward older adults, who can be especially vulnerable to misinformation compared to younger users more at home on the internet.In the U.S., attempts to teach internet literacy have run into political opposition from people who equate it to thought control. Lee, the Seattle teacher, said that concern prevents some teachers from even trying.Several years ago, the University of Washington launched MisinfoDay, which brought high schoolers and their teachers together for a one-day event featuring speakers, exercises and activities focused on media literacy. Seven hundred students from across the state attended one of three MisinfoDays this year.Jevin West, the University of Washington professor who created the event, said he's heard from educators in other states and as far away as Australia who are interested in creating something similar.“Maybe eventually, someday, nationally here in the United States, we have a day devoted to the idea of media literacy,"" West said. “There are all sorts of things we can do in terms of regulations, technology, in terms of research, but nothing is going to be more important than this idea of making us more resilient” to misinformation.For teachers already struggling with other classroom demands, adding media literacy can seem like just one more obligation. But it's a skill that is just as important as computer engineering or software coding for the future economy, according to Erin McNeill, a Massachusetts mother who started Media Literacy Now, a national nonprofit that advocates for digital literacy education.“This is an innovation issue,” McNeill said. “Basic communication is part of our information economy, and there will be huge implications for our economy if we don't get this right.”The driver's education analogy comes up a lot when talking to media literacy experts. Automobiles first went into production in the early 20th century and soon became popular. But it was nearly three decades before the first driver's education courses were offered.What changed? Governments passed laws regulating vehicle safety and driver behavior. Auto companies added features like collapsible steering columns, seat belts and air bags. And in the mid-1930s, safety advocates began to push for mandated driver's education.That combination of government, industry and educators is seen as a model by many misinformation and media literacy researchers. Any effective solution to the challenges posed by online misinformation, they say, must by necessity include an educational component.Media literacy in Canadian schools began decades ago and initially focused on television before being expanded throughout the digital era. Now it's accepted as an essential part of preparing students, according to Matthew Johnson, director of education at MediaSmarts, an organization that leads media literacy programs in Canada.“We need speed limits, we need well-designed roads and good regulations to ensure cars are safe. But we also teach people how to drive safely,"" he said. ""Whatever regulators do, whatever online platforms do, content always winds up in front of an audience, and they need to have the tools to engage critically with it.”___Klepper reported from Washington.",2023/03/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840797,Ex-leader of Taiwan's largest militia in 1940s passes away at 102,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Chung Yi-jen (鍾逸人), a Taiwanese pro-independence activist and militia leader in 1947, later an award-winning author, died of pulmonary edema at a hospital in Taichung on Sunday evening (March 19).In 1947, Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石)'s Nationalist Party, known as the Kuomintang, was cracking down on dissidents of corrupt nationalist officials sent to rule Taiwan after the Japanese occupation. Chung, a then-college teacher at Taiwan Provincial Taichung Teachers College, rallied faculty and students to form the ""27th Corps.""The group quickly won support among students in central Taiwan. However, the group disbanded only two weeks later, and Chung was put in prison for 17 years, according to CNA.When he was released from prison in 1964, martial law still remained in place Taiwan until 1987. Chung could not return to school due to political repression, so he opted to start his own business.In the 1980s, with the support of Lee Chiao (李喬), a leading figure in Taiwanese literature, Chung began writing memoirs and literary works in memory of the victims of the 228 Massacre. A human and civil rights advocate, he was honored with Taiwan's top literary awards.In a 228 memorial event in 2019, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) hailed Chung, recalling his impassioned words when he was arrested in 1947: ""I am a Taiwanese, not a Chinese."" Tsai said Chung's activism paved the way for Taiwan's democratic society.",2023/03/20,1095,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840799,Taipei MRT asked to increase train frequency in Tamsui,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A flood of weekend tourists, along with regular crowds during weekday rush hours is testing the patience of commuters who depend upon the Tamsui MRT Station.Conditions have become so bad that there is nary any space to stand as commuters wait for trains, which they allege are operating on a schedule that is disproportionally slow compared to other popular MRT stations, per UDN.According to the Department of Rapid Transit Systems (DORTS), Taipei City Government, Tamsui MRT Station ranks sixth in terms of passenger volume. This is despite the average frequency of trains departing the station being half that of other stations.This has led to accusations that MRT officials are not doing enough to alleviate crowded MRT platforms and traffic. New Taipei City Councilor Cheng Yu-en (鄭宇恩) appealed to New Taipei City Hall to consider increasing the number of MRT trains departing Tamsui Station, per UDN.As of February, the top MRT stations in terms of passenger volume were Taipei Main Station, Taipei City Government, Ximen, Zhongshan, Zhongxiao-Fuxing, Banciao, Tamsui, Nanjing-Fuxing, Xinpu, and Taipei 101/World Trade CenterCheng said many of these stations see MRT trains departing every three minutes, though only Tamsui has trains departing every six minutes during peak travel time.According to Cheng, the Tamsui-Xinyi Line, also known as the Red Line, is divided into two parts: Tamsui-Xiangshan and Daan-Beitou. During rush hour, the two sections of the route run every six minutes.Cheng said if the Daan-Beitou section was extended to Tamsui, the frequency of MRT trains on the line could be shortened to three minutes, and the commuting problem in Tamsui could be alleviated.Cheng said in the past that DORTS has wanted to increase the frequency many times but ignored the interests of commuters. He also noted that shops and markets around the Tamsui Station may benefit from less frequent trains as it may encourage more commuters to shop while they wait for their trains.One passenger, surnamed Lin (林), pointed out that Tamsui is quite far from downtown areas in Taipei with many people needing to sit for the duration of the trip. Should one desire a seat, they may have to wait for two to three trains to pass.Lin hoped DORTS could do more to increase the number of MRT trains, which may increase the public's willingness to take the MRT and end dependency upon public buses which operate in the area. DORTS says there is still adequate capacity at the moment, though it could make adjustments based upon passenger volume.",2023/03/20,1887,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840837,Trump silent on abortion as 2024 campaign pushes forward,"DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) — No elected Republican has done more to restrict abortion rights in the U.S. than Donald Trump.But in the early days of the 2024 presidential contest, no Republican has worked harder to avoid the issue than the former president. Far more than his GOP rivals, Trump is sidestepping the issue just nine months after he and his party celebrated the Supreme Court's decision to strip away women's constitutional right to abortion.Look no further than Trump’s trip to Iowa last week for evidence of his delicate balancing act.Moments after he stepped off his plane just outside Davenport, Trump repeatedly refused to say whether he would support a federal law restricting abortion in every state, a move that anti-abortion activists are demanding of the GOP's presidential contenders.“We’re looking at a lot of different things,” Trump said when asked twice by The Associated Press whether he supports a federal abortion ban.The former president quickly shifted the conversation to immigration, the economy and “radical-left lunatics.” And in the hours that followed, he didn't mention the word “abortion” even once as he chatted with Iowans in a diner, delivered an hourlong speech and took almost a dozen questions from voters.Trump enters the opening stretch of the GOP primary in a strong position. But he faces a host of challenges in the coming weeks, especially as legal investigations surrounding the former president intensify. In a social media post this weekend, Trump said he expected to be arrested this week as a New York grand jury investigates hush money payments to women who alleged sexual encounters with the former president. Manhattan prosecutors, however, have not been in direct touch with Trump, leaving the timeline of potential charges unclear.But the ultra-cautious approach on abortion reflects a new political reality for Republicans this presidential season.Party leaders concede that the GOP's stunning success in persuading Trump's remade Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade last June ultimately triggered a fierce backlash that boosted Democrats in November's midterms. And while the 2024 political landscape is far from settled, leaders in both parties acknowledge that few issues may be more significant in the election of the next president than abortion.Meanwhile, abortion access is disappearing across America.Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe just nine months ago, 24 states have banned abortion outright or are likely to do so, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, including Florida, are moving toward restrictive laws that would ban abortion as soon as six weeks of pregnancy.The next step, according to anti-abortion leaders already playing a vocal role in the GOP's 2024 presidential primary, is to adopt a federal law that would force abortion restrictions upon every state.Majorie Dannenfelser, who leads the socially conservative organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is pushing for a law banning abortions nationwide at 15 weeks of gestation — if not sooner. She said she has spoken privately with most of the GOP's prospective field, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and believes they would all embrace such a federal ban.And while she's generally pleased by her conversations with the 2024 field so far, she has noticed Trump's lack of public commitment to continued abortion restrictions in recent weeks.“No one gets a pass,” Dannenfelser said, acknowledging that Roe would have not been overturned without Trump's three Supreme Court appointments. “With Trump, this is his legacy. It’s something that I believe he will get right, but he’s clearly doing some soul searching right now.""Meanwhile, Trump's rivals in the nascent presidential primary field have not shied away from their aggressive abortion plans as they court primary voters.In Florida, a DeSantis-backed measure to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy — before many women realize they're pregnant — is moving through the Republican-controlled state legislature. Democrats there admit there's nothing they can do to prevent the bill from becoming law, which DeSantis is using to strengthen his conservative bona bides ahead of a formal presidential announcement expected in the coming months.Former Vice President Mike Pence, another likely 2024 contender who has long promoted religious conservatism, has been one of the GOP's most aggressive anti-abortion voices since the Supreme Court's ruling. On the campaign trail in recent weeks, he highlighted his commitment to go further.Last month in New Hampshire, a state long known for protecting abortion rights, Pence openly vowed to support a federal abortion ban if elected.""If I was in the Congress of the United States or in a job at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and they put a policy in front of me to limit abortions in the country, I’d certainly support it,” Pence said in a radio interview. He added that the issue would likely be decided by each individual state, however.Nikki Haley, who launched her Republican presidential bid a month ago, also believes the issue will be resolved at the state level, despite her personal wishes.She discussed the possibility of a 15-week federal ban during a February interview on the “Today” show. In a New Hampshire radio interview earlier this month, she reminded voters that she signed into law a 20-week ban while South Carolina governor.“I can tell you that if it were up to me, every single state would be pro-life,” Haley said. “But I think the people need to decide that.”South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, another likely Republican 2024 prospect, celebrated the Supreme Court's Roe reversal last summer with his party. Last fall, he headlined a gala for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which is fighting for a federal ban.Democrats are closely tracking the Republican White House hopefuls, knowing that aggressive anti-abortion rhetoric and policies will likely alienate key groups of voters — especially swing voters in the suburbs — in the 2024 general election.“Republicans are not going to be able to hide from their extremist anti-abortion rights agendas in the 2024 presidential election,"" said Alexandra De Luca of American Bridge, a pro-Democrat super PAC. ""American Bridge and the Democratic Party will hammer Republican presidential candidates early and often, making it impossible for whoever emerges to walk back their extremist views during the general election.”More than his Republican opponents, Trump seems acutely aware of such political risks.Before the 2022 midterms, he tried to persuade some of his preferred candidates to back off hard-line abortion positions — especially those that opposed exceptions in cases of rape, incest or life of the mother.In distancing himself from aggressive anti-abortion policies, however, Trump opens himself up to a new set of challenges with religious conservatives.Already, some evangelical leaders have withheld their endorsement. Trump said such moves are “a sign of disloyalty” in an interview with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network. And he accused anti-abortion leaders of failing to do enough to help GOP candidates in the midterms, which hasn't sat well with some evangelicals.Bob Vander Plaats, the president of Iowa's Family Leader, said that abortion remains “a character-defining issue” that helps voters determine whether they can trust candidates or not.So far, he said, it's unclear whether evangelicals can trust Trump in 2024.“While we’re thrilled that he gave us justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, and we’re thrilled he did other things on abortion, frankly I think there's a big question mark out there,” Vander Plaats said. “Where is he on the sanctity of life? Does he really believe what he says he believes? When he’s pivoting and when he doesn’t want to talk about it and when he throws the pro-life community under the bus, those are all indicators that give us more cause for pause.”Trump's campaign pushed back against such concerns.Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung listed Trump's “unmatched” record on abortion, highlighting Trump's Supreme Court nominations, his moves to block taxpayer-funded abortion and his decision to reinstate the “Mexico City” policy that required nongovernmental organizations as a condition of funding not to promote abortion as a family planning method in other countries.“There has been no bigger advocate for the movement than President Trump,” he said.___Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840838,"In Trump probe, grand jury hears from final witnesses","NEW YORK (AP) — A New York grand jury investigating Donald Trump appeared to be hearing from final witnesses as law enforcement officials accelerated security preparations Monday in advance of a possible indictment and as fellow Republicans staked out positions in a criminal probe expected to shake up the 2024 presidential race.Testimony from Robert Costello, a lawyer who had a falling out with the key government witness in the Trump investigation, came as the grand jury that for months has been investigating Trump over hush money paid to a porn star during his 2016 campaign appeared to be wrapping up its work.Costello was invited to appear after saying he had information raising questions about the credibility of Michael Cohen, a key witness in the investigation who has already appeared multiple times before the grand jury. Costello's testimony was expected to give the former president an indirect opportunity to make a case that he shouldn’t face criminal charges, though there were no clear signs his appearance had changed the course of the grand jury probe.Cohen had been available for over two hours to rebut the testimony but was not needed, his attorney said Monday.Costello had provided Cohen, himself a lawyer, legal services several years ago. In a news conference after his grand jury appearance, he told reporters that he had come forward to provide exculpatory information about Trump and to make clear that he did not believe Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal crimes and served time in prison, could be trusted.“If they want to go after Donald Trump and they have solid evidence then so be it,"" Costello said. “But Michael Cohen is far from solid evidence.”Responding to Costello's claims on MSNBC later Monday, Cohen said that Costello was never his lawyer and “he lacks any sense of veracity.”The testimony came two days after Trump said he expected to face criminal charges and urged supporters to protest his possible arrest. In a series of social media posts through the weekend, the former Republican president criticized the New York investigation, directing particularly hostile rhetoric toward Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat.It's not clear when prosecutors might wrap up their work, but law enforcement in New York has been making physical preparations for any unrest surrounding a possible indictment. In the morning, a New York Police Department truck began dropping off portable metal barricades that could be used to block off streets or sidewalks.Costello briefly acted as a legal adviser to Cohen after the FBI raided Cohen’s home and apartment in 2018. At the time, Cohen was being investigated for both tax evasion and for payments he helped orchestrate in 2016 to buy the silence of two women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump.For several months, it was unclear whether Cohen, a longtime lawyer and fixer for the Trump Organization who once boasted that he would “take a bullet” for his boss, would remain loyal to the president.Cohen ultimately decided to plead guilty in connection with the payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, which he said were directed by Trump. Since then, he has been a vociferous Trump critic, testifying before Congress and then to the Manhattan grand jury.Trump, who has denied having sex with either woman, has branded Cohen a liar. Costello broke with Cohen before he pleaded guilty, after it became clear he was no longer in Trump’s camp.In the years since, Costello, a veteran New York attorney, has represented Trump allies including his former political strategist Steve Bannon and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.Even as the New York investigation pushes toward conclusion, Trump faces criminal probes in Atlanta and Washington that, taken together, pose significant legal peril and carry the prospect of upending a Republican presidential race in which Trump remains a leading contender. Some of his likely opponents have tried to strike a balance between condemning a potential prosecution as politically motivated while avoiding condoning the conduct at issue.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an expected GOP presidential candidate, criticized the investigation but also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a move likely to intensify their simmering political rivalry.“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair,"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Panama City. “I can’t speak to that.”But, he added, “what I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that’s an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office. And I think that’s fundamentally wrong.”Mike Pence, the former vice president who’s expected to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination, castigated Trump in an ABC News interview last weekend as “reckless” for his actions on Jan. 6 and said history would hold him accountable. Even so, he echoed the former president’s rhetoric that an indictment would be a “politically charged prosecution.”“I have no doubt that President Trump knows how to take care of himself,"" Pence said. “And he will. But that doesn’t make it right to have a politically charged prosecution of a former president.”___Tucker reported from Washington. Associated Press journalists Michelle L.

The undrafted second-year pro has earned a vital role his star-studded team, and Reaves factored in almost every big play down the stretch as the Lakers snapped a two-game skid.Lakers fans serenaded Reaves with chants of “M-V-P! M-V-P!” as he repeatedly earned trips to the line in the fourth quarter. Reaves shot a career-high 18 free throws, while the Magic shot 17.“For them to recognize what I do — obviously I'm not an MVP-caliber player, those guys are really good — but for them to do that is special,” Reaves said. “It means a lot to me.”The Lakers entered this game off back-to-back losses to Houston and Dallas, imperiling their tenuous position in the playoff race. This win put Los Angeles (35-37) back in ninth in the Western Conference, tied with Minnesota.“I thought it was (Reaves) being his normal self,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “What he's been all year. Coming up in clutch moments for us, trying to make plays downhill, putting the defense in uncomfortable situations with his ability to attack the paint and draw fouls. He was great. He ended up with 35, and we needed all of them.”Rookie Paolo Banchero scored 21 points for Orlando, but got an unwise technical foul with 25.3 seconds to play after repeatedly arguing with officials during the night.“It just puts you in a hard situation when they’re calling it like that,” Banchero said. “You want to defend without fouling, but we keep getting called. We keep fouling, I guess. We keep getting foul calls against us, so it just makes it hard, but we still had a chance to win. You can’t blame it all on that.”Franz Wagner also scored 21 points in the Magic's sixth loss in eight games to wrap up a four-game road swing. Wendell Carter Jr. had 16 points and 11 rebounds, but Orlando couldn't repeat the dominance of its 39-point fourth quarter in a victory over the Clippers one day earlier in the same arena.""It’s difficult, because I think we’re an aggressive, attacking team,” Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley said. “We’ve got to just, I guess, continue to do a better job of defending without fouling, show our help early and earn the respect of being able to get those calls.”Cole Anthony hit a tying 3-pointer with 2:37 left for the Magic, who had trailed throughout the second half. Banchero fouled Reaves on a 3-point attempt a minute later, and Reaves hit two free throws before Wagner tied it again.But Reaves hit a mid-range jumper with 57 seconds left and then grabbed the long rebound of Wagner's missed 3 before making two more free throws. Banchero missed a layup and got the technical foul that helped the Lakers to seal it.The Lakers improved to 6-5 during the latest injury absence for LeBron James, who has been out for three weeks with a sore right foot. Ham reiterated before the game that Los Angeles expects James to return before the regular season ends in three weeks.TIP-INSMagic: Markelle Fultz had 12 points and 10 assists one night after dropping a career-high 28 points on the Clippers. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840840,Some Trump supporters ambivalent on calls for protests,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s calls for protests before his anticipated indictment in New York have generated mostly muted reactions from supporters, with even some of his most ardent loyalists dismissing the idea as a waste of time or a law enforcement trap.The ambivalence raises questions about whether Trump, though a leading Republican contender in the 2024 presidential race who retains a devoted following, still has the power to mobilize far-right supporters the way he did more than two years ago before the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. It also suggests that the hundreds of arrests that followed the Capitol riot, not to mention the convictions and long prison sentences, may have dampened the desire for repeat mass unrest.Still, law enforcement in New York is continuing to closely monitor online chatter warning of protests and violence if Trump is arrested, with threats varying in specificity and credibility, four officials told The Associated Press. Mainly posted online and in chat groups, the messages have included calls for armed protesters to block law enforcement officers and attempt to stop any potential arrest, the officials said.Around the time the Manhattan courthouse complex opened Monday morning, a New York Police Department truck began dropping off dozens of portable metal barricades that could be used to block off streets or sidewalks.The New York Young Republican Club held a small protest in Lower Manhattan on Monday, and incendiary but isolated posts surfaced on fringe social media platforms from supporters calling for an armed confrontation with law enforcement at Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.But nearly two days after Trump claimed on his Truth Social platform that he expected to be arrested on Tuesday and exhorted followers to protest, there were few signs his appeal had inspired his supporters to organize and rally around an event like the Jan. 6 gathering. At the Lower Manhattan protest, reporters outnumbered pro-Trump demonstrators. And a prominent organizer of rallies that preceded the Capitol riot posted on Twitter that he intended to remain on the sidelines.Ali Alexander, who as an organizer of the “Stop the Steal” movement staged rallies to promote Trump’s baseless claims that Democrats stole the 2020 election from him, warned Trump supporters that they would be ""jailed or worse” if they protested in New York City.“You have no liberty or rights there,” he tweeted.One of Alexander’s allies in the “Stop the Steal” campaign was conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who amplified the election fraud claims on his Infowars show. Alexander posted that he had spoken to Jones and said that neither of them would be protesting this time around.“We’ve both got enough going on fighting the government,” Alexander wrote. “No billionaire is covering our bills.”Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser who spoke at rallies on the day before the insurrection, also advised caution.“If you you do choose to publicly protest, it is vitally important that you keep your protest peaceful, civil, orderly and completely legal,"" he said on Monday, alleging some on the left want to foment violence and blame it on Trump. “Do not under any circumstances step into that trap,” Stone said. “Please keep your protest peaceful and respectful.”That stands in contrast to the days before the Capitol riot when Trump stoked up supporters when he invited them to Washington for a “big protest” on a Jan. 6, tweeting, “Be there, will be wild!” Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol that day, busting through windows and violently clashing with officers in an ultimately failed effort to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory.Since then, about 1,000 participants have been arrested, many racking up steep legal bills and expressing regret and contrition in court for their actions. Some have complained of feeling abandoned by Trump. And conspiracy theories that the riot was fueled or even set up by undercover law enforcement informants in the crowd have continued to flourish online, with Trump supporters citing that angst as a basis for steering clear of a new large-scale protest.“How many Feds/Fed assets are in place to turn protest against the political arrest of Pres Trump into violence?” tweeted Rep. Marjorie-Taylor Greene. The Georgia Republican also invoked a conspiracy theory that an FBI informant had instigated the Jan. 6 riot.“Has Ray Epps booked his flight to NY yet?” she tweeted on Sunday.Epps, an Arizona man, was filmed encouraging others to enter the Capitol. Conspiracy theorists believe Epps was an FBI informant because he was removed from a Jan. 6 “wanted” list without being charged. In January, the House committee that investigated the Capitol attack said the claims about Epps were “unsupported.”John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab who has tracked the “Stop the Steal” movement online, said anxiety over being entrapped by so-called agent provocateurs feeds a “paranoia that if they go and do violence, they may get caught and there may be consequences.”“It seems to reduce a lot of people's willingness to make big statements about being willing to go out” and engage in violence, he said.A grand jury is investigating hush money payments to women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump. Prosecutors have not said when their work might conclude or when charges could come. House Republicans on Monday wrote to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg seeking documents related to his inquiry, which they called “an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.”The conflicted feelings over how far to support Trump in his fight against prosecution extends into the political realm, including among fellow Republicans seen as likely opponents in the 2024 race.His own vice president, Mike Pence, who's expected to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination, castigated Trump in an ABC News interview this weekend as “reckless” for his actions on Jan. 6 and said history would hold him accountable — even as he echoed the former president's rhetoric that an indictment would be a “politically charged prosecution.”“I have no doubt that President Trump knows how to take care of himself. And he will. But that doesn’t make it right to have a politically charged prosecution of a former president of the United States of America,” Pence said.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an expected GOP presidential candidate, criticized the Trump investigation on Monday as politically motivated but also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a move likely to intensify their simmering political rivalry.“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair.

A memorial is being planned.Dea also appeared in several movies in the 1940s and ’50s, including “King of the Congo,” starring Buster Crabbe, in 1952.Dea moved from California to Las Vegas in 1980. Famed magician David Copperfield befriended her in her later years, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.“Gloria was amazing. She was charming funny and engaging,” Copperfield told the newspaper. “And in Vegas, as a young magician, she started it all. It was an honor to know her.”Dea was 19 when she performed at El Rancho Vegas on May 14, 1941.Her show at the Roundup Room is the first recorded appearance by a magician in Las Vegas, the Review-Journal reported Sunday.“There was no Strip, really, in those days,” Dea told the newspaper last August when she turned 100. “We had the Last Frontier and the El Rancho Vegas. They had just started building the Flamingo.”Dea performed magic that night and more.“I also danced. I did the rumba because it was difficult to keep setting up all my magic stuff,” Dea said.After relocating to California, Dea appeared in several movies including “Mexicana” in 1945 and “Plan 9 From Outer Space” in 1957.“I was in the Saturday matinees, for the kids,” she said. “‘Plan 9 From Outer Space’ was the worst movie of all time. … I had fun making it though.”But that marked the end of Dea’s entertainment career. She sold insurance and then new and used cars for a dealership in the San Fernando Valley, becoming a top sales rep.According to the Review-Journal, Dea was an only child and did not have any immediate family. Her husband Sam Anzalone, a former California car sales executive, died in January 2022.Dea was scheduled to be inducted into the UNLV College of Fine Arts Hall of Fame on Tuesday night.Those plans will go forward as planned; Dea will be inducted by Copperfield in a presentation before the full program.",2023/03/20,,World

All you can do is smile and laugh.”After TCU pulled back within three late, Timme made a twisting shot in the lane with a defender draped all over him to trigger a 4-0 mini-run that put the game out of reach.Next stop for the 6-foot-10 senior and his social media-friendly mustache: Las Vegas for the West Region semifinals and a meeting with UCLA on Thursday. It will be a rematch of the teams' Final Four game two years ago, when Jalen Suggs banked one in from the half-court logo at the buzzer for the win.Mike Miles Jr. finished with 24 points and four assists in his second straight electric game for the sixth-seeded Horned Frogs (22-13), who were trying to win two games in the same tournament for the first time in program history.Gonzaga coach Mark Few pulled Miles aside briefly during the postgame handshake.“He said that he’s coached a lot NBA players and that I am one,” Miles said. “It's appreciated.”Damion Baugh finished with 15 points for TCU, including a not-so-meaningless 3 he hit at the buzzer to help the Horned Frogs cover the 4.5-point spread listed on FanDuel Sportsbook.Small consolation for TCU, though for 30 minutes-plus, the Frogs looked like very much like one of the 16 best teams in the country. They came at the Bulldogs in waves, trying to stop Timme with every big man on the roster.But while the Gonzaga big man worked for every one of his 12 baskets and his eight rebounds, TCU’s bigs were all in foul trouble as the game wound down. One of the two Horned Frogs who fouled out was JaKobe Coles, who made the last-second runner that gave TCU the first-round win against Arizona State.“Obviously, it was pretty early in the first half when we had to make some adjustments, play a lot of different lineups, probably even deeper than I thought we would,” TCU coach Jamie Dixon said.TCU had led by as many as 10 in the first half.Rasir Bolton (17 points) led Gonzaga's first big run. His two 3-pointers and another by Julian Strawther gave the Bulldogs a 46-45 lead after they had missed 12 of their 14 attempts from behind the arc in the first half.Strawther, a Las Vegas native, will head home for his team's next game. And Timme joined a list that includes Bill Bradley, Elvin Hayes and Danny Manning as only the seventh player with nine NCAA Tournament games of 20-plus points.“I think he's going to go down as one of the all-time great college players in the history of the game,” Few said. “And he still wasn't supposed to shoot that 3. But that's what makes him good. He does things like that every once in a while.”TIMME ON SOCIAL MEDIATimme said he was annoyed by what he called “some nice things on the internet before” the game that took shots at him and Gonzaga. “Throw a little lighter fluid on the fire if you wish,” he said. “I thought TCU was a highly educated school, and they didn’t sound so smart with their comments pregame, so you know. ...”SWEET 16 ANNIVERSARYThe meeting Thursday with UCLA in Vegas will fall on the 16th anniversary of their classic Sweet 16 game, won 73-71 by the Bruins. Over the final, frenetic 40 seconds, UCLA made two steals, scored the last five points and left Zags star Adam Morrison nearly crying on the court.ONE FEWER BIG MANWith TCU’s big men in foul trouble, one difference might have been the absence of Eddie Lampkin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840845,Former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou will visit China,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou will visit China next week in what a spokesman called a bid to ease tensions between the self-ruled island and the mainland.Ma presided over a period of warm ties with Beijing, but left office under a cloud after a trade deal with the mainland failed to win approval amid the island's largest protests since the 1990s. Although the former president is visiting in a private capacity, his stature as a former leader gives the trip political overtones.Ma's proposed visit comes as China's People Liberation Army sends fighter jets toward Taiwan on a near daily basis, and as official communications between the two governments have broken off. China's ruling government claims Taiwan is part of its territory, but Taiwan's governing Democratic Progressive Party says it's already a sovereign state that is not part of China.Ma, a member of the opposition Nationalist Party (Kuomingtang), will lead a delegation of academics and students as well as his former presidential staffers from March 27 to April 7, his office said Sunday.The office of President Tsai Ing-wen said Ma had notified her of his plans on Monday. The president's office said it ""hoped Ma, in his role as the former head of state ... can show the value of Taiwan’s democracy and freedom and the position of equality and dignity in cross-strait exchanges.”Ma will visit Nanjing, Wuhan and Changsha, as well as other cities, Hsiao Hsu-tsen, the director of the Ma Ying-jeou Foundation on Monday, told a news conference in Taipei.Hsiao also announced that Ma would bring college students from Taiwan to meet with colleagues from Shanghai's Fudan University and Changsha's Hunan University.“He strongly believes, as both sides of the (Taiwan) Strait have entered this frozen situation in recent years, allowing young people to have an exchange will help reduce tensions,” Hsiao said. “I think no matter how many weapons we buy, it's not as good as having young people from both sides understand each other, and deepen their exchange.”Ma will not go to Beijing, Hsiao said. The trip is also a chance for him to honor his ancestors, he added, ahead of Tomb Sweeping Day on April 5. During the festival, which is celebrated in Taiwan and China, among other countries, families pay a visit to ancestral graves to remember the deceased and to maintain the burial grounds.Ma's trip was also confirmed by China’s Taiwan Affairs Office.Any results are likely to be symbolic, and will mostly benefit China, said Hoo Tiang Boon, a professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who studies Chinese foreign policy. “Then they can then show they are not against Taiwan, they are not against the Taiwanese people,” he said. ""It’s the DPP and what they deem as separatists causing provocations in cross-strait relations.""Hoo added that he didn’t think it was likely the trip would influence Taiwan’s presidential elections next year.Other experts agreed that it was unlikely to resolve any major issues, but it could still prove helpful.Ma's visit follows Andrew Hsia, vice chairman of the Kuomingtang, who went on a 10-day tour of China in February and met with the head of the Taiwan Affairs Office.Members of the Kuomingtang regularly have exchanges with China. Taipei Mayor Chiang Wang-an, who belongs to the Kuomingtang, had hosted Shanghai city officials in February as well, and discussed exchanges in culture, sports and tourism.“He's not really representing the government to go and negotiate, I think he just wants to transmit the idea of peaceful exchange,” said Kao-cheng Wang, a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Affairs and Strategic Studies at Tamkang University in Taiwan, referring to Ma's plan to bring students. “This will be helpful to cross-strait relations and future development.”During Ma’s terms in office, Taiwan and China increased contacts. Ma negotiated a trade pact with Beijing in 2010 and Chinese tourists flocked to Taiwan.But as both sides opened their borders to each other, concerns grew that Taiwan was falling inescapably into Beijing's orbit, eventually leading to protests over a proposed trade deal with Beijing in 2014. The protests, known as the Sunflower Movement, sparked a rally that drew more than 200,000 people and a 24-day occupation of Taiwan’s parliament by students.Ma met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in 2015, while he was still in office. The meeting was the first between the leaders of the two sides since Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949 during the Chinese civil war, but was considered more symbolic than substantive.In 2016, the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won national elections and Beijing cut off contact with Taiwan's government, citing Tsai's refusal to endorse the idea that Taiwan and China are one country.",2023/03/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840874,Australia charges ex-soldier with murder over Afghan killing,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Police have charged the first Australian veteran with murder for a killing in Afghanistan three years after a war crimes investigation found that 19 Australian special forces soldiers could face charges for illegal conduct.Former Special Air Service Regiment trooper Oliver Schulz, 41, was arrested in New South Wales state and charged by police with the war crime of murder, an Australian Federal Police statement said.“It will be alleged he murdered an Afghan man while deployed to Afghanistan,” the statement said.Schulz's charge was mentioned late Monday in a Queanbeyan court where his lawyer did not apply for his release on bail. Schulz was remanded in custody to appear in a Sydney court on May 16.Australian Broadcasting Corp. broadcast helmet camera video in 2020 of a soldier it said was Schulz shooting an Afghan man in 2012 in a wheat field in Uruzgan province.Schulz, who was awarded the Commendation for Gallantry for his service in Afghanistan, faces a potential sentence of life in prison if convicted.Police are working with the Office of the Special Investigator, an Australian investigation agency established in 2021, to build cases against elite SAS and Commando Regiments troops who served in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.A military report released in 2020 after a four-year investigation found evidence that Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians. The report recommended 19 current and former soldiers face criminal investigation.Benjamin Roberts-Smith, Australia’s most highly decorated member of the armed services when he left the SAS in 2013, has been accused by former colleagues of unlawful treatment of prisoners, including illegal killings. The former corporal, who was awarded the Victoria Cross and the Medal for Gallantry for his service in Afghanistan, has denied any misconduct.His defamation trial against The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Canberra Times newspapers ended in July 2022 but a judgment has yet to be announced.More than 39,000 Australian military personnel served in Afghanistan during the 20 years until the 2021 withdrawal, and 41 were killed there.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840875,"Credit Suisse-UBS deal offers hope, but bank doubts persist","LONDON (AP) — Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system.Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, fell about 56% a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares are now trading at about the level that they are valued at by the deal.Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange before gaining over 2% in late afternoon trading. The deal added volatility to other European bank stocks, which tumbled in early trading even as benchmark indexes climbed, before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit were up, while London-based Barclays sank 1.6%.Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland's reputation as as stable banking haven.Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.“My impression as a customer,"" Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn't add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”___Associated Press writers Courtney Bonnell in London and David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed.",2023/03/21,,World

The MOL encourages migrant workers to take COVID vaccines before flying to Taiwan but will no longer require it.Prior to Monday, migrant workers were still required to undergo seven days of ""self-initiated pandemic prevention"" in individual rooms. Migrant workers on Feb. 20 protested what they described as a ""discriminatory"" policy, since the same rules did not apply to white-collar workers, students, and business visitors with residence permits.Starting Monday, inbound migrant workers will no longer need to undergo quarantine. Once in Taiwan, migrant workers are still subject to epidemic prevention regulations when using public transport or visiting medical facilities.Effective Jan. 1, inbound migrant caregivers must undergo ""one-stop training"" for three days and two nights before they can begin working for their employer. This is pre-employment training and is not tied to epidemic prevention measures.Previously, employers or labor brokers were required to register proof that incoming migrant workers had received at least two doses of COVID vaccines. However, starting on Monday, no such registration of vaccinations is required on the part of migrant workers or their representatives.A representative from MOL's 1955 hotline confirmed that proof of COVID vaccines is no longer necessary. She added that ""no one will check"" to see if arriving migrant workers have received COVID vaccines, as it is now the workers' personal decision if they wish to be vaccinated.Announcement of the end of pandemic prevention measures for migrant workers.

He survived a poor start in which he allowed Cuba's first four batters to reach base.Cuban starter Roenis Elias took the loss, allowing three runs in two innings.The game marked the end of a wild WBC ride for Cuba, which traveled more than 9,000 miles to Taiwan, lost its first two contests, won its next two and prevailed in a five-way tiebreaker. From there, Cuba beat Australia in Tokyo and flew more than 7,000 miles to Miami to play Team USA.Cuba got off to a great start on Sunday with three straight infield hits and an RBI walk by Alfredo Despaigne. But Wainwright got the next three batters to escape further damage. The key play was a grounder to Arenado, who got the force at the plate for the inning's first out.""There was a lot of stuff going on. I had to step off the mound. I had to realize that they weren't smacking me around,"" Wainwright said of his mindset during the first inning. ""I was getting myself into situations that I didn't need to get myself into.

Pete Alonso made it 4-1 with an RBI single, and Tim Anderson added a sacrifice fly.In the fourth, Goldschmidt drew a two-out walk and scored from first on Arenado's triple.

Affiliate marketing is on the rise and expanding among business professionals. Businesses are increasingly seeing the value in affiliate marketing, as it provides both potential benefits and cost savings. As per our findings affiliates generate $27 for every dollar they spend on advertising and marketing, which is more than double the industry average.
There are a number of factors contributing to this trend. Affiliate marketing is becoming more accessible and affordable, making it an attractive option for small businesses with limited resources. Additionally, the growth of technology has made it easier for affiliates to participate in affiliate marketing campaigns. Websites such as Google AdWords and Facebook Advertising allow affiliates to place ads on their own websites without having any prior experience or knowledge about digital marketing.
The increasing popularity of affiliate marketing is likely to continue into the future, especially as businesses increasingly see the value in earning revenue through referrals instead of traditional advertising methods. Affiliate marketing offers a cost-effective way for businesses of all sizes to reach new consumers and generate additional revenue.

This report discusses the industry in terms of research technology and precise prospective utilization, innovation, and future advancements in the Japan Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing.Japan enterprise file synchronization and sharing market was valued at $181.1 million in 2021 and is projected to generate sales revenue of $1178.3 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 23.5% during the forecast period, 2022?2030.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS318The recent growth in business demand for enterprise file synchronization and sharing has necessitated the development of comprehensive solutions that can manage, protect and share files across a wide variety of devices. Enterprises are facing the increasing demand for enterprise file synchronization and sharing. As businesses become more digitalized and technology-driven, they need to be able to keep their data synchronized so that it is available on any device or platform. This can be done through file sharing and synchronization tools, but it can also be difficult to manage and keep track of. Enterprise file synchronization and sharing tools provide a centralized solution for managing data and making it available across devices. They allow organizations to share files and folders, as well as synchronize changes between devices. This can be critical for keeping all the data in an organization centralized, synchronized, and easily accessible.The most popular enterprise file syncing and sharing platforms include FileZilla, SyncToy, DropBox, Box and ? now ? Microsoft OneDrive for Business. One key factor contributing to the growth of these solutions is the spread of mobile devices and cloud-based networking in businesses.
Another trend contributing to the demand for Japan enterprise file synchronization and sharing solutions market is the increased use of virtualized and hybrid environments. This means that organizations need to keep track of files located on both physical desktops as well as virtual machines. In addition, companies are increasingly turning to collaborative file sharing solutions to keep employees coordinated and productive.Market Dynamics of Japan Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing Solutions Market
DriversIn Japan, there is a strong demand for Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing (EFSS) as businesses strive to create a more secure and efficient communication infrastructure. The following factors are believed to be driving this demand:? Businesses in Japan are increasingly adopting advanced security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and encryption, in order to protect their data from unauthorized access. As a result, they require an efficient way to share files between different locations and employees, with the goal of reducing the risk of data theft.
? In addition to safeguarding their data, Japanese businesses are also increasingly relying on collaborative tools to speed up communication between different departments and employees. By sharing files securely between locations, companies can reduce the time needed to communicate complex information.
? Ever-growing number of mobile workers in Japan. As smartphones become more ubiquitous and businesses move away from traditional office setups, employees need access to their files wherever they are. And, with a wealth of diverse mobile operating systems available in Japan, companies can tailor their solution to meet the specific needs of their workforce.Restraints? A lack of awareness and low adoption rates are the primary factors hampering demand in Japan.
? In addition, the Japanese government’s focus on protecting intellectual property (IP) has resulted in a reluctance among businesses to use EFS technology.
? In Japan, companies have traditionally been very tight-lipped about their data, keeping it within the company walls. This is no longer the norm, but in some cases it can take years for departments within a company to agree on changes or updates to shared files.
? Many Japanese businesses also operate on a group-by-group basis rather than an enterprise-wide basis, meaning that there is often little coordination between departments or divisions when it comes to sharing files or collaborating on projects.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS318Segment OverviewBy Component

Enterprise file synchronization and sharing is rapidly becoming a key solution for larger businesses in Japan. According to research conducted AstuteAnalytica, businesses with 250 or more employees are the primary consumers of enterprise file synchronization and sharing services. This is followed by businesses with 100 to 249 employees, and then smaller businesses (less than 100 employees). One of the main reasons why larger businesses are interested in enterprise file synchronization and sharing is that it helps them to improve collaboration across different departments. In addition, it can also help to cut down on administrative costs by reducing the amount of duplicate data that needs to be stored.

The Europe Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing (EFSS) study also looks at the various regulations and policies that the firm has implemented. This report discusses the industry in terms of research technology and precise prospective utilization, innovation, and future advancements in the Europe Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing (EFSS).Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS317Europe enterprise file synchronization and sharing (EFSS) market to generate sales value of $8,534 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 22.5% during the forecast period 2022 ? 2030, which was valued at $1420.4 million in 2021.In today’s world, organizations need to be agile and keep up with the ever-changing trends in order to stay competitive. One such trend is enterprise file synchronization and sharing. These services allow organizations to synchronize files between various locations and devices so that employees can work on the same documents regardless of where they are located. This helps to reduce the information management burden and improves workflow efficiency. Additionally, these services can be used for team collaboration and communication purposes, which is why there is so much interest in them.
According to a recent study, Europe is widely considered to be the leading market for enterprise file synchronization and sharing. This is due in part to the proliferation of mobile devices and collaboration tools, as well as stricter data privacy regulations in some countries. Moreover, many companies are looking to migrate their data storage solutions to cloud services in order to reduce their infrastructure costs.As a result, there is a growing demand for enterprise file synchronization and sharing services across Europe. As the demand for enterprise file synchronization and sharing increases, so too does the number of reputable providers available on the market. This means that businesses of all sizes can find the right solution for their needs, no matter how large or small they may be.Market Dynamics
Drivers
? Increased data complexity. As more and more data is generated, stored, accessed and shared by organizations, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage. This challenges companies’ ability to operate effectively and efficiently due to the sheer volume of data. Enterprises require solutions that can help them synchronize files and share information among different teams more easily.
? Business demands for interoperability. Many European businesses are focused on developing cross-platform base systems so that sensitive data can be shared between different platforms such as iOS and Android, Windows and Macs, etc. This requires solutions that can seamlessly sync files as well as provide collaboration capabilities between individuals and teams on different platforms.Restraints? There is a lack of perceived need for Enterprise file synchronization and sharing in Europe. This is due in part to the prevalence of consumer-based file-sharing tools, such as Dropbox and Google Drive, which are popular among professionals and business users. These tools provide a user-friendly experience that is more convenient and easier to use than traditional Enterprise file synchronization and sharing solutions.
? Europeans are generally less tech-savvy than Americans, which makes them less likely to adopt new technologies. This includes Enterprise file synchronization and sharing solutions, which can be complex and require a lot of individual knowledge and expertise to use effectively.
? Third-party vendors offer cheaper alternatives to Enterprise file synchronization and sharing products. This means that many businesses don?t feel that it?s worth investing in these solutions due to the high cost of implementation. Additionally, many European organizations don?t have an IT department with the necessary expertise to manage these files.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=ARS317Major Players in Europe Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing (EFSS) Market?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841001,Japan PM Kishida announces new Indo-Pacific plan in India,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday invited his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for the Group of Seven summit in May and announced action plans for a new Indo-Pacific initiative aimed at countering China's influence in the region.Kishida, who is on a two-day trip to India, said he hopes to promote a vision of free and open Indo-Pacific, a Tokyo-led initiative for greater security and economic cooperation that is geared toward curbing Beijing's growing assertiveness. It includes Japan’s assistance to emerging economies, support for maritime security, a provision of coast guard patrol boats and equipment and other infrastructure cooperation.It fits with Japan’s new national security strategy adopted in December under which Tokyo Japan is deploying long-range cruise missiles to strengthen its strike-back capability, and using development aid more strategically in support of like-minded countries.India, which is heading this year’s Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market nations, says ties with Japan are key to stability in the region. The two nations, along with the United States and Australia, make up the Indo-Pacific alliance known as the Quad.China's territorial claims in the East China and South China seas have rattled Beijing's smaller neighbors in Southeast Asia as well as Japan, which is also facing threats from North Korea's nuclear and missile development. The relationship between New Delhi and Beijing also has deteriorated since 2020, when Indian and Chinese troops clashed along their undefined border in the Himalayan Ladakh region, leaving 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead.Kishida also held talks with Modi to deepen bilateral cooperation while also addressing food security and development financing. The two leaders said they will closely cooperate in dealing with a wide range of global challenges, including soaring prices of energy and food supplies that have exacerbated since Russia's war in Ukraine.Kishida said Modi accepted his invitation to participate in the G-7 summit of major industrial nations, which will be held in Hiroshima in May. He told reporters later that he will also invite seven other heads of non-G-7 countries, including South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol — a step toward further improving Japan-South Korea ties and to bring Seoul closer to other key players in the strategic map of the region.In his statement, Kishida said he told Modi that he hopes to take up challenges at the summit including upholding the rules-based international order and strengthening partnership with the international community that goes beyond G-7 and includes the Global South, a term used for developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America.The two leaders also discussed their priorities for their respective presidencies of the G-7 and G-20, Modi said in a speech.Japan holds the G-7 presidency in 2023 and has sought deeper ties with developing countries to lay the groundwork for a successful summit.In an article for the Indian Express newspaper Monday, Kishida said “the foundation of order in the international community was shaken by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine” and its impact on food access and fertilizer prices were felt everywhere, including in the Indo-Pacific region.“In order to respond effectively to the various challenges that the international community is currently facing, cooperation between the G-7 and the G-20 has greater significance. Such pressing challenges include food security, climate and energy, fair and transparent development finance,” Kishida wrote.India and Japan share strong economic ties.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841002,Their world was the oyster: Oldest pearl town found in UAE,"SINIYAH ISLAND, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Archaeologists said Monday they have found the oldest pearling town in the Persian Gulf on an island off one of the northern sheikhdoms of the United Arab Emirates.Artifacts found in this town on Siniyah Island in Umm al-Quwain, likely once home to thousands of people and hundreds of homes, date as far back as the region's pre-Islamic history in the late 6th century. While older pearling towns have been mentioned in historical texts, this represents the first time archaeologists say they have physically found one from this ancient era across the nations of the Persian Gulf.“This is the oldest example of that kind of very specifically Khaleeji pearling town,” said Timothy Power, an associate professor of archaeology at the United Arab Emirates University, using a word that means ""Gulf"" in Arabic. “It’s the spiritual ancestor of towns like Dubai.”The pearling town sits on Siniyah Island, which shields the Khor al-Beida marshlands in Umm al-Quwain, an emirate some 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Dubai along the coast of the Persian Gulf. The island, whose name means “flashing lights” likely due to the effect of the white-hot sun overhead, already has seen archaeologists discover an ancient Christian monastery dating back as many as 1,400 years.The town sits directly south of that monastery on one of the curling fingers of the island and stretches across some 12 hectares (143,500 square yards). There, archaeologists found a variety of homes made of beach rock and lime mortar, ranging from cramped quarters to more sprawling homes with courtyards, suggesting a social stratification, Power said. The site also bears signs of year-round habitation, unlike other pearling operations run in seasonal spots in the region.“The houses are crammed in there, cheek by jowl,” he added. ""The key thing there is permanence. People are living there all year around.""In the homes, archaeologists have discovered loose pearls and diving weights, which the free divers used to quickly drop down to the seabed while relying only on their held breath.The town predates the rise of Islam across the Arabian Peninsula, making its residents likely Christians. Islam’s Prophet Muhammad was born around 570 and died in 632 after conquering Mecca in present-day Saudi Arabia.Umm al-Quwain's Department of Tourism and Archaeology, UAE University, the Italian Archaeological Mission in the emirate and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University all took part in the excavation. Umm al-Quwain, the least-populated emirate in the UAE, plans to build a visitor's center at the site.Today, the area near the marshland is more known for the low-cost liquor store at the emirate’s Barracuda Beach Resort. In recent months, authorities have demolished a hulking, Soviet-era cargo plane linked to a Russian gunrunner known as the “Merchant of Death” as it builds a bridge to Siniyah Island for a $675 million real estate development. Authorities hope that development, as well as other building, will grow the emirate's economy.However, even this ancient site bears lessons for the Emirates.The story of pearling, which rapidly collapsed after World War I with the introduction of artificial pearls and the Great Depression, holds particular importance in the history of the UAE — particularly as it faces a looming reckoning with another extractive industry. While crude oil sales built the country after its formation in 1971, the Emirates will have to confront its fossil fuel legacy and potentially plan for a carbon-neutral future as it hosts the United Nations COP28 climate talks later this year.Those searching the site found a dumpsite nearby filled with the detritus of discarded oyster shells. People walking across the island can feel those remains crunching under their feet in areas as well.“You only find one pearl in every 10,000 oyster shells. You have to find and discard thousands and thousands of oyster shells to find one,"" Power said. ”The waste, the industrial waste of the pearling industry, was colossal. You’re dealing with millions, millions of oyster shells discarded.”___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841005,20% of Taiwanese suffer from insomnia,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders among Taiwanese, with many turning to sleeping pills as a remedy.Physicians note that long-term use of sleeping pills can lead to more serious problems such as addiction, over-dependence, and avoidance of the root cause of the disorder.En Chu Kong Hospital Neurology Department Director Sun Yu (孫瑜) says insomnia can be divided into acute and chronic. Important events in life may cause temporary or acute insomnia, though difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep for more than three months is classified as chronic.Many patients with insomnia hope that doctors will prescribe sleeping pills to mitigate the problem, but Sun says that medical textbooks recommend only short-term use of sleeping pills with a warning to doctors to avoid long-term prescriptions.However, many people receive long-term prescriptions for sleeping pills. Sun warns physicians against prescribing sleeping pills to those who have never taken such drugs, as well as the general public against starting the habit.Insufficient sleep caused by insomnia can lead to various abnormalities in the body, such as weakened immunity, depression, and headaches. In severe cases, insomnia may lead to heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, and many other problems.Sun recommends non-drug therapy as the primary treatment for insomnia. Doctors can first look into a patient's medical history to find possible causes, such as physical disease or drug use. A sleep examination center can also measure brain waves with other physiological feedback devices used to teach the public how to relax.Sun appealed to the public to seek alternatives to medication to solve insomnia. Here are 10 suggestions to help you achieve better sleep:",2023/03/20,2414,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841033,Finland declared happiest country sixth time in a row,"Finland has maintained its position as the country with the happiest population for the sixth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report released on Monday.The report, which is compiled by scientists in the United States and based on surveys by the Gallup Institute, asks a nationally-representative sample of people how satisfied they are with their lives.Along with the Finns, Denmark and Iceland rounded up the top three happy countries.Israel climbed five spots to be in fourth place this year, with the Netherlands in fifth. Other countries in the top ten include Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg and New Zealand.Germany, however, dropped two spots from last year to 16th place.The United States, United Kingdom and France ranked 15th, 19th and 21st respectively.Meanwhile, Afghanistan and Lebanon remained the two unhappiest countries in the survey.The report emphasized that significant differences in country rankings for life evaluations were only seen at the extremes, as in the case of Finland at the top and Afghanistan and Lebanon at the bottom.The report identified factors that contribute to supporting life evaluations — including ""income, health, having someone to count on, having a sense of freedom to make key life decisions, generosity, and the absence of corruption.""Mental health was highlighted as a key component of subjective well-being and ""a risk factor for future physical health and longevity.""The report emphasized that everyone is entitled to basic human rights without discrimination, including the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression and the right to work and education.In July 2012, the United Nations General Assembly declared March 20 as International Day of Happiness, which promotes the idea that ""the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal.""DPA material contributed to this report.Edited by: Elizabeth Schumacher",2023/03/20,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841043,Hong Kong Baptist University-led research unveils cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and therapeutic target for COVID-19,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 20 March 2023 - A study led by scientists from Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) has identified a protease called MT1-MMP that is a major host factor behind the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the human body, which leads to the infection of COVID-19 and multi-organ failure. By applying a humanised antibody called 3A2 that can inhibit the activity of MT1-MMP, the viral load of infected mice was reduced by almost 90%. The research team also demonstrated that the protease is a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.       Dr Xavier Wong Hoi-leong, Assistant Professor, and Dr Guo Xuanming, researcher of the Teaching and Research Division of the School of Chinese Medicine, introduce the research findings on the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and therapeutic target for COVID-19.     The research findings have been published in the internationally renowned scientific journal  Nature Communications.   ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry   Vaccination can protect people against COVID-19 and its potential complications, but it is not always effective in individuals with weak immune systems, or against some COVID-19 variants of concern. Thus, the development of a more effective treatment for COVID-19 remains a huge challenge in the post-vaccine era. Understanding the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is vital to curb the spread of the virus, and it will also aid the search for new COVID-19 treatments.   SARS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein found on the membrane of human cells, as its receptor for cellular entry. Despite the lungs being the major organ affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, only a small proportion of lung cells express ACE2.   Previous studies found that the infection of organs with low levels of ACE2 expression by SARS-CoV-2 is made possible by a soluble form of ACE2. The soluble ACE2 binds with SARS-CoV-2, carries the virus to cells with low levels of ACE2 expression, and facilitates its entry into the cells.   MT1-MMP mediates cell entry of SARS-CoV-2   A research team led by  Dr Xavier Wong Hoi-leong, Assistant Professor of the Teaching and Research Division of the School of Chinese Medicine at HKBU, in collaboration with  Dr Yuan Shuofeng, Assistant Professor of the Department of Microbiology at The University of Hong Kong, further studied how the physiological regulation of soluble ACE2 shedding contributes to the aetiology of COVID-19.   The team found that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the increased activation of MT1-MMP, a protease crucial for many physiological processes. MT1-MMP mediates the release of soluble ACE2 from ACE2-expressing cells. This soluble ACE2 in turn binds to the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and carries it to the uninfected cells with low levels of ACE2 expression.   Notably, the team demonstrated that the introduction of human-soluble ACE2 enables SARS-CoV-2 to infect the lungs of a laboratory mouse strain (C57BL/6 mice) that is naturally insusceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the incompatibility of its mouse ACE2 and the viral spike proteins. The findings unveil the mechanism by which the virus hijacks host enzymes to enhance its infectivity, triggering multi-organ infections.   Antibody 3A2 blocks MT1-MMP activity   To study MT1-MMP's functions and how it affects viral infection, the researchers used human cells to create organoids, a 3D tissue structure grown  in vitro to resemble and model different organs in the laboratory.   They discovered that blocking MT1-MMP activity with the monoclonal antibody 3A2 effectively depleted soluble ACE2 levels and reduced the degree of infection of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung, heart and liver organoids by 60-80%. Consistent results were obtained using the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, as well as variants of concern, such as Delta and Omicron. The results demonstrate that MT1-MMP is a major host factor that mediates the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, and that it is also a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 drugs.   The researchers further tested the effects of applying 3A2 in a mouse COVID-19 model. A group of 11 mice were treated with either 3A2 or vehicle controls. Older mice were used in the experiment as old age is a major risk factor for severe symptoms and mortality for COVID-19. The results show that 3A2 reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 by almost 90% and dramatically alleviated lung tissue damage resulting from infection.   MT1-MMP as a therapeutic target   Dr Wong said: ""Two major challenges when it comes to developing COVID-19 drugs are how to enhance treatment results for patients with weakened immune systems, and how to maintain the drugs' effectiveness across different viral strains. 3A2 has good potential to become an effective drug for curing COVID-19 because it antagonises the activity of MT1-MMP, instead of boosting the immunity of patients or acting directly on the virus.   ""Our previous studies have demonstrated that 3A2 also offers protection against obesity and diabetes, two major risk factors for severe symptoms and mortality for COVID-19. Therefore, 3A2 could be particularly suitable for high-risk groups, including older adults and people with metabolic disorders. It could also be effective against emerging coronaviruses in the future, because ACE2 is a doorway for many such viruses with similar cell entry mechanisms. Further research and experiments on 3A2 are required before it can be applied in humans.""  Hashtag: #HKBU

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841044,World on 'thin ice' as UN climate report gives stark warning,"BERLIN (AP) — Humanity still has a chance, close to the last, to prevent the worst of climate change's future harms, a top United Nations panel of scientists said Monday.But doing so requires quickly slashing nearly two-thirds of carbon pollution by 2035, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said. The United Nations chief said it more bluntly, calling for an end to new fossil fuel exploration and for rich countries to quit coal, oil and gas by 2040.“Humanity is on thin ice — and that ice is melting fast,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. “Our world needs climate action on all fronts — everything, everywhere, all at once.”Stepping up his pleas for action on fossil fuels, Guterres called for rich countries to accelerate their target for achieving net zero emissions to as early as 2040, and developing nations to aim for 2050 — about a decade earlier than most current targets. He also called for them to stop using coal by 2030 and 2040, respectively, and ensure carbon-free electricity generation in the developed world by 2035, meaning no gas-fired power plants either.That date is key because nations soon have to come up with goals for pollution reduction by 2035, according to the Paris climate agreement. After contentious debate, the U.N. science report approved Sunday concluded that to stay under the warming limit set in Paris the world needs to cut 60% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, compared with 2019, adding a new target not previously mentioned in six previous reports issued since 2018.“The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts for thousands of years,” the report said, calling climate change “a threat to human well-being and planetary health.”“We are not on the right track but it’s not too late,’’ said report co-author and water scientist Aditi Mukherji. “Our intention is really a message of hope, and not that of doomsday.’’With the world only a few tenths of a degree away from the globally accepted goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, scientists stressed a sense of urgency. The goal was adopted as part of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and the world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit).This is likely the last warning the Nobel Peace Prize-winning collection of scientists will be able to make about the 1.5 mark because their next set of reports may well come after Earth has either passed the mark or is locked into exceeding it soon, several scientists, including report authors, told The Associated Press.After 1.5 degrees “the risks are starting to pile on,” said report co-author Francis X. Johnson, a climate, land and policy scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute. The report mentions “tipping points” around that temperature of species extinction, including coral reefs, irreversible melting of ice sheets and sea level rise of several meters (several yards).“1.5 is a critical critical limit, particularly for small islands and mountain (communities) which depend on glaciers,” said Mukherji.“The window is closing if emissions are not reduced as quickly as possible,” Johnson said in an interview. “Scientists are rather alarmed.”Many scientists, including at least three co-authors, said hitting 1.5 degrees is inevitable.“We are pretty much locked into 1.5,” said report co-author Malte Meinshausen, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. “There’s very little way we will be able to avoid crossing 1.5 C sometime in the 2030s ” but the big issue is whether the temperature keeps rising from there or stabilizes.Guterres insisted “the 1.5-degree limit is achievable.” Science panel chief Hoesung Lee said so far the world is far off course.If current consumption and production patterns continue, Lee said, “the global average 1.5 degrees temperature increase will be seen sometime in this decade.”Scientists emphasize that the world or humanity won’t end suddenly if Earth passes the 1.5 degree mark. Mukherji said “it's not as if it's a cliff that we all fall off.” But an earlier IPCC report detailed how the harms — including even nastier extreme weather — are much worse beyond 1.5 degrees of warming.“It is certainly prudent to be planning for a future that’s warmer than 1.5 degrees,” said IPCC report review editor Steven Rose, an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute in the United States.If the world continues to use all the fossil fuel-powered infrastructure either existing now or proposed, Earth will warm at least 2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, the report said.Because the report is based on data from a few years ago, the calculations about fossil fuel projects already in the pipeline do not include the increase in coal and natural gas use after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It comes a week after the Biden Administration in the United States approved the huge Willow oil-drilling project in Alaska, which could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day.The report highlights the disparity between rich nations, which caused much of the problem because carbon dioxide emissions from industrialization stay in the air for more than a century, and poorer countries that get hit harder by extreme weather. Residents of poorer climate-vulnerable nations are “up to 15 times more likely to die in floods, droughts and storms,” Lee said.If the world is to achieve its climate goals, poorer countries need a three-to-six times increase in financial help to adapt to a warmer world and switch to non-polluting energy, Lee said. Countries have made financial pledges and promises of a damage compensation fund.Developed nations “are expected to speed up the fight against climate change and do their decarbonization much faster than developing countries like Brazil. However, this does not take away our responsibility to do our part,” Brazil’s climate change chief, Ana Toni, said. “It will be our populations in developing countries, which are more vulnerable.”The report offers hope if action is taken, using the word “opportunity” nine times in a 27-page summary. But that word is overshadowed by 94 uses of the word “risk.”“The pace and scale of what has been done so far and current plans are insufficient to tackle climate change,” IPCC chief Lee said. ”We are walking when we should be sprinting.""Lee said the panel doesn't tell countries what to do to limit worse warming, adding “it's up to each government to find the best solution.”“The solutions are at hand,” U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said in a conference call about wildfires. “So let that be an alarm that lets us know that we must act with haste.”“How many reports that chill us to the bone do we need to read before we make the changes required?” asked Tina Stege, climate envoy for Marshall Islands, which are vulnerable to rising seas. “These changes will require some sacrifice — but aren't they worth it when a liveable future on this planet is what is at stake?”___Fabiano Maisonnave in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, contributed to this report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841045,Millions of rotting fish to be removed from Outback river,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Contractors are being hired to remove millions of rotting fish from a river in the Australian Outback after a unprecedented die-off following floods and hot weather, police said on Monday.The fish started dying in the Darling River near the New South Wales town of Menindee on Friday. Officials say the die-off likely occurred because fish need more oxygen in hot weather, but oxygen levels in the water dropped after recent floods receded.Police Assistant Commissioner Brett Greentree said keeping the town’s water supply pure was the main priority and removing the dead fish was the next most pressing issue. Trained contractors had been contacted about removing the fish with nets, but dates for the work haven't been set.“I’m certainly not making promises that all the millions of fish will be removed by contractors because that is really a logistical nightmare,” Greentree said.“I understand and acknowledge the smell and sights on the river — nobody wants to see that,” he added.Authorities were supplying potable water to residents who rely on river water, which was continually being monitored for quality, Greentree said.Mass fish kills have been reported on the Darling River in recent weeks. Tens of thousands of fish were found at the same spot in late February, while there have been several reports of dead fish downstream toward Pooncarie, near the borders of South Australia and Victoria states.Enormous fish kills also occurred on the river at Menindee during severe drought conditions in late 2018 and early 2019.Greentree said the current death toll appeared to be far larger than the events in 2018 and 2019.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/20,,World

She also planned to discuss issues the two countries cooperate on, including trade and the environment.She said that during her two days in Beijing, she would also meet with business leaders and hold a breakfast roundtable with female leaders.Mahuta plans to leave for China on Tuesday.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841047,Ukraine: Volunteer specialist doctors run clinics near front,"KHRESTYSHCHE, Ukraine (AP) — In a cramped municipal building in this former front-line village, its front window boarded up with plywood, a team of volunteer specialist doctors have set up a mobile clinic.For the residents, it’s a lifeline. Even before Russia's war, access to specialist medical help was available only to those who could get to the city, but the village near the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk did have a primary care doctor.Now, with the village health clinic damaged by the war, its residents have been left with little access to health care, and in particular to specialist care.“There is no doctor. We are without a doctor. They left us alone,” wept Mariia Hrebenko, 79, as a doctor took her blood pressure and tried to calm her, gently patting her hand. “No one is helping us.”The limited availability of health care has led to an exacerbation of existing illnesses that could be easily treated with regular medical attention, said Bohdan Avramenko, a 27-year-old cardiologist who is the medical coordinator of FRIDA Ukraine, a Ukrainian-Israeli medical aid organization.“Right now their limited access to the medicine is causing more chronic conditions and the exacerbation of the chronic conditions, which is very bad for the patients because simple diseases like hypertension, diabetes, which can be treated with a very simple medication, to be frank, very cheap medication, they cannot get it,” said Avramaneko. “So they stay with high blood pressure, with high glucose levels.”The teams have also been diagnosing what appears to be an increasing level of cancer, he said. “The limited access to the specialists, the limited access to the ultrasound, to the onco(logy) screening cause a lot, a lot, and a lot of new diagnoses of cancer.”Staffed by volunteer doctors, the group has been providing specialist doctors through mobile clinics in villages and towns near the front lines and in areas recently retaken by Ukrainian troops from Russian forces. Depending on the location, they can see anywhere between a few dozen and 250 patients a day, and they try to return to the places they have already visited once a month to provide follow-up care.The specialists most in demand are the ophthalmologist, the endocrinologist and the cardiologist, Avramenko said, while the team also provides childhood vaccinations. The 14 doctors who were working in Khrestyshche on Sunday were expecting to see about 50-60 patients that day.The teams of volunteers run the mobile clinics in the villages mostly during the weekends as they work in public and private hospitals across Ukraine during the week.Paramedic, nurse and former New York police officer Joseph Farkas, 61, has been with FRIDA Ukraine for about eight months, helping treat families in bomb shelters in towns pummeled by shelling and in villages that haven’t seen a doctor for months.“I wanted to help out,” he said. “Obviously, what is going on here, the Russian military invading Ukraine is wrong. So I wanted to do my share in helping out the people here.”Olena Chetskaya, 38, said both a general practitioner and a pediatrician had worked in the village before the war, but now there was no one to write referrals for specialists, leaving a trip to Sloviansk as the only option.“It’s very important,” she said of the volunteer clinic as she waited in line to see a doctor. “We have a lot of old people and they don’t have the opportunity to leave and go to the city.”One of them was Lyubo Rimar, 74, who sat patiently waiting for the endocrinologist. She hadn’t been feeling well all morning, she said, and felt a lot of pressure in her head.""Of course this is important,” she said of the volunteer group’s services. “We are old, and all the illnesses come to us.”___Vasilisa Stepanenko contributed to this report.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841067,China blasts British lawmakers for ignoring demand not to go to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Chinese embassy in Britain on Sunday (March 19) denounced a visit by British lawmakers to Taiwan that is happening this week.
A group of six U.K. lawmakers led by parliamentarian Bob Stewart, chair of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group, arrived in Taiwan on Sunday for a six-day visit, according to CNA. The group is set to meet with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) on Monday (March 20) afternoon, according to the Presidential Office.
A statement released by the Chinese embassy in London said the lawmakers have “insisted on visiting the Taiwan region of China despite China’s resolute opposition,” according to Reuters. This is a “gross interference in China’s internal affairs and a serious wrong signal to Taiwan independence separatist forces,” the embassy added.
“We want to tell the relevant British politicians that any act that harms China’s interests will definitely be vigorously countered by China,” it said, without specifying what those actions would entail, per Reuters.










Besides Stewart, the delegation includes other members from the House of Commons, including Rob Butler, Sarah Atherton, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Afzal Khan, and Marie Rimmer, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). The delegation will also meet with Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁), National Security Council Secretary-General Wellington Koo (顧立雄), Legislative Speaker You Si-kun (游錫堃), and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮).

The officials predicted that the militaries of China and the U.S. would seek to destroy the satellites of their opponents that ""enable precision-guided weaponry.""They added that this could be followed by cyber attacks on U.S. cities and the sabotage of West Coast ports in the continental U.S. When O-Donnell asked U.S. Navy (USN) Admiral Samuel Paparo what the U.S. response would be in the event of a larger crisis involving the South China Sea or Taiwan, he said:""We'll hope that they'll answer the phone. Else, we'll do our very best assessment, based on the things that they say in open source, and based on their behavior to divine their intentions. And we'll act accordingly.""Asked to describe the most concerning aspect of China's military buildup over the past two decades, USN Admiral Michael Gilday said that beyond the growth of China's conventional forces, what is also disturbing is the expansion of its cyber and space capabilities. Gilday added that the U.S. is alarmed at the ways in which the People's Liberation Army Navy is pushing other country's navies out of certain sectors of the South China Sea, and rather than abiding by international law, ""they want to control where those goods flow and how.""",2023/03/20,8922,Politics

DPP legislators Lo Chih-cheng (羅致政) and Kuo Kuo-wen (郭國文) will hold talks with LDP lawmakers Horii Iwao and Kokuba Konosuke, who have already arrived in Taiwan. The two parties held similar events in August and December 2021, but this will be the first in-person talk between the two parties.
The closed-door meeting will focus on Japan's national security strategy documents, Taiwan's recent defense and military reforms, the progress of Taiwan’s military cooperation with the U.S., and the situation in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan Strait, CNA reported.
DPP Chairman Lai Ching-te (賴清德) said he would like to hold talks in Japan in the future and make these discussions a regular exchange, according to a person familiar with the matter.










The Japanese lawmakers will depart on Wednesday (March 22).
Japan has been increasingly concerned about Chinese military expansion in the region and has repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. In December 2022, Japan released new national security strategy and defense planning reports.
Most notable of the new changes was the authorization of “counterstrike capability,” which points to the ability to strike another nation’s missile launching infrastructure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841134,Australia won't promise to side with US in Taiwan conflict,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — The Australian defense minister says his country has made no promises to the United States that Australia would support its ally in any future conflict over Taiwan in exchange for American nuclear-powered submarines.U.S. President Joe Biden and the leaders of Australia and the United Kingdom announced in San Diego last week that Australia would purchase nuclear-powered attack submarines from the U.S. to modernize its fleet amid growing concern about China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific.Australian critics of the deal argue that the United States would not hand over as many as five of its Virginia-class submarines without assurances that they would be made available in the event of a conflict with China over Taiwan. Beijing says the self-ruled island democracy, which split with China in 1949 after a civil war, is obliged to unite with the mainland, by force if necessary.But Defense Minister Richard Marles said his government had given the United States no assurances over Taiwan.“Absolutely not, and I couldn’t be more unequivocal than that,” Marles told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ’s “Insiders” news program on Sunday.“I want to make it really clear that the moment that there is a flag on the first of those Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s is the moment that that submarine will be under the complete control of the Australian government of the day and again, no one would have expected that to be any different. I mean, that is obviously the basis upon which this is happening,” he added.Australia, like the United States, has a policy of “strategic ambiguity"" in refusing to say how it would react to a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Australia and the U.S. have also shared a bilateral defense treaty since 1951 that obliges them to consult if either comes under attack but does not commit them to the other's defense.Former Australian Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull are among the critics who question how Australia could maintain its sovereignty with such heavy reliance on U.S. technology and military personnel under the submarine deal.The AUKUS deal — named after Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States — provoked an angry reaction from China, which accused Australia of going down a “path of error and danger.""Marles said while the submarines could be used in the case of a conflict, the main intention was for them to protect vital trade routes through the South China Sea and contribute to regional stability.“Nuclear-powered submarines have obviously the capacity to operate in the context of war, but the primary intent here is to make our contribution to the stability of the region,” Marles said.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841135,Thailand dissolves Parliament ahead of May elections,"BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand's Parliament was dissolved Monday by a government decree, setting the stage for a May general election that poses an opportunity to lessen the military’s influence in politics.The dissolution, just a few days before the end of the four-year term of the House of Representatives, was initiated by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who is seeking a fresh mandate in the election expected to be held May 7 or 14. The date will be announced next week.The election will pit the popular opposition Pheu Thai party, backed by billionaire populist Thaksin Shinawatra, against parties representing the conservative establishment and closely linked to the military.Parties led and backed by Thaksin have won the most seats in every election since 2001, but have been blocked by military coups, unfavorable rulings by the conservative judiciary and election laws drafted to favor army-backed parties.The leading Pheu Thai candidate is Thaksin’s daughter, 36-year-old Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who is heavily favored in opinion polls.If elected, she would be the fourth member of the Shinawatra family to serve as prime minister in the past two decades. Her father held office in 2001-2006, and Thaksin’s sister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2011-2014. Both of them were toppled by coups. Thaksin's brother-in-law Somchai Wongsawat served in the office briefly in 2008 before he was removed by a court ruling disbanding the People's Power Party, which was the name of Thaksin's political movement at the time.More than 52 million of the country’s population of over 66 million are eligible to vote across 400 constituencies. Four hundred seats will be determined by first-past-the-post races in each constituency. A separate party preference ballot will seat the other 100 members of the House of Representatives from national party lists. The prime minister is selected by a vote in a combined session of the newly elected lower house and the 250-seat Senate, a conservative body whose members are appointed.Prayuth, who turns 69 on Tuesday, first assumed the top job after staging a military coup as army commander, ousting Yingluck’s elected government in 2014. He did not run in the 2019 election but was selected prime minister by Parliament after the army-backed Palang Pracharath party formed a coalition government.This year, however, he faces a challenge from his longtime comrade-in-arms and deputy prime minister, 77-year-old Prawit Wongsuwan, who has been named the new Palang Pracharath candidate for prime minister.Prayuth joined the recently formed United Thai Nation party in January to become its candidate, even though a court ruled last year that he can serve only two more years in office under the constitution. The party is less experienced, raising the question of whether it can win the minimum 25 seats in the lower house to nominate Prayuth as prime minister.Both Prayuth and Prawit have polled poorly.Prawit had indicated he would be amenable to forming a coalition government with Pheu Thai, a position that was virtually unthinkable for a military-linked candidate just a few years ago.The stronger runners-up in the 2019 polls also have an important roll to play as possible partners in any coalition government. Chief among them is the well-funded Bhumjaithai party, whose base is in the populous northeast region, which holds the greatest number of lower house seats.Bhumjaithai Party leader Anutin Charnvirakul, a construction magnate before entering politics, is the deputy prime minister and health minister in Prayuth’s government, giving him a high profile during the coronavirus pandemic.He and his party are best known for campaigning for and implementing the de facto legalization of marijuana and other cannabis products, a policy that benefits the primarily agricultural northeast.",2023/03/20,,World

Taipower is installing bird repellent on poles and lines and removing nests that affect the power supply, per BCC.Taipower Taichung Branch said bird nests can easily cause power outages, mainly due to nesting materials, which can include conductive materials such as nails and metal wires. Once these materials come into contact with charged power equipment, a power outage can occur.According to Taipower Taichung Office, 190 bird nests were removed in Taichung in 2022. In 2023, 10 nests have been identified and cleared away so far.Taipower said if a nest is detected on wires or poles when inspecting power lines, it will arrange an appropriate time to temporarily suspend power to remove the nest, typically late at night or early in the morning, to avoid affecting people’s electrical needs.Taipower pointed out that whenever it removes a nest, it takes special care to check for any eggs or chicks.Taipower is concerned that more birds are nesting on electrical equipment. It noted that bird nests can be built very quickly, with some nests removed in the morning only to be rebuilt the next day.For this reason, Taipower is calling upon the public to report bird nests on electrical poles in their community to protect not only the birds but an uninterrupted supply of electricity.",2023/03/20,635,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841153,What are the advantages of concrete blocks over bricks?,"When it comes to building walls, two common options are blocks and bricks. While both materials have their own unique benefits, blocks are often preferred over bricks due to their durability, strength, and cost-effectiveness. In this article, we’ll explore the advantages of concrete blocks over bricks.Durability:Concrete blocks are known for their durability and strength, making them an ideal choice for building walls. They are resistant to fire, weathering, and pests, making them an excellent choice for areas with extreme weather conditions. Bricks, on the other hand, are more vulnerable to damage and may require frequent repairs and maintenance.Cost-Effectiveness:Concrete blocks are also more cost-effective than bricks. They are larger and require fewer units to complete a wall, which reduces labor costs and overall project expenses. Additionally, they can be produced in a variety of shapes and sizes, allowing for more versatility in construction design.Strength:Concrete blocks are much stronger than bricks, making them ideal for building load-bearing walls. They have a higher compressive strength than bricks, which means they can withstand more weight and pressure. This strength is especially important for buildings that need to withstand earthquakes or other natural disasters.Energy Efficiency:Concrete blocks are also more energy-efficient than bricks. They have better thermal insulation properties, which means they can help regulate the temperature inside a building. This, in turn, can reduce energy costs associated with heating and cooling.Fire Resistance:Concrete blocks are highly fire-resistant, which makes them an ideal choice for buildings that need to meet fire safety regulations. They are able to withstand high temperatures without crumbling or losing their structural integrity, which can help prevent the spread of fires.Speed of Construction:Concrete concept blocks are also faster to construct than brick walls. This is because they are larger and require fewer units to cover the same area. This means that less time is spent on construction, resulting in lower labor costs and a faster completion time. In addition, because of their standard sizes, they can be easily and quickly installed using automated machines and tools.Sustainability:Concrete blocks are made from locally sourced materials such as cement, sand, and aggregates, which makes them a sustainable choice for construction projects. Additionally, they can be produced using recycled materials, which can help reduce waste and environmental impact. They also have a long lifespan, reducing the need for frequent replacements and reducing the overall carbon footprint.Design Flexibility:Concrete blocks come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, making them an excellent choice for architects and builders who want to create unique and eye-catching designs. Bricks, on the other hand, have a more limited color range and shape options.Resistance to Moisture:Concrete blocks are less permeable to moisture than bricks, which makes them less susceptible to water damage. This is particularly important in areas with high humidity or heavy rainfall. Moisture can cause bricks to deteriorate and weaken, which can lead to structural damage over time.Sound Insulation:Concrete blocks offer excellent sound insulation properties, which makes them an ideal choice for buildings that require noise reduction, such as schools, hospitals, and offices. They are also good at reducing vibration and impact noise, which makes them an excellent choice for buildings located near highways, airports, or other noisy environments.Easy to Transport:Concrete is easier to transport than bricks because they are larger and require fewer units to cover the same area. This means that fewer trips are needed to transport the blocks to the construction site, reducing transportation costs and carbon footprint. In addition, concrete blocks can be stacked on top of each other, which makes them easier to store and transport.Low Maintenance:blocks are low maintenance and require minimal upkeep over their lifespan. They are resistant to weathering, pests, and other environmental factors, which means that they do not need to be treated or maintained as frequently as bricks. This reduces the long-term costs associated with maintaining a building and helps keep it looking good for longer.Resistant to Termites:Termites can cause extensive damage to buildings made of wood or other organic materials. Concrete blocks are resistant to termite damage because they do not contain any organic material. This means that buildings made of concrete blocks are less likely to suffer termite infestations, reducing the need for expensive pest control measures.Easy to Install:Concrete is relatively easy to install compared to other building materials such as stone or brick. They can be easily cut or shaped to fit the specific requirements of a building, and they are lightweight and easy to handle. This makes them a popular choice for DIY projects and smaller construction jobs.Better Fire Rating:Concrete blocks have a better fire rating than bricks, meaning that they can withstand higher temperatures for longer periods of time. This is because they have a lower thermal conductivity, which means that they do not transfer heat as easily as bricks. This makes them an excellent choice for buildings where fire safety is a concern, such as hospitals, schools, and high-rise buildings.In conclusion,blocks have many advantages over bricks that make them a popular choice for construction projects. From durability and strength to energy efficiency and fire resistance, concrete blocks offer a range of benefits that make them an excellent choice for builders, architects, and homeowners alike.",2023/03/20,,

League+ and T1 League to ban the controversial internet personality for life.During a T1 League home game for the Taoyuan Leopards as they faced off with the Kaohsiung Aquas, the TikToker Yu Chao-lin (游兆霖), who goes by the handle ""Eat S*** Brother,"" suddenly ran onto the court while wearing a No. 22 Phoenix Suns Deandre Ayton jersey. He could be heard shouting and recklessly running around Howard before security seized him.After the game, Howard told the media that it is very dangerous for fans to run onto the court. If they attack players, it could lead to unmanageable consequences, and Howard expressed hope that it would not happen again.However, the next day, with a little over five minutes left in the second quarter of a P.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841191,Putin to host ally Xi in Russia as Ukraine war rages,"Russian President Vladimir Putin hosts Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday hoping for support against Western pressure over his war in Ukraine while Xi will present China as a global peacemaker intent on brokering an end to the conflict.
Xi will be the first national leader to shake Putin's hand since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him on Friday over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia since its invasion.
Moscow rejects the charge and Beijing said it reflects double standards.
Russia is presenting Xi's trip, his first since securing an unprecedented third term this month, as evidence that it has a powerful friend prepared to stand with it against a hostile West that it accuses of trying to isolate and defeat Moscow.
""We can feel the geopolitical landscape in the outside world undergoing drastic changes,"" Putin said in an article in China's People's Daily published on the Kremlin website, adding that he had high hopes for the visit from his ""good old friend"".
For Xi, the visit is a diplomatic tightrope.
China has released a 12-point proposal to solve the Ukraine crisis, but at the same time strengthened ties with Moscow.
China has repeatedly dismissed Western accusations that it is planning to arm Russia but says it wants a closer energy partnership after boosting imports of Russian coal, gas and oil following Putin's all-out invasion of Ukraine. Western sanctions on Russian energy mean Beijing has saved billions of dollars.
In an article published at the beginning of his visit to Moscow, Xi said the two countries adhered to the concept of ""eternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation"".
China's Ukraine peace proposal, released last month, reflects global views and acknowledges difficulties, he said.
""Complex problems do not have simple solutions,"" Xi wrote in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, a daily published by the Russian government, according to a Reuters translation from Russian.
Ukraine and its Western backers would be likely to dismiss any attempt to secure a ceasefire as little more than a ploy to buy Putin time to reinforce, and delay a widely expected Ukrainian counter-offensive.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he will only consider peace settlements after Russian troops leave Ukrainian territory.
China's proposal contains only general statements and no concrete proposal on how to end the year-long war which has killed tens of thousands of people, destroyed cities and forced millions to flee.
Putin welcomed China's offer to mediate. He signed a ""no limits"" strategic partnership with Xi last year shortly before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine to end what he said was a threat to Russia from its moves towards the West.
The United States and its allies are deeply sceptical of China's motives, noting it has declined to condemn Russia and given it an economic lifeline as others impose sanctions.
Alongside growing oil and coal deliveries to China, Putin said Russia was helping to build nuclear power reactors there and the two countries were deepening cooperation in space exploration and new technologies.
The United States and the transatlantic military alliance NATO have recently accused China of considering supplying arms to Russia and warned it against doing so.
China has dismissed the accusations.
WAR CRIMES, ARTILLERY SHELLS
Justice ministers from around the world will meet in London on Monday to discuss support for the ICC.
""We are gathering in London today united by one cause: to hold war criminals to account for the atrocities committed in Ukraine during this unjust, unprovoked and unlawful invasion,"" British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said.
Several European Union countries will sign an agreement on Monday in Brussels to buy 155 mm artillery shells for Ukraine, with the first orders possibly placed by the end of May.
Ukraine has identified the shells' supply as critical, with both sides firing thousands of rounds every day.
In Ukraine, fierce fighting continued in the eastern town of Bakhmut with each side launching counter offensives. Ukrainian forces have held out in Bakhmut since last summer in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war.
Giving its regular morning roundup from the front, Ukraine's military said defenders in Bakhmut, Lyman, Ivanivske, Bohdanivka and Hryhorivka - all towns in the Donetsk region - had repelled 69 Russian attacks in the past day.
""Bakhmut remains the epicentre of hostilities,"" it said.
British intelligence said Ukrainian supply lines both west of Bakhmut and west of the town of Avdiivka, further south, were under pressure.
Ukraine's military said that Russian forces were on the defensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions to the south.
Russia's Wagner mercenary group which is spearheading the assault on Bakhmut and has suffered heavy losses, plans to recruit some 30,000 new fighters by the middle of May, its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said at the weekend.
In January, the United States assessed that Wagner had about 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, including 40,000 convicts Prigozhin had recruited from Russian prisons with a promise of a pardon if they survived six months.
Ukrainian officials have said that some 30,000 of Wagner's fighters have deserted or been killed or wounded, a figure that could not be independently verified.Russian President Vladimir Putin hosts Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday hoping for support against Western pressure over his war in Ukraine while Xi will present China as a global peacemaker intent on brokering an end to the conflict.Xi will be the first national leader to shake Putin's hand since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him on Friday over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia since its invasion.Moscow rejects the charge and Beijing said it reflects double standards.Russia is presenting Xi's trip, his first since securing an unprecedented third term this month, as evidence that it has a powerful friend prepared to stand with it against a hostile West that it accuses of trying to isolate and defeat Moscow.""We can feel the geopolitical landscape in the outside world undergoing drastic changes,"" Putin said in an article in China's People's Daily published on the Kremlin website, adding that he had high hopes for the visit from his ""good old friend"".For Xi, the visit is a diplomatic tightrope.China has released a 12-point proposal to solve the Ukraine crisis, but at the same time strengthened ties with Moscow.China has repeatedly dismissed Western accusations that it is planning to arm Russia but says it wants a closer energy partnership after boosting imports of Russian coal, gas and oil following Putin's all-out invasion of Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841192,Biden's appeals court nominee faces rare Democratic scrutiny,"WASHINGTON (AP) — One of President Joe Biden's nominees to a federal appeals court has generated rare concern from some Democrats and outside groups over his signature on a legal brief defending a parental notification law in New Hampshire, injecting the issue of abortion into his confirmation fight from an unexpected flank.Michael Delaney, nominated for the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Boston, said in written testimony to senators that he did not write the 2005 brief and otherwise had “extremely limited involvement” in the case that was brought while he was deputy attorney general in New Hampshire.But the signing of the brief, along with scrutiny of his representation of St. Paul's School, a private boarding school in New Hampshire that was sued in connection with a sexual assault, is complicating a confirmation fight in which the White House has little room for error.The close attention on an abortion case also shows how stakes are ever-higher in a post-Roe v. Wade world. Access to abortion could hinge on lower-level judges now that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned the constitutional right to the procedure and advocates on both sides want near-certainty as they assess nominees. The issue helped derail one proposed Biden pick last summer when the White House decided not to nominate an anti-abortion lawyer in Kentucky following an outcry from Democrats.Delaney’s case will test how far Biden will push Democrats to support his nominees to the federal bench even after the White House set records in the number of appointments in his first two years. It will also test the power of personal persuasion in the clubby Senate, whose members can often be influenced by fellow members whose counsel they trust.In this case, both New Hampshire Democratic senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, strongly back Delaney and are deeply respected by other senators. Both are also fierce supporters of abortion rights.At issue is a New Hampshire law, passed in 2003 but repealed in 2007, that required minors to tell their parents before they obtained an abortion. As the state’s deputy attorney general, Delaney was among those who signed a brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court that defended the law because it “does not present a substantial obstacle to any woman's right to choose an abortion.”The law, according to the brief filed in the case, Ayotte vs. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, ""promotes compelling state interests, not the least of which is protecting the health of the pregnant minor by providing an opportunity for parents to supply essential medical history information to the physician.”Delaney's involvement is detailed in response to written questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that he submitted after his confirmation hearing last month. But his signature on the brief has caused consternation for Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a strong supporter of abortion rights.“For me personally, reproductive rights is a fundamental, core issue,"" Blumenthal told The Associated Press. ""And I think I’d want to know why he put his name on the brief and what it reflects in his personal view.”Besides Blumenthal, two other Democratic members of the closely divided Senate, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, have also expressed general reservations about his nomination, particularly as it relates to the St. Paul's case. And at least one other Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is concerned about Delaney’s involvement in the Planned Parenthood case, according to a person familiar with the senator’s thinking who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations over the nomination.One factor being weighed is how much Delaney's involvement in the brief was just a matter of course in his job. Delaney told senators that he was not involved in the decision to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, nor did he represent New Hampshire during oral arguments there. He was not directly involved in formulating the brief's arguments, he said, and while he read the brief before it was submitted, he said he does not recall whether he offered substantive feedback.In a statement to the AP, former New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, said: “Mike Delaney strongly supports women’s reproductive freedom.""Lynch said he disagreed with then-Attorney General Kelly Ayotte on the Planned Parenthood case. “When Mike became my legal counsel, he worked with me to successfully repeal the law at issue in the case,” he said.Still, in private conversations, groups that support abortion access have similarly raised questions about why Delaney signed a brief that defended abortion restrictions. They have been dissatisfied with the responses.In a previously unreported letter, the National Council of Jewish Women said it would oppose the confirmation of Delaney, the first nominee from the Biden administration that it has rejected. The group pointed to his representation of St. Paul’s as well as to his signature on the Planned Parenthood brief.Saying federal judges should have a record that “evidences fairness, independence, fidelity to constitutional values, and respect for the individuals who appear before the court seeking justice,” the group wrote in the letter that ”unfortunately, after reviewing the record, we do not think that Mr. Delaney possesses those important qualifications.”The White House continues to support Delaney's nomination. Privately, White House officials are concerned that focusing on one motion or case could set a precedent for Republican opponents of Biden's picks to undermine other candidates for the bench, according to a person with knowledge of the internal deliberations who insisted on anonymity to discuss them.“This was the first we had heard that anyone was interested in more information beyond his 116 pages of thorough, under-oath answers,"" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""Michael Delaney has three decades of legal experience, including his service as Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of New Hampshire, and he is well-qualified to serve in this important position. The White House expects Senators to take his full record into account when evaluating his nomination.”Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a potent political force in Democratic politics, was noncommittal on Delaney's nomination, saying in a statement: “Planned Parenthood conducts a review of the records of federal judicial nominees. Our review of this nominee and his involvement in the Ayotte case is ongoing.”Biden nominated Delaney for the appeals court in January, almost a year after Shaheen's office first contacted him to discuss filling the vacancy. Since then, Shaheen and Hassan have been Delaney's biggest patrons, despite a rocky confirmation hearing that even Democrats say did not go well for him after he faced repeated questions from Republican senators who attacked his handling of the St. Paul's case.Shaheen and Hassan have worked privately to lobby colleagues. In a closed-door lunch with other Democratic senators earlier this month, Shaheen and Hassan made their case while offering what attendees described as more context and history on his involvement in the St. Paul’s case. During that meeting, the two senators also distributed copies of an endorsement letter from Susan Carbon, a longtime state judge in New Hampshire who served as director of the Office on Violence Against Women during the Obama administration.“He has the experience, the intellect, the character and commitment to justice, and a broad, broad amount of support, including from advocates for victims,” Hassan said. Delaney has been rated well qualified by the American Bar Association, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., says he will support him.Still, concerns persist among a handful of Democrats.Booker said he had some “preliminary concerns” about how Delaney handled the sexual assault case. Hirono said she was prepared to support him after his confirmation hearing but said she was now reviewing his written testimony and added: “So we shall see.”Blumenthal added: “Having concerns doesn’t necessarily mean that any of us will oppose his nomination.” Still, most Democrats on the committee said they were undecided on whether to confirm him.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841193,Top Israeli minister: 'No such thing' as Palestinian people,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — A firebrand Israeli minister claimed there’s “no such thing” as a Palestinian people as Israel's new coalition government, its most hard-line ever, plowed ahead on Monday with a part of its plan to overhaul the judiciary.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition said it was pushing a key part of the overhaul — which would give the coalition control over who becomes a justice or a judge — before the parliament takes a monthlong holiday break next week.The development came a day after an Israeli and Palestinian delegation at a meeting in Egypt, mediated by Egyptian, Jordanian and U.S. officials, pledged to take steps to lower tensions roiling the region ahead of a sensitive holiday season.It reflected the limited influence the Biden administration appears to have over Israel’s new far-right government and raised questions about attempts to lower tensions, both inside Israel and with the Palestinians, ahead of a sensitive holiday season.As the negotiators were issuing a joint communique, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich delivered a speech in Paris saying the notion of a Palestinian people was artificial.“There is no such thing as a Palestinian nation. There is no Palestinian history. There is no Palestinian language,” he said in France late Sunday. He spoke at a memorial event for a French-Israeli right-wing activist who denied the existence of a Palestinian nation and advocated annexation of the West Bank. The lectern was adorned with what appeared to be an image showing the map of Israel that included the occupied West Bank, Gaza and Jordan.Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said that Smotrich’s appearance with the icon was a “reckless inflammatory act and a violation of international norms and the peace treaty” between the two countries.It later summoned Israel's ambassador over Smotrich's remarks.Ahmed Abu Zaid, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, said the Israeli minister's remarks “deny the facts of history and geography … (and) undermine the efforts aimed at achieving calm between the Palestinian and Israeli sides.”Israel's Foreign Ministry on Monday evening released a statement affirming that it is committed to the countries' 1994 peace agreement.“There has been no change in the position of the State of Israel, which recognizes the territorial integrity of the Hashemite Kingdom,” the statement said.Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said Smotrich's remarks were “conclusive evidence of the extremist, racist Zionist ideology that governs the parties of the current Israeli government.”In Brussels, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the minister’s remarks “certainly cannot be tolerated.”“I have to deplore this unacceptable comment. It is wrong, it is disrespectful, it is dangerous, it is counter-productive to say these kinds of things in a situation that is already very tense,” Borrell told reporters after chairing a meeting of EU foreign and defense ministers. “Could you imagine if a Palestinian leader would have said the state of Israel does not exist. What would have been the reaction?”Borrell called on the Israeli government “to disavow those comments and to start working with all parties to defuse tensions.”A far-right settler leader who opposes Palestinian statehood, Smotrich has a history of offensive statements against the Palestinians. Last month, he called for the Palestinian town of Hawara in the West Bank to be “erased” after radical Jewish settlers rampaged through the town in response to a shooting attack that killed two Israelis. Smotrich later apologized after an international uproar.His remarks on Palestinians were reminiscent of those made by late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir that caused an uproar in 1969. She later told The New York Times that she meant there had never been a Palestinian nation. But critics say the comments continue to tarnish her legacy.During Sunday’s talks in Egypt, a Palestinian gunman carried out another shooting attack in Hawara, seriously wounding an Israeli man.The new violence, along with Smotrich’s comments, illustrated the tough challenges that lie ahead in soothing tensions after a year of deadly violence in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and more than 40 Israelis or foreigners have been killed in Palestinian attacks during that time.Sunday’s summit was held ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins this week. The Jewish festival of Passover is set to take place in April, coinciding with Ramadan.The upcoming period is sensitive because large numbers of Jewish and Muslim faithful pour into Jerusalem’s Old City, the emotional heart of the conflict and a flashpoint for violence, increasing friction points.Large numbers of Jews are also expected to visit a key Jerusalem holy site, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount — an act the Palestinians view as a provocation.Clashes at the site in 2021 helped trigger an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip.On Monday, Israeli police closed the offices of a Palestinian radio station in east Jerusalem, saying it worked for official Palestinian Authority media in violation of the 1994 interim agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. The PA condemned the closure.The heightened tensions with the Palestinians coincide with mass demonstrations inside Israel against Netanyahu’s plans to overhaul the judicial system. Opponents of the measure have carried out disruptive protests, and the debate has embroiled the country’s military, where some reservists are refusing to show up for service. Netanyahu has rejected a compromise by Israel's figurehead president.During a call with Netanyahu, President Joe Biden appealed for caution, the White House said, “as a friend of Israel in the hopes that there can be a compromise formula found.”The president “underscored his belief that democratic values have always been, and must remain, a hallmark of the U.S.-Israel relationship,” the White House said, and added that “fundamental changes should be pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support.”Netanyahu's government says the plan is meant to correct an imbalance that has given the courts too much power over the legislative process. Critics say the overhaul would upend the country's delicate system of checks and balances and push Israel toward authoritarianism. They also say Netanyahu could find an escape route from his corruption trial through the overhaul.The protests, along with the rising violence with the Palestinians, have posed a major challenge for the new government. So far this year, 85 Palestinians have been killed, according to a tally by The Associated Press.The number of Israelis killed during the same period rose to 15 on Monday after Or Eshkar, 33, died. He was shot in the head at point-blank range by a Palestinian in Tel Aviv on March 9.Israel says most of the Palestinians killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions and people not involved in the confrontations have also been killed.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for their future independent state.___Associated Press writers Isaac Scharf and Ilan Ben Zion in Jerusalem contributed to this report.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841194,Dozens in Indonesia protest Israel's presence at U-20 Cup,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Dozens of conservative Muslims marched in Indonesia's capital on Monday to protests Israel's first-ever participation in the FIFA World Cup Under-20 in Indonesia.The world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation is hosting the U-20 World Cup from May 20 to June 11 in Indonesia’s six major cities. A total of 24 countries from five continents are participating, including Israel, after a two-year delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the host country, Indonesia is automatically qualified for the tournament.Although Indonesia does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and is a strong supporter of the Palestinians, officials say the government will not prevent Israel from taking part in the tournament.Waving white flags bearing the Islamic declaration of faith along with Indonesian and Palestinian flags, more than 100 demonstrators filled a major thoroughfare in downtown Jakarta. They halted traffic, chanting “Allahu Akbar” and “Get out Israel from U-20 World Cup.”Authorities blocked streets leading to the Presidential Palace.The protest was organized by a conservative Muslim alliance that held mass demonstrations in 2016 against Jakarta’s ethnic Chinese Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, that led to him being imprisoned for blasphemy.Several moderate Muslim groups in the country also have joined in calls for the Israeli players to be denied a place in the tournament. They included Indonesia’s second largest Muslim organization, Muhammadiyah, which counts more than 60 million members, Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, widely known as Mer-C, and the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country’s highest Islamic body.“Israel’s long history of oppression against the Palestinian people motivates us to strongly reject Israel’s presence in any form in Indonesia,” said Nur Aida, a protester.Countries qualify for the U-20 World Cup based on performances in their respective U-20 or U-19 continental competitions.Last year, England won the title while the three other semi-finalists, Israel, France and Italy, and play-off winner Slovakia, all joined them in qualifying for Indonesia 2023. For runners-up Israel, this will be their first-ever appearance at a FIFA U-20 World Cup.Indonesia's Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Teuku Faizasyah said it is FIFA that decides on the participation of all teams and the rules of the game at the U-20.“Despite Indonesia’s position as the U-20 host, our country’s consistent stance on Palestine will not waver, not even a little,” Faizasyah told a news briefing.Early this month, Youth and Sports Minister Zainudin Amali said the government will guarantee the safety of all teams.Gaining the right to host the U-20 World Cup was a major milestone in Indonesia’s soccer development, raising hopes that a successful tournament would turn around long-standing problems that have blighted the sport in the country of 277 million people.Last October, 135 people died at a league game between host Arema FC of East Java’s Malang city and Persebaya Surabaya when police fired tear gas inside the stadium, setting off a panicked run for the exits.A court this month acquitted two police officials of a charge of negligence leading to the deaths, and sentenced up to 18 months in prison a third official as well as the organizing committee chair for Arema FC and the club’s security chief. The verdict drew outcries from rights activists and families of the victims.",2023/03/20,,World

The Sweet 16 won't have blue bloods Kentucky, Duke or North Carolina for only the second time since 1979.In are upstarts like Princeton, Florida Atlantic and a team picked to finish last in the Big 12 Conference.And, this being March, of course there's Tom Izzo.The bracket has been nearly devoid of the buzzer-beaters that college hoops fans have been accustomed to, but the games have been close. There have been four games decided by one point, the most since there were six in 2017 and three short of the record last matched in 1998.SOUTH REGIONAlabama has looked every bit the No. 1 overall seed, blowing out Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Maryland despite turmoil swirling around the program.Waiting for Alabama in Louisville, Kentucky, will be San Diego State. The fifth-seeded Aztecs are old and love to knock around opponents — just ask College of Charleston and Furman.The second game marks Princeton's first Sweet 16 in 56 years. The No. 15 seed Tigers had the first major March upset by knocking off No. 2 Arizona and proved it was no fluke by taking down Missouri.They face Creighton, one of three Big East teams to get this far. Inconsistent early, the bombing Bluejays and big man Ryan Kalkbrenner are in the Sweet 16 for the second time in three seasons after bouncing No. 3 seed Baylor.EAST REGIONFlorida Atlantic won the battle of bracket darlings by knocking off Fairleigh Dickinson, the second No. 16 seed ever to beat a No. 1, taking down Purdue.The Owls better be ready for some bruises against Tennessee at Madison Square Garden in their first Sweet 16. The third-seeded Vols bullied their way through the first two rounds, pushing around Duke after grinding out a win over Louisiana.Sharing the Garden marquee will be Michigan State and Kansas State.The Spartans are at their best in March under coach Izzo, who won his record 16th NCAA Tournament game as a lower seed by bouncing No. 2 seed Marquette.Jerome Tang is taking underdog Kansas State from one Manhattan to another in his first season in the Little Apple.Picked last in the Big 12, the Wildcats and undersized but undeterred guard Markquis Nowell shoved aside Montana State and wore down Kentucky for their first Sweet 16 since 2018.MIDWEST REGIONTang said the Wildcats won because they've “got dudes.” Houston has a few of its own.The Midwest's No. 1 seed, the Cougars have played the lockdown defense that made them a Final Four favorite at the start of the season, holding Northern Kentucky to 52 points and Auburn to 64.The Cougars' bid to play the Final Four at home now heads to Kansas City, Missouri, where they will face Miami.The speedy, fifth-seeded Hurricanes hit Indiana with a gale force of offensive rebounds, scoring 29 second-chance points to reach the Sweet 16 for the second straight season under Jim Larrañaga.Another Texas team is still in the mix to reach the Final Four in its home state — the one from Austin.No. 2 seed Texas overcame the midseason firing of coach Chris Beard to play some outstanding basketball under interim coach Rodney Terry. The Longhorns shut down sweet-shooting Colgate in the first round and earned their first Sweet 16 appearance in 15 years with a 71-66 win over Penn State.Up next is another coach making the most of an opportunity.Fired by Arizona two years ago, Sean Miller landed back where he started at Xavier.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841196,Grizzlies' Morant gets standing ovation after NBA suspension,"Ja Morant received a standing ovation from the Memphis crowd when he arrived courtside just before tip-off Monday night in his return from an eight-game NBA suspension.The two-time All-Star guard slapped hands with some of his teammates and was part of the line greeting starters as they prepared to begin the game. Morant then took a seat on the bench and watched the Grizzlies rally to be beat Dallas 112-108. It's unclear exactly when he'll play but he could return Wednesday.“He is going to be part of practice (Tuesday), and obviously we’re hopeful for Wednesday so long as everything medically clears out,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, adding the delay is part of the “ramp-up process.”The Grizzlies host the Rockets on Wednesday in the first of two consecutive home games against Houston. The teams meet again in Memphis on Friday.The Grizzlies know Morant has been working out, trying to be ready for this moment. Memphis was off Sunday after back-to-back wins, and Jenkins said he would like Morant to practice or at least participate in a shootaround before seeing game action.Morant first stepped away from the team March 4, hours after he livestreamed himself on Instagram displaying a gun at strip club in Colorado following a game against the Denver Nuggets. The Grizzlies said on March 8 that Morant would be sidelined for four more games.Morant met with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver in New York before the NBA announced his suspension last week, including six games he already had missed.The league investigation found that Morant was “holding a firearm in an intoxicated state” — but did not prove the gun was owned by Morant “or was displayed by him beyond a brief period.” The NBA also did not find that Morant had the gun with him on Memphis’ flight to Denver, or that he possessed the gun in any NBA facility.Police in Colorado conducted their own investigation and concluded there was no reason to charge Morant with a crime after looking into the circumstances surrounding the video.Morant said in an ESPN interview that the gun was not his and that he takes full responsibility for his actions.But the strip club incident wasn't Morant's first eyebrow-raising move. The Grizzlies had been talking with Morant about his off-court conduct even before the March 4 incident.“I can see the image that I painted over myself with my recent mistakes,” Morant told ESPN. “But in the future, I’m going to show everybody who Ja really is, what I’m about and change this narrative that everybody got.”Morant, whose suspension cost him $669,000 in salary and possibly a chance to max out the five-year contract he signed last July by making the All-NBA team, also has to keep working on himself away from basketball.Morant said he underwent counseling during his suspension.“He’d probably be the first one to tell you: 'Nothing is going to change immediately overnight. I’m going to learn and grow, but I’m going to get the skills and methods to do that both personally and professionally,’” Jenkins said.On the court, the Grizzlies are pleased with the growth of the 23-year-old Morant. After Memphis selected him with the No. 2 draft pick in 2019, he was named the 2020 NBA Rookie of the Year and last year earned NBA Most Improved Player honors.He is averaging 27.1 points and has six triple-doubles this season.He rejoins a Memphis team in the middle of a competitive postseason race. The Grizzlies, who were second in the Western Conference before the March 4 incident, are tied with Sacramento — four games back of West-leading Denver with 12 games remaining.Jenkins knows Morant will be “chomping at the bit” to rejoin his teammates, but the Grizzlies have a plan ready for his return.Jenkins said that all starts with what’s in Morant's head and in his heart.“He’s doing a really good job recognizing the improvements he’s making,” the coach said, “and that he has to continue to make.”In his pregame comments before the game with Dallas on Monday, Jenkins seemed ready to move on as the Grizzlies prepare for the stretch run.“Good first day back, and excited to have him back with the team,” Jenkins said.___Associated Press freelance reporter Clay Bailey contributed.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841197,Women's tennis works to safeguard against predatory coaches,"Lindsay Brandon is a lawyer whose past clients include athletes disputing doping suspensions. In her new post as the WTA’s first director of safeguarding, Brandon is leading an increased effort to protect athletes from predatory coaches — and others — on the women’s professional tennis tour.“Safeguarding is about emotional abuse. Physical abuse, as well. And it’s not just coach-athlete,” Brandon said in a telephone interview from the BNP Paribas Open, which wrapped up Sunday in Indian Wells, California, and was the first tournament she visited as part of the job she began 3 1/2 months ago.“There are other people that are part of this process,” Brandon told The Associated Press. “There can be athlete-to-athlete issues. There can be issue with respect to training staff separate from coaches. Those are just some of the examples.”Her priorities include managing the WTA security team’s investigations of complaints — she did not reveal how many are currently active — and “monitoring any potential concerns,” along with improving education and creating a safeguarding code of conduct she hopes will be published in 2024.The aim of that code, which Brandon said is separate from a general code of conduct that already exists, is to create a rulebook that outlines behavioral standards and establishes procedures to follow if a matter arises. It will apply to anyone who is credentialed “in the WTA environment,” Brandon said, including players, coaches, physiotherapists, other members of entourages, tournament staff and tour staff.“Safeguarding is multifaceted and strongest when the entire population is educated, invested and held to the same standards. ... We have a diverse body of players, staff and support teams, so the challenges and areas of concern will vary. As the governing body, our focus is making sure that players feel they can come forward and share their concerns, which plays a critical role in being able to address the issues that may be at hand,” WTA Chairman and CEO Steve Simon said in an email to The Associated Press.Might be hard to gauge the success of such an initiative so soon, but Simon found at least one positive measure.“We are seeing more athletes coming forward,"" he said, ""which is a great initial result.”Adding what Simon called “the expertise of a dedicated safeguarding position” is the biggest public-facing step taken by the Florida-based WTA in this area since the issue of protecting players drew increased attention last year: A French player once ranked as high as No. 39 accused her former coach of rape; another player sued the U.S. Tennis Association for failing to protect her from a coach she says sexually abused her at one of its training centers when she was 19; 2002 International Tennis Hall of Fame inductee Pam Shriver, who won 21 Grand Slam titles in women’s doubles, said she “had an inappropriate and damaging relationship with my much older coach” that began when she was 17 and he was 50.“Maybe we need to talk more to players and tell them what’s going on with everything so they know to be careful,” said two-time Grand Slam finalist Ons Jabeur, a 28-year-old from Tunisia. “Maybe it’s never enough and we should do more.”Simon expressed a similar sentiment during an interview at the tour’s season-ending championships in November.“We have ... background checks on our coaches. We have an athlete assistance program in place. We have mental health experts who are here to help if there’s an emotional issue. We have all sorts of education programs. We have investigators coming in,” he said. “One of the things that we’re educating everybody on is: We need to help ourselves. If you see it, you need to report it. We need to work with our players to have them learn to set up the appropriate boundaries around themselves and what’s right and what’s wrong.”Brandon, who said she played tennis through high school and for one tournament in college, came to the WTA after about seven years working for Howard Jacobs, a well-known sports lawyer who recently helped tennis pro Varvara Lepchenko get a doping ban reduced from four years to 21 months.“Lindsay’s knowledge in this area (applicable rules, inappropriate behavior, etc.) is likely more in-depth than anyone the WTA could have hired for this role,” Jacobs wrote in an email to the AP.Brandon planned to travel to the Miami Open, where play begins Tuesday, and “as many tournaments as I reasonably can this year,” including smaller events where younger players compete.“The earlier you can provide support and outreach to these athletes, the better,” Brandon said. “I tell people that I don’t want to just be a response resource; I want to be a support resource and a preventative resource, as well.”___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841198,Verstappen grumbles despite driving from 15th place to 2nd,"First he had a stomach bug that delayed his arrival at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. Then a mechanical failure in qualifying dropped Max Verstappen deep on the starting grid.So recovering for a second-place finish should have been reason to celebrate, right?Not for the two-time reigning Formula One world champion.Verstappen barely even praised Red Bull's second straight 1-2 finish after he rallied from 15th to finish behind teammate Sergio Perez at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit on Sunday. Verstappen won the the season-opener in Bahrain, with Perez second.Not even earning a bonus point for logging the fastest lap of the race — a point that kept Verstappen atop the F1 standings — could ease his frustration.“The whole feeling in the team, everyone is happy. But personally, I’m not happy,” Verstappen said after the race. “Because I’m not here to be second, especially when you are working very hard back at the factory to make sure that you arrive here in a good state, and basically making sure that everything is spot on.”The 25-year-old Dutchman had to delay his trip to Jeddah by a day because of a stomach bug. Then, a driveshaft issue hindered him in Saturday's qualifying and prevented him from challenging for the pole.Starting 15th would have meant simply trying to squeeze out a solid finish for most drivers. But not Verstappen, who charged through the field as if his rivals were parked.Even so, a distracted-sounding Verstappen complained about feeling weird sensations from the driveshaft late in the race.All those factors ranked higher to him than how he clawed his way back to a near-victory. He didn't even seem to care that his fastest lap nudged him one point ahead of Perez in the championship lead in what looks increasingly likely to be a straight Red Bull shootout for the title.""If that’s the case it’s fairly simple, right?” said Verstappen. “We are allowed to race, so the best one will finish in front.”Verstappen is a perfectionist on the track and so he struggles handling imperfections. He has the fastest car on the grid but it grates him — and perhaps overly so — when there are glitches beyond his control.It got to him last year when reliability issues forced him to retire from two of the first three races, and several times in previous seasons he'd also struggled to contain his temper when mechanical or engine problems affected his races.His frustration in Jeddah was compounded by the fact he led all three practice sessions leading up to qualifying.“It's not only about the pace of the car, we need to make sure we are reliable without any issues. After three positive practice sessions, I have an issue in qualifying,"" Verstappen said. “Of course, I recovered to second, which is good.”Yet the manner of how he finished second bugged the driver who won a record 15 F1 races last year.“You have to do a recovery race, which I like — I mean, I don’t mind doing it,” he said. ""But when you’re fighting for a championship, and especially when it looks like it’s just between two cars, we have to make sure that also the two cars are reliable.”Next up is the Australian Grand Prix on April 2 — a race where Verstappen's never won and retired twice.“We have to do better,” Verstappen said. “Just have a cleaner weekend. I think that would be nice as well.”___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841199,Radical action to cut plastic waste needed in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Spring is in the air. Daan Beach, a popular destination for water activities in central Taiwan, has been open since March 1, and Shanyuan Bay in Beinan Township, Taitung County, will be open for beach activities and swimming starting April 1.The opening of these beaches gives hope that they will be cleaned daily, as it is disappointing to see Taiwan's beaches so often awash with debris and rubbish during the off-season.A clean beach is an inviting and pleasant escape from city life, a quiet picnic, beach games with the family, and walking the dog. Perhaps it may even help attract the return of domestic and foreign tourists now that life seems to be getting back to normal post-COVID.Unfortunately, the off-season sees mounds of plastic and other non-degradable rubbish clogging up what should be the pristine coastline of Taiwan. It is not a good look from an aesthetic perspective, and it certainly brings into question the commitment to the environment in Taiwan's ESG aspirations.Some minor accolades should be given to individuals, companies and organizations who arrange some sort of regular beach clean-up. These activities are admirable, but it does not give an entity bragging rights or the ability to put a “tick” next to any question about its commitment to the environment in its ESG report.It’s not that Taiwan has ignored the issue of beach pollution. In 2017, the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) and Taiwan's environmental NGOs worked together to establish the “Marine Debris Governance Platform.""This followed intensive information exchange and discussion. The complexity and severity of marine debris in Taiwan was appreciated and the noble intent of this action plan was to work to reduce the production of and the impact caused by marine debris.The plan focused on four areas: Source reduction, prevention and removal, research and investigation and expansion of collaboration and participation. It was also pledged to ensure constant action, reduce the generation of marine debris, and mitigate its impact on the ocean environment.Taiwan recognizes marine waste as a major ongoing marine environmental problem. It has a sincere appreciation of the profound impact of marine plastic waste because of its slow decomposition.Recognition of the urgency of the marine waste problem even found its way into the 2020 Taiwan-U.S. Environmental Protection Technological Collaboration Agreement, which lists marine waste as requiring bilateral collaboration.The action plan, pledge of ongoing action, and agreement are positive moves. Yet, the appearance of Taiwan’s beaches at times seems to contradict all the beautiful words.Even so, according to EPA reports from earlier this month, the amount of waste on Taiwan’s coastlines has been reduced by nearly 60% over the past three years. However, domestically produced plastic waste continues to wash up on shorelines.The EPA reports are based on surveys commissioned as part of the Cabinet’s ""Salute to the Sea"" policy, which aims to protect, improve knowledge of and improve accessibility to Taiwan’s marine environment.Let us take a moment to applaud the improvements. A 60% reduction is significant, but it is not time to get carried away with celebrations as these improvements must continue and, without being pessimistic, it is possible we are already too late and it’s all because of plastic.We know that plastic has revolutionized our lives, but it continues to threaten not just Taiwan but also global ecosystems at an alarming rate. The real enemy is microplastics.Microplastics are found everywhere on Earth, and they represent a real threat to animal, human and environmental health. At less than 5mm long, microplastics are harmful to oceans and aquatic life and come from a variety of sources, including from larger plastic debris that degrades into smaller pieces.Present in a variety of products, from cosmetics to synthetic clothing to plastic bags and bottles which readily enter the environment as waste, microplastics are increasingly present in the marine environment and scientists have been finding plastic fragments in a wide range of animal species, from tiny crustaceans to birds and whales and even bears.New studies have shown that microplastics are also harmful to human cells. Microplastics have already been found in various human foods such as beer, drinking water, honey, sugar, and table salt and, naturally, seafood.The possible problems associated with plastic contamination are especially pertinent to the Taiwanese public because there is a relatively high proportion of seafood in the Taiwanese diet. Taiwan’s coastline is heavily polluted with macroplastics and microplastics, and the waters surrounding Taiwan, even with the improvements noted above, are amongst the most plastic-polluted in the world.Scientists are actively trying to find solutions to this hidden menace, but humans seem to have a unique ability to pollute and threaten their very existence.The media has and must continue to take up this issue, but it is arguable that only the complete ban of many plastics, especially single-use packaging, can avoid an environmental catastrophe.If Taiwan is to truly adhere to its commitment to the environment within its ESG plans, then radical action is needed. However, the appetite must be found to further reduce the amount of plastic pollution, and find ways to make a meaningful impact on the level of microplastics.",2023/03/23,726,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841208,65% of companies in Taiwan polled have at least one woman in C-suite,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) —  The British Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (BCCTaipei) recently hosted the Women in Business Forum: Climate Action Taiwan to present the findings of its cross-industry research on the status of women in climate action in Taiwan.According to the report, there are three key suggestions for increasing female representation, including hardline governmental legislation for businesses, tax breaks to incentivize female promotion, and regulations to appoint at least one female director per organization. Additionally, the report recommends identifying more creative means to facilitate women’s entry into in-demand industries where they are underrepresented.The research also examines the wide variety of measures adopted by private organizations to tackle climate change in keeping with local policies and legislation.Survey results showed that 80% of organizations are taking steps to reduce their impact on the environment. Meanwhile, 53.3% implement initiatives to attract and retain female employees.Responding organizations, ranging in size from one to almost 4,700 employees, reported that 81.9% have at least one female manager in C-suite positions, and 65.3% have at least one woman in a director’s position or above.Although the representation of women in Taiwan is growing, BCCTaipei’s interviews reveal barriers to gender equality. These include family pressures to prioritize childcare, discrimination from employers, perceptions about women’s role at work, a culture of male dominance in certain industries, a lack of investment in female-oriented training schemes, and few women pursuing university degrees in ICT and STEM fields.Another criticism is that employment policies tend to focus on pregnancy and childcare, rather than cultivating talent or promoting women to senior positions.At the event, Director-General Tsai Lin-yi (蔡玲儀) of Taiwan’s Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), said that Taiwan, ranked first in Asia for gender equality and is dedicated to empowering female leadership. ""Women’s contribution to reaching our collective goal of ‘Net-Zero by 2050’ in line with COP26 is essential for Taiwan’s future,"" she said.John Dennis, representative of the British Office in Taipei, said gender equality and green energy represent two core priorities for the British government’s ""Global Britain"" agenda, and he is delighted to see the progress made across a variety of industries in Taiwan. ""The UK has a profound role to play in Taiwan’s transition to clean, carbon-free energy through the development of strategic sectors such as offshore wind, and I look forward to further cooperation in the coming years.”Chair of BCCTaipei General Committee, Carl Blundon, talked about the organization's research, which offers valuable insights into women’s role in the climate debate. He said championing gender equality is not only vital for the success of private organizations, but for all aspects of wider society in Taiwan and abroad.",2023/03/24,346,Business

In the future, Fosun will focus on core businesses, innovation, and globalization. Nomura believes that with strong strategic determination, Fosun's business recovery is just around the corner, thus maintaining ""overweight"" rating on Fosun International, with a target price of HK$9.20.   Nomura pointed out that Fosun recently announced it has formally signed an agreement with Shagang Group on the transfer of 60% of the equity of Nanjing Nangang Iron & Steel United, and the overall transaction plan is progressing smoothly. Nomura believes that focusing on its core businesses and streamlining the organization is still the main strategic direction of Fosun International. Nomura also believes that Fosun's accelerated disposal of non-core businesses, consolidated capital buffer, active approach to adjust business structure, and focus on core businesses with high growth potential in the household consumption sector will enable the Company to achieve more valuable growth. At the same time, as Fosun continues to implement the strategy, Nomura believes that concerns regarding the Company's leverage ratio and liquidity will subside, and Fosun's fundamental operations are on an upward trend.   In addition, Nomura expressed optimism about Fosun's globalization strategy, and believes that Fosun International has formed solid globalization capability, which allows the Company to leverage its global business presence to gather resources around the world for customers worldwide. In terms of innovation, Fosun has always maintained a high investment in R&D, building a global innovation system led by product innovation, digital intelligence innovation, and management innovation, and leading the upgrade of family happiness with innovation.

Guo Guangchang pointed out in his speech that for the future development, Fosun will first focus on innovation and R&D investment, especially in biopharmaceuticals. Secondly, Fosun will step up its efforts to improve global innovation capabilities and operational capabilities. Fosun has full confidence in its overall development goals for this year.   Guo Guangchang said that since the beginning of this year, he has truly felt the rapid recovery of consumption, offline consumption in particular. In fact, Fosun's various businesses demonstrated optimistic performance in both domestic and overseas markets: Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival became an Internet sensation this year and attracted more than 4 million visitors. The recovery of the tourism industry is even more evident, the occupancy rate of Atlantis Sanya under Fosun Tourism Group (FTG) has exceeded 90% since mid-January and has exceeded 99% during Chinese New Year. In terms of overseas markets, Club Med posted the highest single-month business volume in its history of more than 70 years since its establishment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841263,"Report: 43,000 estimated dead in Somalia drought last year","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A new report says an estimated 43,000 people died amid Somalia's longest drought on record last year and half of them likely were children under 5 years old.It is the first official death toll announced in the drought withering large parts of the Horn of Africa.At least 18,000 people, and as many as 34,000, are forecast to die in the first six months of this year.“The current crisis is far from over,” says the report released Monday by the World Health Organization and the United Nations children’s agency and carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Somalia and neighboring Ethiopia and Kenya are facing a sixth consecutive failed rainy season while rising global food prices and the war in Ukraine complicate the hunger crisis.The U.N. and partners earlier this year said they were no longer forecasting a formal famine declaration for Somalia for now but called the situation “extremely critical” with more than 6 million people hungry in that country alone.Famine is the extreme lack of food and a significant death rate from outright starvation or malnutrition combined with diseases like cholera. A formal famine declaration means data shows more than a fifth of households have extreme food gaps, more than 30% of children are acutely malnourished and over two people out of 10,000 are dying every day.“The risk of famine still remains,” the U.N. resident coordinator in Somalia, Adam Abdelmoula, told journalists on Monday.Some humanitarian and climate officials this year have warned that trends are worse than in the 2011 famine in Somalia in which a quarter-million people died.“The death rate was increasing as the year came to a close,” London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine professor Francesco Checchi told journalists. The hardest-hit populations are in Bay and Bakool in southwest Somalia and displaced people who have fled to the capital, Mogadishu.Millions of livestock have died in the current crisis compounded by climate change and insecurity as Somalia battles thousands of fighters with al-Qaida’s East Africa affiliate, al-Shabab. The U.N. migration agency says 3.8 million people are displaced, a record high.A food security assessment released last month said nearly a half-million children in Somalia are likely to be severely malnourished this year.This time, the world is looking elsewhere, many humanitarian officials say.“Many of the traditional donors have washed their hands and focused on Ukraine,” the U.N. resident coordinator told the visiting U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, during a briefing in Mogadishu in January.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841264,Putin welcomes China’s Xi to Kremlin amid Ukraine fighting,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed Chinese leader Xi Jinping to the Kremlin on Monday, sending a powerful message to Western leaders that their efforts to isolate Moscow over the fighting in Ukraine have fallen short.Xi's trip — his first abroad since his re-election earlier this month — showed off Beijing's new diplomatic swagger and gave a political lift to Putin just days after an international arrest warrant was issued for the Kremlin leader on war crimes charges related to Ukraine.The two major powers have described Xi’s three-day trip as an opportunity to deepen their “no-limits friendship.” China looks to Russia as a source of oil and gas for its energy-hungry economy, and as a partner in standing up to what both see as U.S. aggression, domination of global affairs and unfair punishment for their human rights records.The two countries, among the five U.N. Security Council's permanent members, also have held joint military drills. U.S. officials have picked up indications China is considering supplying Russia with weapons for its fight in Ukraine but have seen no evidence they’ve actually done so.The leaders smiled and shook hands before sitting down at the start of their meeting, calling each other “dear friend” and exchanging compliments. Putin congratulated Xi on his re-election and voiced hope for building even stronger ties.“China has made a colossal leap ahead in its development in recent years,” Putin said, adding that “it’s causing genuine interest all around the world, and we even feel a bit envious,” as Xi smiled.The Kremlin leader welcomed China’s proposals for a political settlement in Ukraine and noted Russia is open for talks.“We will discuss all those issues, including your initiative that we highly respect,” Putin said. “Our cooperation in the international arena undoubtedly helps strengthen the basic principles of the global order and multipolarity.”Both Moscow and Beijing have accused Washington of trying to isolate them and hold back their development as they challenge it for regional and global leadership.In an increasingly multipolar world, the U.S. and its allies have been unable to build a broad front against Putin. While 141 countries condemned Moscow in a United Nations vote marking the first anniversary of Russian troops rolling into Ukraine, several members of the G-20 — including India, China and South Africa — abstained. Many African nations also have refrained from openly criticizing Russia.""We hope that the strategic partnership between China and Russia will on the one hand uphold international fairness and justice, and on the other hand promote the common prosperity and development of our countries,” Xi said.In their 4 1/2 hours of talks, along with a dinner that included a Pacific seafood platter and roast venison in cherry sauce, Putin would offer Xi a “detailed explanation” of Moscow’s actions in Ukraine, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Broader talks on a range of subjects are scheduled Tuesday.For Putin, Xi’s presence is a prestigious, diplomatic boost to show partnership in the face of Western efforts to isolate Russia over Ukraine.In an article published in the Chinese People’s Daily newspaper, Putin described Xi’s visit as a “landmark event” that “reaffirms the special nature of the Russia-China partnership” and said the meeting signaled that the two countries aren't prepared to accept attempts to weaken them.“The U.S. policy of simultaneously deterring Russia and China, as well as all those who do not bend to the American diktat, is getting ever fiercer and more aggressive,” he wrote.China portrays Xi’s visit as part of normal diplomatic exchanges and has offered little detail about its purpose, though Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Monday that China “will uphold its objective and fair position on the Ukrainian crisis and play a constructive role in promoting peace talks.” Xi didn't directly mention the Ukraine fighting or his peace plan when he sat down for the talks with Putin.Beijing’s leap into Ukraine issues follows its recent success in brokering talks between Iran and its chief Middle Eastern rival, Saudi Arabia, which agreed to restore their diplomatic ties after years of tensions.Following that success, Xi called for China to play a bigger role in managing global affairs.Although they boast of a “no-limits” partnership, Beijing has conducted a China First policy. It has refrained from supplying Russia’s military — a move that could worsen relations with Washington and turn important European trade partners against China. On the other hand, it has refused to condemn Moscow’s aggression and criticized Western sanctions against Moscow, while accusing NATO and the United States of provoking Putin’s military action.Western pressure has made Russia increasingly reliant on Beijing, observers said.Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, noted that Beijing is aiming at “getting Russia as a junior partner deeper into China's pocket.”Dmitry Oreshkin, professor at Free University in Riga, Latvia, observed that Beijing benefits from tensions between Moscow and the West, by gaining access to cheap Russian energy resources. “It’s very convenient for China, which couldn't get such a discount before,” he said.China last month called for a cease-fire and peace talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautiously welcomed Beijing’s involvement, but the overture fizzled.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby urged Xi “to press President Putin directly on the need to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” He also said the U.S. administration believes Xi could play “a constructive role” by speaking directly with Zelenskyy.The Kremlin has welcomed China’s peace plan, while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday any proposal that left Russian forces in place in Ukraine would merely let Moscow reequip and otherwise regain strength to resume its offensive.“Calling for a cease-fire that does not include the removal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory would effectively be supporting the ratification of Russian conquest,” he told reporters in Washington. “The world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms.”Kyiv officials say they won’t bend in their terms for a peace accord.Ukraine's allies, meanwhile, are stepping up their support. The State Department announced Monday that the U.S. will send Ukraine $350 million in weapons and equipment. The latest aid package includes ammunition, such as rockets for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, fuel tanker trucks and riverine boats.In Brussels, European Union countries endorsed a fast-track procedure to provide Ukraine with artillery shells, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. He hailed “a historic decision” for the 27-nation bloc and Norway to send Ukraine 1 million 155 mm artillery shells within 12 months.Xi’s trip came after the International Criminal Court in The Hague announced Friday it wants to put Putin on trial for the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.The Kremlin doesn't recognize the court's authority and has rejected its move against Putin as “legally null and void.” China, the U.S. and Ukraine also don't recognize the ICC, but the decision tarnished Putin's international standing.China’s Foreign Ministry urged the ICC to “respect the jurisdictional immunity” of a head of state and “avoid politicization and double standards.”Russia’s Investigative Committee retaliated Monday by opening a criminal case against a prosecutor and three judges of the ICC over the arrest warrants issued for Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova. The committee called the ICC’s prosecution “unlawful” because it was, among other things, a “criminal prosecution of a knowingly innocent person.”___Follow the AP’s coverage of Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine___Associated Press writer Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841265,Arrests as Kenya opposition leads anti-government protests,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — At least three Kenyan legislators and several protesters have been arrested and then released for participating in protests in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, in which opposition supporters demanded the resignation of President William Ruto.Opposition leader Raila Odinga joined thousands of demonstrators and announced weekly demonstrations until the president resigns or the cost of living goes down.Odinga's convoy of dozens of cars drove around the city after being blocked from accessing the central business district.He made public addresses on several stops and his motorcade was teargassed several times by police. In response his supporters pelted stones at the police.Odinga asserted that his car was shot at by the police and his party spokesperson shared a photo of a shattered windscreen online.Police did not respond to a request from The Associated Press to comment on the shooting claims.The legislators arrested have been released and are to appear in court on Thursday on charges that have not yet been announced, according to Nairobi police chief Adamson Bungei.He said others arrested in the protests would be released after paying cash bail.Bungei had over the weekend said police had denied the opposition permission to hold their protests and that any congregation would be illegal.The opposition called for protests against Ruto who they say was not validly elected in the August 2022 elections. They are also blaming Ruto’s administration for the rising cost of living.Opposition leader Raila Odinga on Sunday insisted that protests would proceed as planned and demonstrators would march to State House, the official residence of the president.Odinga said Kenyan citizens have a constitutional right to demonstrate and the role of the police is to protect them after they issue a notification in advance.Police have been heavily deployed to State House with motorists and pedestrians being stopped from accessing the road there.Most shops in Nairobi's central business district closed on Monday as business owners feared looting.Kenya's deputy president Rigathi Gachagua said the country has lost about 2 billion Kenya shillings ($15 million) due to Monday's protests. Gachagua urged Odinga to call off the protests and think about the losses to the economy.The leaders who have been arrested include the senate minority leader Stewart Madzayo and members of parliament Opiyo Wandayi and Amina Mnyazi.Other legislators who had turned up at the designated meeting point in the city were dispersed by the police with teargas. They retreated to parliament buildings where they announced that protests would continue through the afternoon.Kenya’s opposition has in the past held violent demonstrations in which people have died.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841266,Activists demand EU halts 'green' funds for Spain ski resort,"MADRID (AP) — Spanish environmental groups on Monday called on the European Union to open an inquiry into the approval of 26.4 million euros ($28.1 million) of “green” economic recovery funds to join two ski resorts in the rapidly warming Pyrenees mountain range.Five Spanish groups sent a delegation to Brussels for meetings this week with European Union lawmakers and officials to urge greater scrutiny of a project they say will cause irreversible damage to the glacial valley of Canal Roya in the Aragon region.The EU’s 724 billion-euro ($763-billion) COVID-19 recovery program is supposed to support member states to “build a greener, more digital and more resilient future,"" with stringent rules on impacting biodiversity, water use and carbon emissions.The activists argue the union of the resorts of Astún-Candanchú and Formigal with an 8-kilometer-long cable car link violates these conditions. The plan was approved by Spain’s tourism ministry in December.“This is a space of enormous environmental quality, and serves as a green corridor for the passage of animal populations such as the bearded vulture or other flora and fauna characteristic of the area,” said Marina Gros, spokesperson for Ecologists in Action.Gros criticized the “opacity” of the Aragon regional government in its management of pandemic recovery funds, and alleged hypocrisy on the part of Spain's central government for approving the project, given its recent trumpeting of its green credentials.“These funds supposedly for sustainable tourism are being dedicated more than 80% to only four projects (in Aragon) based on snow-based tourism,” she said. After trying and failing to stop the project domestically, Ecologists in Action have joined with groups including Greenpeace and WWF to tackle the issue in Brussels.A petition to stop the cable car project from going ahead has so far garnered almost 50,000 signatures, making it one of the most popular on the Change.org website.Critics argue that skiing is neither financially nor environmentally sustainable in the rapidly warming mountain range. Many resorts draw water from nearby streams or reservoirs and typically use compressed air and electricity to blow snow into piles on the slopes when it’s cold.Spanish scientists said in 2021 that the Pyrenees’ glaciers will likely be reduced to ice patches in the next two decades due to climate change. The mountains have suffered a higher-than-average 1.5-degree-Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) overall temperature increase since the 19th century.Spain was one of the first EU countries to apply for and receive funds from the EU pandemic recovery fund, and stands to be among its main beneficiaries. It is set to receive a total of 140 billion euros, half in direct transfers, half in loans.The European Court of Auditors warned this month of insufficient checks and safeguards on how EU member countries spend the 724 billion euros ($763 billion) of pandemic recovery funds. A visiting EU Parliament delegation urged the Madrid government in February to be more transparent and flexible in its use of the funds and in providing public information about them.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841267,Pakistani police arrest scores more Imran Khan supporters,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani police on Monday arrested scores more supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan for attacking officers over the weekend outside an Islamabad court where the ousted premier was to appear on graft charges, officials said.Meanwhile, a rocket hit a vehicle carrying Khan supporters in the country's northwest, killing 10 people.The arrests were the latest amid legal cases facing Khan, now opposition leader, since his ouster in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. The standoff between the 70-year-old former cricket player turned Islamist politician, and the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, has turned increasingly violent.Monday's arrests bring the total number of Khan's followers detained in Islamabad to 198 since Saturday, when 59 were arrested in the Pakistani capital. Khan’s followers threw firebombs and hurled rocks at the officers as riot police wielded batons and fired tear gas. More than 50 officers were injured and at a police checkpoint, several cars and motorcycles were torched.Also on Monday, police arrested Saddique Jan, a Pakistani TV anchor known for supporting Khan in Islamabad, his BOL TV station said. It was unclear on what charges police arrested Jan, who was nabbed from outside his office. His arrest drew condemnation from colleagues, politicians and human rights activists.A rocket struck a vehicle carrying Khan supporters in the northwest on Monday, killing Atif Munsif, a local leader from Khan's party, and nine others, officials said. The attack happened in Abbottabad, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said Asghar Khan, a local police chief unrelated to the former prime minister. He said it was unclear who was behind the attack.The police chief said the Khan supporters were apparently returning to Abbottabad from Islamabad.Khan said Munsif's political rivals were behind previous gun attacks on elders from his family. He said police were investigating.There was no immediate comment from Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, which is currently preparing for an upcoming election for a regional assembly in the northwest, where Khan is hugely popular.Also on Saturday, police stormed Khan’s residence in the eastern city of Lahore, arrested 61 suspects there and seized Molotov cocktails, weapons and ammunition after clashing with his supporters.Khan was not at home, having traveled to Islamabad for the court appearance on charges he had sold state gifts received while in office and concealed assets. After he failed to appear before the Islamabad court, the judge postponed that hearing until March 30.Earlier last week, Khan’s residence in Lahore was the scene of two days of clashes between police and his followers when officers attempted to arrest Khan. The warrant was later suspended.On Sunday, police in Islamabad filed charges against Khan, 17 of his aides and scores of supporters, accusing them of terrorism and offenses related to the clashes in Islamabad the previous day. Police have also charged those arrested later with the same charges. Among the detained is Hassan Niazi, a nephew of Khan, police said in a statement.Khan denies any wrongdoing and has claimed that his ouster was a conspiracy by Sharif's government and Washington. Both Sharif and the United States have dismissed the allegations.Khan has also claimed there are plots to assassinate him since he was wounded last November in a shooting attack while leading a rally, when a gunman sprayed Khan's vehicle and entourage with bullets. That attack killed one of Khan's supporters and wounded 13.On Monday, Khan claimed his scheduled court appearance Saturday in Islamabad was another such plot and promised to provide details later.“I will expose how I almost walked into a death trap & the plot to kill me in the Judicial Complex,” he tweeted.Khan in a video message on Monday said he didn't go to the judicial complex on Saturday to avoid a possible attack. He did not back up his claim and said the government was behind the plot to kill him to avoid a possible defeat in the next parliamentary elections, which are due later this year. He demanded to be allowed to face court cases via video links to avoid any further attack on him.___Associated Press writer Riaz Khan contributed to this story from Peshawar, Pakistan.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841268,Good soccer and big wins help Barcelona leave scandal aside,"MADRID (AP) — By playing good soccer and winning big matches, Barcelona is leaving aside the distractions of its latest scandal.With its second win over Real Madrid in less than three weeks, Barcelona made sure there is more talk about the team’s prowess on the field than the club’s alleged troubles away from it.The Catalan club has been under scrutiny over its payments of several millions of dollars over several years to the former vice president of the country’s refereeing committee. The club will have to defend itself in the courts after being formally accused by prosecutors with alleged corruption, fraudulent management and falsification of documentation.Barcelona is holding its own just fine on the field, though. It rallied for a 2-1 win over Madrid on Sunday to all but secure its first Spanish league title since 2019. The victory, coming on a stoppage-time winner by Franck Kessié after Madrid took an early lead at the Camp Nou, gave Barcelona a more-than-comfortable 12-point lead over its rival with 12 games left.“It was a happy locker room,” Barcelona coach Xavi said. “We can’t forget where we are coming from. Last year, the gap to Madrid was 12 points, but we were behind. In October we were three points back, so we made up 15 points to Madrid. You have to give credit to how things are being done in this club.”Madrid is among the clubs siding against Barcelona in the legal proceedings, as is the Spanish government, the league and the soccer federation. Barcelona has consistently denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest, saying it paid for technical reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games.Madrid did leave the Camp Nou complaining about the refereeing, though, after its 81st-minute go-ahead goal by Marco Asensio was disallowed by video review in a tight offside call. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the offside wasn't clear enough to be overturned.Barcelona had already been saved by the VAR last weekend when Athletic Bilbao’s equalizer was called back after a controversial handball in the buildup of Iñaki Williams’ 87th-minute goal.Despite the recent help, Barcelona has been playing well under Xavi and finding ways to win when the team is not on its best form or dealing with injuries like the recent ones to Robert Lewandowski, Ousmane Dembélé and Pedri.Barcelona is seeking its first league title since being dragged into a deep financial crisis that led to the departure of Lionel Messi to Paris Saint-Germain. It's chasing a 27th league trophy, which would leave it eight behind Madrid.Barcelona won eight league titles in 11 seasons through 2019. Since then, it finished second to Madrid in 2020, third — behind Madrid and champion Atletico Madrid — in 2021, and second to Madrid again last season without Messi.This year it has already won the Spanish Super Cup — the team’s first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey. The Catalan club was eliminated from both the Champions League and Europa League again, but remains alive in the Copa. It is facing Madrid in the semifinals, having won the first leg 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium after another solid performance. The return leg is next month at Camp Nou.Barcelona will need another big result then to keep the spotlight on Xavi's team and not on the club's off-the-field problems.“We’ve only won the Super Cup so far,” Xavi said. “The league is ours to lose. We can’t relax. We hope the players return well from the international break.” ___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841269,French government survives no-confidence votes over pensions,"PARIS (AP) — Parliament adopted a divisive pension bill Monday raising the retirement age in France from 62 to 64, after lawmakers in the lower chamber rejected two no-confidence votes against the government.But the bill pushed through by President Emmanuel Macron without lawmakers' approval still faces a review by the Constitutional Council before it can be signed into law. The council has the power to reject articles within bills but usually approves them.The first no-confidence motion, proposed by a small centrist group with support across the left, narrowly missed approval by National Assembly lawmakers Monday afternoon, garnering 278 of the 287 votes needed to pass. The second motion, brought by the far-right National Rally, won just 94 votes in the chamber.Macron’s centrist alliance has more seats than any other group in the lower chamber.The speaker of the National Assembly, Yael Braun-Pivet, said the failure of both votes means parliament has adopted the pension bill.Yet this is not the end of the complex path to turn the bill into law. Opponents said they would ask the Constitutional Council to review the text before it is formally promulgated, opening the door to the possible rejection of articles within the measure if they are not in line with the constitution. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said she would ask the council to censure it.Macron, who has remained silent since his decision to push the bill through last week, will meet Tuesday morning with Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and the leaders of his centrist alliance.After the first vote Monday, some leftist lawmakers called for Borne to resign.“Only nine votes are missing … to bring both the government down and its reform down,” hard-left lawmaker Mathilde Panot said. “The government is already dead in the eyes of the French, it doesn't have any legitimacy any more.”The Senate, dominated by conservatives who back the retirement plan, approved the legislation last week.The head of The Republicans’ lawmakers, Olivier Marleix, earlier explained why his group would reject the motions.“We acknowledge the need for a reform to save our pension system and defend retirees’ purchasing power,” he said during the debate Monday afternoon. A minority of conservatives lawmakers strayed from the party line and voted in favor of the first motion.Centrist lawmaker Charles de Courson, whose allies introduced the motion supported by the left, deplored the government's decision to use a special constitutional power to skirt a vote on the pension bill last week.“How can we accept such contempt for parliament? How can we accept such conditions to examine a text which will have lasting effects on the lives of millions of our fellow citizens?” he exclaimed.France, like many richer nations, has a low birth rate and its citizens have longer life expectancy.The tensions in the political arena have been echoed on the streets, marked by intermittent protests and strikes in various sectors, including transportation, energy and sanitation workers. Garbage in Paris has piled ever higher and reeked of rotting food on the 15th day of a strike by collectors. The three main incinerators serving the French capital have been mostly blocked, as has a garbage sorting center northwest of Paris.On Monday, hundreds of mainly young protesters gathered by Les Invalides, the final resting place of Napoleon, to demonstrate against pension reform. Some trash bins were set on fire in early evening, but the protest was otherwise calm. Participants listened to the proceedings in the National Assembly through a channel broadcast on loudspeaker from a union van.“The goal is to support the workers on strike in Paris ... to put pressure on this government that wants to pass this unjust, brutal and useless and ineffective law,” said Kamel Brahmi, of the leftist CGT union, speaking to workers with a bullhorn at the Romainville sorting plant.Some refineries that supply gas stations also are at least partially blocked, and Transport Minister Clement Beaune said on France-Info radio Monday that he would take action if necessary to ensure that fuel still gets out.Opinion polls show a large majority of the French oppose raising the retirement age.Economic challenges have prompted unrest across Western Europe, where many countries have low birthrates, leaving fewer young workers to sustain pensions for retirees. Spain’s leftist government joined with labor unions last week to announce a “historic” deal to save its pension system.Spain’s Social Security Minister José Luis Escrivá said the French have a very different, unsustainable model. Spain’s workers already must stay on the job until at least 65 and won’t be asked to work longer — instead, their new deal increases employer contributions for higher-wage earners.The reform in France also would require 43 years of work to earn a full pension at 64, otherwise workers would still have to wait until they turn 67.Unions in France have called for new nationwide protests on Thursday to demand the government simply withdraw the retirement bill.“I know the questions and concerns that this reform is raising. I know what it asks of many of our fellow citizens,” Borne said Monday. Macron vowed to push the pension plan through, she said, out of “transparency” and “responsibility,” because it is needed to keep the system from diving into deficit amid France’s aging population.___Associated Press reporters Jeffrey Schaeffer and Thomas Adamson in Paris and Nicolas Garriga in Romainville, France, contributed to this report.",2023/03/21,,World

These were tires that were strategically placed for acts of criminality,” said police spokeswoman Athlenda Mathe.Some protest marches were noted in various areas including Alexandra and Tembisa townships, east of Johannesburg.Several roads leading to the center of Johannesburg's eastern suburb of Kempton Park were closed as protesters marched to voice their grievances.“All South Africans should be protesting with us right now because loadshedding (power cuts) is affecting all of us. The government must know that we are suffering, especially us who are running small businesses,” said Cedric Cele, who joined the EFF demonstration in Kempton Park.The protest was meant to highlight South Africa's power cuts which have seen households and businesses go without electricity for up to 12 hours daily.Security forces were deployed to monitor the protests Monday, with government officials describing them as part of the EFF's “regime change agenda.”The EFF is South Africa’s third largest political party by representatives in the National Assembly.",2023/03/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841324,"Credit Suisse, UBS shares sink after last minute takeover","Stock markets remained jittery on Monday as they opened following the announcement of the takeover of embattled Swiss lender Credit Suisse on Sunday by UBS and Swiss National Bank.The buyout for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion, €3.03 billion) was agreed after weekend talks that ran into Sunday evening, finalizing just ahead of financial markets' Monday openings in New Zealand, Australia and eastern Asia.The rescue of Credit Suisse has shaken Switzerland, a country that has built its reputation around being a safe banking and financial hub.Shares in the embattled lending giant were down over 60% in Zurich on Monday morning, dipping below the price paid by UBS, whose own share price fell by over 8%.Fears of an economic downturn sent the price of oil tumbling while gold — seen as a relatively safe investment — saw its price top $2,000 for the first time in over a year.The Europe-wide banking index was down 3.2% on Monday, its lowest level in three months, although European stock markets began to settle after the initial slump.The UK, Germany and France were also hit, with the main indexes in London, Frankfurt and Paris all down around 1%. German major banks Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, as well as France's BNP Paribas, were all down by at least 3%.Meanwhile, Asian equities fell on Monday despite the news of the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse and hot on the heels of a sell-off in New York amid fears of a financial sector collapse.Tokyo shares were down after Monday's trading, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index falling 1.42%, or 388.12 points, while Hong Kong's main index fell 2.65% by the end of the day.As part of the deal, Swiss authorities directed the write-off of high-risk bonds worth a total of 16 billion Swiss francs. The so-called addition tier 1 (AT1) bonds were created after the 2008 financial crisis to put losses from high-risk investments on the investors rather than taxpayers.Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank responded to the news saying that its exposure to AT1 bonds was ""near zero.""Germany's financial regulator BaFin said it was ""following current market developments"" in the wake of the turmoil in Zurich, adding that ""the German financial system continues to be stable and robust.""France's central bank head Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Monday, in an interview for France Inter radio, that Credit Suisse's woes and the volatility in the US banking system ""don't concern French and European banks.""Villeroy, who is also a member of the European Central Bank (ECB), praised UBS for the takeover, saying: ""They have diversified business models, which are profitable. They have strong risk controls and, above all, they have very important levels of liquidity and capital.""French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire also praised the buyout as a ""good deal.""""At the same time... it's a heavyweight in Europe, so we will remain extremely vigilant about the reaction of the markets,"" he added.However, the leader of Switzerland's Social Democrats, Roger Nordmann, told Reuters news agency on Monday that the UBS buyout had created a big risk for Switzerland.""The new UBS is also another massive risk — it's going to have more than 1,500 billion francs in assets, and it's simply too big for Switzerland,"" the lawmaker from the country's second-biggest party said.ab/es (Reuters, AFP, dpa, AP)",2023/03/20,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841325,France: Government faces two separate no-confidence votes,"The French government faces two no-confidence votes on Monday after Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne forced controversial pension reforms through parliament without a vote last week.The pension reforms, spearheaded by President Emmanuel Macron, would increase the retirement age from 62 to 64. This has led to ongoing protests in Paris and other cities since Thursday.One of the no-confidence motions was filed by the small, centrist Liot bloc and supported by the left-wing Nupes coalition. The other was filed by the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen.If a no-confidence vote is successful, the pension reform bill would be rejected and Macron would also have to appoint a new cabinet.Macron's tenuous political alliance has the largest number of MPs in the National Assembly but it does not control an absolute majority.However, the government believes it can survive both votes, especially since the conservative Republicans vowed not to support either of the no-confidence motions.""Let's get clarity. The vote means clarity,"" Aurore Berge, chief of the pro-government MPs, told broadcaster Franceinfo Sunday.""It's about one sole question: is the pension reform indispensable or unbearable for the French public?""The election reforms triggered numerous protests and strikes in the months leading up to last Thursday.Protests erupted in major cities again after Borne used Article 49/3 of the French constitution to force the bill through parliament without a vote, a strategy the Macron government has repeatedly had to turn to since losing an absolute majority in parliament last year.Garbage collectors, oil refinery staff and other workers have continued to go on strike. A nationwide day of action has been planned for the coming Thursday.""For as long as the 64-year reform is on the table, we have to keep it up,"" far-left former presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon told broadcaster RTL on Sunday.However, he urged protesters to remain non-violent.""Don't make our struggle invisible with practices that would be turned against us,"" Melenchon said. ""Mr Macron... is counting on people going too far, so as to profit from a situation of fear.""zc/es (AFP, Reuters, dpa, AP)",2023/03/20,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841333,Germany forward Jamal Musiala out with thigh injury,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Germany forward Jamal Musiala has been ruled out of upcoming friendly games against Peru and Belgium because of a muscle-fiber tear in his left thigh.Musiala came on as a substitute in Bayern Munich’s 2-1 loss at Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga on Sunday and played to the end of the game.“We all hoped Jamal would be fit because he has extraordinary qualities,” Germany coach Hansi Flick said Monday ahead of the matches against Peru on Saturday and Belgium on March 28.Southampton defender Armel Bella-Kotchap had already withdrawn from the Germany squad with a shoulder injury. Flick called up AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw in his place.Thiaw has never played for Germany before and is one of six players, including Mergim Berisha, Kevin Schade, Marius Wolf, Josha Vagnoman and Felix Nmecha, who have been called up for the first time.It’s unclear how long Musiala will be out. Bayern has yet to comment on the injury. The Bavarian club hosts Bundesliga leader Borussia Dortmund for “der Klassiker” on April 1.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/20,,World

The first stop is Xinying’s well-known landmark —Swan Lake Park—to admire the scenery of the arch bridge and swans swimming in the lake. Then, bikers may continue to ride along the bikeway to connect to the Chianan Irrigation Channel Xingying Branch trail (嘉南大圳新營支線步道), where riders can visit the House of Sanpin Honda (本田三一宅), which is now a tea house, and drink tea there.Riders may continue on to the Xinying Cultural Center and the Nanying Green Heart Park located downtown. From there, they can ride to Xinying Art Park, a popular instagrammable place with a series of artistic works created by artist No2Good that are themed around “mice” and “childhood fantasies.”The next stop is the Changsheng Barracks, a rebuild of a deserted military camp, that features a rare U-shaped green tunnel that is formed by the outstretched branches of the banyan trees on both sides of the street. Riders may continue up to the Xinying Railroad Culture Park to visit the former Xinying Sugar Factory and enjoy the factory’s fresh milk ice. The last stop is Xinying Railway Scenic Park, where riders can find a spot to relax and watch the trains come and go.(Tainan City Government photos)",2023/03/20,1243,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841402,Liz Weston: Should you rent in retirement?,"Some people rent in retirement because they don’t have much choice; they can’t afford to own homes. But financial planners say renting can make more sense than owning in some circumstances, even for retirees who can afford the costs of homeownership.Renting offers flexibility as well as freedom from all the chores and expenses of maintaining a home. Renting also may provide built-in communities for socializing, as well as accessible housing features such as one-floor living, which can help people age in place. People who are “house rich and cash poor” can sell their homes and use the equity to fund a more comfortable lifestyle.“While retirees often don’t want to rent, it can be a smarter decision for a number of reasons,” says certified financial planner Lisa A.K. Kirchenbauer of Arlington, Virginia.CONSIDER RENTING IF YOU’RE IN TRANSITIONIf you’re moving to a new area, financial planners often recommend renting first to get a better feel for the advantages and disadvantages of various neighborhoods. You’ll need time to find new doctors, check out entertainment venues, locate favorite restaurants and otherwise set up your support services, says Delia Fernandez, a certified financial planner in Los Alamitos, California.“It makes sense to rent for maybe even a year so you can really dig into the community and figure out what’s going to be the right fit for you,” she says.Renting is often smart if you expect to move again within a few years. Buying and selling homes is expensive, and your home may not rise in value fast enough to offset those costs. Selling a home also may take longer than you expect, especially during a real estate downturn, which could add stress, delays and additional costs to your move.RENTING COULD HELP YOU AGE MORE SAFELY AND SERENELYFew homes are truly accessible to people who have mobility problems or other age-related disabilities, and adapting your current house could be prohibitively expensive. Newer apartment buildings could offer ramps, elevators, one-floor living and other amenities to keep you safe as you age.Social isolation and loneliness are other risks to consider, since these can have a huge negative impact on older people’s health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Apartments can provide a community of people who can socialize and watch out for each other. Rental communities for older adults often offer organized activities and classes to help people connect, says Sara DeSantis, a personal finance educator in Denver.Another option, for those who can afford it, is a continuing care retirement community, or CCRC, that allows you to stay in one place even if you later need higher levels of care. People typically move into one of these facilities when they’re healthy and can live independently, with the promise that they can access assisted living, skilled nursing and sometimes memory care services as they age. CCRCs typically charge a hefty one-time entrance fee — the average was $379,606 in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care , a research group. Residents also pay monthly fees that typically increase with the level of care . The average monthly rent was $4,364, NIC found.RENTING COULD HELP YOU TAP MORE EQUITYMany people hit retirement age without enough savings and need to use their home equity to supplement their income, says certified financial planner Nicholas Bunio of Berwyn, Pennsylvania. Two common ways of tapping equity — selling a home and buying a less expensive one, or using a reverse mortgage — may not free up enough cash to substantially improve their situations, Bunio notes.“If you sell the house and rent, you have this big pile of cash to help cover the rent plus anything extra,” Bunio says.COPING WITH RENT INCREASES AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIESMany retirees understandably fear the possibility of big rent increases when they’re on a fixed income. But retirees should keep in mind that rents aren’t the only housing costs that are subject to inflation. Even when you have a fixed-rate mortgage, chances are good that your property taxes, homeowners insurance and costs to maintain and repair your property increase every year as well, says Crystal Cox , a certified financial planner in Madison, Wisconsin.Renters can ameliorate the risk of rent increases somewhat by opting for longer leases, Bunio says. So-called “mom and pop” landlords may be more amenable to negotiating rent than large corporations, and being a star tenant also can help, Fernandez notes.“Landlords like people who keep up their property, and they like people who make any maintenance easy,” Fernandez says.Another potential worry is the possibility of eviction. Even if you can keep up with the rent, a landlord could end your tenancy by selling the building, for example.But homeowners aren’t immune to potential dislocations, DeSantis notes. Many older people must move into assisted living facilities because they’re no longer safe in their homes. She recommends people consider moving to more supportive housing while they still have the health and energy to manage the transition.“Make that decision earlier, instead of it being forced upon you,” DeSantis says.____________________________________This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.Liz Weston is a columnist at NerdWallet, a certified financial planner and author of “Your Credit Score.” Email: lweston@nerdwallet.com.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841403,China says deadly 2022 plane crash still being investigated,"BEIJING (AP) — Experts are still investigating the cause of the crash of a China Eastern Airlines jetliner that killed 132 people one year ago, China's government said Monday.The March 21, 2022, disaster was a rare failure for a Chinese airline industry that dramatically improved safety following deadly crashes in the 1990s.The Boeing 737-800 en route from Kunming in the southwest to Guangzhou, near Hong Kong, went into a nosedive from 8,800 meters (29,000 feet), appeared to recover and then slammed into a mountainside. Everyone aboard was killed.The Civil Aviation Administration of China said investigators were reviewing the plane’s controls and other debris but gave no details of what they might have found.“Due to the complexity and rarity of this accident, the investigation is still being carried out,” said a six-sentence statement on the CAAC website. “The investigation team will continue to carry out analysis.""The China Eastern crew reported no problems before losing contact with air traffic control. The CAAC said one month after the crash that no abnormalities had been found in the plane, crew or outside elements such as bad weather.The “black box” flight data and voice recorders were given to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for analysis. No information has been released about what might have been found.The crash left a 20-meter- (65-foot-) deep crater in a mountainside and set the forest on fire.Authorities reported they recovered more than 49,000 pieces of debris. The crash was so violent that the flight data recorder was found driven 5 feet (1.5 meters) into the ground.China Eastern, one of four major state-owned Chinese airlines, and its subsidiaries grounded all their Boeing 737-800s, more than 200 planes, but later returned them to service. The airline said that was a precaution, not a sign of any problem with the planes, which are among the most widely used models worldwide.",2023/03/20,,World

Taiwan’s high-tech companies are also significant investors in the Czech Republic.Pekarova Adamova said she will meet the island’s leaders, including Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and the prime minister, and she will address the Parliament.She said China has warned against the trip.China in recent years has upped its threat to bring Taiwan under its control, by force if necessary, prompting new sales of tanks and missiles to the island by key ally the United States and steps by Tsai’s administration to extend compulsory military service and bolster the domestic defense industry.The Chinese government recently condemned a phone call between newly elected Czech President Petr Pavel and Tsai.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841405,School library book bans are seen as targeting LGBTQ content,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Teri Patrick bristles at the idea she wants to ban books about LGBTQ issues in Iowa schools, arguing her only goal is ridding schools of sexually explicit material.Sara Hayden Parris says that whatever you want to call it, it's wrong for some parents to think a book shouldn't be readily available to any child if it isn’t right for their own child.The viewpoints of the two mothers from suburban Des Moines underscore a divide over LGBTQ content in books as Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds pushes an especially sweeping crackdown on content in Iowa school libraries. The bill she's backing could result in the removal of books from school libraries in all of the state's 327 districts if they're successfully challenged in any one of them.School boards and legislatures nationwide also are facing questions about books and considering making it easier to limit access.“We’re seeing these challenges arise in almost every state of the union,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom. “It’s a national phenomenon.”Longstanding disagreements about content in school libraries often focus this year on books with LGBTQ themes as policymakers nationwide also consider limiting or banning gender-affirming care and drag shows, allowing the deadnaming of transgender students or adults in the workplace, and other measures targeting LGBTQ people.The trend troubles Kris Maul, a transgender man who is raising a 12-year-old with his lesbian partner in the Des Moines area and wants school library books to reflect all kinds of families and children. Maul argued that those seeking to remove books take passages out of context and unfairly focus on books about LGBTQ or racial justice issues.LGBTQ people are more visible than even five years ago, Maul said, and he believes that has led to a backlash from some who hope limiting discussion will return American society to an era that didn’t acknowledge people with different sexualities.“People are scared because they don’t think LGBTQ people should exist,” Maul said. “They don’t want their own children to be LGBTQ, and they feel if they can limit access to these books and materials, then their children won’t be that way, which is simply not true and is heartbreaking and disgusting.”In Louisiana, activists fear a push by Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry to investigate sexually explicit materials in public libraries — and recently proposed legislation that could restrict children and teens’ access to those books — is being used to target and censor LGBTQ content.Landry, who is running for governor, launched a statewide tip line in November to field complaints about librarians, teachers, and school and library personnel. Landry released a report in February that listed nine books his office considers “sexually explicit” or inappropriate for children. Seven have LGBTQ storylines.In Florida, some schools have covered or removed books under a new law that requires an evaluation of reading materials and for districts to publish a searchable list of books where individuals can then challenge specific titles.The reviews have drawn widespread attention, with images of empty bookshelves ricocheting across social media, and are often accompanied by criticism of Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican expected to run for president.The state’s training materials direct the reviews to target sexually explicit materials but also say that schools should “err on the side of caution” when selecting reading materials and that principals are responsible for compliance.Florida's largest teachers union is challenging the law, arguing its implementation is too broad and leading to unnecessary censorship. An education department spokesperson did not immediately comment.DeSantis said the state has not instructed schools to empty libraries or cover books. He said 175 books have been removed from 23 school districts, with 87% of the books identified as pornographic, violent or inappropriate for their grade level.The Iowa legislation comes amid efforts there to keep a closer eye on public school curriculums and make taxpayer money available to parents for private school tuition. Reynolds, the governor, has made such proposals the core of her legislative agenda, telling a conservative parents group that their work was essential to guarding against “indoctrination” by public school educators.Under a bill backed by Reynolds, the titles and authors of all books available to students in classrooms and libraries would be posted online, and officials would need to specify how parents could request a book's removal and how decisions to retain books could be appealed. When any district removes a book, the state Education Department would add it to a “removal list,” and all of Iowa’s 326 other districts would have to deny access to the book unless parents gave approval.At a hearing on Reynolds’ bill, Republican lawmakers, who hold huge majorities in both legislative chambers, said they might change the proposal but were committed to seeing it approved. The bill has passed a Senate committee and is awaiting a floor vote.“The parents are the governing authority in how their child is educated, period,” said Sen. Amy Sinclair. “Parents are responsible for their child’s upbringing, period.”Patrick, a mother of two, expressed befuddlement about why anyone would want to make sexually explicit books available to children.“I have to believe that there are books that cater to the LGBTQ community that don’t have to have such graphic sexual content in them,” said Patrick, a member of a local chapter of Moms for Liberty, a conservative group that has gained national influence for its efforts to influence school curriculum and classroom learning. “There are very few books that have ever been banned and what we’re saying is, in a public school setting, with taxpayer-funding money, should these books really be available to kids?”Hayden Parris, a mom of two from a suburb only a few miles away, understands the argument but thinks it misses the point.“A kindergartner is not wandering into the young adults section and picking out a book that is called like, “This Book is Gay,” said Hayden Parris, who is leading a parents group opposed to Iowa's proposed law. “They’re not picking those books, and the fact that they can pick one out of several thousand books is not a reason to keep it away from everyone.”Sam Helmick, president of the Iowa Library Association, said communities should decide what's in their libraries and that it's important for children to have access to books that address their lives and questions. Helmick didn't have that ability as a child, and students shouldn't return to that time, she said.“Can we acknowledge that this will have a chilling effect?” Helmick asked. “And when you tell me that books about myself as an asexual, nonbinary person who didn’t have those books in libraries when I was a kid to pick up and flip through, but now publishing has caught up with me and I can see representation of me — those will be behind the desk and that’s not supposed to make me feel less welcome, less seen and less represented in my library?”___Izaguirre reported from Tallahassee, Florida, and Cline from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841412,Why SEO Is so Important to Businesses in Ireland,"The global pandemic saw many families confined to their homes – and this has had far-reaching consequences for both retail and providers of various services. In fact, it is estimated that eCommerce will capture around 25% of all global sales by 2026 – it already accounts for 19% of retail sales.This is good news for consumers as it increases the online availability of products and services – and increases competition, thus driving down prices. However, increased competition is not always great news for Irish businesspeople, especially online competition. It means a crowded marketplace where it’s not always easy to stand out from the crowd.However, the increase in the number of Irish businesses that are turning to the Internet to market products and services has grown in lockstep with the global eCommerce trends. This is why searches for SEO Dublin and SEO Ireland have increased immensely in the last number of years. An Irish company that wants to dominate the search engine results pages (be a result near the top of that coveted first page) is going to have to become familiar with the practice of SEO or find a company that can offer advice in this crucial area of content creation and management.Just what is SEO?SEO or ‘Search Engine Optimisation’ is part of a content creation methodology that is designed to increase the number of visitors to a website (or another web page). It consists (in simple terms) of using a variety of phrases and words on a site that triggers the Google algorithm to rank a site highly – and elevate it to the top of the list of the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) for a particular search. The visitors who reach a site in this manner (using ‘Organic Search) are referred to collectively as ‘unpaid traffic’ (as opposed to those who arrive at a site via an advertisement of some kind).So what can SEO do for a Company?Organic search is by far the most common method that leads consumers to a company site – and feeds the company’s sales funnel. It’s important to adhere to the content guidelines that are issued by Google on a regular basis in order to ensure that SEO is effective. It may seem unfair to cite Google as the source of the ultimate guidelines for effective copy creation and SEO practice – but they are the Gorilla in the Search Sandpit.SEO can have a variety of benefits, but only if it is done right, here are some of those benefits.Quality content that adds value to the lives of the site visitor is the fuel that keeps an effective online communication and marketing strategy ticking over. A company that provides this sort of quality SEO-optimised content and adheres to Google’s guidelines will soon find that its message not only reaches those using a search engine to find products for the first time – but also reassures current clients and builds brand loyalty. Messaging needs to be well thought out and consistent – and good SEO practice will reflect this clarity.The ever-busy Google algorithms have evolved to the point where they can track and interpret the user experience. This is evidenced by Google’s provision of a ‘Page Experience Update’ to marketers. This is invaluable information about how a visitor to the page accesses content. Great SEO practice elevates the on-page user experience – and improves the chances of them taking the next step in the sales journey – and finally becoming loyal brand ambassadors.The user needs to be able to find what they are looking for with the minimum of fuss and bother – or as that translates into the Internet experience – the minimum number of clicks. If they struggle to find a particular service or product, then the Google algorithms will inevitably start to punish the ranking of that site in the search engine results.A well-structured SEO plan will include a variety of keywords and key phrases that are directly related to the area within which a local business operates. It is one of the reasons that suppliers of plumbing and electrical services (for example) simply need an Internet presence. The trend towards the use of mobile devices to find products and services has also increased this sort of Internet search activity. Put simply, a business that does not practice good SEO that has been developed to reach a local demographic is missing out on business opportunities.The Internet today allows small and medium-sized Irish businesses to play in the same marketing field as the business heavyweights. Marketing in Ireland, including search engine marketing from trusted local companies such as irelandseo.ie and attracting organic traffic using quality SEO-optimized content, provides even the fledgling company with a messaging reach and effectiveness that smaller organizations could only dream of a generation ago. However, not only does professional SEO practice allow the marketing messages and brand identity of the organization to reach well-defined demographic groups, when and where they want, but it also does so at a fraction of the cost of traditional above-the-line advertising – and its effectiveness is measurable.However, many smaller businesses simply do not have the resources or manpower to dedicate to the development and management of a st5rategically integrated and SEO-driven online marketing campaign. In cases like these outsourcing can offer tremendous value to the organization. There are professional advisors that can handle everything from the conceptualization of the online communications strategy, including the SEO component.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841434,"First Phosphate Obtains High Purity 40.2% Apatite Concentrate in Metallurgical Testwork Based on Lac à L'Orignal Property in Quebec, Canada","Saguenay, Quebec - Newsfile Corp. - 20 March 2023 - First Phosphate Corp. (CSE: PHOS) (FSE: KD0) (""First Phosphate"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has obtained Metallurgical Testwork results on mineralization sourced from its Lac à l'Orignal Property in the region of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, Quebec, Canada. The testwork was completed by an independent laboratory, SGS Canada Inc., Quebec City, Quebec, and dated March 13, 2023. The full report is available at:  https://firstphosphate.com/projects/assets.   The results from the batch and locked cycle tests were used to prepare an overall mass balance for the proposed flowsheet. The overall mass balance showed that the flowsheet could recover 91.4% of the apatite to a concentrate containing 40.2% P2O5.   Preliminary upgrading testwork on the ilmenite and magnetite streams achieved an ilmenite concentrate grading 39.3% TiO2 and a magnetite concentrate grading 69.0% Fe (99.2% Fe2O3). Further testwork is recommended to optimize the ilmenite circuit.   ""We are pleased with the results of our high purity apatite recovery which has the potential to allow us to create a large amount of purified phosphoric acid for the production of LFP batteries,"" says First Phosphate President, Peter Kent. ""Our secondary recovery of ilmenite is equally important in that its upgrading may allow us to create the iron sulphate required as another important ingredient in the production of LFP batteries. The magnetite remains a potential tertiary recovery of value. We are now able to proceed towards a beneficiation pilot plant ahead of schedule.""   The metallurgical testwork program was undertaken on a composite of 75 fluoroapatite half drill cores from the Lac à l'Orignal Deposit with the objective of recovering and upgrading the apatite (removing silicates, ilmenite, magnetite, etc.) to produce high grade concentrate feed for phosphoric acid production to be used in the production of LFP cathode active material. The composite sample had a head grade of 5.55% P2O5.   Qualified Person   The scientific and technical disclosure for First Phosphate included in this news release have been reviewed and approved by D. Grant Feasby, P.Eng. of P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Mr. Feasby is a metallurgist and a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure of Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"").   About First Phosphate Corp.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841445,"'Ted Lasso' visits White House, promotes mental health care","WASHINGTON (AP) — Fictional soccer coach Ted Lasso used a White House visit Monday to encourage people, even in politically divided Washington, to make it a point to check in often with friends, family and co-workers to ""ask how they're doing, and listen, sincerely,”Comedian Jason Sudeikis, who plays the title character — an American coaching a soccer team in London — and other cast members were meeting with President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden to talk about how mental health contributes to overall well-being.Mental health and looking after one another is a theme of “Ted Lasso,” Sudeikis told reporters from the lectern as he helped press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre open her daily White House briefing. The Emmy-winning, feel-good show on Apple TV+ just opened its third season.“While it’s easier said than done, we also have to know that we shouldn’t be afraid to ask for help ourselves,"" Sudeikis said. ""That does take a lot, especially when it’s something that has such a negative stigma to it, such as mental health and it doesn’t need to be that way.“And if you can ask for that help from a professional, fantastic,” he continued. ""If it needs to be a loved one, equally as good, in a lot of ways.”Mental health is part of Biden's bipartisan “unity agenda.” He has called on lawmakers to direct more resources toward fighting what some say is a crisis, and the administration has surged funding to bolster a new 988 suicide and crisis line and put more mental-health professionals in schools.Sudeikis said there should be no stigma attached to reaching out for help because everyone knows someone who has needed a shoulder to lean on, or has been that person themselves.“No matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter who you voted for, we all probably, I assume, we all know someone who has, or have been that someone ourselves actually, that’s struggled, that’s felt isolated, that’s felt anxious, that has felt alone,"" he said.“It’s actually one of the many things, believe it or not, that we all have in common as human beings,"" Sudeikis continued. “That means it's something that we can all, you know, and should, talk about with one another when we’re feeling that way or when we recognize that in someone feeling that way.”He issued a special appeal for people in the nation's capital.“I know in this town a lot of folks don’t always agree, right, and don’t always feel heard, seen, listened to,"" Sudeikis said. ""But I truly believe we should all do our best to help take care of each other. That’s my own personal belief. I think that’s something that everyone up here on stage believes in.”The Bidens have seen some of “Ted Lasso” and are familiar with its messages of hope and kindness, according to the White House.Joining Sudeikis at the daily briefing were cast members Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, Brendan Hunt and Toheeb Jimoh. The group was given a tour of the president's private living quarters, a White House official said.As he left the briefing room, Sudeikis was asked if he would do the Joe Biden impression he used to do on “Saturday Night Live,” but he declined, saying that “they got the real one here now.""Sudeikis and the cast were the latest entertainers to visit the White House and associate themselves with issues the Democratic president and first lady are raising awareness about.Singer Olivia Rodrigo visited during the pandemic to help encourage young people like herself to get vaccinated against COVID-19. BTS, the popular Korean boy band, helped promote Asian inclusion and combat bias against Asian Americans.Actor Matthew McConaughey delivered a passionate appeal for tighter gun laws last year after the shooting at an elementary school in his hometown, Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 children and two teachers.Singer/actors Mary J. Blige and Selena Gomez participated in separate events with Jill Biden focused on cancer awareness and youth mental health, respectively, and singer Sam Smith and Cyndi Lauper performed the day Biden signed gay marriage legislation into law in December.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841446,Putin sticks to protocol during Chinese leader Xi's visit,"MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin wasn't waiting at the end of the red carpet to greet Chinese leader Xi Jinping upon his arrival in Russia on Monday for a high-profile visit.But it wasn't a snub.Russia's standard protocol for visiting dignitaries calls for them to be welcomed at the airport by a lower-ranking Cabinet official.Many observers argue that the fighting in Ukraine has made Russia increasingly dependent on China for support as the country becomes isolated from the West.But Putin didn’t deviate from the script, and the start of Xi's trip was like that of any visiting leader.Putin sent Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko to the Russian capital's Vnukovo airport to meet Xi after he stepped off his Boeing 747.The Russian president, meanwhile, was far away in central Moscow busy with other commitments before his high-stakes dinner with Xi in the evening.Putin began his day by making an appearance at a meeting of the Interior Ministry’s top officials. He also addressed a parliamentary conference involving lawmakers from African nations.Back at the airport, Xi listened as a Russian military band played the national anthems of China and Russia. He then walked past a line of honorary guards accompanied by Chernyshenko.While Putin didn't break protocol and pamper Xi with a surprise appearance at the airport, the Russian leader showered his Chinese guest with praise when he greeted him inside the Kremlin before a private dinner.Facing the Chinese leader across a small table after they shook hands, Putin hailed what he described as China's ""colossal leap forward“ under Xi's leadership, adding that he feels a bit of envy — a remark that drew a thin smile from Xi.Xi responded in kind, saying he was sure that Putin would receive strong support in the presidential election next year, even though the Russian leader hasn't yet declared his intention to run.They spent about 4 1/2 hours over a seven-course dinner, which included such offerings as a Pacific seafood platter, a sterlet — or small sturgeon — soup, quail and mushroom pancakes and venison roasted in cherry sauce. Putin got out to see Xi off and they shook hands again.Before the meeting began, Putin described Xi's visit as a “landmark event” in an article published in China's top People's Daily newspaper, saying it offers a ""great opportunity for me to meet with my good old friend with whom we enjoy the warmest relationship.” He also wrote in detail about their first meeting in 2010, adding that he and Xi met about 40 times and citing a line from Chinese philosopher Confucius that said: ”Is it not a joy to have friends coming from afar!“Xi's visit offers an important political boost to Putin just days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader on charges of alleged involvement in abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.Moscow, which doesn't recognize the court's jurisdiction, dismissed the move as “legally null and void,"" but it further ramped up the pressure on the Russian leader.After Monday's private dinner, Putin and Xi will hold official talks on Tuesday that will also be attended by top officials from both countries. They are expected to issue conclusive statements after the negotiations.Analysts say that Western sanctions have made Russia increasingly reliant on China.“This relationship is increasingly asymmetrical — China has much more leverage,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who has long studied Russia-China ties.Gabuev noted that Xi could be expected to maintain strong support for Putin amid mounting Western pressure.“The reality is that China sees absolutely no upsides in dumping Vladimir Putin, because there will be no incentives or no points earned in the relationship with the U.S.,” he said.While most observers say that Beijing will be unlikely to offer Moscow military assistance as the U.S. and other Western allies fear, the alliance with Beijing would allow the Russian leader to pursue his course in Ukraine.“This helps Russia stay defiant against Western sanctions,” tweeted Chris Weafer, CEO and Russian economy analyst at the consulting firm Macro-Advisory. “So long as Russia can trade with China, and other Asian states, it is no danger of running out of money or being forced to concede on the battlefield.”",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841447,"Windows smashed at India consulates in London, San Francisco","LONDON (AP) — Windows at India's High Commission in London and at the Consulate General of India in San Francisco were smashed during separate demonstrations by Sikh protesters, police in both cities said Monday.London’s Metropolitan Police force said a man was arrested Sunday afternoon on suspicion of violent disorder outside the diplomatic mission, where two security guards were slightly injured. In San Francisco, dozens of protesters gathered outside the consulate and smashed windows with their flagpoles after a skirmish with embassy workers, a protester said.San Francisco Police Officer Robert Rueca said in an email that embassy workers were injured, though he didn't say how many or the extent of the injuries. Suspects fled and have not been arrested, he said.The U.S. State Department was working with local authorities to investigate the incident and repair the damage.“We certainly condemn that vandalism,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday during a briefing.The protesters were affiliated with a Sikh separatist movement that seeks to create a new homeland or breakaway state, called ""Khalistan.""The incidents came a day after police in India’s Punjab state launched a manhunt to capture Amritpal Singh, a separatist leader who supports the Khalistan movement. His supporters staged protests in the majority Sikh state over the weekend and 112 were arrested, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.In San Francisco, police officers arrived at the Consulate General on Sunday afternoon to find shattered glass windows. Workers described protesters trying to enter the building, Rueca said. He didn't immediately provide additional details on how the confrontation began.On Monday morning, more than a dozen protesters were again outside the building, which was protected behind police barricades and a police vehicle in front.Gurpreet Singh of Fresno, California, was outside the embassy both days and said protesters planned to keep up their demands for a separate Sikh state. Singh said he arrived too late to see what happened Sunday afternoon but was told embassy workers took down the Khalistan flags protesters had put up near the entrance.A worker then pushed a protester, cursed him and said “don’t put your dirty flag here,"" said Veer Singh, another protester who saw the confrontation. That led protesters to begin using their flagpoles to smash in the windows, Gurpreet Singh said.Rueca, of the police department, said protesters were blocked from entering the building.The Consul General of India in San Francisco did not respond to an emailed inquiry for comment.In London, footage posted on social media showed a man detach the Indian flag from a balcony of the building while a crowd of people below waving bright yellow Khalistan banners appeared to encourage him.Police said officers were called but protesters had largely dispersed by the time they arrived.“An investigation was launched, and one male was arrested nearby a short time later on suspicion of violent disorder. Inquiries continue,” the force said.The Indian government said it had summoned British Deputy High Commissioner Christina Scott in New Delhi to demand an explanation.“India finds unacceptable the indifference of the U.K. government to the security of Indian diplomatic premises and personnel in the U.K.,” the Indian government said in a statement.On Monday, Punjab remained on high alert as police resumed their search for Singh, whom they accuse of inciting communal tensions.The Khalistan movement is banned in India, where officials see it and affiliated groups as a national security threat. But the movement still has some support in the state, as well as beyond, in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom which are home to a sizable Sikh diaspora.On Monday, at least 200 Sikh protesters affiliated with India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party held demonstrations outside the British High Commission in New Delhi over the incident in London. The protesters, who said they were also demonstrating against the insult to the Indian flag, tried to march inside the British embassy but were stopped by police.“Some people in the cover of Sikhism are trying to create an impression that we support Khalistan. We are against Khalistan. We don’t want Khalistan,” protester Arvinderpal Singh said.U.K. Foreign Office Minister Tariq Ahmad said he was “appalled” by the violence in London.“This is a completely unacceptable action against the integrity of the Mission and its staff,” he wrote on Twitter. “The U.K. government will always take the security of the Indian High Commission seriously.”London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned “the violent disorder and vandalism.”“There is no place in our city for this kind of behavior,” he said.___Har reported from San Francisco.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841448,"With overdoses up, states look at harsher fentanyl penalties","RENO, Nev. (AP) — State lawmakers nationwide are responding to the deadliest overdose crisis in U.S. history by pushing harsher penalties for possessing fentanyl and other powerful lab-made opioids that are connected to about 70,000 deaths a year.Imposing longer prison sentences for possessing smaller amounts of drugs represents a shift in states that in recent years have rolled back drug possession penalties. Proponents of tougher penalties say this crisis is different and that, in most places, the stiffer sentences are intended to punish drug dealers, not just users.“There is no other drug — no other illicit drug — that has the same type of effects on our communities,” said Mark Jackson, the district attorney for Douglas County, Nevada, and president of the Nevada District Attorneys Association, which is pushing for stricter penalties for fentanyl-related crimes.But the strategy is alarming recovery advocates who say focusing on the criminal angle of drugs has historically backfired, including when lawmakers elevated crack cocaine penalties in the 1980s.“Every time we treat drugs as a law enforcement problem and push stricter laws, we find that we punish people in ways that destroy their lives and make it harder for them to recover later on,” said Adam Wandt, an assistant professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. He said people behind bars often continue getting drugs — often without receiving quality addiction treatment — then emerge to find it's harder to get work.Since 2020, drug overdoses are now linked to more than 100,000 deaths a year nationally, with about two-thirds of them fentanyl-related. That’s more than 10 times as many drug deaths as in 1988, at the height of the crack epidemic.Fentanyl mostly arrives in the U.S. from Mexico and is mixed into supplies of other drugs, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and counterfeit oxycodone pills. Some users seek it out. Others don't know they're taking it.Ingesting 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be fatal, meaning 1 gram — about the same as a paper clip — could contain 500 lethal doses.That's what's driving some lawmakers to crack down with harsh penalties, along with adopting measures such as legalizing materials to test drug supplies for fentanyl and distributing naloxone, a drug that can reverse overdoses.Before this year's legislative sessions began, a dozen states had already adopted fentanyl possession measures, according to tracking by the National Conference of State Legislatures.And in this year, in one legislative chamber of liberal Oregon and one chamber of conservative West Virginia, lawmakers have agreed upon tougher penalties. In her State of the State speech this March, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, called on lawmakers to adopt a drug trafficking bill that includes tougher fentanyl sentences.In Nevada, where Democrats control the Legislature, a bill backed by Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford would give one to 20 years in prison for selling, possessing, manufacturing or transporting 4 grams or more of fentanyl into the state, depending on the amount. It’s a change for Ford, who has supported criminal justice reforms including a sweeping 2019 law that, among other provisions, raised the threshold for such penalties to 100 grams. It would also remove fentanyl from the state’s “Good Samaritan” law, which exempts people from criminal drug possession charges while reporting an overdose.“What we’ve learned is that lowering the thresholds for all drugs was overinclusive,” Ford said.Harm reduction advocates are pushing Ford and others to rethink their support, arguing the thresholds for longer penalties can sweep up low-level users — not just the dealers the law is aimed at — as well as some who may not even know they are taking fentanyl. They warn that the state’s crime labs test only for the presence of fentanyl, not the exact amount in a mixture of drugs. Thus, people with over 4 grams of drugs containing a few milligrams of fentanyl could be subject to trafficking penalties, they say.Rosa Johnson runs a needle exchange where she meets people who could face consequences should the stricter fentanyl bill pass. For the dozens of people that show up each day, it is rare for them to cite fentanyl as their “drug of choice.” But it’s also rare that fentanyl test strips come back negative, with the drug being “laced in a lot of things,” Johnson said.Other lawmakers introduced two bills to create penalties for fentanyl with lower thresholds, though much of the internal debate surrounds the Ford-backed bill. Meanwhile, Nevada's Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, a former sheriff, has vowed to introduce tougher legislation that would make possession of any amount of fentanyl the same felony threshold as fentanyl trafficking.Both Republican-led chambers in South Carolina have passed fentanyl trafficking measures with bipartisan support, although lawmakers haven’t agreed on which version to send the governor. Senators also unanimously approved a bill allowing alleged drug dealers to be charged with homicide in overdose deaths.House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford slammed colleagues for selling a “false bill of goods.” While Republican Rep. Doug Gilliam said he understood concerns about ambiguity, he said lawmakers had to send a “strong message” to drug dealers.A Senate subcommittee heard emotional testimony from family members of people who died of a fentanyl overdose. Among them was Holly Alsobrooks, co-founder of an advocacy group that also supports more fentanyl test strips, opioid antidotes and rehabilitation centers. While Alsobrooks said there is no “perfect” solution, she said the fentanyl trafficking measures are the “best” answers she has heard.“We are fully behind this bill,” she said. “And if people go to jail, they’re going to go to jail.”Marc Burrows, who leads a Greenville-based harm reduction program that reports it has reversed 700 overdoses through the provision of opioid antidotes, said these bills could increase deaths by creating hesitancy among drug users to report overdoses.“I just don’t know if a policy like this is the way to do it,” Burrows said.___Pollard reported from Columbia, South Carolina, and Mulvihill from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841449,FIFA appeals to Swiss supreme court in Haiti abuse case,"ZURICH (AP) — FIFA has appealed to Swiss federal judges after the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned a life ban for the former Haiti soccer federation president who was accused of multiple sexual offenses against players in women’s and girls’ national teams.FIFA said Monday it filed a case at Switzerland’s supreme court to challenge the CAS ruling announced last month that upheld an appeal by 75-year-old Yves Jean-Bart.“FIFA is concerned that this (CAS) award contains a number of very serious procedural and substantive flaws, including the CAS Panel’s failure to evaluate key pieces of evidence that were offered by FIFA,” soccer’s world body said in a statement.FIFA said it asked the Swiss Federal Tribunal to annul the sports court verdict and refer the case back for a second hearing.The federal court can review CAS decisions on limited grounds such as abuse of legal process. It rarely overturns verdicts.FIFA’s ethics committee banned Jean-Bart from soccer in November 2020 and fined him 1 million Swiss francs ($1.08 million).The published verdict detailed how FIFA ethics judges believed allegations that during 20 years as Haiti federation president Jean-Bart raped underage girls and habitually had sexual relationships with players.When Jean-Bart’s appeal came to CAS one year ago, his legal team provided 21 witnesses who gave evidence on his behalf. FIFA produced one witness “as a victim of Yves Jean-Bart’s actions,” the sports court said about its verdict.Witnesses in Haiti were alleged to have been threatened not to give evidence against Jean-Bart.CAS said its panel of three judges was “fully aware of the seriousness of the alleged facts and the possibility that some witnesses might feel threatened.”“It took all possible steps to facilitate the search for evidence and the establishment of the facts,” the court said, including the ability to testify accompanied by a CAS chaperone from a secret location on encrypted calls with voices distorted to protect identity.While Jean-Bart was expelled from soccer, the Haiti national team progressed through qualifying for the Women's World Cup. Last month Haiti sealed its first ever place at the women's finals tournament, being co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand in July and August.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/20,,World

The party is now set to become a part of the new coalition government with several smaller parties.Political turmoil and frequent changes in government are nothing new in Nepal, where eight different governments have ruled in the past 10 years.This is Dahal's third time in power since his Maoist group abandoned a decade-long armed revolt in which more than 17,000 people were killed and joined a U.N.-assisted peace process and mainstream politics in 2006.The Maoists secured most parliamentary seats in 2008 elections and Dahal, also known as Prachanda, or the “fierce one,” became prime minister but quit a year later over differences with the president.",2023/03/20,,World

Over 19,700 others have been detained by authorities amid a violent crackdown trying to suppress the dissent. Some people linked to the protests have been executed.The EU said it had imposed asset freezes and travel bans on the 8 officials and frozen the assets of The Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution due to their involvement “in serious human rights violations in Iran.”The EU said the council is “a regime policy body” that “promoted several projects undermining the freedom of girls and women, setting limits on their clothing and education. Its decisions have also discriminated against minorities.”It’s the sixth round of sanctions that the 27-nation bloc has imposed on Iranian officials and organizations — including other ministers, military officers and Iran’s morality police — for alleged rights abuses.",2023/03/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841454,Starbucks new CEO Laxman Narasimhan takes his seat,"Starbucks officially has a new CEO. The Seattle coffee giant said Monday that Laxman Narasimhan has assumed the role of CEO and joined the company’s board of directors. Narasimhan succeeds longtime Starbucks leader Howard Schultz, who came out of retirement last spring to serve as interim CEO while the company searched for a new chief executive. Schultz will remain on the company’s board. Starbucks announced last Septembe r that Narasimhan would become its new CEO. Narasimhan, 55, most recently served as CEO of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health, hygiene and nutrition company. Prior to that he was a longtime executive at Pepsico. Since he was named incoming CEO, Narasimhan has traveled to more than 30 stores, manufacturing plants and support centers around the world, the company said. He also earned his barista certification. In a prepared statement, Narasimhan said he was humbled as he stepped into his new role. “The foundation Howard has laid – building from scratch an iconic global brand fueled by a lasting passion to uplift humanity – is truly remarkable, and I am honored to have the opportunity to build on this deep heritage,” Narasimhan said. Narasimhan is scheduled to lead Starbucks’ annual meeting on Thursday. In his year as interim CEO, Schultz has announced hundreds of millions in investments to improve worker pay and benefits and revamp Starbucks’ North American stores. The company posted record sales in its most recent quarter, which ended Jan. 1. But Schultz also faced a growing unionization effort at its U.S. stores, which the company opposes. Schultz is scheduled to testify March 29 before a Senate committee examining the company’s labor record.",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841479,EU pledges $1 billion for post-quake Turkey reconstruction,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Commission said Monday it will support Turkey with one billion euros ($1.07 billion) to help with reconstruction in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated parts of the country and neighboring Syria last month.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU's executive arm, also pledged 108 million euros in humanitarian aid for Syria at the opening of a donors' conference in Brussels gathering the bloc's international partners to raise money for both countries.The magnitude 7.8 earthquake on Feb. 6 killed more than 52,000 people — the vast majority in Turkey. Nearly 300,000 buildings in Turkey either collapsed or were severely damaged, according to the country's president.The International Rescue Committee, an aid group responding to humanitarian crises, said the situation in the region remains critical and urged donors to ensure that the U.N.’s appeal for Turkey and Syria — calling for $1 billion and $397 million respectively — is fully funded.“The people affected by this devastating earthquake are relying on donors meeting in Brussels to step up this week,” said Tanya Evans, the IRC’s Country Director in Syria. ""They need to ensure that funding is available for life-saving items including food, shelter, warm clothes and clean water, as well as support to the already weak healthcare system including the provision of medicines and medical equipment. If they fail to do so, the most vulnerable will pay the price,” she added.The conference is hosted by the European Commission and Sweden, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU. The one-day meeting is attended by NGOs, G-20 and U.N. members as well as international financial institutions.Survivors of the earthquake in rebel-held northwest Syria have received very little assistance because of deep divisions exacerbated by the country’s 12-year war. The EU said 15.3 million Syrians of a population of 21.3 million already required humanitarian assistance before the earthquake struck.The bloc has been providing humanitarian aid to Syria since 2011 and wants to step it up. But it does not intend to help with reconstruction in the war-torn country, with EU sanctions against the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad in place due to its continued crackdown against civilians.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed the conference via videolink and described some of the reconstruction challenges, including deadly floods that hit parts of the earthquake zone last week.“Some of the aftershocks have been going on for a while and they are of equal magnitude to a separate earthquake,” he said. “We have been fighting against the flood disasters and challenging weather conditions.”Erdogan said some 298,000 buildings across 11 provinces affected by the earthquake were destroyed or left unfit for use.“No single country can fight against such a disaster, regardless of its level of economic development,” he said, putting the cost of reconstruction at $104 billion. “Your contributions made at this conference will contribute to the healing of wounds and wipe clean the traces of this disaster.”___Andrew Wilks in Istanbul, Turkey, contributed to this report.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841480,Yemeni sides say deal reached to free nearly 900 prisoners,"CAIRO (AP) — Yemen’s warring sides said Monday they agreed to release nearly 900 prisoners of war in a U.N.-brokered deal amid international efforts to end the yearslong conflict.The deal on a prisoner exchange capped 10 days of intensive talks in Switzerland between Yemen’s internationally recognized government and the Houthi rebels. The discussions were co-chaired by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross.The deal involves the release of over 700 Houthi prisoners, said Abdul-Qader el-Murtaza, the head of the Houthi delegation. The Iran-backed Houthis would release more than 180 prisoners, including Saudi and Sudanese troops fighting with the Saudi-led coalition, he added.It's unclear how many prisoners remain but the number is thought to be in the thousands on both sides.El-Murtaza said the releases would begin in three weeks, and that both sides would convene for another round of talks on more prisoner exchanges after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts this week.Majed Fadail, Yemen’s deputy minister for human rights and a member of the government delegation, said the releases would include four Yemeni journalists who were detained and sentenced to death in recent years by a Houthi-controlled court in a trial described by the Amnesty International as “grossly unfair.”He said the deal also includes the release of top military officials held by the Houthis since the start of the war. Among them are Maj. Gen. Mahmoud al-Subaihi, who was the defense minister when the war erupted; Nasser Mansour Hadi, the brother of former Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi; relatives of late strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, and sons of former Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, he said.In a statement, the Yemeni government welcomed the deal and urged the joint government-Houthi committee to continue its efforts to release all prisoners.The deal was a follow-up to a 2018 agreement that demanded that both parties release all those detained in relation to the conflict “without any exceptions or conditions.” The agreement was part of a wider settlement that ended fierce fighting over the crucial port city of Hodeida, which is held by the Houthis.Since then, both parties have released many prisoners, with a major exchange in October 2020 of more than 1,000 detainees from both sides.Monday’s deal came more than a week after Iran and Saudi Arabia announced a China-brokered deal to re-establish diplomatic ties after years of frayed ties and hostilities. The Iran-Saudi deal, announced in Beijing on March 10, has invigorated hopes of a settlement to Yemen's conflict.The U.N. envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, told the the U.N. Security Council last week that intense diplomatic efforts are underway to end the war, citing new regional and international momentum, including the Saud-Iranian deal.Yemen’s conflict began in 2014, when the Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north, ousting the internationally recognized government that fled to the south then into exile in Saudi Arabia.The Houthi move prompted a Saudi-led coalition to intervene months later in a bid to restore the internationally recognized government to power. The conflict has in recent years turned into a regional proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.The conflict has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841481,Prosecutors rest in sedition case against Proud Boys leaders,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors on Monday rested their seditious conspiracy case against former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and four lieutenants charged with plotting to stop the transfer of presidential power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 election.Jurors will hear testimony from defense witnesses before deliberating in one of the most serious cases to come out of the Justice Department’s massive investigation of the violent Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.Defense attorneys have argued there is no evidence the Proud Boys plotted to attack the Capitol and stop Congress from certifying Biden’s electoral victory. Norm Pattis, an attorney for former Proud Boys leader Joseph Biggs, said the group Boys had no plan, “no understanding” and no “implicit conspiracy” for Jan. 6.“They did not come to your home to cause a riot,” Pattis told jurors on Monday.The jury in Washington's federal court has heard more than 30 days of testimony over more than two months by more than 20 prosecution witnesses, including two former Proud Boys members who are cooperating with the government in hopes of lighter sentences.Tarrio, a Miami resident who served as national chairman of the group, and the other Proud Boys could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of seditious conspiracy.The case comes on the heels of the seditious conspiracy convictions of Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and a Florida leader of the antigovernment group. Four other Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy in January. Rhodes and other Oath Keepers are scheduled to be sentenced in May.Also on trial with Tarrio and Biggs are Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola.Nordean, of Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter leader. Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, was a self-described Proud Boys organizer. Rehl was president of the Proud Boys chapter in Philadelphia. Pezzola was a Proud Boys member from Rochester, New York.Nordean's attorney called the first defense witnesses, including former Proud Boys member Travis Nugent, of Vancouver, Washington. Nugent, who hasn't been charged with any riot-related crimes, testified that he was shocked to see rioters breach police barricades near the Capitol.“It definitely felt spontaneous to me,” Nugent said. “I didn't know it was going to happen.”“You had every reason to expect violence, didn't you?” prosecutor Conor Mulroe asked Nugent during his cross-examination.“No,” Nugent replied.Most of the defendants aren’t accused of engaging in violence themselves. Tarrio wasn’t even at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Police arrested him in Washington, D.C., on separate charges two days before the riot, and he heeded a judge’s order to leave the nation’s capital.“It’s too hard to blame Trump,” Sabino Jauregui, one of Tarrio’s lawyers, said during the trial's opening statements. “It’s easier to blame Enrique as the face of the Proud Boys.”Prosecutors have employed an unusual theory that Proud Boys leaders mobilized a handpicked group of foot soldiers — or “tools” — to supply the force necessary to carry out their plot by overwhelming police and breaching barricades. Defense attorneys have dismissed the government’s “tools” theory as a novel, flawed concept with no legal foundation.Jurors have seen hundreds of messages that Tarrio and other Proud Boys privately exchanged on the Telegram platform and publicly on social media before, during and after the Jan. 6 attack. The messages show the Proud Boys becoming increasingly agitated as Trump's legal challenges fail in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. The messages also show the Proud Boys celebrating the attack on the Capitol and their role in it.In one exchange shown to jurors, Tarrio urged his fellow extremists to stay at the Capitol on Jan. 6.“Make no mistake,” he wrote. “We did this.”That evening, Rehl's mom asked if he was OK.“I'm ok!” Rehl replied. “Seems like our raid of the capital set off a chain reaction of events throughout the country. i’m so (expletive) proud.""The Proud Boys trial has lasted significantly longer than the judge and attorneys expected when jury selection began in December. The proceedings have been bogged down by bickering. Defense lawyers have routinely sparred with U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly during breaks in testimony and repeatedly asked for him to declare a mistrial.Two onetime Proud Boys members, Matthew Greene and Jeremy Bertino, were among the key witnesses for prosecutors.Greene testified in January that Proud Boys members were expecting a “civil war” after the 2020 election. Bertino testified last month that the Proud Boys saw themselves as “the tip of the spear"" and plotted to keep Biden out of the White House because they wanted to “save the country” from what they feared would be a tyrannical government.Greene and Bertino said they didn't know of any specific plan to storm the Capitol. Greene said group leaders celebrated the attack on Jan. 6 but didn’t explicitly encourage members to use force.“My expectation was, if there was violence started, you should not back down,” Greene testified.Bertino, of North Carolina, is the only Proud Boys member who has pleaded guilty to a seditious conspiracy charge. Greene, of Syracuse, New York, pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress certifying the Electoral College vote.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the Capitol riot at https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841482,US aid worker and French journalist freed in West Africa,"NIAMEY, Niger (AP) — An American aid worker and a French journalist kidnapped and held by Islamist extremists were freed and flown to Niger's capital Monday, four days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the country.U.S. officials said no ransom was paid for aid worker Jeffery Woodke, who was held for more than six years, and praised Niger’s government for helping secure his release. The French government did not comment on how freedom was won for journalist Olivier Dubois, who was abducted almost two years ago in neighboring Mali.“I thank God first of all. And after God, I thank the government of Niger, the U.S. government and France. Long live France!"" said Woodke, his long gray hair pulled back in a ponytail as he used a walking stick.“I’m very happy to be back in Niamey again, in Niger, my second country, and I’ve nothing more to say apart from, 'Hello to my family.' That’s all,” he said.Dubois beamed as he greeted well-wishers, telling journalists that he was tired but otherwise fine.“It’s amazing for me to be here, to be free,” the 48-year-old journalist said. “I didn’t expect it at all. I would like to pay tribute to Niger, and to its knowledge of these types of delicate missions. And to pay tribute to France and to all those who made it possible to be here today.”Blinken visited the region last week and on Thursday spoke to the press in Niger, where he announced $150 million in direct assistance to the Sahel region.“I’m very pleased we are now seeing that come to fruition today,"" Blinken said, thanking his team, and Niger, for their efforts.Woodke lived in Niger for three decades and had been kidnapped from his home in the town of Abalak in October 2016. Gunmen ambushed and killed his guards, then forced him at gunpoint into their truck, where he was driven north toward Mali’s border.At a 2021 news conference in Washington, Els Woodke said she believed her husband was being held by an al-Qaida-linked militant group known as JNIM and that his captors had sought a multimillion-dollar ransom.Dubois also was being held by JNIM militants, though it was unclear how much time the two foreign hostages had spent in captivity together, said Laith Alkhouri, CEO of Intelonyx Intelligence Advisory.Officials in Niger unexpectedly announced Monday morning that the two men had taken a special flight to the country's capital but provided no details. U.S. officials said the American hostage was not freed in Niger but in the surrounding region that includes Mali, where Dubois was abducted in 2021.Also on Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced that two of its employees were freed in Mali. The organization would not disclose the employees’ identities or the circumstances of their abductions, and it could not be confirmed if there was any connection to the other hostages who were released.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said efforts to free Woodke were headed by U.S. military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies , working closely with the French.“It was a team effort to get him out, and there were no concessions made,” Kirby said. “There were no swaps here. This was just hard, grueling, deliberate work by diplomats and other experts directly with the government of Niger to get him home.”Woodke and Debois were the highest-profile foreigners known to be held in the region, and their release was the largest since a French woman and two Italian men were freed together in Mali in October 2020.French President Emmanuel Macron wrote that he had spoken with Dubois on Monday.“Immense relief for the nation, for his relatives and fellow journalists,” Macron tweeted. ""Deep gratitude to Niger for this release.”Although it remained unclear what led to the releases, “it might not be a coincidence” that the hostages' freedom came after Blinken visited Niger and offered millions of dollars in aid, Alkhouri said.The aid ""could have oiled the Niger government to use its intelligence apparatus in negotiating their release,"" Alkhouri said.A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on background, said Woodke was the second American to be freed in the last six months and that the topic had come up last week during Blinken's visit to Niamey. The identity of the other hostage freed in Niger was not made public.Groups have long abducted hostages for ransom in the Sahel, the vast, semi-arid expanse below the Sahara Desert. Previously released captives have described being moved frequently from site to site in harrowing conditions and sweltering temperatures. The extremists aim to use ransom money to fund their jihadi operations, though not all countries engage in payment negotiations.The Biden administration official did not identify the specific group believed responsible for holding Woodke, saying overlapping networks operated in that part of West Africa.At least 25 foreigners and untold numbers of locals have been kidnapped in the Sahel since 2015, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. In 2020, Swiss authorities said Christian missionary Beatrice Stoeckli was killed by her militant captors.Militants with links to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group are still believed to be holding captives, including a German priest. The Rev. Hans-Joachim Lohre was preparing to celebrate Mass in Mali’s capital when he was abducted in November.Last year an Italian couple and their child were abducted with a household employee in southern Mali. Other hostages taken in West Africa include Ken Elliott, an Australian doctor abducted in 2016, and Romanian citizen Julian Ghergut, who was seized near a mining site in 2015.___Tucker reported from Washington, and Larson reported from Dakar, Senegal.

Over the weekend, the bank's credit rating was downgraded by S&P Global Ratings, which said that the rescue package should ease near-term liquidity pressures, but it “may not solve the substantial business, liquidity, funding, and profitability challenges” that it believes the San Francisco-based bank is now likely facing.Volume surpassed 184 million shares, compared with the daily average of less than 14 million shares.

Bank and non-bank financial firms will be allowed to bid on asset portfolios.Bids for Silicon Valley Bridge Bank must be submitted by by 8:00 p.m. ET on Friday, while bids for Silicon Valley Private Bank are due by 8:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday.On Friday the parent of Silicon Valley Bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and Silicon Valley Bridge Bank was not included in the Chapter 11 filing.SVB Financial Group is no longer affiliated with Silicon Valley Bank after its seizure by the FDIC. Its collapse was the second biggest bank failure in U.S. history after the demise of Washington Mutual in 2008.The shuttering of Silicon Valley Bank and of New York-based Signature Bank has revived bad memories of the financial crisis that plunged the United States into the Great Recession of 2007-2009.The federal government, determined to restore public confidence in the banking system, moved to protect all the banks’ deposits, even those that exceeded the FDIC’s $250,000 limit per individual account.The turmoil in the banking industry spread to Europe and forced a deal under which UBS will acquire troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion.

Shares of UBS rose 3.3%.The FDIC said late Sunday that New York Community Bank agreed to buy a significant chunk of the failed Signature Bank in a $2.7 billion deal.Shares of New York Community Bancorp jumped 32%.Despite all of the concerns swirling around the banking sector, Wall Street is rising on Monday following all of the moves being made to restore confidence in the banking sector.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841484,Germany hopes to repair reputation before hosting Euro 2024,"BERLIN (AP) — With the European Championship looming next year, host Germany hopes this week to start repairing the tattered reputation of its men’s national soccer team.Two World Cup flops and a poor showing in between have taken their toll on what was a proud heritage for Germany. The four-time World Cup winner no longer strikes fear among opponents.The German soccer federation wants to change that before the country hosts Euro 2024. It's an opportunity to restore lost pride, albeit with the potential for more embarrassment.The campaign starts this week with friendly games against Peru in Mainz on Saturday, then Belgium in Cologne three days later.The federation has given coach Hansi Flick another chance to lead the team after its first-round exit at the 2022 World Cup. It also brought in former Germany striker and coach Rudi Völler as sporting director to oversee what it hopes will be a successful shakeup.Another one.Former coach Joachim Löw attempted a shakeup after Germany’s first-round exit at the 2018 World Cup, then ditched it after a 6-0 drubbing by Spain when he recalled veterans Thomas Müller and Mats Hummels for the coronavirus-delayed Euro 2020 tournament. It only got his team as far as the second round, where England ended Löw’s 15-year stint in charge.Flick is banking on more success with the latest focus on youth, building his squad on a foundation of talented but untested under-21 players. Flick has called up six debutants for the games against Peru and Belgium, while leaving out established regulars like Müller, Leroy Sané, Ilkay Gündogan, Antonio Rüdiger and Marco Reus among others.“We’ve taken this path to see which players have the potential to be at the European Championship next year,” Flick said.Bayer Leverkusen’s 19-year-old attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz is the German team's new star, particularly with Bayern Munich’s 20-year-old Jamal Musiala ruled out of the upcoming games through injury. Both were already established players for the senior team, though Wirtz missed the World Cup last November with a knee injury.Perhaps to underline Germany’s new faith in its youth setup, under-21 coach Antonio Di Salvo appeared alongside Flick and Völler at Monday’s press conference.Di Salvo is preparing his team for the Under-21 European Championship in Georgia and Romania this summer, but said he was happy to see players like AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw get their chance with Flick’s senior team.“It’s an honor for the players. It’s also an honor for all the coaches involved along the way from the club to the under-21 team,” Di Salvo said.Völler also stressed the importance of Germany’s underage sides.“I myself am a child of the under-21 team,” said Völler, whose goals helped West Germany win the World Cup in 1990.The now 62-year-old Völler said Germany’s success at the 1982 Under-21 European Championship, where his team reached the final, laid the foundation for the 1990 World Cup win. He also referred to 2009 European champions Manuel Neuer, Sami Khedira, Benedikt Höwedes, Mesut Özil and others helping Germany win the World Cup in 2014.“That’s the basis for us,” said Völler, who said all the players in Flick and Di Salvo’s teams had the chance to play for Germany at Euro 2024.“It’s fortunate we have this wonderful European Championship here next year. It’s important for every player and it shows the young players, especially those who are there, how lovely it is to have such a big tournament in your own country,” Völler said. “Every tournament is hugely important and it brings you forward.

John Jenrette, a colorful politician who was convicted in the Abscam bribery scandal in the late 1970s and whose wife talked to Playboy about an in-session dalliance on the U.S. Capitol steps, has died. He was 86.Jenrette, who had been in declining health, died Friday, according to his obituary from Goldfinch Funeral Home in Conway, South Carolina.Jenrette served three terms as a Democrat in the U.S. House, and while his crime and escapades received the most attention, he also was known for securing federal help for his mostly rural district, including aid to tobacco and other types of farmers and a new bridge in Georgetown tall enough to allow ships to easily pass.Jenrette was elected to the U.S. House in 1974, knocking off the incumbent Republican in the wake of the Watergate scandal.Democratic leaders respected Jenrette and his ability to accomplish things. There was talk of leadership positions. But his splashy, outspoken nature would be his downfall.A FBI informant approached Jenrette and other congressional members in the late 1970s, offering bribes if they would help pass immigration bills to help get into the country foreigners who wanted to run casinos in the U.S.“I’ve got larceny in my blood,” Jenrette said on the grainy video as the FBI, for the first time in the agency's history, taped politicians taking bribes.Jenrette said he was drunk when he took the $50,000 bribe. He was convicted and served 13 months of a two-year prison sentence. He resigned from the U.S. House in 1980 just before his term ended. Even with all the news about the bribery scandal, Jenrette nearly won reelection.After his conviction, Jenrette's second wife, Rita, posed nude in Playboy magazine and said she had sex with her husband behind a column on the U.S. Capitol steps during a break in a late-night U.S. House session. The escapade was the inspiration for the group The Capitol Steps, which did policial satire songs and skits for almost 40 years.The book “Capitol Steps and Missteps: The Wild, Improbable Ride of Congressman John Jenrette” by John Clark and Cookie Miller VanSice detailed his life.Both were former aides. They chronicled Jenrette's productive life after prison, where he helped tobacco companies sell cigarettes in Eastern Europe after the fall of communism, bred horses in Bulgaria, and bought and sold land in Myrtle Beach, eventually settling into a beachfront home with his third wife, Rosemary.Jenrette helped promote the book about his life.“I made some mistakes, but I lived a great life,” Jenrette told The Post and Courier newspaper in 2017 . “I’ve been blessed. I’ve been around the world and done things I never even thought I could do.""",2023/03/20,,World

Until Russia does we will stand united with Ukraine for as long as it takes,” said Blinken.The new aid comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping arrived in Moscow on Monday, giving a political lift to Russian President Vladimir Putin against the West just days after an international arrest warrant was issued for the Kremlin leader on war crimes charges related to Ukraine.The American weapons will be taken from Pentagon stocks through the presidential drawdown authority, so it will be able to be delivered quickly to the warfront. The U.S. has provided more than $32.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841487,"N. Ireland unionists say no to Sunak's Brexit deal, for now","LONDON (AP) — Northern Ireland’s main British unionist party said Monday it will vote against a deal struck by Britain and the European Union to resolve a thorny trade dispute that vexed U.K.-EU relations and triggered a political crisis in Belfast.Democratic Unionist Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal “does not deal with some of the fundamental problems at the heart of our current difficulties” and the party’s eight lawmakers would not support it when the House of Commons votes on Wednesday.The U.K.-EU agreement, known as the Windsor Framework, aims to ease customs checks and other hurdles for goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. that were imposed after Brexit to maintain an open border between the north and its EU neighbor the Republic of Ireland. The open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process.Northern Ireland’s British unionist politicians strongly opposed the customs border, saying it undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom. The DUP walked out of the power-sharing semi-autonomous Belfast government a year ago in protest, leaving Northern Ireland’s 1.9 million people without a functioning administration.The Windsor Framework is designed to ease the burden on businesses and address unionist concerns. It gives Northern Ireland politicians a mechanism, known as the Stormont Brake, to challenge new EU trade rules that could apply in the region — a key unionist demand.But the DUP is concerned that the mechanism does not go far enough and some elements of EU law will continue to apply in Northern Ireland. Under the deal, Northern Ireland is part of the U.K.’s internal market but also has access to the EU’s vast single market of 27 nations for trade in goods.The DUP decision is a blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s deal, but likely not a fatal one. Wednesday’s vote, on the Stormont Brake part of the deal, is a chance for lawmakers to express a view, but not essential to the framework being implemented.The U.K. and the EU are set to formally adopt the Windsor agreement at a meeting between British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and EU Brexit negotiator Maroš Šefčovič on Friday.The DUP also indicated it might change its mind in future. Donaldson said the party would seek “further clarification, re-working and change” and would “continue to work with the government on all the outstanding issues.”""There is a lot more work to be done, we’re engaged with the government on that, and we will make our judgments whenever we see the final picture of all of this,” he said.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841488,US envoy hails 'historic' EU-brokered Serbia-Kosovo deal,"PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — The United States envoy for the Serbia-Kosovo dialogue on Monday welcomed the European Union-facilitated deal on normalizing relations between neighboring Kosovo and Serbia as an “important and historic agreement.”Gabriel Escobar said the weekend deal between Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti in Ohrid, North Macedonia “sets the conditions for normalization between Serbia and Kosovo on European terms.On Saturday EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Vucic and Kurti agreed on an 11-point EU plan to normalize relations following their 1998-1999 war and Kosovo’s declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008.The plan calls for them to maintain good neighborly relations and recognize each other’s official documents and national symbols. If implemented, it would prevent Belgrade from blocking Kosovo’s attempts to seek membership in the United Nations and other international organizations. But it doesn’t explicitly call for mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia.“This agreement is a legally binding obligation on both parties … (and) will continue to be the basis of our policy for the United States going forward and the basis for European engagement in the region,” Escobar said in an online briefing.Both countries hope to join the EU one day, and have been told they must first mend their relations. Solving the dispute has gained attention as war rages in Ukraine and fears mount that Russia could try to stir instability in the volatile Balkans, where it holds historic influence.Escobar said the “primary intent was to frame the ground rules of interaction between the two countries so that things like license plates and barricades don’t threaten to spin out of control and create regional instability.”Kosovo is a majority ethnic Albanian former Serbian province. The 1998-1999 war erupted when separatist ethnic Albanians rebelled against Serbia’s rule, and Belgrade responded with a brutal crackdown. About 13,000 people died, mostly ethnic Albanians. In 1999 a NATO military intervention forced Serbia to pull out of the territory.Tensions have simmered ever since. Kosovo’s independence is recognized by many Western countries. But it is opposed by Belgrade with the backing of Russia and China.",2023/03/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841489,"Logano, Ford deliver answer to Chevy's strong NASCAR start","HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) — As the reigning NASCAR champion, Joey Logano had no reason to panic when Team Penske had a slower than expected start to the new season.He was second in the season-opening Daytona 500 but hardly the dominant driver he was at the end of last season, when Logano won his second Cup title. Even worse, Ford was shut out of the first four races of the season, which were won by Chevrolet drivers.So Logano's return to the winner's circle in Atlanta was a much-needed boost for Ford. Chevrolet won the Daytona 500 with Ricky Stenhouse Jr., at California with Kyle Busch and then back-to-back wins by Hendrick Motorsports' William Byron.But at Atlanta Motor Speedway — led by Logano — Team Penske had the three fastest qualifiers for Sunday's race. Austin Cindric and Ryan Blaney followed Logano in qualifying.Even better for the Blue Oval bunch? Ford drivers lined up in the top eight spots.Logano showed that qualifying was no fluke as he dominated the race and then passed fellow Ford driver and former Penske teammate Brad Keselowski on the final lap to claim his first win of 2023.Team Penske executive vice president Walter Czarnecki was asked if the win was an important statement that Hendrick and the Chevrolets would have competition this season.“Short answer to your question: very important,” Czarnecki said. “It gets us over the hump.”Toyota also had a strong showing, with four Toyotas finishing in the top 10: Christopher Bell was third, Tyler Reddick was fifth, Denny Hamlin was sixth and Ty Gibbs was ninth.Logano's crew chief, Paul Wolfe, said he saw Logano's confidence early in the race. That confidence proved crucial in the last-lap duel between Ford drivers.“Brad is so good at this type of racing,” said Wolfe, who won championships with both Keselowski and Logano. “Obviously, he’s very good at blocking and being able to manage the lead and I know that. For Joey to be able to make some of those moves and pass him was very impressive.“When he has confidence in his car, he can make some magic happen out there for sure.”Keselowski, who went winless last year in his first season as part of the ownership group in Jack Roush's rebranded RFK Racing team, wound up second.“We were right there,” Keselowski said. “I’m glad a Ford won. It was a heck of a battle.”Like Logano, Keselowski left the race with renewed confidence.“It’s night and day from where we were a year ago, 100%,” Keselowski said. ""You just keep running like this with good finishes and the wins will come.”Logano's Penske teammates, Ryan Blaney and Austin Cindric, finished seventh and 11th, respectively, and Logano said the Ford drivers showed they will be a force on superspeedways this season.While Logano had not lost confidence in his Ford, he said it was crucial to make a strong showing on Atlanta's reconfigured superspeedway track because he said it's clear the Fords are designed to thrive in that style of racing.“It’s an indication of the direction we want,” Logano said. “It’s pretty obvious. I think the whole garage knows the direction we’ve gone. We knew we needed to come here and maximize our day.”The win came one week after Logano qualified 16th and finished a disappointing 11th in Phoenix. Asked about the No. 22 team's mentality entering Atlanta, Logano said: “I wouldn’t say deflated. We know the situation we’re in this year and we know we have to be perfect all the time, and if there’s a team that can do that, it’s this team and we can do it all the time.""We were not perfect last week at Phoenix.”Logano and the Fords were saving their perfect finish for Atlanta, where they finally had a chance to run with the Chevys.“Chevrolets clearly have had an advantage,” Czarnecki said. “So for Ford to come back, not just Joey, means a lot.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841490,"Amazon cuts 9,000 more jobs, bringing 2023 total to 27,000","NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon plans to eliminate 9,000 more jobs in the next few weeks, CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff on Monday.The job cuts would mark the second largest round of layoffs in the company's history, adding to the 18,000 employees the tech giant said it would lay off in January. The company's workforce doubled during the pandemic, however, in the midst of a hiring surge across almost the entire tech sector.Tech companies have announced tens of thousands of job cuts this year.In the memo, Jassy said the second phase of the company's annual planning process completed this month led to the additional job cuts. He said Amazon will still hire in some strategic areas.“Some may ask why we didn’t announce these role reductions with the ones we announced a couple months ago. The short answer is that not all of the teams were done with their analyses in the late fall; and rather than rush through these assessments without the appropriate diligence, we chose to share these decisions as we’ve made them so people had the information as soon as possible,” Jassy said.The job cuts announced Monday will hit profitable areas for the company including its cloud computing unit AWS and its burgeoning advertising business. Twitch, the gaming platform Amazon owns, will also see some layoffs as well as Amazon's PXT organizations, which handle human resources and other functions.Prior layoffs had also hit PXT, the company's stores division, which encompasses its e-commerce business as well as company’s brick-and-mortar stores such as Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and other departments such as the one that runs the virtual assistant Alexa.Earlier this month, the company said it would pause construction on its headquarters building in northern Virginia, though the first phase of that project will open this June with 8,000 employees.Like other tech companies, including Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet, Amazon ramped up hiring during the pandemic to meet the demand from homebound Americans that were increasingly buying stuff online to keep themselves safe from the virus.Amazon's workforce, in warehouses and offices, doubled to more than 1.6 million people in about two years. But demand slowed as the worst of the pandemic eased. The company began pausing or cancelling its warehouse expansion plans last year.Amid growing anxiety over the potential for a recession, Amazon in the past few months shut down a subsidiary that’s been selling fabrics for nearly 30 years and shuttered its hybrid virtual, in-home care service Amazon Care among other cost-cutting moves.Jassy said Monday given the uncertain economy and the “uncertainty that exists in the near future,"" the company has chosen to be more streamlined.He said the teams that will be impacted by the latest round of layoffs are not done making final decisions on which roles will be eliminated. The company plans to finalize those decisions by mid to late April and notify those who will be laid off.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841491,Millions in extra funding pledged for ICC work in Ukraine,"LONDON (AP) — An international conference in London raised 4 million pounds ($4.9 million) to support the International Criminal Court in its investigations into alleged war crimes in Ukraine and its work to hold Russia to account, officials said Monday.Justice ministers from over 40 countries met in London for the war crimes conference days after the global court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of personal responsibility in the abduction of children from Ukraine. Friday’s move was the first time the court has issued a warrant against a leader of one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.“We share the belief that President Putin and the wider leadership must be held to account,” Britain’s Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said as he opened the meeting. “Let’s make sure that we back up our words with deeds, that we back up our moral support with practical means to effectively investigate these awful crimes.”Karim Khan, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, said the warrant for Putin was not a moment of triumph but a “somber occasion” reminding the world that joint international action is key to delivering justice for Ukraine.“If we don’t at this moment of world affairs cling to the law, if we don’t look at ourselves and ask how we can do better … we will not only miss an opportunity but we may not have further opportunities,” Khan said.Monday's conference drummed up extra international funding for the ICC, as well as other offers of resources from European countries including investigative support and forensic expertise, Raab said.The global court on Friday also issued a warrant for the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for Children’s Rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation.Andriy Kostin, prosecutor-general of Ukraine, described the abduction and transport of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia to be adopted and raised as Russians as part of a “clear plan” by Russia to “destroy Ukraine and Ukrainian identity.”His office has already launched investigations into over 72,000 incidents of war crimes in his country, he said, adding that no single day goes by without “widespread and systemic atrocities” committed in residential areas against civilians.Although the conference's focus was on backing the ICC's work, Kostin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also petitioned for international support for the establishment of a special international tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia's leaders for the broader crime of aggression.In a pre-recorded video message aired at the end of the conference, Zelenskyy told participants that a new tribunal would supplement the ICC and “significantly strengthen international justice.”Zelenskyy has long pushed for a tribunal to hold Russian leaders to account for the decision to invade Ukraine. The European Union, among others, have supported the idea, but talks are in an early stage and there is no international agreement on the matter so far. Some are concerned that such a tribunal could undermine the ICC's mandate.The arrest warrant against Putin may damage his international standing, but its practical implications are likely limited, not least because Moscow does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction or extradite its nationals. Russian officials dismissed the ICC's move as “legally null and void.”Asked whether he believed it likely that Putin will one day stand trial, Khan said the ICC's record isn't perfect — but that international courts have successfully tried leaders including Liberian President Charles Taylor for crimes in Sierra Leone. He was convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.“Those that think they have a free pass or that there's no consequences need to realize that the law is out there,” the prosecutor told Sky News.___This story has been corrected to show that Charles Taylor was convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, not the International Criminal Court.",2023/03/21,,World

The results are all ranked by how relevant they are to the original search query.People use search engines all the time to find businesses like yours.

If you aren’t appearing at the top of the list, then you could be missing out on potential customers that are going to your competitors instead.If you’re looking for ways to increase your revenue without breaking the bank, then SEO is one of the most effective investments you can make.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841535,"Avaloq, an NEC Company: Results Show Investors Are Ready for AI in Wealth Management","Tokyo, Japan - Newsfile Corp. - 20 March 2023 - NEC Corporation (TSE: 6701) (OTC Pink: NIPNF) shares a recent survey conducted by Avaloq, an NEC Company and leading financial services provider, stating that nearly 80% of investors are comfortable with having artificial intelligence (AI) in a lead or supporting role when it comes to managing their portfolios.      The poll, conducted on 6000 retail, affluent, high-net-worth and ultra-high net worth individuals, also revealed 73% are open to receiving investment advice supported by AI, and 74% are willing to receive AI-assisted product recommendations.   From providing entertainment suggestions to facilitating navigation and shopping, AI has increasingly become the backbone of numerous services relied on daily by a tremendous amount of people. According to the survey results, AI is making significant headway in the banking industry and is currently considered a major disruptor in this field.   The ability of AI to sort vast quantities of data, automate repetitive processes and accurately identify outliers has proven particularly valuable in the back and middle offices of financial institutions. From anti-money laundering to payment fraud prevention, AI is helping financial institutions to not only streamline their workflows, but to increase service accuracy by minimizing the risk of human error.   Wealth management professionals are seeing increased AI adoption in the front and investment office, where they have traditionally been reluctant to incorporate AI in the advisory process, according to Gery Zollinger, Head of Data Science and Analytics at Avaloq. When looking into the attitudes of wealth management clients, he added, it's clear that the time is right for AI to play a greater role in areas such as portfolio analysis or optimization.   ""The main benefits of AI technology in finance are enhanced operational efficiency, increased relationship manager productivity and improved data analysis,"" said Zollinger. In the following Q&A, he shares his thoughts on the present and future of AI in wealth management.   What are the current uses of AI in the front office?   Two key areas have been identified where AI is already established in the wealth management sector. The first use case is virtual assistant technology to augment the role of the relationship manager. Smart virtual assistants can support relationship managers, for example, by providing near-instant suggestions to client requests for account statements, transfers, trade proposals, etc. This works based on natural language processing (NLP) - similar to the technology behind ChatGPT. The virtual assistant analyses client-adviser communications, understands the client's intent and suggests next best actions or relevant news items for the adviser to share. This AI support enables the relationship managers to serve a larger and more diverse client base, while ensuring quicker responses to keep clients engaged.   The second is improved client lifecycle management. Wealth managers can deploy network analytics to automate prospect mapping, while churn prediction engines can alert relationship managers when a client is at risk of leaving the firm. In our experience, these tools can enable wealth managers to increase their client acquisition rate by up to 20% while staving off client attrition.   How will AI help wealth management in the future?   Advances in NLP will help drive conversational banking - i.e. interaction with relationship managers over multiple channels - and substantially increase the productivity of bank employees. An exciting future application of this technology is the combination of NLP with a voice-to-text solution. This would enable the AI to suggest next best actions in near real time, such as generating trade ideas, to the relationship manager during client meetings or generate a summary and to-do list after the meeting has finished.   What about AI in the broader banking industry?    The biggest change on the horizon is new regulation on the use and ethics of AI. A prime example is the pending AI Act by the EU Commission, which sets out clear guidance with respect to fairness, verifiability and non-discrimination. We believe that this guidance will give decision-makers the regulatory confidence to implement value-adding AI tools to leverage their vast datasets, which will ultimately boost innovation in the financial sector. Increased client acceptance of AI is expected over time, especially as individuals become more familiar with AI-augmented tools such as ChatGPT.       Gery Zollinger     About Gery Zollinger, Head of Data Science and Analytics at Avaloq, an NEC Company   Gery Zollinger leads the team behind the Avaloq Insight product line, which is designed to embed data analytics and artificial intelligence in wealth management.

It pays 100,000 euros ($107,000) to the winner.Odermatt’s total topped the previous men’s record of 670,000 Swiss francs ($724,000) set by Marcel Hirscher in his overall title-winning season of 2017-18.___ More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841550,Thai officials trace missing radioactive cylinder to foundry,"BANGKOK (AP) — Thai officials said Monday they have traced to a recycling foundry a metal cylinder with radioactive contents that was discovered earlier this month missing from a power plant, but advised that there appeared to be no public health hazard.The 30-centimeter- (12-inch-) long cylinder containing the radioactive material Caesium-137 was reported missing on March 10 from a piece of machinery at a steam power plant in Prachinburi province, 165 kilometers (102 miles) east of Bangkok.Prachinburi Gov. Narong Nakhonchinda said that traces of Caesium-137 were detected Sunday in bags of furnace dust that was a byproduct of the smelting process at the foundry, which is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the power plant. He said the furnace used for the process was a closed system, so radioactive particles could not escape from it.Work at the plant was ordered halted and employees and nearby residents given health checks.Health officials said medical records for the past month for all hospitals in the province would be checked to see if any paietnts had showed symptoms possibly caused by exposure to radiation. Prolonged direct contact with radioactive material can cause skin rashes, hair loss, canker sores, fatigue, and vomiting. Short-term contact with Caesium-137 may not show immediate symptoms but could lead to a higher risk of cancer.Permsuk Sutchaphiwat, secretary-general of the Office of Atoms for Peace, Thailand’s nuclear research agency, said the metal extracted in processing would not become radioactive because the Caesium-137 would separate from the steel due to the high temperatures used in the process. However, traces of it can still be found in the furnace.The missing 25-kilogram- (55-pound-) cylinder was connected to a 17-meter- (56-foot-) tall silo at the power plant and used for measuring ash content. Police say they suspect the cylinder had been stolen for sale as scrap.In 2000, illegally disposed cannisters containing the radioactive substance Cobalt-60 were found in a junkyard in Samut Prakarn, a suburb of Bangkok. At least five people were hospitalized after being exposed to radiation when the cannisters were opened by the scrapyard workers, unaware of the hazard. The cylinders were believed to have come from a medical X-ray machine.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841551,Paris aims to keep Olympians cool without air conditioners,"The Paris Olympics is going underground to find a way to keep athletes cool at the 2024 Games without air conditioners.Organizers are planning to use a water-cooling system under the Athletes Village — much like the one that has helped the Louvre Museum cope with the sweltering heat that broke records last year — to keep temperatures in check for the Olympians and Paralympians who stay there.The decision is part of the organizing committee’s goal to cut the carbon footprint of the Paris Games by half and stage the most sustainable Olympics to date by installing a special technology to use natural sources to keep everyone cool even during a potential heat wave.“I want the Paris Games to be exemplary from an environmental point of view,” said Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who has resolved to tackle climate change with an ambitious action plan that aims to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make the City of Lights carbon neutral by 2050.Compared to a conventional project, the carbon impact will be reduced by 45% for the Athletes Village during the construction phase and over the entire Olympic cycle, she said.For two months between July and September 2024, the Athletes Village north of Paris will host 15,600 athletes and sports officials during the Olympics and 9,000 athletes and their supporting teams during the Paralympics. After the games, the 50-hectare (125-acre) site next to the River Seine in the popular district of Seine-Saint-Denis will become a zero-carbon, eco-friendly residential and commercial neighborhood with 6,000 new inhabitants — the first ones moving in as soon as 2025.In anticipation of hot weather, organizers have been studying heatwaves block by block in the Athletes Village. They have simulated conditions in the parts of the accommodation most exposed to the sun and have tested the effectiveness of the cooling system with an objective to keep the indoor temperature between 23 and 26 degrees Celsius (73 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit).The geothermal energy system will ensure that the temperature in the athlete apartments in the Seine-Saint-Denis suburb does not rise above 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) at night, including during a potential a heat wave, said Laurent Michaud, the director of the Olympic and Paralympic Villages.He said organizers have conducted tests in rooms that are located on the highest floors of the residences and are facing south and exposed to direct sun on two sides. They also considered directions of winds in the region and the water temperature in the Seine. They have worked closely with France’s national weather agency to develop temperature forecasts.“Despite outdoor temperatures reaching 41 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit), we had temperatures at 28 degrees (82 degrees Fahrenheit) in most of these rooms,” Michaud told The Associated Press, detailing the results of a heatwave simulation. “In other rooms, we clearly had lower temperatures.”In addition to the underfloor cooling, the insulation built into the buildings will enable residents to keep the cold obtained during the night throughout the day, Michaud said. To keep the coolness inside, the athletes will have to follow some basic rules, he added, including making sure the window blinds are shut during the day.Laurent Monnet, who is in charge of the green transition at Saint-Denis City Hall, Paris’ northern suburb where the main Olympic Village will be located, said all rooms should be 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the outside temperature, without an AC unit. Although some Olympic hopefuls have already expressed concern about the lack of air conditioning, Monnet said athletes should adapt and help contribute to fight against climate change.“We need athletes to set an example when they use the buildings,” Monnet said. “We can build the most virtuous village we want, it is also the use that will be made of it that will weigh on our carbon footprint.”Eliud Kipchoge, a two-time Olympic champion and marathon world record holder, endorsed the Paris sustainability plan. The Kenyan is one the sport’s most vocal proponents of environmental justice and has repeatedly sounded the alarm on climate change and the impact of global warming.“It’s a good thought, because we all need to reduce our carbon,” Kipchoge said in an interview with the AP.He called on fellow athletes to help combat climate change by reducing their carbon impact during competition, training and their lives in general because “we are all going to go through the same scenario.”Paris organizers have been in touch with national Olympic committees and said they will have the option of setting up their own AC units in specific cases and on condition that the devices comply with the organizing committee’s technical criteria.Most national Olympic officials have responded to the plans to keep their athletes cool during the Paris Games with a wait-and-see attitude. Some Olympic officials are not excluding bringing their own air conditioners to France — or paying for one on the spot — depending on the weather at the time.The Australian Olympic Committee said it will keep an eye on the weather patterns in Paris over the coming year to ensure “the optimal high-performance environment for our athletes, including heat and humidity mitigation that may be required.”Michaud, the director of the Olympic Village, said organizers want to be kind to the environment, but not endanger the health of athletes. Some athletes, especially in Paralympic events, have difficulty regulating their body’s core temperature and if they reside in rooms in which it proves impossible to keep at 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) at night, national delegations will be able to install a portable AC system.“It will be on a case-by-case basis, and for health and safety of the athletes,” Michaud said, adding that ventilators vaporizing water droplets could be installed instead of traditional air conditioning units.Hidalgo, the Paris mayor, is adamantly against turning next year’s event into the bring-your-own-air-conditioning Olympics — health exceptions aside.“I can assure you that we will not change course and that there will be no changes to the construction program of the village regarding air conditioning,” Hidalgo said.Regarding the option of organizers providing national teams with an additional cooling mechanism, she said: “I am not in favor of it. We must be consistent with our objectives.”___AP Sports Writers Jimmy Golen in Boston and Dennis Passa in Brisbane contributed to this report.___More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841552,Lebanon to construct new terminal at Beirut airport,"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon will construct a $122 million terminal at Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport to be operated by a leading Irish airport company when it's completed in four years, officials said Monday.Lebanon’s only international airport had a major facelift after the country’s 1975-90 civil war and has been working at full capacity for years. The airport has not undergone an expansion since 1998.Caretaker Minister of Public Works and Transport Ali Hamie said Terminal 2 will bring in private sector investments worth $122 million and will handle 3.5 million passengers annually when operations begin in 2027. It will add six docking stands as well as remote ones, he said in a ceremony at government headquarters to announce the launch of the new terminal.Terminal 2 will be built where the airport's old cargo building used to stand, according to Hamie.The project comes as Lebanon is in the throes of its worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political class.“The project opens more horizons for air aviation between Lebanon and the world,” caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said. He added that it will help in solving several problems, including crowding at the current terminal.The project will create 500 direct jobs and 2,000 related jobs, Hamie said, adding that Terminal 2 will be for chartered and low-cost flights.Hamie said once Terminal 2 is ready it will be operated by leading European company daa International, an airport company in Ireland.Ireland’s Minister of State James Browne attended Monday’s ceremony in Beirut and was quoted in a statement released by the Lebanese prime minister’s office as saying that the contract signed will deepen business relations between the two countries.The airport currently handles 8 million passengers a year, and the plans are to reach 20 million in 2030, according to the website of national carrier Middle East Airlines.Lebanon’s economic crisis that began in October 2019 has left three quarters of the country’s 6 million people, including 1 million Syrian refugees, in poverty.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841553,Trump lawyers attack Georgia grand jury and prosecutor,"ATLANTA (AP) — Lawyers for former President Donald Trump are attacking a special grand jury and prosecutors who investigated him in Georgia, asking a state court to throw out its report and all testimony from the inquiry and bar Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from continuing to investigate or prosecute Trump.The filing, made Monday in Atlanta, argues that the Georgia law that allows for special grand juries is unconstitutionally vague because it doesn't say whether such a grand jury is handing criminal matters or civil matters. The lawyers also argue that the grand jury didn't sufficiently protect Trump's right to due process.Lawyers Jennifer Little and Drew Findling wrote that the world watched a special grand jury process “that was confusing, flawed, and at times, blatantly unconstitutional.”The lawyers wrote that the special grand jury “involved a constant lack of clarity as to the law, inconsistent applications of basic constitutional protections for individuals being brought before it, and a prosecutor's office that was found to have an actual conflict, yet continued to pursue the investigation.”Willis opened the Georgia investigation in early 2021, shortly after a recording of a phone call between Trump and a top state official was made public. During that Jan. 2, 2021, phone call, Trump suggested that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could “find” the votes needed to reverse his narrow loss in the state.The special grand jury, which was seated in May 2022, heard from about 75 witnesses and considered other evidence before wrapping up its work in December. It did not have the authority to issue indictments but instead produced a report with recommendations for Willis. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered most of that report to remain under seal.The foreperson of the special grand jury said in news interviews last month that the panel recommended that numerous people be indicted, but she declined to say who. It is ultimately up to Willis to decide whether to go to a regular grand jury to seek one or more indictments in the case. She said during a hearing in January that decisions in the case are “imminent.”The lawyers also attacked interviews that the foreperson and other grand jurors have given, writing that ""the foreperson’s public comments in and of themselves likewise violate notions of fundamental fairness and due process and taint any future grand jury pool.”",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841554,Antonio Conte's Tottenham reign could be nearing the end,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Even by Antonio Conte's standards, it was a remarkable outburst that leaves his position as manager at Tottenham in even greater doubt.The fiery Italian, who will soon be out of contract, has long been expected to leave his post at the end of the season. But after publicly criticizing his players and the Premier League club's ownership following Saturday's 3-3 draw with last-place Southampton, he might not last that long.“They don’t want to play under pressure. They don’t want to play under stress,” Conte said Saturday. ""Tottenham’s story is this. Twenty years there is the (same) owner and they never won something.”Conte is a serial winner who has also developed a reputation for conflict. While he has been unable to deliver trophies in his 16 months at Tottenham, the conflict has come.After months of speculation about his future, Champions League elimination by AC Milan in the round of 16 this month appeared the be the beginning of the end for Conte.Afterward he claimed his players were “soft,” fan patience was “finished,” and that it would take a “miracle” to win a trophy.The 53-year-old coach, who has just returned to the touchline after recovering from gallbladder surgery, also said he would not “kill himself” in pursuit of success at a club that has not won a major trophy since the League Cup in 2008.Conte's criticism of his players is unlikely to improve his relations with them after Brazil international Richarlison complained about his lack of playing time this season.Meanwhile, his withering assessment of Tottenham's owners could prompt chairman Daniel Levy into action at a time when Champions League qualification is still a possibility.The risk is that Conte's erratic outbursts could see the team's challenge for a top-four finish unravel if it leads to unrest within the squad.Some have interpreted Conte's actions as evidence that he wants go now.“Conte wants to be sacked in this international break,” TV commentator Jamie Carragher wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “Spurs should just put him out of his misery and do it tonight.""If these are Conte's final days at Tottenham, they echo the end of his Chelsea reign in 2018.Despite winning the Premier League title and FA Cup in his two seasons in charge at Stamford Bridge, he was openly critical about the club's transfer business and fell out with striker Diego Costa.Conte has developed a reputation as a demanding manager.Amid links with Manchester United last season, the club's former captain and now TV commentator Gary Neville urged against hiring him despite his stellar reputation.“I wouldn’t bring Conte in to United,” he said at the time. “He’s not a fit for United.”Conte went on to lead Tottenham to a top-four finish and into the Champions League, while United endured its worst ever Premier League campaign.It appeared to be further evidence of Conte's golden touch after winning five league championships and numerous other trophies with Juventus, Chelsea and Inter Milan.But there was always the possibility that he would grow frustrated if Tottenham could not match his own ambitions and provide him with the players to seriously challenge at the top of the Premier League.Spurs spent about $140 million since his arrival, including $73.5 million on Richarlison.While they are currently in fourth place, both Newcastle and Liverpool can overtake them if they win their games in hand.The loss to Milan felt like a missed opportunity to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League, having avoided Europe's best teams — Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Napoli — in the round of 16.There was also the embarrassing loss to second-division club Sheffield United in the FA Cup at the start of the month.Conte has had to contend with personal trauma following the deaths of three close friends over the past five months — Tottenham fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone, and former players Sinisa Mihailovic and Gianluca Vialli.He then had to deal with his own health issues when undergoing gallbladder surgery in February.Still, the season is far from a lost cause, and back-to-back top-four finishes would be considered a success for many teams — especially one that has not won a major trophy in 15 years.For a serial winner like Conte, however, it doesn't appear to be enough to satisfy his relentless ambition.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841556,Anthony Fauci documentary on PBS covers a career of crises,"NEW YORK (AP) — There's a moment in the new PBS documentary about Dr. Anthony Fauci when a protester holds up a handmade sign reading, “Dr. Fauci, You Are Killing Us.""It says something about Fauci that it's not initially clear when that sign was waved in anger — in the 1980s as AIDS made its deadly rise or in the 2020s with COVID-19 vaccine opponents.“American Masters: Dr. Tony Fauci,” offers a portrait of an unlikely lightning rod: A government infectious disease scientist who advised seven presidents. Fauci hopes it can inspire more public servants like him.“I just felt that there needed to be a story of people understanding what public health officials go through, but also I hope as a source of inspiration for young people who are either in science or interested in going into science,” he told The Associated Press. The documentary airs Tuesday and later streams.Fauci allowed a film crew to follow him for 23 months starting in January 2021. The documentary covers his career and its crises, especially the way COVID-19 was handled by the Trump administration.“When you talk about all of the different things coming together for a disaster, that’s what happened: A divided country, a president who amplified the division and then a public health crisis — you couldn’t ask for a worse combination of things,” he said.Director Mark Mannucci offers an intimate look at his subject, with images of Fauci running from meeting to meeting and wolfing down Wheat Thins between Zooms. His wife attests to the stress by pointing out their security detail due to threats.“The story illuminates — and he’d be the first to say it — some very dark stuff about this country and how a person who has devoted his life to helping individuals got so twisted in this current climate,” said Mannucci.Michael Kantor, executive producer for the American Masters series, says Fauci is a figure who has been central to American life for decades and deserves an examination, even if some virulently oppose him.“Dr. Fauci is a very controversial figure, and there are going to be people who are going to voice — just as in the film — great displeasure about what he’s done and about his approach to things. But isn’t that the whole point of public media? It is intended to make that conversation happen in the best possible way.”COVID-19 may have introduced Fauci to millions of Americans, but his long career at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was marked by numerous previous health scares, among them HIV, SARS, MERS, Ebola and even the nation’s 2001 anthrax attacks.The film shows that Fauci learned a lesson in humility with AIDS, as the disease stubbornly persisted and activists argued not enough was being done from the government. “I went from a world of success and gratification to a world of frustration and failure,” he says in the film.Mannucci's camera flashes-forward to today, with Fauci cordially meeting up with the former AIDS activists who once decried him. They have long since reconciled; they were all on the same side, after all — science.“I put aside the confrontational behavior and the attacks on me and listen to what they were saying,” Fauci explained in the interview. “And what they were saying was making perfect sense. It made me feel if I were in their shoes, I’d be doing exactly what they were doing.”That's not the case when protesters in recent years began attacking Fauci for mask mandates, school closures, quarantines and bizarre claims about the COVID-19 vaccines.“There’s one sign that says, ‘Fauci, You’re Killing Us’ and the other sign that says ‘Fauci, You’re Killing Us’ but the rationale for those from the 1980s to 2023 is enormously different,” Fauci said. “They couldn't be more different.”In one remarkable sequence in the documentary, Mannucci presses Fauci on whether he might have handled things differently looking back — like asking Americans to adopt masks sooner or ordering quarantines faster. “Maybe I should have done that,” he says. “Yeah, I was wrong.”Mannucci relied on 10 long sit-downs with Fauci to develop trust with his subject and didn't clutter the documentary with testimonials from talking heads, wanting to focus on Fauci's experiences.“I hope it’s not viewed as a partisan message, but as a portrait of who he is and what he went through,” said the director. “I hope that people on the other side, even if they never end up agreeing with him, will at least see somebody who is a real person, who’s a thinking person, who’s somebody maybe they can even relate to.”The film ends with Fauci's retirement from the NIAID late last year. Kantor suspects only time will tell where history will judge a man who dedicated his life to public service.“I think 10 years from now, hopefully the furor over him as a controversial figure will die down. But the legacy of the approach to pandemics and so on will still be super valuable,” he said.___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841558,US: War crimes on all sides in Ethiopia's Tigray conflict,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration announced Monday that it has determined all sides in the brutal conflict in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.The move carries no immediate U.S. policy implications but lends weight to calls for such allegations to be prosecuted.Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the determination less than a week after he returned from a visit to Ethiopia during which he met with Ethiopian government and Tigrayan officials as well as victims of the conflict, but said little about the U.S. view of prospects for accountability.His determination covers members of the Ethiopian and Eritrean national armies as well as the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and forces aligned with the Amhara region. Blinken said those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable.He said after “careful review of the law and facts” he had determined that members of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, Eritrean Defense Forces, Tigray People’s Liberation Front forces and Amhara forces committed war crimes during the conflict in northern Ethiopia.Members of the Ethiopian, Eritrean and Amhara forces also committed crimes against humanity, ""including murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and persecution,” Blinken said. “Members of the Amhara forces also committed the crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer and committed ethnic cleansing in western Tigray.”Blinken announced the determination as he rolled out the State Department's annual global human rights reports, which cover 2022.“I condemn the unspeakable violence against civilians and destruction that occurred in northern Ethiopia,” he said. “Recognizing the atrocities committed by all parties is an essential step to achieving a sustainable peace. Those most responsible for atrocities, including those in positions of command, must be held accountable.”The formal determination is more measured than his assertion early in the two-year conflict that “ethnic cleansing” was taking place in parts of Tigray.Last year, a United Nations commission of inquiry said it had turned up evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Ethiopian government forces, Tigray forces and Eritrea’s military. But the commission also said Ethiopian forces had resorted to “starvation of civilians” as a tool of war and that Ethiopian and Eritrean forces were found to be responsible for “sexual slavery” — while Tigray forces were not.The conflict, which ended with a peace deal in November, killed an estimated half-million civilians in Tigray alone, according to Ghent University researchers, a death toll echoed by U.S. officials.Blinken called on all sides to respect the agreement and follow through on pledges “to implement an inclusive and comprehensive transitional justice process.”___Cara Anna contributed from Nairobi.

Last year, the title was taken by Ukraine's entry, Kalush Orchestra.Normally that would mean Ukraine would be this year’s designated host country, but it was deemed too risky to have the contest there because of the ongoing Russian invasion.Instead the U.K., who came second last year with Sam Ryder’s “SPACE MAN,” is staging the event in Liverpool on the winner's behalf and plans to celebrate Ukraine’s creativity and culture.“I just want to make sure that they feel celebrated on that night as well,"" Muller says of Ukraine. “And I think that 3,000 Ukrainians have got tickets to come to Eurovision the final.

""And then I worked through that. I got over those emotions and then I realized just how much of like a blessing that really is.”Maybe it was all in the stars: Muller admits she’s been obsessed with music since she was a toddler.She even appeared, when she was nine, as the girl in a green dress in the music video for MIKA’s 2007 hit “Grace Kelly.”“It could have either like scared me and maybe gone the other way and gone, ‘Oh no, too much for me,’ Muller recalls. “Obviously, I went the other way and I was like, ‘I love it!’”",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841563,The big problem for endangered orcas? Inbreeding,"SEATTLE (AP) — People have taken many steps in recent decades to help the Pacific Northwest's endangered killer whales, which have long suffered from starvation, pollution and the legacy of having many of their number captured for display in marine parks.They've breached dikes and removed dams to create wetland habitat for Chinook salmon, the orcas' most important food. They’ve limited commercial fishing to try to ensure prey for the whales. They've made boats slow down and keep farther away from the animals to reduce their stress and to quiet the waters so they can better hunt.So far, those efforts have had limited success, and research published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution suggests why: The whales are so inbred that they are dying younger and their population is not recovering. Female killer whales take about 20 years to reach peak fertility, and the females may not be living long enough to ensure the growth of their population.While that news sounds grim for the revered orcas — known as the “southern resident” killer whales — it also underscores the urgency of conservation efforts, said Kim Parsons, a geneticist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's NOAA Fisheries who co-authored the study. The population is not necessarily doomed, she said.“It’s not often inbreeding itself that will result in a shortened lifespan or kill an individual,” Parsons said. “It's really that inbreeding makes these individuals more vulnerable to disease or environmental factors. We can support the population by supporting the environment and giving them the best chance possible.”The struggles of the charismatic population of orcas that frequent the waters between Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia have been well documented — including in 2018, when one grieving mother carried her stillborn calf for 17 days in an apparent effort to mourn or revive it.The southern resident population comprises three clans of whales known as the J, K and L pods. They are socially distinct and even communicate differently from other orca populations, including the nearby northern residents, which are listed as threatened and which primarily range from Vancouver Island up to southeast Alaska.While the southern residents' range overlaps with other populations of killer whales, they haven't regularly interbred in 30 generations, the researchers said.In the 1960s and 1970s, dozens of Pacific Northwest whales were caught for display in marine theme parks. The whale-capture industry argued that there were many orcas in the sea, and that some could be sustainably caught.At least 13 orcas died in the roundups, and 45 were delivered to theme parks around the world — reducing the southern resident population by about 40%. The brutality of the captures began to draw public outcry and a lawsuit to stop them in Washington state.Today only 73 southern residents remain, according to the Center for Whale Research on Washington state's San Juan Island. That’s just two more than in 1971. Of those captured, only one — 56-year-old Lolita, at the Miami Seaquarium — survives. The Seaquarium announced last year it would no longer feature Lolita in shows.Prior studies have suggested that inbreeding was a problem, including a 2018 study that found just two males had fathered more than half the calves born to the southern residents since 1990.For the new research, NOAA geneticist Marty Kardos, Parsons and other colleagues sequenced the genomes of 100 living and dead southern residents, including 90% of those alive now. Those whales had lower levels of genetic diversity and higher levels of inbreeding than other populations of killer whales in the North Pacific, they found.The capture of the whales decades ago, as well as the geographic or social isolation of the animals, likely explains the inbreeding, the researchers said.Meanwhile, conservation efforts have helped other North Pacific orca populations thrive. The northern resident killer whales have increased from about 122 animals in 1974 to more than 300 by 2018. Like the southern residents, they only eat fish, primarily salmon — unlike many other killer whales, which eat mammals such as seals.The Alaska resident killer whale population is estimated to have doubled from 1984 to 2010. According to the researchers, the southern residents would likely be on a similar trajectory if not for their elevated levels of inbreeding.Inbreeding has also afflicted other populations of isolated or endangered animals, such as mountain lions in California, gorillas in Africa and bottle nose dolphins off western Australia. In some cases, scientists may be able to improve the gene pool in one population by capturing and introducing animals from another.That's not the case for orcas, which are massive and free-swimming. Further, the southern residents already have opportunities to interbreed — they just haven't done so, Parsons said.“We really have to leave it to those whales to mate with whom they choose and support the population in other ways,” Parsons said.",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841576,"Miami Beach struggles with spring break violence, big crowds","MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — For the third year in a row, Miami Beach finds itself struggling with spring break violence, including two fatal shootings and unruly crowds, despite a massive police presence and activities designed to give people alternatives to drinking alcohol and roaming the streets.The party-all-the-time vibe in the South Beach section of the popular barrier island city has already led officials to ban alcohol sales at larger clubs after 2 a.m. Police are stationed everywhere, including in mobile towers that give officers a birds-eye view of the streets. Art, music, yoga and volleyball tournaments were added this year to give people something to do, at least during the day.Yet the violence and street chaos continues at night. All night.The city imposed an overnight curfew that ended Monday morning but decided at a City Commission meeting not to enact a second curfew next weekend, when the Ultra Music Festival will draw thousands of people to South Beach. It's the third weekend of spring break when the worst chaos occurs, said Commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez.“Ultra weekend is not the problem,"" she said.Commissioner Ricky Arriola agreed, saying there may need to be metal detectors, security fences or other measures installed next year in certain sections of Miami Beach. He noted that dozens of businesses and their workers depend on the crowds the Ultra event bring in.“A curfew is not a long-term solution,” he said. “We're taking it out on law-abiding businesses.”The panel did decide, as it did last year, to force liquor stores in the South Beach area to close early at 6 p.m. during next weekend. Officials did point out the city manager still has emergency authority to order a 72-hour curfew despite the commission's reluctance.Mayor Dan Gelber wants the violence and disorder to stop.“The volume of people in our city, the unruly nature of too many and the presence of guns has created a peril that cannot go unchecked,” Gelber said in a video statement issued Sunday. “It is clear that even an unprecedented police presence could not prevent these incidents from occurring.”Gelber added: “We don't ask for spring break in our city. We don't want spring break in our city.”Miami Beach police reported at least 322 arrests on a variety of charges between Feb. 27 and Sunday. Gelber said more than 70 firearms were confiscated in that time. This has been happening despite police officers working up to 14-hour shifts six days a week, according to a city emergency declaration.The latest shooting happened at around 3:30 a.m. Sunday on Ocean Drive in South Beach, police said. A male was shot and died later at a hospital, and officers chased down a suspect on foot, police said on Twitter. Their identities were not released, nor were any possible charges.Grainy security footage being shared on social media shows a man pulling a gun from underneath his T-shirt and firing multiple shots, striking another man as crowds quickly scattered.“Next thing I know, I started hearing about two shots. I got low and got scared,” Travis Turner, a bystander from Michigan, told WSVN-TV.On Friday night, one male victim was killed and another was seriously injured in a shooting that sent panicked crowds scrambling from restaurants and clubs into the streets. Police detained one person at the scene and found four firearms, but no other details have been made available.David Wallack, owner of Mango’s Tropical Cafe, said nightclubs are being unfairly blamed for the shootings, and city officials need to work more closely with business owners to prevent violence in the future.“What was going on out in the streets was not customers of businesses,” Wallack said. “The majority of all those people in the street, they’re bringing their own stuff to the party. They don’t have the money to pay $20 a drink.”Tolga Bugdaci, 21, who was visiting South Beach from Dusseldorf, Germany, said he’s not surprised the city decided to enact a curfew over the past weekend.“I can understand it, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be this way,” Bugdaci said, adding that he did not witness either shooting. ""We woke up to it, and everything was yellow on the street. It was crazy, we had never experienced anything like this before. It was a different world to us.”Under the now-expired curfew, people had to leave businesses before midnight, although hotels can operate later only in service to their guests. Restaurants could stay open only for delivery and the curfew won’t apply to residents, people going to and from work, emergency services and hotel guests. Some roads will be closed off and arriving hotel guests may have to show proof of their reservations.Last year, the city imposed a midnight curfew following two shootings, also on Ocean Drive. The year before that, authorities made about 1,000 arrests and confiscated dozens of guns during a rowdy spring break that led Miami Beach officials to take steps aimed at calming the annual festivities.For some business owners, the crowds have become impossible to manage. Vice Mayor Steven Meiner said there will be a debate in the coming months about how to prepare better for next spring break.“I don’t view any other option at this point other than to do metal detectors. I’m not going to through next year and have dead people on our streets,” he said. “I don’t understand how we can’t make a secure perimeter around this. We’re going through the same thing year after year.""_______Associated Press writer Freida Frisaro contributed from Fort Lauderdale. Anderson reported from St. Petersburg.",2023/03/21,,World

He declined to give their ages or grades.Another male student was arrested at the scene and charged with capital murder, Jones said at an afternoon news conference. The police chief declined to identify the suspected shooter because he is a minor, but said he is being held at a juvenile detention center in the area.The gunman ran from the scene without ever entering the Lamar High School building and was taken into custody by responding officers “within minutes,” Jones said. He said investigators recovered a gun used in the shooting but the shooter's motive and where he got the weapon remain unclear.Jones said the police officers normally stationed at the school weren't there during the shooting, which began shortly before the officers were set to start duty.Arlington Independent School District spokeswoman Anita Foster said the school went into lockdown during the shooting but school buses and other arriving students were diverted from the campus before classes were set to begin. Police said they completed their search of the school at 10:40 a.m.School staff began reuniting students who'd been sheltering inside the building with their parents or guardians around 11 a.m., according to Superintendent Marcelo Cavazos. He said there would be no classes Tuesday and counselors would be available to students and staff on Wednesday.In Texas, people convicted of capital murder can be sentenced to death.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841578,EU's top diplomat hails deal on artillery shells for Ukraine,"BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union countries have endorsed a fast-track procedure aimed at providing Ukraine with sorely needed artillery shells to repel Russia's invasion forces, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Monday, as Moscow maintains its focus on attacking the industrial east of the war-ravaged country.As he chaired a meeting of EU foreign and defense ministers in Brussels, Borrell took to Twitter to hail what he described as “a historic decision” for the 27-nation bloc and Norway to send Ukraine 1 million 155-milimeter artillery shells within 12 months.“We are taking a key step towards delivering on our promises to provide Ukraine with more artillery ammunition,” he said, and noted that 18 countries had signed up to a European Defense Agency, or EDA, project to place joint orders for ammunition with the defense industry.Borrell said that he had won approval for his proposal to provide 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to encourage member nations to provide artillery shells from their stocks and any orders for new rounds that they might have placed with industry.A further 1 billion euros would also be used to fast-track new orders and encourage countries to work together on those purchases through the EDA or in groups of at least three nations. Germany has already called for countries to join its own effort, which Berlin believes will go faster.The third track of the program involves support to Europe’s defense industry. so that it can ramp up production in the longer term. EU officials have said that new joint orders could be placed by May if the plan is endorsed.Germany’s defense industry says it stands ready to ramp up its output, including the kinds of arms and ammunition needed by Ukraine, but that it needs clarity about what governments want before investing in further production capacity.Ukraine became the world’s No. 3 importer of arms in 2022 after Russia’s invasion triggered a big flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe, according to Swedish think tank SIPRI.“What’s important for us as an industry is to get predictability,” Hans Christoph Atzpodien, the head of Germany’s arms manufacturing association, told The Associated Press last week. “That means we have to be clearly told which products are needed within which time.”",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841579,Will the Credit Suisse bank takeover calm financial fears?,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — In a bid to ease turmoil in the world financial system, Swiss authorities engineered a plan for the UBS bank to acquire its troubled smaller rival Credit Suisse at a marked-down price.It's another urgent attempt to fight fears that have put the financial world on edge 15 years after the failure of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers pitched the global economy into a crisis.Here are key things to know — and some things that aren't yet known — about the takeover and the wider market anxiety fueled by bank failures in the U.S.WHY IS UBS TAKING OVER CREDIT SUISSE?Swiss authorities pushed UBS to take over its rival after the price of Credit Suisse shares plunged and depositors fled, raising fears that it could fail.Credit Suisse isn't just any bank. Unlike midsize Silicon Valley Bank, which went under earlier this month in the U.S., it is one of 30 banks classified as globally significant because it could pose a risk of bigger trouble if it collapses, as happened with Lehman.Credit Suisse's troubles pre-dated Silicon Valley's failure, including a $5.5 billion loss on its dealings with private investment firm Archegos and a spying scandal.Then fears about banks fed by the U.S. failures made investors take a closer, less friendly look at banks. When Credit Suisse's biggest investor, Saudi National Bank, refused to put up more money, investors and depositors headed for the exits.WILL THE TAKEOVER RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM?Confidence in banks is shaky right now. That said, economists, bank regulators and stock-market analysts generally say that banks are in better shape than in 2008, with thicker financial buffers against losses and a slew of new regulations.And this time, policymakers have been quicker to respond. The U.S. Federal Reserve offered credit to banks that suffered uninsured losses on bond holdings due to rising interest rates.On Sunday, just ahead of the opening of markets in Asia, other central banks joined the Fed in expanding unlimited dollar credit to any bank that needs it. That was a swift preemptive move used in earlier emergencies such as the pandemic market meltdown of 2020.Swiss officials balked at letting Credit Suisse just fail, unlike the U.S. government in 2008, when it let Lehman go under, spreading losses and fear across the financial system. Financial institutions had been in trouble since 2007, but it wasn't until two weeks after Lehman that the U.S. Congress came to the system's aid with a $700 billion emergency economic stabilization act.Questions have been raised about the technicalities of the Credit Suisse rescue and the decision to insure all depositors at Silicon Valley. But officials are showing that they learned one lesson from Lehman, “namely to act decisively and swiftly, and if needed to run roughshod over any discussion of moral hazard and legal obstacles, both of which can be discussed once the dust settles,” said Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International.As a result, “some semblance of calm has been restored. This crisis is far from over, but at least some of the immediate risks of an exponential ballooning of contagion effects have been mitigated.”SO WE CAN SOUND THE ALL CLEAR?Not yet. UBS shares initially plunged Monday on fears that the bank has simply inherited trouble by buying Credit Suisse. The share later turned positive. And the way the takeover was done, by wiping out some of the Credit Suisse's bondholders, rattled markets in those bonds. So new problems could arise.“Containing crises is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole — with new fires starting as existing ones are extinguished,” said Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. “A key issue over the next week will be whether problems arise in other institutions or parts of the financial system.""Among the lingering worries: Did other U.S. banks ignore the risk that interest rates might swiftly rise, as Silicon Valley did? Could there be trouble in other parts of the financial sector that don’t take insured deposits, such as investment banks, hedge funds and mortgage brokers?Said Shearing: “A reasonable base case is that we avoid a system-wide crisis on the scale of 2007-08, but further problems emerge at individual institutions.”WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SWISS BANKS?In the global financial crisis, it was UBS that needed government help, while Credit Suisse did not. Now UBS faces the task of integrating Credit Suisse and sorting out its problems.Switzerland, which had five big banks 30 years ago, is now left with one very large bank that’s “too big to fail.”“That means the government is even more challenged to support any problems in the financial system,” said Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at the University of Zurich.WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY?Analysts say pressure from markets and regulators may now make banks less likely to risk new lending, which could restrict credit for new purchases or investment in new businesses.If credit is seen to tighten because of fears over banks, central banks such as the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England might choose to slow down their recent rapid interest rate increases aimed at fighting inflation — or to stop the increases at a lower level than they otherwise would have.Tighter credit, whether from nervous banks or from central bankers raising rates, tends to counteract inflation.That was behind European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde's statement last week after the bank raised rates by a half-percentage point. She said further rate decisions would be taken meeting to meeting based on the latest data.Lagarde said Monday that the current financial tensions “might have an impact on demand and might actually do some of the work that might otherwise be done by monetary policy.”___Associated Press Writer Courtney Bonnell contributed from London.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841580,France ordered to curb mass dolphin deaths in fishing nets,"PARIS (AP) — France’s highest administrative body on Monday ordered the government to better protect endangered dolphins and porpoises in an industrial fishing hub in the Atlantic Ocean that has become controversial over links to mass deaths of the creatures in recent years.The move was welcomed by conservationists, who hope it could stop some species becoming extinct in the zone.The council of state gave government officials six months “to close areas of fishing in the Bay of Biscay for appropriate periods, in order to limit the number of deaths of common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises that are victims of accidental capture during fishing.”It also required them to compile a reliable estimate of the annual number of accidental catches.Government-affiliated scientists estimate that some 10,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed on average every year in that maritime zone of western France alone — one recent year recorded 18,000 deaths. They're widely blamed on industrial fishing.Indiscriminate French nets, sometimes 50 kilometers (31 miles) long, trawl the ocean for regular fish, indiscriminately pulling in a full range of sea creatures.Several species are now in a state of “unfavorable conservation,” with the common dolphin and harbor porpoise in “serious danger of extinction” in the region, officials said.What’s shocked people is the brutality of many of the deaths. Autopsies carried out on some dolphins showed extreme levels of mutilation. Activists say it’s common for fishermen to cut body parts off the suffocated dolphins after they are pulled up on the nets, to save the nets.Sea Shepherd France is among groups that have fought to get trawlers and boats to curb their deadly practices.“Of course, this move is a ray of hope for us but it’s bittersweet. So many dolphins are already dead, we see dead creatures washed up every day. I hope it’s not too late,” Lamya Essemlali of Sea Shepherd France told The Associated Press. “We’ve come so far. Even a few years ago in France, no one knew about these horrors.”French and international conservation groups now want French Sea Minister Herve Berville to implement the recommendations of international agencies, according to which the Bay of Biscay needs to be closed for fishing for three months in winter and one month in summer to save the population.But damage to the cetacean population has already been done. Dolphins in the zone are already behaving in ways scientifically consistent with a dying population, conservation groups say.“The dolphins have already changed their reproductive pattern; they are giving birth faster. This is a sign just before extinction,” Essemlali added.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841581,Jury convicts 3 of murder in death of rapper XXXTentacion,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Three men were found guilty of first-degree murder on Monday in the 2018 killing of star rapper XXXTentacion, who was shot outside a South Florida motorcycle shop while being robbed of $50,000.Michael Boatwright, 28, Dedrick Williams, 26, and Trayvon Newsome, 24, were also convicted of armed robbery by a jury that rendered its verdict less than an hour after beginning its eighth day of deliberations.Their sentencing, which Circuit Judge Michael Usan set for April 6, will largely be a formality; Florida law dictates a life sentence for first-degree murder convictions.The defendants, two dressed in suits and one in a button-down shirt, showed little emotion as they stood one by one to be handcuffed by a bailiff. There was no audible reaction from family members and other observers in the courtroom. Before the verdicts were read, Usan warned that anyone who caused any kind of disruption would be held in contempt of court.The Broward State Attorney’s Office thanked the jurors and prosecutors in a statement but said it would not comment further until the sentencing.Williams' attorney, Mauricio Padilla, told The Associated Press that he doesn't feel his client was afforded a fair trial. He noted that a crucial defense witness was stricken and that he was prohibited from deposing a key witness. Phone messages were left with attorneys representing Boatright and Newsome.“It is obvious from the days the jury was deliberating that they had questions and I only wish I would have been able to properly defend my client,” Padilla said in an email.During the monthlong trial, prosecutors linked Boatwright, Williams and Newsome to the June 18, 2018, shooting outside Riva Motorsports in suburban Fort Lauderdale through extensive surveillance video taken inside and outside the store, plus cellphone videos the men took showing them flashing fistfuls of $100 bills hours after the slaying.Prosecutors also had the testimony of a fourth man, Robert Allen, a former friend of the defendants who said he participated in the robbery. He pleaded guilty last year to second-degree murder. He has not been sentenced pending the conclusion of this trial. He could get anywhere between time served, meaning he could soon be released, and life, depending partly on how much weight prosecutors give to his assistance.Defense attorneys accused Allen of being a liar who was motivated by his desire to avoid a life sentence. They also said prosecutors and detectives did a poor investigation that didn’t look at other possible suspects, including the Canadian rap star Drake; he and XXXTentacion had an online feud.Boatwright was identified as the primary shooter. Twice last week, the jury asked to review 17 text messages that prosecutors said he sent to various people from the time he woke up about 10:30 a.m. until 3 p.m., about an hour before the shooting. He then stopped texting for about two hours.About an hour after the shooting, Boatwright sent a text saying, “Tell my brother I got the money for the new phone."" Minutes after that, he sent someone a screenshot of a news story saying XXXTentacion had been shot, prosecutors said.XXXTentacion, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, had just left Riva Motorsports with a friend when an SUV swerved in front of him and blocked his BMW.Surveillance video showed two masked gunmen emerging and confronting the 20-year-old singer at the driver’s window, and one shot him repeatedly. They then grabbed a Louis Vuitton bag containing cash XXXTentacion had just withdrawn from the bank, got back into the SUV and sped away. The friend was not harmed.Newsome was accused of being the other gunman. Williams was accused of being the driver of the SUV, and Allen of being inside the vehicle.Allen testified that the men set out that day to commit robberies and went to the motorcycle shop to buy Williams a mask. There they spotted the rapper and decided to make him their target. Allen and Williams went inside the shop to confirm it was him. They then went back to the SUV they had rented, waited for XXXTentacion to emerge and ambushed him, according to testimony.The rapper, who pronounced his name “Ex ex ex ten-ta-see-YAWN,” was a platinum-selling rising star who tackled issues including prejudice and depression in his songs. He also drew criticism over bad behavior and multiple arrests, including charges that he severely beat and abused his girlfriend. —-This story has been edited to correct that jurors asked for the text messages from Boatwright last week, not this week.—-Associated Press reporter Terry Spencer contributed to this report.",2023/03/21,,World

Alcaraz, a 19-year-old from Spain who first ascended to No. 1 by winning the U.S. Open in September, didn't drop a set in the hard-court tournament.Djokovic has spent more weeks at No. 1 than any man or woman in tennis history.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841583,AP source: Lions agree to 1-year deal with Gardner-Johnson,"The Detroit Lions have agreed to an $8 million, one-year deal with safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson, according to a person familiar with the situation.The person spoke Monday to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement had not been announced.Detroit landed some much-needed defensive backs last week, adding cornerbacks Cameron Sutton and Emmanuel Moseley and took another step in revamping the secondary by acquiring Gardner-Johnson.Gardner-Johnson reunites with Lions coach Dan Campbell and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn after playing for them in New Orleans. He had a career-high six interceptions last season with the Philadelphia Eagles after picking off five passes over three years with the Saints.Earlier in the day, the Lions announced they signed offensive lineman Graham Glasgow and re-signed kicker Michael Badgley and safety C.J. Moore to follow up a busy opening week in free agency for the franchise.Detroit drafted Glasgow out of Michigan in 2016 and he started 58 games over four seasons. He signed with Denver as a free agent in 2020 and started 33 games with the Broncos.Badgley made 20 of 24 field goals in 12 games for the Lions last season, providing desperately needed stability at the position.

She said he had left their second-floor apartment in a Damascus suburb on Sunday morning, as he regularly did, and within less than a minute, she heard a crackling noise coming from the outside.“They were waiting for him. He was killed with a weapon equipped with silencer,” al-Aswad’s wife, who identified herself as Um Abdul-Rahman, told The Associated Press.Al-Aswad was buried at the Martyrs Cemetery in the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk on the southern edges of Damascus.The wife said she checked the stairs after hearing the crackling but saw nothing. After 45 minutes she received a call from people asking about him and when she looked from the window she saw her husband's body lying in their backyard.“He appeared as if he was sleeping,"" she said. The 29-year-old woman said the couple have two daughters and one son.There was no statement from Israel on al-Aswad's killing .The Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the family had settled in Syria in 1948 after Israel was created. The group said al-Aswad joined the organization as a young man.In 2019, Israeli warplanes fired missiles at the Damascus home of Akram Ajouri, a member of Islamic Jihad’s leadership living in exile. Ajouri was not harmed, but his son was reportedly killed in the attack.Last month, an airstrikes on residential areas in Damascus that Syrian officials said killed at least five people were attributed to Israel. The Israeli military declined to comment on whether they had carried out the strike.The militant group had warned Israel in a statement there would be “a decisive response without delay to any assassination attempt (on) the leaders of the resistance.”Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of Syria in recent years, including attacks on the Damascus and Aleppo airports, but it rarely acknowledges or discusses the operations.Israel has acknowledged, however, that it targets bases of Iran-allied militant groups, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has sent thousands of fighters to support President Assad’s forces.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841585,"Biden issues first veto, taking on new Republican House","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden issued the first veto of his presidency Monday in an early sign of shifting White House relations with the new Congress since Republicans took control of the House in January — a move that serves as a prelude to bigger battles with GOP lawmakers on government spending and the nation's debt limit.Biden sought to kill a Republican-authored measure that would ban the government from considering environmental impacts or potential lawsuits when making investment decisions for people's retirement plans. In a video released by the White House, Biden said he vetoed the measure because it “put at risk the retirement savings of individuals across the country.”His first veto represents a more confrontational approach at the midway of Biden's term in office, as he faces a GOP-controlled House that is eager to undo parts of his policy legacy and investigate his administration and his family. Complicating matters for Biden, several Democratic senators are up for re-election next year in conservative states, giving them political incentive to put some distance between them and the White House.The measure vetoed by Biden would have effectively reinstated a Trump-era ban on federal managers of retirement plans considering factors such as climate change, social impacts or pending lawsuits when making investment choices.The veto could also help calm some anger from environmentalists who have been upset with the Biden administration for its recent decision to greenlight the Willow oil project, a massive and contentious drilling project in Alaska.“The president vetoed the bill because it jeopardizes the hard-earned life savings of cops, firefighters, teachers, and other workers,"" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said.But critics say so-called environmental, social and governance investments allocate money based on political agendas, such as a drive against climate change, rather than on earning the best returns for savers. Republicans in Congress who pushed the measure said environmental or social considerations in investments by the government are just another example of being “woke.”“In his first veto, Biden just sided with woke Wall Street over workers,"" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., tweeted on Monday. “Tells you exactly where his priorities lie.” He said ""it’s clear Biden wants Wall Street to use your retirement savings to fund his far-left political causes.”Biden's veto is likely to prevail. Just three Democrats in Congress — one in the House, and two in the Senate — supported Republicans in the matter, making it unlikely a two-thirds majority in both chambers could be assembled to overcome Biden's veto.Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, was the sole Democrat to back the resolution in the House, while Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., supported it in the Senate. Golden is a perennial target of Republicans seeking to oust him from his conservative district, while Tester and Manchin are both up for re-election next year.“This administration continues to prioritize their radical policy agenda over the economic, energy and national security needs of our country, and it is absolutely infuriating,"" Manchin said in a statement.Though Biden swiftly vetoed the investment resolution, other measures coming from Capitol Hill in the weeks and months ahead could be a tougher call for the White House.The administration initially signaled that Biden would reject a Republican-authored measure that would override a crime measure passed by the District of Columbia Council, but the president later said he would sign it and did so Monday. He also signed a bill directing the federal government to declassify intelligence related to the origins of COVID-19.Biden's immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, vetoed 10 bills during his term in office, while Barack Obama vetoed 12, according to the the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Both had one of their vetoes overridden by Congress.The president with the most vetoes was Franklin Delano Roosevelt — who was elected to four terms before a constitutional amendment limited all presidents to two — with 635 vetoes. Six U.S. presidents never vetoed any legislation in office.",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841605,6 missing after Montreal building fire that included Airbnb,"MONTREAL (AP) — Montreal’s mayor vowed Monday to tighten regulation of Airbnb as a search continued for six people missing after a fire swept through a building that included Airbnb units in a historic city section where they are banned.Firefighters initially thought there was one person missing in the blaze Thursday in the eastern Canadian city. However, reports emerged later of illegal Airbnb units in the more than 130-year-old building, and authorities updated the missing over the weekend to seven, including some from the United States.Montreal police reported pulling the body of a woman from the rubble Sunday evening.Montreal police Inspector David Shane said the six who are still missing are from Quebec, Ontario and the U.S., adding that investigators have contacted their families. The fire also injured nine people, including two who were hospitalized.The cause of the fire is being investigated.Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said the building included illegal Airbnb units as well as an architect’s office. Plante said Airbnb should have demanded that unit owners provide a permit number from the Quebec provincial government.“What happened here is a complete tragedy,” Plante said. “Clearly, we would not be in this position if we had been dealing with a company that took its responsibilities seriously and said to these owners ‘You don’t have a certificate, you cannot rent your unit.’” And that would force people who want to act illegally and don’t pay taxes to not escape their responsibilities.”Plante said she planned to work with the Quebec provincial government to tighten regulations on short-term rentals.Firefighters have said several apartments in the building were being used as Airbnb rentals, and police they didn’t know how many of the missing were tourists. San Francisco-based Airbnb is “washing its hands” of the problem of illegal rentals in cities across Quebec, Plante said.Nathan Rotman, Airbnb's regional policy lead for Canada, said in a emailed statement: “We are assisting law enforcement as they investigate. We are also engaged with the mayor’s office.""Alexandre Bergevin, a lawyer for the building’s owner — Emile-Haim Benamor — said on Sunday that Airbnb rentals in the building were not being operated by his client but by tenants, adding that steps had been taken to stop the practice.Montreal fire operations chief Martin Guilbault said firefighters would begin dismantling the second and third floors of the building Monday.Shane said the police force’s fire unit used a drone to help locate the body of the woman that was removed Sunday.“The assumption is that there are six more people inside,” Shane said. “The different steps we’ve taken (suggest) these people who are still missing are probably in the rubble, unfortunately.”City officials said Airbnb-style, short-term rentals are illegal in the Old Montreal neighborhood where the building is located. The fire took place at the Édifice William-Watson-Ogilvie, built in 1890, the city said.Bergevin said in a text message Sunday that the alarm system had been replaced in 2019 and was regularly tested.Shane said no one has been charged in connection with the fire and that the cause remains under investigation.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841606,Dominican police arrest 19 in high-profile corruption case,"SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — Authorities in the Dominican Republic have arrested 19 people in a sweeping corruption case that accuses a well-known former presidential candidate and three former officials of embezzling nearly $350 million and illegal campaign financing.The arrests are the latest in a string of investigations that officials have launched in the past two years as part of a crackdown on rampant government corruption in the Caribbean country.Among those detained Saturday night is Gonzalo Castillo, a former public works minister who won 37% of the vote when he ran as presidential candidate for the Dominican Liberation Party in the 2020 general elections won by current President Luis Abinader.Also arrested is a former treasury minister, Donald Guerrero; former comptroller general, Daniel Omar Caamaño; and former administrative minister to the presidency, José Ramón Peralta.Prosecutors said they are accused of paying bribes, laundering assets and illegally financing the previous electoral campaign on an “unprecedented” scale after embezzling $347 million of government funds.The suspects were charged after authorities launched 40 raids targeting their properties and businesses in the capital of Santo Domingo and beyond.Hundreds of Castillo supporters gathered Monday outside the Justice Palace to protest his arrest as they waved the party's purple-and-yellow flag and tried to damage the building before police scattered the crowd with tear gas. Meanwhile, officials with the Dominican Liberation Party questioned the impartiality of prosecutors and accused them of only investigating and arresting former government officials and not looking into corruption allegations against Abinader's current administratoin.“It is clear that behind these actions, there are markedly political and re-election interests,"" said Charlie Mariotti, the party's secretary general.Police on Saturday also arrested the former director of the State Sugar Council, Luis Miguel Piccirilo; former director of the National Cadastre, Claudio Silva Peña; and the former directors of Casinos and Gambling, Oscar Chalas Guerrero and Julián Omar Fernández.Defense attorneys for the accused could not be immediately reached for comment. The suspects were expected to appear in court Monday.Last year, authorities arrested Jean Alain Rodríguez, the country’s former attorney general, and other suspects accused of diverting government funds in an unrelated case.One of Abinader's promises in the 2020 campaign was to appoint an independent attorney general to fight corruption and impunity. He selected Miriam Germán Brito, a former judge held in high regard.Since then, various high-ranking government officials tied to former President Danilo Medina have been arrested, along with two of his siblings.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841607,Georgetown hires Providence’s Ed Cooley as basketball coach,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Ed Cooley is the new men’s basketball coach at Georgetown, hired away from Big East rival Providence in the hopes of rebuilding a once-proud program that dropped to new lows under former star player Patrick Ewing.Georgetown announced the move on Monday, after Providence issued a news release saying that Cooley had resigned.“I plan on hitting the ground running, getting to work on the court and cultivating relationships in and around the District,” Cooley said in a statement released by his new employer. “Accepting this opportunity with Georgetown is not a decision I took lightly.”He leaves the Friars with a 242-153 record after 12 years and seven March Madness appearances with a total of three wins in the tournament; the highlight was a trip to the Sweet 16 in 2022. His team went 21-12 this season, closing with four consecutive losses, including in the first round of the Big East Tournament against Connecticut and the first round of the NCAA Tournament against Kentucky.“Coach Cooley is a mentor to young men, and a consistent winner with an impressive body of work,” Georgetown athletic director Lee Reed said. ""His previous experience gives him an understanding of our Jesuit values and I am confident that he is the coach to return our program to prominence within the Big East and nationally.”Cooley’s name was linked to the Georgetown job even as Providence's season was still in progress, and so he was asked after the 61-53 defeat against Kentucky on Friday whether he would be returning. The initial reply: “Next question.”When a follow-up query came about whether there was a chance that was his last game with the Friars, Cooley avoided a direct answer.“There’s all kinds of rumors and speculation, and I know you guys are trying to do your job. I get it,” said Cooley, whose daughter is a student at Georgetown. “But after a game like this, I just think it’s fair to talk about our players. I think it’s fair to talk about the game.”The Hoyas will be the 53-year-old Cooley’s third team as a college head coach; before Providence, he was at Fairfield for five seasons. He is the first Georgetown head coach in about a half-century without a direct tie to the late John Thompson Jr., who took the job in 1972, was in charge of the team when Ewing was a player, then was succeeded by assistant Craig Esherick, who was followed by Thompson's son, John III, who gave way to Ewing.Ewing was fired on March 9 after going 75-109 in six seasons, 13-50 over the past two. Georgetown made only one March Madness appearance in that time, bowing out in the first round in 2021.It was quite a difficult stretch for Ewing and the school he led to a national championship in 1984 and helped make two other runs to the title game.His last two contests in charge at his alma mater were a pair of losses by a combined 72 points, one to close the regular season against Creighton and one in the Big East Tournament against Villanova.___ March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841608,Idaho poised to allow firing-squad executions in some cases,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Idaho is poised to allow firing squads to execute condemned inmates when the state can't get lethal-injection drugs, under a bill the Legislature passed Monday with a veto-proof majority.Firing squads will be used only if the state cannot obtain the drugs needed for lethal injections — and one death row inmate has already had his scheduled execution postponed multiple times because of drug scarcity.The move by Idaho lawmakers is in line with those by other states that in recent years have scrambled to revive older methods of execution because of difficulties obtaining drugs required for longstanding lethal injection programs. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly have barred executioners from using their drugs, saying they were meant to save lives, not take them.Idaho Republican Gov. Brad Little has voiced his support for the death penalty but generally does not comment on legislation before he signs or vetoes it.Only Mississippi, Utah, Oklahoma and South Carolina currently have laws allowing firing squads if other execution methods are unavailable, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. South Carolina’s law is on hold pending the outcome of a legal challenge.Some states began refurbishing electric chairs as standbys for when lethal drugs are unavailable. Others have considered — and at times, used — largely untested execution methods. In 2018, Nevada executed Carey Dean Moore with a never-before-tried drug combination that included the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. Alabama has built a system for executing people using nitrogen gas to induce hypoxia, but it has not yet been used.During a historic round of 13 executions in the final months of Donald Trump’s presidency, the federal government opted for the sedative pentobarbital as a replacement for lethal drugs used in the 2000s. It issued a protocol allowing firing squads for federal executions if necessary, but that method was not used.Some lawyers for federal inmates who were eventually put to death argued in court that firing squads actually would be quicker and cause less pain than pentobarbital, which they said causes a sensation akin to drowning.However, in a 2019 filing, U.S. lawyers cited an expert as saying someone shot by firing squad can remain conscious for 10 seconds and that it would be “severely painful, especially related to shattering of bone and damage to the spinal cord.”President Joe Biden’s attorney general, Merrick Garland, ordered a temporary pause on federal executions in 2021 while the Justice Department reviewed protocols. Garland did not say how long the moratorium will last.Idaho Sen. Doug Ricks, a Republican who co-sponsored that state's firing squad bill, told his fellow senators Monday that the state's difficulty in finding lethal injection drugs could continue “indefinitely” and that he believes death by firing squad is “humane.”“This is a rule of law issue — our criminal system should work and penalties should be exacted,” Ricks said.But Sen. Dan Foreman, also a Republican, said firing-squad executions would traumatize the people who who carry them out, the people who witness them and the people who clean up afterward.“I've seen the aftermath of shootings, and it's psychologically damaging to anybody who witnesses it,” Foreman said. “The use of the firing squad is, in my opinion, beneath the dignity of the state of Idaho.”The bill originated with Republican Rep. Bruce Skaug, prompted in part by the state's inability to execute Gerald Pizzuto Jr. late last year. Pizzuto, who now has terminal cancer and other debilitating illnesses, has spent more than three decades on death row for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors.The Idaho Department of Correction estimates it will cost around $750,000 to build or retrofit a death chamber for firing squad executions.Agency Director Jeff Tewalt last year told lawmakers there would likely be as many legal challenges to planned firing squad executions as there are to lethal injections. At the time, he said he would be reluctant to ask his staffers to participate in a firing squad.Both Tewalt and his former co-worker Kevin Kempf played a key role in obtaining the drugs used in the 2012 execution of Richard Albert Leavitt, flying to Tacoma, Washington, with more than $15,000 in cash to buying them from a pharmacist. The trip was kept secret by the department but revealed in court documents after University of Idaho professor Aliza Cover sued for the information under a public records act.Kempf was promoted to lead the Correction Department two years later and now is the executive director of the Correctional Leaders Association. He said the execution process is always challenging for all involved, including victims' relatives. Those challenges could be amplified in firing squad executions, he said.“I've got to say at the same time, my thoughts go to staff members that may have to carry out something, per law, that looks like putting someone to death,” Kempf told the AP during a phone interview earlier this month. “That is nothing I would assume any correctional director would take lightly, asking someone-slash-ordering someone to do that.”Biden pledged during his campaign to work at ending the death penalty nationwide, but he has remained silent on the issue as president. Critics say his hands-off approach risked sending a message that he’s OK with states adopting alternative execution methods.___Tarm contributed from Chicago.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841609,$9.25 million settlement announced in 2020 protest lawsuits,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia officials announced a $9.25 million settlement Monday with hundreds of people over several lawsuits challenging the police response to the protests and civil disorder in 2020 after George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police.Officials said the money will be distributed among 343 plaintiffs in connection with police actions during the protests that erupted in west Philadelphia and along Interstate 676 in the city center that spring. In addition, a grant will provide $500,000 to $600,000 for mental health counseling for west Philadelphia residents.Videos of Philadelphia police firing tear gas on June 1, 2020, at dozens of protesters trapped on I-676 by SWAT team officers on both sides — many unable to retreat to an on-ramp and clambering to get up a steep embankment and over a concrete wall and fence — were spread widely on social media.Attorneys suing over events the day before in and around a west Philadelphia business corridor that is the heart of a predominantly Black neighborhood said witnesses reported residential communities turned into a war zone, with tanks traveling on side streets ""chasing residents into their homes and indiscriminately firing canisters of tear gas at them.”Mayor Jim Kenney and Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw faced harsh criticism in two audits of the planning and response to the protests, which included multiple clashes, the burning of police cars and instances of opportunistic thefts and vandalism in business districts. One review cited failures in planning that researchers said led to short staffing, emotional responses from officers and sometimes excessive uses of force.Kinney told WCAU-TV he hoped the settlement would “continue the healing process” following the pandemic, racial injustice, civil unrest and Donald Trump's presidency.“We've been through the wringer, and if this can bring us to a point where we can continue to heal, it's worth it,” Kinney said.Outlaw on Monday called the mass demonstrations in Philadelphia and across the nation following Floyd's death “unprecedented in scope” but said her department was “a learning organization.""""Along with city, state, and community stakeholders, we will continue to work non-stop towards improving what we as police do to protect the First Amendment rights of protestors, keep our communities and officers safe, and to ultimately prove that we are committed to a higher standard,” Outlaw said in a statement.Officials also said the city two years ago ended its participation in a federal program that allows distribution of surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies. Shortly afterward, all of the equipment received under that program was returned, a city spokesperson said.“There should be no place for militarizing a police department that is supposed to serve its citizens,” attorney Charles McLaurin of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said Monday.Some of the plaintiffs cited lingering injuries and health effects due to tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and the zip-ties used in their arrests. Many of the speakers said the settlement will not end their efforts and vowed to seek far-reaching reforms of police operations and conduct.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841610,Austin Reaves rising to challenges in Lakers' playoff push,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — When the Los Angeles Lakers reached the final minutes of a tight game they desperately needed to win, the player with the ball in his hands on every possession Sunday night wasn't one of their superstars, but an undrafted second-year reserve guard who has made a career out of surpassing expectations.Austin Reaves took over, scoring the Lakers' last 10 points during the final 93 seconds of a 111-105 win over the Orlando Magic that breathed life into Los Angeles' flickering playoff hopes while LeBron James is out with a foot injury.Reaves ended up with a career-high 35 points, and Lakers fans serenaded him with chants of “M-V-P! M-V-P!” each time he stepped to the free-throw line down the stretch.“It's special,” Reaves said. “I grew up a Lakers fan, so to do it for this organization especially is surreal. Sometimes I’ve got to stop and really think about what I am doing. Obviously, I think all the odds were stacked against me from where I’m from.""Reaves has become something more than another interesting find by the Lakers' scouting department: The unsung prospect from rural Arkansas who played more baseball than basketball growing up is now a versatile, vital part of Los Angeles' rotation. He's in line for a huge pay raise in free agency this summer — after he helps the Lakers into the playoffs, he hopes.“He carried us tonight with his play,” Anthony Davis said after Reaves added six rebounds and six assists while hitting nine of his 14 shots against Orlando. “He got whatever he wanted, pick-and-rolls, 3s, got to the line 18 times. We know what we have in Austin. We’re very confident in him.”Reaves became only the seventh player in franchise history to score at least 35 points in a reserve role, but the way he got his points was particularly impressive. Driving to the hoop and shooting with confidence, he also repeatedly baited the Magic into fouls and then made 16 of his 18 free throws, both career highs.“He gets a lot of those calls,” Davis said. “Me and Bron joke about it, like, ‘Man, we wish we could get some of those.’ As a guard, he’s able to — I don’t want to say manipulate the game — but to see how the game is being called and use it to his advantage, like guys who get a lot of free throws.”Reaves said he has studied how James Harden and Trae Young draw fouls and attempted to incorporate their strategies into his game. Between his penchant for getting fouled and his physical approach on defense, Reaves regularly ends up moderately bloodied or bruised after games.Reaves sees it as a way to help the Lakers without relying on superior strength or world-class speed. Lakers coach Darvin Ham calls him a daredevil, while James describes him as fearless.“I’ve said many times I’m not the most athletic person in the world,” Reaves said. “I’m not the best at anything, but I think I’m really good at a lot of things.”Reaves jokes about his limited athletic ability, yet he would be the most athletic person in almost any room in the world — except the room where he spends most of his life.And basketball is in his blood: Both of his parents were accomplished players at Arkansas State, his mother a high-scoring 6-footer and his father a playmaking guard. He grew up idolizing Kobe Bryant, his grandmother's favorite player.He was modestly recruited out of high school, and he headed to the pros after five years in college at Wichita State and Oklahoma. He started out on a two-way contract with the Lakers last season but played his way into a firm NBA role as a rookie.Reaves will be a restricted free agent this summer, and Lakers fans are already fretting about his future two years after they lost Alex Caruso, another undrafted find who played his way into a major role on the 2020 championship team. Los Angeles allowed Caruso to leave for Chicago apparently to avoid adding to its luxury tax bill, even though Caruso said he would have given a discount to stay.The Lakers can match any contract offer given to Reaves, and it's clear how their superstars feel about him: James cheered for Reaves' big finish from the bench before tweeting about Reaves postgame: “You toooooo TOUGH!!”Reaves smiled when he was shown the tweet, briefly looking like a star-struck Lakers fan once again.“I felt like there was a really good chemistry IQ-wise from day one,” Reaves said of his bond with James. “Stuff like that (tweet) means a lot to me. Looking back in 20 years when I’m hopefully retired, playing golf every day, I can tell my kids, my grandkids.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841611,Pay transparency is spreading. Here's what you need to know,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. employers are increasingly posting salary ranges for job openings, even in states where it’s not required by law, according to analysts with several major job search websites.Following new legislation in New York City, California, Washington, Colorado, and elsewhere, employers across the country are becoming more transparent about pay in order to stay competitive with companies in states that require employers to post salary ranges, experts say. A tight labor market and significant increase in remote work have also contributed to the rise.The number of U.S. job postings that include salary information more than doubled between February 2020 and February 2023, from 18.4% to 43.7%, according to a new report from job search site Indeed.Salary visibility is lowest in the southern U.S., which accounted for 18 of the 20 least transparent metro areas, and highest in the western part of the country, which tends to have more regulation.Advocates say it’s a trend that benefits women and people of color, who statistically fare less well in hiring negotiations.Rather than placing the responsibility on the job-seeker or employee to determine how their pay compares to coworkers, and what fair compensation might be, the laws shift that expectation to the employer.Kate Bahn, chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, says that means employers have less of an upper hand in determining pay. Laws that forbid employers from asking potential hires about salary history in recent years do similar work.In 2021, the median pay for full-time women workers was about 83% of men’s pay, according to federal data, and women make less than their male counterparts in nearly all fields. Black women make 64 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, according to a report by the National Partnership for Women and Families. Latina women make 54 cents and Native American women 51 cents.Keegan Vance Forte, 37, a freelancer based in Jersey City, New Jersey, is looking for a permanent position either in New York or New Jersey. She said she’s noticed more salary listings for open roles in both states during the past several months than she did when job hunting in the past. (New Jersey does not have a law requiring transparency. New York City’s law, which requires employers to post a good-faith salary range with every posting, took effect in November.)“I’m still getting used to it,” she said. “When I see a salary posting with a job listing, my eyes widen.”In the past decade, Forte has held roles in business development, marketing and company partnerships, and she says knowing the available range is helpful to avoid wasting both her time and the hiring manager's.“Instead of dancing around the elephant-in-the-room question at the end, you at least know you're playing in the same ballpark,” she said.Previously, Forte has spent weeks interviewing for a position only to discover the salary wasn't in an acceptable range for her.“Over a career, that can be very time consuming,” she said.Daniel Zhao, lead economist for job site GlassDoor, said that compliance with the new laws requiring disclosure is already strong in New York City, California, and Washington, and even stronger in Colorado, which has had a law mandating transparency in effect since 2019.“The additional compliance in Colorado implies it will improve in the other states,” he said. “And what we're really noticing is that, since the laws have taken effect, more employers have decided to share salaries nationwide.”Major companies including Microsoft, CitiGroup, and Google have publicly committed to posting salary ranges for all jobs across the country, rather than only in the states where it's legally required.“Companies that are not necessarily in locations that now have laws — they're disclosing that information anyway,"" said Vicki Salemi, a career expert at job site Monster. “It's becoming more of the norm because job-seekers are expecting it.”Salemi, who also previously worked as a recruiter, said employers tend to compete for job candidates across state lines, including neighboring states that have different laws.“That means it's in their best interest to start sharing their own ranges, so the job seekers can compare apples to apples,"" she said. ""It's a virtuous feedback loop.”She called the new laws a “game-changer” in reducing the taboo around discussing pay.In New York City, the NYC Commission on Human Rights is early in its enforcement efforts. But Jose Rios Lua, the commission's executive director of communications, said that the new law has been “life-changing for a lot of folks.”“Before they’ve gone through what could turn out to be a long application process, they know the salary range, so they know if a position is worth pursuing,” he said. “For those in lower-earning jobs, it might mean the difference from living paycheck to paycheck.""A provision of New York City's law also gives companies 30 days to rectify any violation in a job posting — whether that's listing an overly broad salary range or not having a range at all. It's an unusual grace period.In the first few months, the commission has seen that both employers and prospective employees have been “vigilant about job postings,” he said.Any member of the public can come to the commission and file an inquiry. If a company repeatedly violates the law, they will be subject to penalties including fees. Anyone who encounters a business not complying with the new salary transparency law can file an inquiry at the commission website.The law is also proving illuminating for some employees who weren’t necessarily looking for new jobs.Kimberly Nguyen, 25, a UX copywriter in a contract role at CitiGroup, noticed a job posting for a comparable role, but as a full-time employee with a significantly higher salary range. She shared it with her fellow contracted copy-writers and tweeted about it. The group brought it to their managers to try to negotiate for higher pay. Nguyen said they're still waiting.“They told us it's out of their hands, and there's nothing they can do,” she said. “The managers said they hadn't even realized the job had been posted.”A spokesperson for CitiGroup said Citi pays the contracting company that employs Nguyen a market-competitive rate for their services, and that the contractor negotiates individual pay rates. The spokesperson said Citi is hiring for a full-time role for an employee with five to eight years of experience, more than Nguyen has, and the salary range reflects that.Nguyen's experience shows the limits of pay transparency in a highly contracted workforce. For now, she says she's looking for full-time roles with higher pay at other companies, while still advocating for pay increases for contracted workers at Citi. She said she supports pay transparency and sees it as a tool for pay equity.“It’s a hill I’m willing to die on, but I also have to pay rent,” she said.___The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841612,It’s the first day of spring: Here’s what that really means,"NEW YORK (AP) — Spring has sprung!Monday marked the spring equinox — at least for those in the Northern Hemisphere.But what does that actually mean?WHAT IS THE SPRING EQUINOX?As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle.For most of the year, the Earth’s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun’s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.During the equinox, the Earth’s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That’s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time — though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.The spring — or vernal — equinox can land on March 19, 20 or 21, depending on the year. This year it landed on Monday at 5:24 p.m. Eastern time.WHY ARE THERE TWO KINDS OF SPRINGS?There are two different ways to carve up the year: Meteorological and astronomical seasons.Meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles.By that calendar, spring already started on March 1, and will run until May 31.But astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun.Equinoxes, when the sun lands equally on both hemispheres, mark the start of spring and autumn. Solstices, when the Earth sees its strongest tilt toward or away from the sun, kick off summer and winter.WHAT TO EXPECT NOW THAT SPRING IS HERE?For those north of the equator, daylight will keep stretching longer— with earlier sunrises and later sunsets — until the summer solstice in June. The new season signals warmer weather, budding plants and migrating animals.The Southern Hemisphere will see the opposite: Days will keep getting shorter as this half of the planet heads out of summer and into autumn.According to the U.S. government's national outlook for the season, this spring is expected to bring wet weather that will continue to ease drought conditions in the western parts of the country. Melting snowpack may also bring flood risks in the Midwest.Much of the southern and eastern U.S. may see warmer than usual temperatures this spring, while parts of the Great Basin and northern Plains will likely be chillier than average.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841613,"LSU coach: Skenes so hot, he could handle big-league batters","Paul Skenes put up numbers impressive enough last season to earn Mountain West Conference co-pitcher of the year and some All-America honors.So far this season, he's the most dominant pitcher in the country and doing it under the hot spotlight of LSU and the Southeastern Conference.After throwing 6 1/3 scoreless innings in a 9-0 win over Texas A&M on Friday, the big right-hander has won all five of his starts and has a nation-leading 59 strikeouts against four walks in 30 1/3 innings.His 0.53 walks and hits per innings pitched is best in the nation, his 17.51 strikeouts per nine innings rank second, and opposing hitters are batting just .115 against him.“He could do it against a major league lineup right now and I believe that,” LSU coach Jay Johnson said.Skenes grew up in Lake Forest, California, and three of his uncles served in the armed forces. He initially wanted to do the same, but he said before the season that he changed his mind last year and wanted to pursue a professional baseball career.Skenes was drawn to LSU so he could be tutored by Wes Johnson, the former Minnesota Twins pitching coach who left at midseason last year to take the same job at LSU.Texas A&M coach Jim Schlossnagle said Skenes ranks with Stephen Strasburg and Mark Prior as the best college pitchers he's seen in his 33 years in coaching.Schlossnagle offered that opinion after watching Skenes strike out 11, walk none and give up four hits against the Aggies. Skenes retired 10 in a row during one stretch.“It’s one thing to throw 98-100 mph, but this guy is big and tall and loose, and he’s got some life to his fastball,” Schlossnagle told reporters. “He threw a couple decent change-ups. He’s a real pitcher. He’s pitching in the wrong league, I’ll tell you that. He needs to be in the American or National League.”IN THE POLLSLSU (18-2) stayed No. 1 in the polls after winning two of three on the road against Texas A&M.D1Baseball.com ranks Wake Forest (18-3) and Florida (18-4) second and third. Florida is No. 2 and Louisville (17-2) is No. 3, according to Baseball America.Collegiate Baseball newspaper ranks Louisville second and Arkansas (18-2) third.MIGHTY MIZZOUMissouri produced the biggest surprise of the weekend, sweeping three games from Tennessee and outscoring the Volunteers 23-6 in the process. The Vols had been swept only once in SEC play since the start of the 2022 season.Chandler Murphy and Rorik Maltrud combined on a three-hitter with 10 strikeouts in Friday's 9-1 win. The teams played two seven-inning games Sunday, and Austin Troesser and two relievers combined on a one-hitter with 12 strikeouts in a 7-1 win in the finale.REAL DEAL EAGLESEyebrows were raised last week when Boston College failed to crack the highly regarded D1Baseball rankings. The Eagles couldn’t be denied after taking two of three at nationally ranked Florida State. They’re No. 16 in the D1Baseball poll, 14-3 for the first time in program history and 4-2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference for the first time since joining the league two decades ago.STEAL FESTVMI tied the NCAA record for stolen bases in an inning when it swiped eight in the first inning of a 15-4 win over Norfolk State on Sunday. The previous team to steal that many in an inning was FIU, against Florida A&M in 1993.The Keydets' 13 steals for the game set the school record.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841614,Hornets' Ball anticipates being ready for training camp,"CHARLOTTE, N.C (AP) — Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball said he anticipates being ready for training camp in September after suffering through an injury-plagued 2022-23 season in which he sprained his left ankle three times and fractured his right ankle, all of which limited him to 36 games.Whether he’ll consider wearing ankle braces moving forward remains to be seen.“It’s tough,” Ball said Monday. “I mean probably annoying just going through it, but I’m still alive and stuff like that, so you can’t really be too mad. Just go through the rehab, do that whole process and try to come out on top.”Ball, wearing a walking boot on his right foot and leaning on crutches, spoke to reporters for the first time since undergoing season-ending surgery on his broken right ankle on March 1.The Hornets had playoff expectations this season, but Miles Bridges’ legal troubles over the summer and a series of injuries to key players like Ball, Gordon Hayward, Cody Martin and Kelly Oubre Jr. wrecked the team's season.When on the court, Ball showed he was ready to take the next step in his progression after reaching the All-Star game last season.He averaged career highs in points (23.3) and assists (8.3) per game while shooting 37.6% from 3-point range, becoming the second-youngest player to record 1,000 points, assists and rebounds in NBA history behind only LeBron James.The Hornets (22-50) currently have the fourth-worst record in the league heading into Monday night's game against Indiana, and have already been eliminated from playoff contention.It marks the seventh-straight year Charlotte will miss the postseason.“Well we didn't make no playoffs and so whether I played 36 games, 25 or 50, it doesn't really matter,” Ball said. “The fact that we didn't make it... I mean, it's just kind of getting ready for the next season now.”It has been a rough year for Ball's older brother Lonzo, too.The Chicago Bulls point guard hasn't played in more than a year and a half and his agents announced last week he will have a cartilage transplant in his left knee and miss the remainder of this season. It is Lonzo Ball's third surgery on the knee in a little more than a year.LaMelo Ball, who is just 21, didn't discuss the details of his rehab schedule, saying he's not sure when he'll be allowed to walk without crutches or begin running or jumping.The repeated injuries to his ankles, which actually began in October when he stepped on Anthony Gill's foot in a preseason game against the Washington Wizards, has raised questions over whether Ball should wear ankle braces.Like many NBA players, Ball wears low tops and no ankle braces.“I haven’t really looked into that yet,"" Ball said when asked if he's considering ankle braces. ""I gotta see how I feel first when I come back. Then I will make a decision.”Ball, who has relatively thin legs, said he wants to build more overall strength in his ankles this offseason and make sure they're fully healed, including the bones that have been repaired when he came down wrong on his foot during a non-contact play on Feb. 27.“I hate milk for real but my pops always had me drinking it — cookies and milk every night,” he said with a laugh.Ball, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2020 draft, has yet to make the postseason with the Hornets, but added he still likes playing for the franchise.“Wherever I'm at I feel like I'm straight, I feel like I'm good,"" Ball said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841615,Attorneys make divergent closings in trial of Haitian mayor,"BOSTON (AP) — An attorney for three Haitian men who claimed in a U.S. lawsuit that the former mayor of their small hometown subjected his political opponents to violence and terror called the defendant “a small, petty tyrant” during closing arguments Monday.But an attorney for the defendant spent his time poking holes in the testimony of witnesses and saying the plaintiffs were motivated by money when they brought the case against Jean Morose Viliena.The case against Viliena, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who now lives in Malden, Massachusetts, shed light on the broader issue of political violence in the Caribbean nation and its ineffective judicial system.Bonnie Lau, who represents the plaintiffs, asked the jury during closings to award $35 million in compensatory and punitive damages.“We have the overwhelming weight of the evidence in our favor,"" she said.Peter Haley, Viliena's attorney, said testimony from witnesses in the civil suit being heard in U.S. District Court in Boston was inconsistent, the witnesses were associated with the plaintiffs and his client could not be held responsible for the actions of others.“There's no coherent theory of oppression,” he said.The jury went home Monday without reaching a verdict and is scheduled to resume deliberations on Tuesday.The suit was filed under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, which allows civil lawsuits to be filed in the U.S. against foreign officials who allegedly committed crimes in their homeland — if all legal avenues in their home country have been exhausted. It was filed by the Center for Justice and Accountability in San Francisco.Viliena's lawyer said his client was not involved in violence and was responsible for increased services, such as improved infrastructure and better access to medical care, while leading Les Irois. The town is populated by about 22,000 people on Haiti’s westernmost tip, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) from the capital Port-au-Prince.The original plaintiffs — David Boniface, Juders Ysemé and Nissage Martyr — lodged legal complaints against Viliena in Haiti, but even though he was taken into custody at one point, he was ultimately released and never tried. Martyr has since died and his son, Nissandère Martyr, took his place as a plaintiff.Viliena was elected as a candidate for the Haitian Democratic and Reform Movement and was backed by the Committee for Resistance in Grande-Anse, which the lawsuit said dominates regional politics through patronage, threats and armed violence.The plaintiffs said that in 2007, Viliena — a loyalist of former Haitian President Michel Martelly — began a “campaign of persecution” against Boniface, a supporter of the opposing Struggling People's Party, after he tried to defend a neighbor who the lawsuit states Viliena assaulted for piling garbage in the streetThe lawsuit alleges Viliena led a group of men armed with guns, machetes and clubs to Boniface’s home. In Boniface’s absence, his younger brother, Eclesiaste Boniface, was dragged out of the house and fatally shot by one of Viliena’s men, the lawsuit states.The lawsuit also alleges Viliena and his men beat and shot Ysemé and Nissage Martyr at a community radio station in 2008. Ysemé was blinded in one eye, while Martyr lost a leg, according to the suit.The plaintiffs also allege that Viliena’s allies burned down dozens of homes occupied by his political opponents in 2009. Even though Viliena was not present during the arson, he was heard on a cellphone giving the orders, an attorney for the plaintiffs said in court.It’s not the first time a former Haitian official has gone before an American court to answer for alleged wrongdoing in their homeland. In 2006, a New York judge ordered former Haitian strongman Emmanuel “Toto” Constant to pay $19 million in damages to three women who said they were gang-raped by paramilitary soldiers under his command.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841616,WH economic report: Money for child care would help growth,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is making the case for more government support for child care programs in an economic report that it released Monday, drawing on extensive research to say additional spending would improve kids' lives, increase the quality of early childhood schooling and enable more women to hold jobs.The analysis dovetails with President Joe Biden's political messaging as ideological lines are being drawn for the 2024 election. Democrats have sought to put a greater focus on Republican lawmakers who have restricted access to abortions in the wake of last year's Supreme Court decision and called for mandating that impoverished parents be employed in order to receive government aid.The White House Council of Economic Advisers put together the analysis on child care as part of its broader annual economic report of the president. This year's 513-page report also explores the financial dangers created by climate change, global partnerships, reforms to make college more accessible, the online economy, crypto currencies and ways to add workers to the U.S. economy that include increased levels of immigration.The administration is making a fuller case that its policies are better for overall economic growth, not just in terms of social fairness. That applies to international trade and the shift toward renewable energy sources, but programs aimed at children tend to produce long-term benefits that more than cover their price tags.“The president’s approach is that we need to be investing in our children, because we know that pays for itself multiple times over,” Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.Rouse added that government support for child care would help ensure a “robust labor force” because parents are often prevented from working due to its costs. Child care expenses can overwhelm their earnings, meaning that parents are better off staying unemployed or working part-time even if doing so can diminish their long-term earning potential. This reflects a problem in the U.S. economy that the private sector has been unable to fix on its own, leading to the Biden administration's push for greater government involvement.The analysis draws on studies showing that each dollar invested in early childhood education can produce a return of $7 to $12, if not more. The spending increases the likelihood of kids staying in school and staying employed as adults, which helps to boost economic growth, reduce crime and eventually lower their reliance on government programs. A recent study cited in the analysis shows that the benefits are intergenerational and extend to the children of those who received child care.The analysis also addresses the market failures with child care in the U.S. Not only is it expensive, but workers at child care centers are often paid so poorly that many of them leave their jobs and cause a shortage of available support. The latest Labor Department data shows that child care workers earn $17.95 an hour, about 36% less than the average non-supervisory worker in the U.S. economy.This analysis recommends greater government funding to make child care more affordable for families and also to raise the pay of workers in that sector, which would help to improve the quality of the care.Many Republicans are skeptical about the benefits of more government aid for child care, which they have criticized for being part of a cultural agenda instead of a financial one.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has argued that deficit reduction would be the better policy choice because it could help families by lowering inflation. When the Commerce Department recently announced that large computer chip manufacturers needed to offer affordable child care as part of receiving government aid, some Republican senators accused the Biden administration of social engineering.The Biden administration has portrayed those objections as a red herring, saying that investments in child care and renewing the l apsed child tax credit — it was temporarily expanded as part of his coronavirus relief legislation — would boost growth.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has told Congress that the loss of abortion rights will hurt the economic prospects of women. And in his State of the Union address last month, the president said his social policies are also focused on the economy.“Let’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work,” Biden said. “And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.”",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841620,Police: Dentist killed wife by lacing shakes with poison,"DENVER (AP) — Police believe a Colorado dentist laced his wife’s pre-workout protein shakes with arsenic and cyanide, eventually killing his spouse so he could be with a woman he was having an affair with, according to court documents.James Craig, 45, was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder Sunday, shortly after his wife died after being taken off life support during her third trip to the hospital this month. According to court records, he is being represented by the public defender's office, which does not comment on cases.Craig is scheduled to appear in court Thursday to learn whether prosecutors have decided to file charges against him.As Angela Craig languished in the hospital, with doctors unable to figure out what was wrong with her, police in the Denver suburb of Aurora allege her husband was meeting with a fellow dentist who flew in for visits with him. Police began investigating Craig after his dental practice partner and friend, Ryan Redfearn, told a nurse that Craig had ordered potassium cyanide even though they did not need it for their work, according to an arrest warrant laying out evidence gathered by investigators.After allegedly Googling questions like, “Is Arsenic Detectable in Autopsy?"" investigators believe Craig put arsenic in one of the protein shakes he routinely made for his wife for their workouts on March 6 and then, after she survived, he ordered a rush shipment of potassium cyanide that he told the supplier was needed for a surgery. Craig had asked an office manager not to open that package but another employee did, leading to its discovery and eventual disclosure to authorities, the document said.The delivery of a third substance he is accused of ordering, Oleandrin, was intercepted by authorities after they began investigating him, the document said. Oleandrin is a poisonous substance found in leaves of the oleander plant.Craig told Redfearn that he ordered the potassium cyanide for his wife and told a social worker that she had been suicidal and depressed since he asked for a divorce in December even though neither of the couple's children said anything about suicide attempts, according to the arrest affidavit.Redfearn also told investigators that Craig was on the verge of bankruptcy and had been having problems in his marriage, according to the document. Angela Craig's sister, Toni Kofoed, told police that Craig had drugged his wife about five years ago with an unknown drug because he said he planned to kill himself and did not want her to be able to save him.Kofoed believes that incident is what Craig referenced in a series of texts between Angela and James Craig about her symptoms after she first fell ill on March 6. According to the arrest affidavit, James Craig wrote: “Given our history I know that must be triggering. Just for the record, I didn't drug you. I am super worried though.""Last week, two days before Angela was declared brain dead, the woman police say he was having an affair with wrote Craig an email expressing sympathy about what he was going through, according to the document. However, she said she did not think it was right for her to mix in with those who had gathered to mourn Angela because she did not want to “conceal what I feel for you.”",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841621,Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino accepts job at St. John's,"NEW YORK (AP) — Rick Pitino is back in the Big East Conference.St. John’s hired the Hall of Fame coach Monday to boost a storied program that’s been mired in mediocrity for much of this century. The school announced that Pitino will be introduced during a news conference Tuesday at Madison Square Garden.Following a successful run at nearby mid-major Iona, the 70-year-old Pitino was plucked away to replace Mike Anderson, who was fired after four seasons in charge of the Red Storm without making the NCAA Tournament.Reports quickly surfaced that St. John's planned to target Pitino, who grew up on Long Island not far from the school's Queens campus in New York City.“Coach Pitino is one of the most brilliant minds in the history of the game and has won at the highest levels everywhere he has coached,"" athletic director Mike Cragg said in a press release. ""There is no doubt in my mind he will restore a championship-level program and culture for St. John’s Basketball.”Pitino has been to seven Final Fours and won a pair of NCAA championships, one each at Kentucky (1996) and Louisville (2013).He was dismissed at Louisville in 2017 after an FBI investigation into college basketball corruption led to allegations of NCAA violations. It was the third scandal, professional and personal, in an eight-year period with the Cardinals — but Pitino was eventually exonerated in the FBI-related case.Pitino has been coaching college basketball so long that he was on the opposing bench with Big East rival Providence when St. John's was a national power in the mid-1980s under Lou Carnesecca.Now, he's tasked with invigorating a Red Storm squad that hasn't won an NCAA Tournament game — or even reached the Big East semifinals — since 2000. The school has made only three NCAA appearances over the past two decades, the most recent coming in 2019 under Chris Mullin.During that time, through several conference reconfigurations, St. John’s has fallen behind Big East foes with similar profiles such as Villanova, Providence and Seton Hall.“One of my great coaching memories was having the distinct privilege of coaching against Lou Carnesecca and St. John’s, a Hall of Fame coach and historic program that I have always respected,” Pitino said. “It is surreal to now have this opportunity to bring St. John’s back to prominence. I’m honored, humbled and grateful.”The Red Storm went 18-15 during a turbulent 2022-23 season, including 7-13 in Big East play to finish eighth in the conference standings. They blew a 14-point lead against sixth-ranked and top-seeded Marquette in the Big East Tournament quarterfinals, ending the season with a 72-70 loss in overtime that left Anderson with a 68-56 record at St. John's, including 30-46 in Big East regular-season games.Pitino has a .740 winning percentage in 35 seasons as a college basketball head coach. He has guided five schools to the NCAA Tournament, including Boston University (1983) and Iona (2021, 2023).He took a surprising Providence team on a memorable run to the 1987 Final Four, but the 2013 national title Pitino won at Louisville (then in the Big East) was later vacated by the NCAA after an investigation found that an assistant coach paid escorts and exotic dancers to entertain players and recruits in campus dorms.After two years coaching in Greece, he got the job at Iona — a small, private Catholic school located in New Rochelle, just north of New York City. And two years ago, he said the only reason he would leave would be to retire.But his plans changed.Pitino went 64-22 in three years with the Gaels, guiding them to two regular-season titles in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and a pair of NCAA Tournament appearances. Seeded 13th this year, they led No. 4 seed UConn at halftime before getting knocked out in the first round with an 87-63 loss that snapped a 14-game winning streak.Pitino posted tweets thanking Iona administrators and “all those people who touched our lives.”“To my players, the last three years. All I can say is you know how much I love you,” he tweeted. “Follow up, I’m not sad it ended. I’m so grateful it happened.”Leading up to Iona's NCAA Tournament game this year, Pitino said he hopes he can coach for 12 more years.“But I’ll take six or seven,” he said.Pitino had two stints in the NBA, one with the New York Knicks that featured a division title and a failed stretch with the Boston Celtics that didn’t produce a playoff appearance.But in college, he's endured only one losing season (13-14 at BU in 1980-81).And now, at a time when Hall of Fame coaching contemporaries like Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim have reached the end of their road, Pitino is still going strong and getting new jobs.St. John's has the ninth-most wins among Division I teams, with 90 winning seasons in its 116-year basketball history.The school has reached two Final Fours (1952, 1985) and won the NIT a record six times — including back-to-back crowns in the 1940s when that event was often considered the country's premier postseason tournament.Anderson plans to file an arbitration lawsuit against St. John's, first reported by ESPN, over the approximately $11 million he would have been owed by the school had he not been fired “for cause.”“I vehemently disagree with the University’s decision to terminate my contract for cause. The ‘for cause’ accusation is wholly without merit and I will be aggressively defending my contractual rights through an arbitration process,"" Anderson said in a statement provided to the AP by M Group Strategic Communications CEO Jay Morakis, who confirmed the former Red Storm coach has retained attorney John Singer of Singer Deutsch to handle the case.St. John's declined to comment.___AP College Sports Writer Ralph D.

Jim Justice on Monday ordered a sweeping investigation of the State Police after he accepted the resignation of the agency's superintendent and revealed allegations of wrongdoing, including that a video camera was placed inside a women's locker room.Justice said he has appointed Jack Chambers, the deputy director of the Capitol police, as interim superintendent to replace Superintendent Jan Cahill, who had served under Justice since the governor took office in 2017. Justice said Chambers will conduct “an all-out investigation” to replace one that started last month under Cahill and was nearing its completion.One focus of the investigation will be an allegation that a State Police employee hid a video camera in the women’s locker room at a State Police facility in Kanawha County.“To me, it is absolutely not to be tolerated in any way,” Justice said.Justice did not specify when it occurred but indicated it was several years ago, perhaps before Cahill took over, and that the employee involved later died of an apparent heart attack while jogging.Justice said three troopers eventually found a thumb drive “and from that they found the video.” At least one of the troopers “jerked the thumb drive out, threw it to the floor and started stomping on it. You can't make this stuff up, can you? Now we've got law enforcement officers destroying evidence.""Justice acknowledged that “maybe we won’t be able to recover much information. Maybe many troopers are long gone. Maybe there’s no way to recover evidence. But we ought to try, because we're better than this.”A separate incident that will be investigated involved money allegedly stolen by a trooper from a man at a casino in the Charleston suburb of Nitro. The governor also said the investigation will look into an unspecified “loss of life” on Interstate 81 in the Eastern Panhandle.In the casino incident, a man was playing a video machine with a trooper close by, Justice said. As the man got up to go to the restroom, an envelope with him fell out of his seat. The trooper picked up the envelope and kept the money inside.“Basically any way you cut it, that money was stolen,” Justice said.The governor said State Police should have immediately begun a investigation, but “we didn’t do that.” The governor did not specify whether the trooper was disciplined.Justice did not provide details of the I-81 incident, including when it occurred. The governor said he has seen video of what happened and it is “very, very concerning.” An investigation is ongoing, “and Jack Chambers has to get into this as well,” Justice said.News outlets, citing information from State Police, reported a Maryland man was walking along the interstate on Feb. 12, got involved in a struggle with troopers, became unresponsive and later was pronounced dead at a hospital. Three troopers were placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation’s completion.In a November 2018 incident that Justice said “cast a dark shadow” on law enforcement, a police dashcam video showed an officer kicking and punching a handcuffed teenage boy on the ground and kneeling on his shoulder during a traffic stop in the Eastern Panhandle. State Police said the teen was involved in a crash with a sheriff’s cruiser before a pursuit ensued, his vehicle crashing again before he was apprehended. Two troopers were fired before one of them won his job back. Two sheriff’s deputies also were fired and later reinstated.Chambers served a combined 26 years with the Capitol police and State Police. The Capitol police, also known as the Division of Protective Services, was established in 1999 to provide security at the state Capitol Complex in Charleston and other state facilities.Justice said he met with Cahill at the superintendent's request Monday morning at the governor's residence, when Cahill submitted his resignation.“I stand with and behind our police on every issue up to the point in time when it goes beyond what is right,” Justice said.Before becoming superintendent, Cahill served as the sheriff in Greenbrier County, where the governor has a home and owns the posh Greenbrier resort. Before that, Cahill spent 23 years with the State Police in a variety of roles. He started as a field trooper in 1989 and retired as troop commander captain in Beckley in 2012, the year he was elected to the first of two terms as sheriff.",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841634,Venezuela's oil czar resigns amid corruption investigations,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela’s oil czar announced his resignation Monday as officials investigate alleged corruption among public officials in the state oil industry and other parts of the government.Tareck El Aissami announced his resignation on Twitter and pledged to help the investigation into any allegations involving Petroleos de Venezuela SA, commonly known as PDVSA, while also offering support to President Nicolás Maduro’s anti-corruption campaign.“... I place myself at the disposal of the leadership of the (ruling party) to support this crusade that the President @NicolasMaduro has undertaken against the anti-values that we are obliged to fight, even with our lives,” El Aissami wrote.Venezuela’s National Anti-Corruption Police last week announced an investigation into unidentified public officials in the oil industry, the justice system and some municipalities, though they did not cite PDVSA.Corruption has long been rampant in Venezuela, which sits atop the world’s largest petroleum reserves. But officials are rarely held accountable — a major irritant to citizens, the majority of whom live on $1.90 a day, the international benchmark of extreme poverty.Maduro acknowledged El Aissami’s decision in televised remarks during a gathering of governing party leaders. He said he accepted the resignation “to facilitate all the investigations that should result in the establishment of the truth, the punishment of the culprits, and justice in all these cases.”The U.S. government designated El Aissami, a powerful Maduro ally, a narcotics kingpin in 2017 in connection with activities in his previous positions as interior minister and governor. The Treasury Department alleged “he oversaw or partially owned narcotics shipments of over 1,000 kilograms from Venezuela on multiple occasions, including those with the final destinations of Mexico and the United States.”Under the government of the late President Hugo Chávez, El Aissami headed the Ministry of Internal Affairs. He was appointed minister of oil on April 2020.Attorney General Tarek William Saab in a radio interview Monday said that at least a half dozen officials, including people affiliated with PDVSA, had been arrested, and he expected more to be detained.“I assure you, even more so at this moment, when the country calls not only for justice but also for the strengthening of the institutions, we will apply the full weight of the law against these individuals,"" Saab said.Oil is Venezuela’s most important industry. A windfall of hundreds of billions in oil dollars thanks to record-high global prices allowed Chávez to launch numerous initiatives, including state-run food markets, new public housing, free health clinics and education programs.But a subsequent drop in prices and government mismanagement, first under Chávez's government and then Maduro's, ended the lavish spending. And so began a complex crisis that has pushed millions into poverty and driven more than 7 million Venezuela to migrate.PDVSA's mismanagement, and more recently economic sanctions imposed by the U.S., caused a steady production decline, going from the 3.5 million barrels per day when Chávez took power in 1999 to roughly 700,000 barrels per day last year.The U.S. government recently loosened some sanctions, even allowing oil giant Chevron for the first time in more than three years to resume production. Maduro's government has been negotiating with its U.S.-backed political opponents primarily to get the sanctions lifted.U.S. congressional researchers saw El Aissami as an impediment to Maduro's goals.“Should Al Aissami remain in that position, it could complicate efforts to lift oil sanctions,” a November report from the Congressional Research Center said.In September, Maduro's government renewed wrongdoing accusations against former oil minister, Rafael Ramírez, alleging he was involved in a multibillion- dollar embezzlement operation during the early 2010s that took advantage of a dual currency exchange system. Ramírez, who oversaw the OPEC nation’s oil industry for a decade, denied the accusations.In 2016, Venezuela’s then opposition-led National Assembly said $11 billion went missing at PDVSA in the 2004-2014 period when Ramirez was in charge of the company. In 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department accused a bank in Andorra of laundering some $2 billion stolen from PDVSA.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841635,Bad Bunny's ex-girlfriend files lawsuit seeking $40M,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Bad Bunny’s ex–girlfriend is suing the superstar for at least $40 million over a well-known voice recording she provided the singer before he became famous.Carliz De La Cruz Hernández, whose breathy “Bad Bunny, baby” recording was included in two of the artist’s songs, claimed in a lawsuit filed this month in a Puerto Rico court that her voice and the phrase she came up with are being used without her permission.The lawsuit, which was first reported by online Puerto Rico news site Noticel, notes that the phrase was used in the “Pa Ti,” song, which has more than 355 million views on YouTube and more than 235 million reproductions on Spotify. It also was used in the “Dos Mil 16” song, which has more than 60 million views on YouTube and 280 million reproductions on Spotify.The lawsuit states that De La Cruz’s “distinguishable voice” also has been used without her consent for songs, records, promotions, worldwide concerts, television, radio and social and musical platforms.“Since then, thousands of people have commented directly on Carliz’s social media networks, as well as every time she goes to a public place, about the ‘Bad Bunny, baby.’ This has caused, and currently causes, that De La Cruz feels worried, anguished, intimidated, overwhelmed and anxious,” the lawsuit states.Also sued is Noah Kamil Assad Byrne, manager for Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Martínez Ocasio.Assad and representatives of Bad Bunny did not immediately respond to a message for comment.De La Cruz and Martínez first became a couple in 2011. A year later, they began studying at the University of Puerto Rico in the north coastal town of Arecibo while also working at a nearby grocery store. The lawsuit stated that during that time, Martínez was constantly creating songs and rhythms and would seek opinions from De La Cruz, who also was in charge of scheduling his parties and handling invoices and contracts.The birth of the phrase, “Bad Bunny, baby,” came about in 2015, and Martínez asked De La Cruz to record herself saying it. She did so in a bathroom one day while staying with a friend because that's where it was least noisy and then sent it to him, the lawsuit stated.On Jan. 1, 2016, Martínez asked De La Cruz to marry him, and they made plans to do so in July 2016. But in April 2016, Rimas Entertainment signed Martínez. That same year, De La Cruz was accepted into the University of Puerto Rico’s law school, and she ended her relationship with Martínez in May 2016.They got back together in 2017, but once again went their separate paths.Then in May 2022, a Bad Bunny representative reached out to De La Cruz, saying he needed to talk to her.“In that call, (the representative) said, ’I know you don’t like to talk about Voldemort (referring to Martínez), but I need to ask you something,” the lawsuit stated.He offered her $2,000 to buy the recording of her voice. De La Cruz declined and then spoke with someone at Rimas Entertainment who also offered to buy it, saying the recording would be used in the upcoming album, “Un Verano Sin Ti,” the lawsuit stated.But a deal was never reached, and the song was published without De La Cruz’s consent, according to the lawsuit.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841636,Guatemala seeks to remove opposition candidate's immunity,"GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — A prosecutor in Guatemala asked a court Monday to lift the immunity of one of the candidates in June presidential elections, because the candidate had asked about a judge’s motive in prosecuting journalists.Candidates in Guatemala normally have immunity from being prosecuted while they are running, to ensure free elections.But on Monday government prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche asked the country’s Supreme Court to lift the immunity of candidate Edmond Mulet, because Mulet had asked for an investigation into a judge.It was the latest chapter in which Guatemala prosecutors have gone after journalists, politicians, former prosecutors and judges for having investigated corruption inside the government and judicial system.Experts, opponents and foreign governments say that, instead of going after corruption, prosecutors in Guatemala are now going after those who denounce it.“Let's see if this crazy, totally unjustified request made by the prosecutor is upheld by the Supreme Court or not,"" Mulet said Monday. “We will keep on in this process of fighting corruption and shortsightedness.”Mulet, who usually places third or fourth in polls of the presidential candidates, is the only one of them who asked for an investigation of Judge Jimi Bremer.In February, Bremer ordered the investigation of nine journalists from a newspaper whose president, a prominent government critic, has already been jailed on various charges since last year.Bremer said journalists from El Periodico newspaper should be placed under investigation to determine whether they were maliciously pursuing prosecutors, judges and other members of Guatemala’s justice system.Top prosecutor Cinthia Monterroso had argued that El Periodico published stories about complaints, disciplinary processes and questioned decisions by justice officials, including herself. She said who ordered such stories and the sources of their financing must be investigated.The U.S. government has sharply criticized the weakening of anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala under President Alejandro Giammattei.Some 30 judges, magistrates and prosecutors involved in the investigation or processing of those corruption cases have been forced to flee the country after facing legal action under the current administration.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841637,Carson Briere charged for pushing wheelchair down stairs,"Three misdemeanor charges were filed Monday against the son of Philadelphia Flyers interim general manager Danny Briere after a video posted on social media showed him and another Mercyhurst University athlete pushing an unoccupied wheelchair down a staircase.Police in Erie, Pennsylvania, filed charges of criminal mischief, criminal conspiracy to commit mischief and disorderly conduct against Carson Briere, who completed his third hockey season at Mercyhurst. Patrick Carrozzi, listed as a senior member of the school’s lacrosse team, faces the same three charges, according to documents filed with District Judge Sue Mack.The two are scheduled to appear in court on May 22.Briere and Carrozzi are seen on a surveillance video at the top of a staircase of a local bar, where they push the wheelchair down the steps on March 11. Police say their actions posed a potential danger to anyone coming up the stairs, while also creating a hazardous condition by blocking the staircase.The wheelchair’s owner, identified as Sydney Benes, filed a complaint saying the fall down the stairs damaged the left brake handle, broke the right arm rest’s plastic molding, bent a rear handle and caused the wheels to drag when moving forward. Benes said the wheelchair was purchased a year ago, costing $2,000.It’s unclear if Briere or Carrozzi have lawyers who can speak on their behalf.Briere and two other athletes were placed on interim suspension, while the school investigated the matter.A message seeking comment left with a Mercyhurst athletic department spokeswoman was not immediately returned.Last week, the 23-year-old Briere apologized in a statement released through the NHL’s Flyers.“I am deeply sorry for my behavior on Saturday,” he said. “There is no excuse for my actions, and I will do whatever I can to make up for this serious lack of judgment.”Danny Briere, who was promoted to run the Flyers after Chuck Fletcher was fired two weeks ago, said he was shocked to see his son’s actions and called them “inexcusable,” while saying his son ""accepts full responsibility for his behavior.”Mercyhurst previously released a statement saying the actions displayed in the video fall short of the school’s “belief in the inherent dignity of each person,"" adding the school’s “tradition also reminds us that students and all people who make poor choices deserve opportunities to learn, change behaviors and atone for harmful actions.”Carson Briere previously was dismissed from Arizona State’s hockey club in 2019 for what the school called a violation of team rules.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

When novelist Colson Whitehead’s award was announced, Biden noted that the author of “The Underground Railroad” and “The Nickel Boys” has already won back-to-back Pulitzer Prizes.The president, who is expected to announce for reelection this spring, quickly picked it up“Pretty good man,” he told Whitehead. “I'm kind of looking for a back-to-back myself,” he added, drawing a laugh from the audience.It was a feel-good event in the East Room, as the honorees stepped forward to receive their awards one by one. Louis-Dreyfus, who channeled Biden’s resume when she starred in “Veep,” jokingly sagged under the weight when the president placed the medal for the arts around her neck. “Wow!” she exclaimed.Springsteen, with his everyman persona, looked incongruous in a black suit. He was lauded for “his extraordinary contributions to the American songbook, and for being ‘The Boss.’"" Poet and author Richard Blanco stunned in a teal tuxedo.Knight, the “empress of soul,” gave the president a giant hug when he put the medal around her neck. Jaclyn Sallee, who received the medal on behalf of Native America Calling, a podcast and radio show, beamed with pride. So did social historian Earl Lewis, who, according to the president, chronicles African American history and “explores how diversity strengthens our nation.”Biden joked that he opens his closet to find one honoree, designer Vera Wang, inside — her clothes, anyway — then said, “Your dresses always look beautiful on my wife.”The medals are Biden’s first batch of awards for the arts and humanities and were delayed by the pandemic. The president surprised Sir Elton John with a National Humanities Medal during a White House musical event last September. He told the crowd how important their work was, in keeping American culture alive and reminding people of our history - even the parts we'd like to forget. The honorees work includes dance, art, design, history as well as music, writing and philanthropy.“You do make the country better, you make it a better place,” Biden told the crowd before they departed for a White House reception.The honorees did not perform or speak to the crowd after they received their awards.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841641,"Last wild Atlantic salmon can survive Maine dams, feds say","PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The federal government ruled Monday that the last wild Atlantic salmon in the country can coexist with hydroelectric dams on a Maine river, dealing a blow to environmentalists who have long sought to remove the dams.The salmon, once abundant in the U.S., now return to only a few Maine rivers. One is the Kennebec River, dammed by Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday that the dams are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the salmon if conservation measures are taken.Conservation measures along Brookfield's four Kennebec dams are designed to improve fish passages and will require an investment of more than $100 million by Brookfield, NOAA said. The dam upgrades would allow the salmon to swim up the Kennebec from the Atlantic Ocean to freshwater inland habitats for the first time since the construction of the dams in the 19th century, the agency said.The agency reviewed the dams because Brookfield is seeking to relicense one of them and amend the licenses for three others, said NOAA spokesperson Allison Ferreira. NOAA said in a statement that it will “oversee an extensive monitoring program to ensure that the dams meet the expectations of improved fish passage in the Kennebec River.”NOAA's opinion “is an important milestone in ensuring that these facilities can continue to support Maine’s clean energy future and traditional industries along the lower Kennebec River,” said David Heidrich, a spokesperson for Brookfield.However, environmental groups said the dams threaten extinction of the salmon, and NOAA's ruling is shortsighted. They also said the dams endanger other vulnerable species of fish, such as sturgeon.The dams' negative impacts on salmon are a violation of the Endangered Species Act, said the Kennebec Coalition, an alliance of several environmental groups supporting dam removal, in a statement. They argue that in addition to blocking access to key spawning habitat, the dams also create hazardous conditions for this fish.“Removal of these dams provides the best chance to prevent Atlantic salmon from becoming extinct, while also continuing the restoration of a vibrant, healthy Kennebec River,” the statement said.Atlantic salmon populations in the U.S. fell into the hundreds due to factors such as overfishing and habitat loss, according to NOAA. They've been listed under the Endangered Species Act for over two decades.Conservationists and Native American tribes have for years made the case that Brookfield has not fulfilled its obligations to protect the remaining salmon.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841642,Antoine Davis ends chase for Maravich's NCAA scoring record,"Antoine Davis has ended his pursuit of “Pistol” Pete Maravich's NCAA scoring record.The Detroit Mercy guard finished four points shy of breaking Maravich's mark earlier this month in a loss during the Horizon League Tournament.While it looked like Davis' college career was over when the College Basketball Invitational did not extend an invitation to the Titans, he held out hope until Monday that he would get another chance to play, possibly in an inaugural College Hoops Postseason 8.“I'm upset about it,” Davis said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. ""I feel like I got cheated out of something that they can’t ever give back to me. I think it's selfish — and weird — that people emailed or called the CBI to say we shouldn't be in the tournament because they didn't want me to break the record.“But there's nothing to hold my head down about. I still feel like I’m the best scorer in my generation, especially finishing No. 2 behind him.”The CBI, which started Saturday, posted pictures on its Twitter account of Maravich and Davis shortly after Detroit Mercy lost at Youngstown State and had talks with the school about a potential invitation. Ultimately, the CBI decided not to give the Titans (14-19) an opportunity to pay $27,500 to play in the 16-team tournament.“We did receive unsolicited emails and voicemails about Detroit Mercy and some said we don't ever want Pete Maravich's record broken,” said Rick Giles, president of the Gazelle Group that runs the CBI. “The decision we made wasn't based purely on whether we wanted him to break the record or not.”Jaeson Maravich said he did not have a personal problem with Davis, but he wasn't happy that his father's record had a chance to be broken in a lower-tier, pay-to-play college basketball postseason tournament.“I think it's a terrrible look,” Jaeson Maravich told the AP. “Your season should be over if you're 14-19.“This situation is very personal and sensitive to me. But to be clear, I'm not mad at Antoine Davis and I have nothing bad to say about Antoine Davis. My beef is with these tournaments.”In mid-March of last year, the Titans were below .500 and still played in the postseason. Davis scored 24 points in a loss to Florida Gulf Coast in The Basketball Classic, and Fresno State went on to win the tournament's championship.Maravich closed his three-season, 83-game career at LSU with 3,667 points in 1970, and his mark has stood for more than a half-century. The dazzling guard, who went on to become a five-time NBA All-Star in a 10-season career, died in 1988 at 40 after suffering a heart attack in California while playing in a pickup game.Davis scored 22 points in a 71-66 loss at Youngstown State in the 144th game of his five-year career. He missed four 3-pointers, one of them a wide-open look, in the final two minutes of his last college game.“I had opportunities to do it in the Youngstown game,” Davis said. “I can't be mad about it, but I just don't get why people would go out of their way to say we shouldn't have an opportunity.”Davis, like all NCAA athletes enrolled when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S., was granted a fifth year of eligibility.The 6-foot-1 guard does own some NCAA records, including 144 straight games with double figures in scoring and 588 career 3-pointers. He led the nation with 28.2 points per game this season and 159 3-pointers, four shy of surpassing the single-season record set by Stephen Curry at Davidson during the 2007-08 season.Detroit Mercy coach Mike Davis said his son's pursuit of the scoring championship was not the only the reason the Titans were trying to play again. He said the postseason would have given previously banged-up players a chance to play for a team that was not healthy all season.“People were trying to paint a picture of us that wasn't true,” Mike Davis said. ""The picture painted was that we were tyring to buy a record. The CBI was never going to let us in because of the backlash. The PS8 had teams pulling out, saying they wouldn't play if we were going to be in the tournament.“It's disappointing that people were calling our school president and athletic director and the people running these tournaments to say don't let us in. We just had to let it go.""___Follow Larry Lage at https://twitter.com/larrylage___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841643,New Gophers coach Plitzuweit has core freshmen 4 staying put,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The four Minnesota freshmen recruited by Lindsay Whalen all decided their loyalty to the home-state program was stronger than the disappointment of seeing their leader — and Gophers legend — depart.Now that they've got a new head coach, Amaya Battle, Mara Braun, Nia Holloway and Mallory Heyer are feeling even better about staying.When Dawn Plitzuweit was introduced as Whalen's successor at a news conference at the team's practice facility on Monday, the heralded quartet was in attendance as part of a healthy turnout from the current roster.There will be some departures, with the light of the transfer portal perpetually glowing, but as long as the Twin Cities area natives Battle, Braun, Holloway and Heyer are in place Plitzuweit will have a solid starting point.“It’s been kind of chaotic, a little sad when we first heard about coach Whay, but we understand,” Battle said. “We all committed for the reason to turn this program around and since we’ve been here we’ve all grown really close, so it’s not even just necessarily for the school, for Minnesota, but it’s for each other just as well.”Plitzuweit has a six-year contract that will pay her a base salary of $800,000, about 45% more than Whalen was making, after guiding West Virginia to the NCAA Tournament in her lone season.“What’s really special about them is they have chosen to come to the ‘U’ to represent themselves, their families, the program, our athletic department, but the entire state of Minnesota in a lot of ways,"" Plitzuweit said. “You can feel it when you’re around them.”The native of West Bend, Wisconsin, who has 16 years of experience as a college head coach and deep ties to the region, had a get-to-know-you meeting with the players on Saturday night that made a strong impression.“She just radiates energy,” Braun said.Whalen led the Gophers to the Final Four as a senior in 2004. They went to the NCAA Tournament seven times in an eight-year span from 2002 under Brenda Frese (then Oldfield) to 2009 under her successor Pam Borton, winning a total of 10 games. They reached the Sweet 16 in 2003 and 2005.Borton went just 84-79 over her last five seasons without an NCAA Tournament appearance and was fired in 2014. Marlene Stollings had three 20-win records and two NCAA Tournament appearances in four seasons, but she left for Texas Tech.That created the opening for Whalen, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member who had no previous coaching experience, five years ago. Whalen went 71-76 with Minnesota, including a 32-58 record in Big Ten play and no NCAA Tournament appearances. The Gophers tied for 12th in the Big Ten this season with a 4-12 record, their fewest wins in 12 years.Whalen’s departure was described by Minnesota athletic director Mark Coyle as a mutual decision, but it seemed like she wasn’t ready to leave. Plitzuweit said she has “tremendous respect” for Whalen during her prepared remarks.“Lindsay is one of our own, and I look forward to honoring her and all of our alumni,” she said.Coyle, who sits on the NCAA men's basketball committee and spent last weekend immersed in the selection process for the field of 68 on that side, kept an eye on the West Virginia women's games as much as he could. This hire was bound to be someone with significant experience as a head coach, and the 50-year-old with a career record of 356-141 — including time at South Dakota, Northern Kentucky and Grand Valley State — clearly has that.“The fact that she has such strong connections back here is just a huge positive,” Coyle said. “We felt it was important to find a coach who's won at a high level.”Coyle was asked if he had concern that Plitzuweit stayed at West Virginia for just one season. He said he encouraged her during the interview process by pointing out that he only stayed at Syracuse for one year, after leaving Boise State and before being hired at Minnesota.The chance to coach in the Big Ten and be closer to family was too strong to pass up.“This is home for me,” she said. “This is a dream opportunity.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World

The rule went into effect elsewhere across the country Monday.The change repeals a Trump-era rule and expands some water pollution protections to thousands of small streams, wetlands and other waterways.""Our goal is to protect public health, the environment, and downstream communities while supporting economic opportunity, agriculture, and industries that depend on clean water,"" the EPA said in a statement.Republicans have targeted the regulation in Congress and in court, where at least five federal lawsuits are challenging the EPA rule. The Supreme Court is considering a related case by an Idaho couple who have been blocked for more than 15 years from building a home near a lake after the EPA determined part of the property was a wetlands that could not be disturbed without a permit.A decision in the case, known as Sackett v.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841645,Wyoming bans transgender youth from girls' sports teams,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Wyoming has become the 19th state to ban transgender athletes from playing on girls or women's sports teams after the Republican governor opted not to veto the legislation.Gov. Mark Gordon allowed the bill to become law without his signature Friday, saying he supports and agrees with the overall goal of fairness in competitive female sports. But he also said in a decision letter that the ban “is overly draconian, is discriminatory without attention to individual circumstances or mitigating factors, and pays little attention to fundamental principles of equality.”The law, which takes effect July 1, will prohibit “students of the male sex from competing on a team designated for students of the female sex.” It's among dozens of Republican proposals pushing back against transgender rights in statehouses across the U.S., including measures to ban gender-affirming care for minors, restrict drag shows, and prevent transgender people from using restrooms, locker rooms and other facilities associated with their gender identities.Antonio Serrano, advocacy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Wyoming, said the latest development was shameful because it codifies discrimination.“It’s about erasing and excluding trans people from participation in all aspects of public life,” he said. “Inclusive teams that support all athletes and encourage participation should be the standard for all school sports.”The ACLU statement said the new law is unconstitutional and violates the Civil Rights Act, but the group has not indicated if it plans to file a lawsuit. Meanwhile, Sara Burlingame, director of Wyoming Equality, the state's largest LGBTQ advocacy organization, told the Casper Star-Tribune that a lawsuit is planned and the group has contacted local and national groups interested in joining it.The bill stipulates that if the law is suspended because of a suit, a five-member school activity commission will determine on an individual basis if transgender students are eligible to compete in gender-designated sports that don't correspond to their birth-assigned sex.The law applies to public school students in grades 7 through 12 who participate in interscholastic sports. Gordon noted in his decision letter that there are only four known transgender students competing in school athletics in the state.“This seems to call for individualized consideration, where families, students, teams, and others can thoughtfully address specific circumstances, rather than such a punitive, ostracizing broad-brush approach,” he wrote, while still allowing the bill to become law “without the benefit of my signature.”Neighboring Idaho was the first state to enact a transgender sports ban in 2020, and other states to follow suit include Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed a proposed ban for the third year in a row, but the Republican-controlled Legislature plans to try to override her within the next few weeks.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841646,"Following parents' lead, Ole Miss' McPhee-McCuin making mark","STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — The game finally decided, Gladstone McPhee's arms shot into the air and he released a scream of jubilation a long time coming for the proud father and lifelong basketball coach himself. His daughter is on the big stage now, beautifully representing the family and their homeland in The Bahamas.Yolett McPhee-McCuin remembers so well being 10 when her dad lost in a championship and cried in an empty gym. She went over and cried along with him that day.They both did so again Sunday night, this time shedding celebratory tears as Ole Miss advanced to its first Sweet 16 in 16 years.Now, with her oldest daughter that same age, McPhee-McCuin has no problem showing her own emotions for 10-year-old Yasmine and younger sister Yuri, 5. They are getting a front-row seat — literally — to mom's remarkable coaching journey that has taken her to seven different stops.“You can’t be what you can’t see, and I really believe that. So my daughters are learning how to be strong and go after dreams and also how to be a wife and how to balance,"" she said. ""I cry in front of my kids. Had we lost, my 10-year-old would have cried tonight. My 5-year-old is just living the dream right now. But my 10-year-old, she would have been an emotional wreck.”The No. 8 seed Rebels (25-8) stunned top-seeded Stanford 54-49 to extend this special March run out West.Senior Angel Baker told her coach how proud she is of her leading the program. The team's top scorer, Baker transferred from Wright State for her final two seasons to play for McPhee-McCuin. The coach is relatable to these young women: She played community college basketball then at Rhode Island, first becoming the first Bahamian woman to sign a Division I letter of intent and later the first to coach in D-I.“One of the reasons why I came to Ole Miss is I wanted to be under a coach that looked like me. I feel like Coach Yo really is a believer, a fighter, and that’s somebody who I want to represent,” Baker said. “We try our best to resemble her on the court with a lot of passion, just toughness.”Almost everyone who witnessed the Ole Miss triumph at Maples Pavilion couldn't help but feel that energy from a spirited, defensive-minded group so determined to bring this program back to national relevance.With McPhee-McCuin's Mississippi team headed to an improbable Sweet 16, she will be taking a few minutes out of game-planning to write a thoughtful note to her girls' principal: They'll be missing another week of school, “See you when I see you, because we going to Seattle,” she cracked.“Everybody asks me where I get my passion from. Man, I tell this story over and over again. My dad lost in a championship game. The gym cleared out and he cried, and I was Yasmine’s age, my 10-year-old’s age, and I remember walking over and crying with him,"" McPhee-McCuin recalled. ""That’s when I learned passion and love for the game. And so my daughter is the same way. And I don’t care if she doesn’t coach, but what she is learning, what they are learning, is let’s normalize women in leadership.”Her father sat courtside as his 40-year-old daughter and her gutsy Ole Miss gals took down the powerhouse Cardinal led by Hall of Famer and winningest women's coach Tara VanDerveer.It's been quite a cross-country path to reach this place, too. McPhee-McCuin has coached at Frank Phillips College in Texas, Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Portland and Pittsburgh. Then Clemson, Jacksonville and Ole Miss.She actually called up Ole Miss and pushed for a job. And those very administrators who gave her the chance were right there on the court with congratulatory hugs once the final buzzer sounded sealing the second-round win.“I think everyone loves a story that they can relate to. I didn’t play on Team USA. I didn’t play for the late, great, Pat Summitt. Geno didn’t endorse me,” she said of UConn coach Geno Auriemma. “Like I really got it out of the mud. Y’all, I’m an immigrant. I migrated from The Bahamas and came over here and started in junior college and worked my way up. You know how I got this job at Ole Miss? I called Ole Miss and said: ‘What are you guys doing? I’m hot and y’all could get me for cheap, and I’m recruiting my butt off with a $20,000 recruiting budget. Give me yours and watch what I do.’ So I’ve always been bold, and I also share my story with a lot of people.”She hopes to keep telling it all the way to the Final Four in Dallas. The Rebels reached their first Sweet 16 since a trip to the Elite Eight in 2007.Next up for Ole Miss is a date with fifth-seeded Louisville, which beat No. 4 Texas 73-51 on the Longhorns' home floor Monday.""I’m a right now-type person, because I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. So we’re about to party like it’s 1999 tonight, and then tomorrow, we’ll party again,"" the coach said. “And then we’ll all watch Texas ask Louisville together to see who we’re going to play and then we’ll get right back to work. When we win, we party, and then we let it go.”As this celebratory night began to wrap up, the coach’s daughters took a turn in front of the microphones in their own pretend press conference.And, with a little bit of thoughtful coaching of course, Yuri announced with glee: “We’re going to Seattle!”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World

He is also alleged to have thrown a water bottle in the direction of the assistant referee, which the FA described as improper behavior.Fulham led 1-0 before going into meltdown when Willian was sent off and United was awarded a penalty, which Bruno Fernandes converted. Marcel Sabitzer fired United in front and Fernandes added a third.Fulham has also been accused of failing to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841648,Trump indictment would be unprecedented in US history,"The decision whether to indict former President Donald Trump over hush-money payments made on his behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign lies with a Manhattan grand jury that has been hearing evidence in secret for weeks.An indictment of Trump, who is seeking the White House again in 2024, would be an unprecedented moment in American history, the first criminal case against a former U.S. president.Law enforcement officials are bracing for protests and the possibility of violence after Trump called on his supporters to protest ahead of a possible indictment.An indictment could also test a Republican Party already divided over whether to support Trump next year, in part due to his efforts to undermine his 2020 election loss.Trump denies any wrongdoing and has slammed the Manhattan district attorney's office probe as politically motivated.Here's a look at the hush-money probe, grand jury process and possible ramifications for his presidential campaign:____WHAT'S THE PROBE ABOUT?The grand jury has been probing Trump’s involvement in a $130,000 payment made in 2016 to the porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with him years earlier. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, through a shell company before being reimbursed by Trump, whose company, the Trump Organization, logged the reimbursements as legal expenses.Earlier in 2016, Cohen also arranged for former Playboy model Karen McDougal to be paid $150,000 by the publisher of the supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer, which then squelched her story in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill.”Trump denies having sex with either woman.Trump’s company “grossed up” Cohen’s reimbursement for the Daniels payment to defray tax payments, according to federal prosecutors who filed criminal charges against the lawyer in connection with the payments in 2018. In all, Cohen got $360,000 plus a $60,000 bonus, for a total of $420,000.Cohen pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance law in connection with the payments. Federal prosecutors say the payments amounted to illegal, unreported assistance to Trump’s campaign. But they declined to file charges against Trump himself.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team appears to be looking at whether Trump or anyone committed crimes in New York state in arranging the payments, or in the way they accounted for them internally at the Trump Organization.BUT CAN A FORMER PRESIDENT BE INDICTED?In a word, yes. Longstanding Justice Department policy prohibits the federal indictment of a sitting president, but Trump, two years out of office, no longer enjoys that legal shield. And the New York case is not a federal probe anyway.WHAT IS THIS GRAND JURY?A grand jury is made up of people drawn from the community, similar to a trial jury. But unlike juries that hear trials, grand juries don’t decide whether someone is guilty or innocent. They only decide whether there is sufficient evidence for someone to be charged. Grand juries exist in the federal court system and in many states.Proceedings are closed to the public, including the media. There is no judge present nor anyone representing the accused.Prosecutors call and question witnesses, and grand jurors can also ask questions. In New York, the person who could be indicted may ask for a certain witness, though it's up to grand jurors.New York grand juries have 23 people. At least 16 must be present to hear evidence or deliberate. Twelve have to agree there is enough evidence in order to issue an indictment. The grand jury may also find there is not enough evidence of a crime or direct the prosecutor to file lesser charges.Centuries-old rules have kept grand juries under wraps to protect the reputations of people who end up not being charged, to encourage reluctant witnesses to testify, to prevent those about to be indicted from fleeing and to guard against outside pressure.Grand juries have long been criticized as little more than rubber stamps for prosecutors. Former New York Judge Sol Wachtler famously said that prosecutors could convince a grand jury to “indict a ham sandwich.” Defenders of the process say it is a crucial safeguard against politically motivated prosecutions.WHO HAS TESTIFIED IN THIS CASE?One of the final witnesses being called was Robert Costello, who was once a legal adviser to Cohen, the government’s key witness in the investigation.The men have since had a falling out, and Costello has indicated that he has information he believes would undercut the credibility of Cohen and contradict his current incriminating statements about Trump.Costello contacted a lawyer for Trump saying he had information that could be exculpatory for Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss secret legal proceedings. The lawyer brought it to the attention of the district attorney’s office, which last week subpoenaed Costello’s law firm for records and invited him to testify.He was at the building where the jurors were meeting on Monday, invited by prosecutors, ensuring the grand jury had an opportunity to consider testimony or evidence that could weaken the case for indicting.Trump was also been invited to testify, but his lawyer has said the former president has no plans to participate.WHAT ABOUT THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS?Trump says charges would actually help him in the 2024 presidential contest. Longtime ally Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, said Saturday that District Attorney Bragg “has done more to help Donald Trump get elected.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, considering joining the Republican field, criticizes the Trump investigation as politically motivated, “fundamentally wrong.” But he also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a quip likely to intensify their rivalry. DeSantis said he personally doesn’t “know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair.""Comments by other potential rivals, eager to convince voters it is time to move on from the former president but also contending with the fact that he remains the most popular figure in the party:— During a Saturday visit to Iowa, former Vice President Mike Pence called the idea of indicting a former president “deeply troubling.”— Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor mulling his own 2024 bid, said he didn’t expect Trump to withdraw from the race after an indictment, though that would be the “right” thing to do.— Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a declared candidate who also served as Trump's U.N. ambassador, said Monday on Fox News that Bragg's case was an attempt at scoring “political points,"" adding, “You never want to condone any sort of prosecution that's being politicized.”“At the end of the day, not one single person’s opinion of him will be any different after indictment than it was before,” veteran GOP operative Terry Sullivan said in an interview. “All of his perceived negatives are already baked into his name ID with voters.”WHAT ABOUT OTHER TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS?The New York probe is among many legal woes Trump is facing.The Justice Department is investigating his retention of top secret government documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House, as well as possible efforts to obstruct that probe. Federal investigators are also still probing the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to overturn the election Trump falsely claimed was stolen.Portions of a report from a special grand jury in Georgia that investigated whether Trump and his allies illegally interfered in the 2020 election in Georgia shows jurors believed “one or more witnesses” committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges. The former president never testified, but the report didn't foreclose the possibility of other charges.WHAT'S NEXT IN NEW YORK?It's unclear. Trump declared in a social media post over the weekend that he expects to be taken into custody on Tuesday and urged supporters to protest his possible arrest. However, there has been no public announcement of any time frame for the grand jury’s secret work. A Trump spokesperson said there has been no notification from Bragg's office.Law enforcement officials have been making security preparations for the possibility of an indictment in coming days or weeks — or a court appearance by the president himself.WILL TRUMP BE HANDCUFFED?Anna Cominsky, a New York Law School professor and former criminal defense lawyer, said that her best guess is that Trump’s lawyers will work out a deal with the prosecutor’s office to avoid the spectacle of an indictment with handcuffs and a perp walk.“There is a great likelihood that he will self-surrender, which means you won’t see a 5 a.m. knock on Mar-a-Lago’s door, officers swarming his house and arresting him and bringing him out in handcuffs,” she said. “He would appear at the prosecutor’s office voluntarily and then be processed, fingerprinted and his picture taken. ”Cominsky is less sure that Trump would want to avoid a public appearance for his arraignment, which would come within two days of an indictment. At that time a judge lists the charges and asks if the defendant pleads guilty or not guilt.“He doesn’t shy away from the chaos, so he may want to use this to his advantage,” she said.____Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington, Anthony Izaguirre from Tallahassee, Florida, and Bernard Condon and Michael R.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841649,March Madness arrives in Vegas after years of avoiding it,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — March Madness has long been a huge draw for gamblers who came to Las Vegas to place their bets on the tournament while partying at the city's famed casinos. But they were limited to watching the games on TV; catching one in person here was impossible not that long ago.That changes this week when UCLA faces Gonzaga and UConn takes on Arkansas at T-Mobile Arena on the Vegas Strip.The NCAA Tournament avoided the city until very recently because sports gambling is legal here. The governing body for collegiate athletics even had a policy prohibiting its championship events from being played in Nevada.With legal sports betting spreading across the country, the NCAA now has no qualms about crowning its champions in Las Vegas. The Sweet 16 games scheduled here Thursday are among several championship events the NCAA has awarded to the city.Others include hockey’s Frozen Four in 2026 and the Final Four in 2028.This no longer is Jerry Tarkanian’s Las Vegas, at least in the eyes of the NCAA, which for many years had fought with the late Hall of Fame coach who sued the governing body and settled in 1998 for $2.5 million.Between the outlaw image of UNLV's Tarkanian and an overall feeling that sports betting — legal or not — was inherently bad for athletics, Las Vegas was an outsider in the sports world for a decades.It also was a much smaller city when Tarkanian ruled. Less than 800,000 people lived in the metropolitan area when the Rebels won the 1990 national championship, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. That figure last year was 2.3 million.Professional sports leagues have taken note of the additional potential paying customers and now the NFL and NHL have teams here. The Oakland Athletics are also considering moving here, and an NBA expansion team could be on the way in future years.Even before the influx of professional teams, Las Vegas began making headway, particularly in basketball. All 30 teams compete in the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, which also is home to USA Basketball. Five college conferences play their men's and women's basketball tournaments in the area.Views about legalized sports betting also have evolved dramatically, getting a big assist in 2018 when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act.The federal ban blocked states from regulating sports betting, making exceptions for Nevada, Delaware, Montana and Oregon, which already had legal sports wagering in some form. Only Nevada permitted single-game betting.“Thirty years ago in the Tarkanian era, I'm sure they were pretty skeptical of Las Vegas,” said Steve Hill, CEO and president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. “I think as time passed, they probably mellowed. We've had conference tournaments here and we've had a real partnership, it feels like now, that didn’t exist before the change in the law.”The Supreme Court's decision created a path for any state that wanted to legalize sports betting, and soon many would begin the process. That left the NCAA — already showing signs of drifting toward easing its stance on Nevada — with no choice but to allow its championship events even where sports wagering was legal.“That was the impetus,"" said Dan Gavitt, NCAA vice president of men’s basketball. “Once that changed, we were excited from a basketball championships perspective to bring March Madness to such a great city that has embraced college basketball with conference championships for some time.”Jim Livengood, when he was UNLV’s athletic director in 2009-13, worked behind the scenes with his colleagues before the federal ban was overturned to change the NCAA’s position on Las Vegas.Even after retiring in 2013, Livengood remained an advocate for Las Vegas as he moved into consulting.“I thought the tide was starting to turn in probably ‘16, ’17, '18,” Livengood said. “We were making some really serious headway.”In 2019, the NCAA formally changed its policy regarding championships in Las Vegas — and it couldn't wait to plant a flag.NCAA officials told Las Vegas representatives to skip the usual process of first bidding on the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament and go straight for a regional.“I think that was very unusual, but a reflection of the fact that there was pent-up demand for Las Vegas,” Pac-12 Conference Commissioner George Kliavkoff said.___AP College Sports Writer Ralph D.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841650,Montana senator wants to block mandatory diversity training,"HELENA, Mont. (AP) — A Republican lawmaker in Montana wants to prohibit mandatory diversity training for state employees with a bill whose language matches a Florida law that is temporarily blocked by the courts.The proposed “Montana Individual Freedom Act,” would prohibit diversity, equity and inclusion training as a condition of state employment if the training is aimed at having the employee believe that a group of people are responsible for “and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress,” for historical injustices.A House committee heard testimony Monday after the Senate passed the bill on party lines.""I find it interesting and confusing that we're trying to legislate emotional responses,” the executive director of the Montana Human Rights Network, Angelina Gonzalez-Aller, said Monday when she testified in opposition to the bill before a House committee.“I have no doubts that this is little more than a censorship attempt rooted in a coordinated national effort to roll back progress on racial and social justice,” Gonzalez-Aller had said last month when the bill was heard by a Senate committee.The sponsor, state Sen. Jeremy Trebas, said that nationally, diversity training is getting too political. He did not suggest that what he considered politically slanted training was taking place in Montana, but that his bill seeks to preempt it.“I think we need to work on definitions, then talk about what's appropriate to train and to whom we should be training on these topics,"" Trebas said.The House committee has not yet voted on it.“This bill is a gross mischaracterization of what is conventionally called DEI, or diversity equity and inclusion workshops,” said Chris Young-Greer with the Montana Racial Equity Project.“We focus on lifting up what all of us bring to the table with regard to our very different and important backgrounds,” she said Monday. ""Diversity is no more than acknowledging differences. Equity means that we all get what we need to be successful. And inclusion means that each of us, no matter our differences, are included, welcomed and accepted.”Opponents argued the bill’s language is word-for-word in some places like Florida’s challenged Stop WOKE Act passed in 2022.Trebas' original bill was amended to make it clear the discussion of critical race theory as part of academic instruction was allowed — eliminating one of the reasons Florida's law was blocked. Critical race theory is a way of looking at American history through the lens of race.Montana's administrative rules require the Department of Administration to ensure all new employees receive diversity and inclusion, equal opportunity and harassment prevention training within 90 days of being hired. Employees must participate in refresher training every three years.Attorney Don Harris said the department supports the bill.The attempt to regulate diversity training appears to have its roots in executive orders issued by then-President Donald Trump in September 2020, after a summer of protests over racial injustice in policing.The first order banned taxpayer dollars from being spent on diversity training for federal employees if the training implies that anyone is racist or sexist based on their race, sex and/or national origin. He later expanded the prohibition to training for the military, government contractors and other federal grantees.Opponents argued the order prevented workplaces from addressing the concepts of white privilege, systemic racism and unconscious bias.Trump's order cited examples of such training, including a presentation by the Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of African American History & Culture that said, in part: “If you identify as white, acknowledging your white racial identity and its privileges is a crucial step to help end racism. Facing your whiteness is hard and can result in feelings of guilt, sadness, confusion, defensiveness, or fear.”President Joe Biden revoked Trump's second executive order on his first full day in office. The U.S. Department of Labor had already suspended the order as it related to federal employees after a federal court in California granted a preliminary injunction against the order.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841651,Biden signs bill on COVID origins declassification,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill Monday that directs the federal government to declassify as much intelligence as possible about the origins of COVID-19 more than three years after the start of the pandemic.The legislation, which passed both the House and Senate without dissent, directs the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to declassify intelligence related to China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. It cites “potential links” between the research that was done there and the outbreak of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The law allows for redactions to protect sensitive sources and methods.U.S. intelligence agencies are divided over whether a lab leak or a spillover from animals is the likely source of the deadly virus. Experts say the true origin of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1.1 million in the U.S. and millions more around the globe, may not be known for many years — if ever.Biden, in a statement, said he was pleased to sign the legislation.“My Administration will continue to review all classified information relating to COVID–19’s origins, including potential links to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” he said. “In implementing this legislation, my Administration will declassify and share as much of that information as possible, consistent with my constitutional authority to protect against the disclosure of information that would harm national security.”",2023/03/21,,World

He was also part of Harris' unsuccessful bid to buy the Denver Broncos, who were instead sold to a group led by Walmart heir Rob Walton for a record $4.65 billion.The Commanders are expected to sell for more, which would be the highest price paid for a North American professional sports franchise. Forbes estimates the team is worth $5.6 billion.Harris along with partner David Blitzer owns the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL’s New Jersey Devils. Washington-area billionaire Mitchell Rales is also reportedly part of Harris’ group.Amid multiple investigations into workplace conduct and potential financial improprieties, longtime owner Dan Snyder and wife Tanya began exploring selling part or all of the team in the fall. Any sale would need to be approved by three-quarters of NFL owners, which could happen at their upcoming meeting in Arizona.Snyder's ownership has been a hot-button issue for years, since several employees came out about workplace harassment, which prompted a league investigation and a $10 million fine. When no written report of Beth Wilkinson's investigation was produced, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform launched its own review of the situation, which included a referral to the Federal Trade Commission.The league retained former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White to investigate, and that probe is ongoing.

Colorado says siding with the Navajo Nation will undermine existing agreements and disrupt the management of the river.But, arguing on behalf of the Navajo Nation, attorney Shay Dvoretzky told the justices that the tribe’s current water request is modest. The “relief that we are seeking here is an assessment of the nation’s needs and a plan to meet them,” he said.Arguing on behalf of the Biden administration, attorney Frederick Liu said that if the court were to side with the Navajo Nation, the federal government could face lawsuits from many other tribes.Four of the court’s justices, including its three liberals, seemed sympathetic to the tribe’s case. But other conservatives including Justice Samuel Alito were skeptical during nearly two hours of arguments at the high court.Alito asked about “some of the real world impacts” of the decision and suggested he’d seen figures indicating that “per capita water on the Navajo Nation is greatly in excess of per capita water for residents of Arizona.” He pointed out that the Navajo Nation’s original reservation was hundreds of miles away from the section of the Colorado River it now seeks water from.Justice Brett Kavanaugh also asked about the potential consequences of siding with the Navajo Nation, pointing to a brief that said more water for the tribe would necessarily mean less water for Arizona, striking “at the heart of the social and economic livelihood” of the state “with dire consequences.”The facts of the case go back to two treaties the tribe and the federal government signed in 1849 and 1868. The second established the reservation as the tribe’s “permanent home” — a promise the Navajo Nation says includes a sufficient supply of water. In 2003 the tribe sued the federal government, arguing that it had failed to consider or protect the Navajo Nation’s water rights to the lower portion of the Colorado River.A federal trial court initially dismissed the lawsuit, but an appeals court allowed it to go forward.“Is it possible to have a permanent home, farm and raise animals without water?” Justice Neil Gorsuch asked at one point during arguments, suggesting sympathy for the tribe’s case.Justice Sonia Sotomayor, participating in the case via telephone because she wasn’t feeling well, said the government was making the argument that the Navajo Nation can’t do anything to force the government to protect its water rights, something she suggested would have been an “odd agreement” for the tribe to make.The Colorado River flows along what is now the northwestern border of the tribe’s reservation, which extends into New Mexico, Utah and Arizona. Two of the river’s tributaries, the San Juan River and the Little Colorado River, also pass alongside and through the reservation. Still, a third of the some 175,000 people who live on the reservation, the largest in the country, don’t have running water in their homes.The federal government says it has helped the tribe secure water from the Colorado River’s tributaries and provided money for infrastructure including pipelines, pumping plants and water treatment facilities. But it says no law or treaty requires the government to assess and address the tribe’s general water needs. The states involved in the case, meanwhile, argue the Navajo Nation is attempting to make an end run around a Supreme Court decree that divvied up water in the Colorado River’s Lower Basin.A decision in the case is expected by the end of June when the Supreme Court typically breaks for its summer recess.___This story has been corrected to show that the court seems split on the dispute, not that the court appeared to be leaning toward the government argument.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841666,Confident Mayfield excited about fresh start with Buccaneers,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Baker Mayfield is excited to have an opportunity to try to win Tom Brady’s old job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.The No. 1 overall pick from the 2018 draft signed a one-year deal worth up to $8.5 million in free agency and will compete with third-year pro Kyle Trask to become Brady’s successor on a team two seasons removed from winning the Super Bowl.“Listen, I’m never going to be Tom Brady. There’s a reason he has won so many Super Bowls — he’s the greatest of all time, there’s no doubt about that. I’m not going to try and be Tom, I’m going to be me. That’s what’s gotten me to this point,” Mayfield said Monday.“We’re going to do it differently, but that’s what makes this league so special. Everybody puts their own touch on it. It’s an honor to follow up somebody like that,” the former Cleveland, Carolina and Los Angeles Rams quarterback added.“The people that have played with him around here, I’m going to pick their brains as to the things he did. There’s no doubt about that. I’m excited.""Tampa Bay will be the third team Mayfield has played for since being traded from the Browns to the Panthers last July. He went 29-30 in four seasons in Cleveland, and was combined 2-8 as a starter while throwing for 2,163 yards, 10 touchdowns and eight interceptions with Carolina and Los Angeles in 2022.Mayfield, who turns 28 next month, has thrown for 16,288 yards, 102 touchdowns and 64 interceptions over five seasons overall.“It was important to me to be in a place that’s stable and knows how to win, knows how to do it properly,” the quarterback said of the decision to join the Bucs, who are retooling in the wake of Brady’s retirement.“I’ve gotten to see different things from my journey that is not exactly how I drew it up. It’s helped along the way, especially in making a decision like this,” Mayfield added. “I want to go somewhere where we can win right away, and this is that place.”Brady led the Bucs to a Super Bowl title three seasons ago and consecutive NFC South titles the past two years.The offense was not nearly as efficient in 2022, when Brady threw for the third-most yards in the NFL, but Tampa Bay scored just 18.4 points per game after averaging more than 30 the previous two seasons.Mayfield is looking forward to competing with Trask, who’s attempted just nine regular-season passes since being drafted in the second round in 2021, and working with a talented group of receivers that includes Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Russell Gage.“Any time you get to play with playmakers like that, it obviously makes your job easier. They’re so experienced, and they’ve seen a lot as well, so I’m excited to get the opportunity to play with them,” Mayfield said.He said he’s also excited about joining new offensive coordinator Dave Canales, who moved to Tampa Bay from Seattle after helping Geno Smith jumpstart his career, earn NFL Comeback of the Year honors and land a big contract this offseason.“In my short term of knowing Dave so far, just realizing who he is, how he’s going to tailor the offense to his playmakers — to me, that speaks volumes. You find a lot of guys that want to just run their system without really trying to play to the attributes of their players, and that’s not Dave,” Mayfield said.Mayfield’s best season was 2020, when the Browns went 11-5 and then won a playoff game. The fact he’s on his fourth team in the past year speaks to how quickly his career shifted in another direction.The 2017 Heisman Trophy winner remains confident in his ability.“It’s not how I drew my career up, by any means. If I were to tell you how it would go based on the plan, I wouldn’t have said that I put on three different uniforms in the year 2022. But that’s how it happens,” Mayfield said. “I’ve grown a lot. I appreciate all the things that have happened throughout my journey, and it’s helped me get here today.""___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841667,2nd officer in inmate's fatal beating gets same 20-year term,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — The second of three former correctional officers sentenced in the fatal beating of a state inmate received a 20-year prison term Monday, the same as a co-conspirator despite a judge's declaration he could have stopped the attack as the senior officer.U.S. District Judge Sue Myerscough sentenced Todd Sheffler, a 54-year-old former correctional lieutenant, on two federal civil rights violations and various other counts for the attempted cover up of the brutal beating of Larry Earvin on May 17, 2018.The federal government had sought a life sentence. Sheffler's lawyers had asked for 2 1/2 years for the beating of Earvin, 65, as the prisoner was being transferred to a segregation unit at Western Illinois Correctional Center in Mount Sterling.In an emotional statement in court, Sheffler fumbled with shackled hands and wiped tears from his eyes with a tissue. He said he accepted responsibility “for what I did or didn't do” that caused Earvin's death.Then, looking at Earvin's son Larry Pippion, who was seated in the first row in court, the ex-guard said with his voice rising to a shout, “I did not put hands on your father. If it has to be life, let it be life, but I will not lie to favor someone's conviction record.”He added, “If there's anything I can do for the Earvin family, I will do it. I expect nothing less than your hatred.”Along with Sheffler, former officers Alex Banta, 31, and Willie Hedden, 43 were charged with conspiracy to deprive civil rights, deprivation of civil rights, obstruction of an investigation, falsification of documents and misleading conduct.Hedden pleaded guilty and testified for the government. Scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday, he declined comment outside the courthouse.Myerscough sentenced Sheffler, like Banta last week, to 15 years on each civil rights charge, to run concurrently, and five years each on the other charges, also concurrently.“You were an active participant,” Myerscough told Sheffler in explaining his sentence. “We're well past the point of minimizing conduct and shifting blame. ... Three witnesses testified that you contributed to the assault. You were the senior officer and could have stopped it.”Earvin was late in reporting for outdoor yard time and was ordered back to his cell at the prison in Mount Sterling, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. He allegedly became combative and an “officer in distress” call summoned dozens of officers. Outside the housing unit, Banta, Hedden and Sheffler escorted Earvin, handcuffed behind his back, to the segregation unit.Inside that facility's vestibule, where there are no security cameras, testimony indicated the three officers threw Earvin into a wall, then kicked, punched and stomped him.In Myerscough's words, Banta delivered “the most serious and depraved blow” by jumping up and landing on Earvin's mid-section with both knees. Earvin suffered 15 broken ribs and abdominal injuries so severe that a portion of his bowel was surgically removed. He died June 26, more than a month after the beating.In his statement, Sheffler admitted for the first time that he saw Banta jump and come down on his knees. He said he couldn't see but assumed he landed on Earvin and could not persuade himself to tell the truth because Banta had two small children and another on the way and “I was aware of the implications” if Banta's action was known.Like Banta, Sheffler offered an indictment of the Department of Corrections, derided its effort to offer mental health treatment, and said its main goal is to “cover the state’s ass.”In sentencing Banta, Myerscough acknowledged he had been “caught up in the culture” of acting on or witnesses violence against inmates and keeping quiet about it.Sheffler attorney Sara Vig noted that her client didn’t join the escort until Earvin was outside the housing unit and that testimony revealed Earvin was handled roughly inside, including testimony by one of the 31 officers who responded to the distress call that he had stomped on a prone Earvin just inside the housing unit door. She wondered why no one else has been held accountable.“Imagine the change in the system if all 31 were charged,” Vig said. “Justice can’t be meted out on my client’s back.”Department of Corrections spokesperson Naomi Puzzello said that staff and inmate safety is the agency’s top priority.“Over the last few years, the department has worked diligently to expand security measures statewide and improve its responsiveness to the concerns of individuals in custody,” Puzzello said in a statement.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841668,Missouri to restrict gender-affirming care for minors,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri’s Republican attorney general on Monday said he will limit access to gender-affirming care for minors, sidestepping the GOP-led Senate as it struggles to pass a law banning the practice for children completely.As hundreds of activists rallied at the Capitol to pressure lawmakers to act on the bill, Attorney General Andrew Bailey announced plans to file an emergency rule.The rule will require an 18-month waiting period, 15 hour-long therapy sessions and treatment of any mental illnesses before Missouri doctors can provide that kind of care to transgender children, according to Bailey's office.“I am dedicated to using every legal tool at my disposal to stand in the gap and protect children from being subject to inhumane science experiments,” Bailey said.The emergency rule also requires disclosure of information about puberty blocker drugs, including that they are experimental, not approved by the FDA and that the FDA has warned they can lead to brain swelling and blindness, Bailey said.While puberty blockers and hormones often prescribed in transgender treatment are not FDA approved for transgender care, they are used in those cases “off-label,″ which is an accepted and permitted practice.This is not the first time Bailey has weighed in on transgender health care since taking office in January.In February, Bailey announced an investigation of a transgender youth clinic in St. Louis run by Washington University, following allegations of abuse by a former employee. He asked the university to shut down the clinic, but it refused.Bailey's spokeswoman did not say when the new health care rule will be filed and did not provide a copy.Maysa Akbar, chief diversity officer for the American Psychological Association, called the rule “a disturbing development for transgender and gender-nonconforming youth in Missouri.”“This emergency order flies in the face of the scientific consensus, which is that, with appropriate psychological screening, treatment approaches should affirm an adolescent’s gender identity, not deny it,"" Akbar said. ""Research shows that discrimination has adverse effects on the health and well-being of transgender people.”The rule appears to be aimed at helping children who might regret transitioning, said Dr. Jack Drescher, section editor of the gender dysphoria chapter of the DSM-5, the most recent edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s mental illness manual.“However it does so at the expense of those children who would indeed benefit from transition services,” Drescher said. “Sacrificing the well being of the latter for the presumed benefit to the former is an ethically troubling intervention by the state into clinical practice.”Missouri LGBTQ-rights group PROMO called Bailey's rule an abuse of power and said his office “does not respect the professional guidelines of every major medical association in our country, who agrees gender-affirming healthcare is the standard of care for transgender Missourians.”The rule comes amid a national push to restrict transgender health care, drag shows, bathroom access and how LGBTQ topics are discussed in schools.Erin Reed, a researcher who tracks transgender legislation, said Bailey is among Republican elected officials in state executive offices across the nation who are finding ways to limit gender-affirming care when legislatures fail to act.“An action like this taken to sidestep the legislature and sidestep the democratic process is in and of itself undemocratic and is going to harm trans youth in Missouri,” Reed said.Florida state medical officials last year banned transgender children from receiving hormones or undergoing surgeries to treat gender dysphoria at the urging of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely considered to be weighing a run for the Republican presidential nomination.Texas went farther than any state last year when Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued a first-of-its-kind order that instructed child welfare officials to investigate reports of gender-confirming care for kids as abuse.A couple hundred people rallied Monday at the Capitol in hopes of pushing lawmakers to pass a law to ban all gender-affirming treatment for children, while several came in opposition. The rally featured a diverse collection of speakers, including Republican state officials such as Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, Christian leaders and several gay and transgender activists who said that only adults should be able to access gender-affirming care.Catherine Dreher, vice chair of the Missouri Libertarian Party, said her 18-year-old son has dealt with mental health issues, recently left home and wants to transition to a woman, which distresses her. She opposes allowing that for minors, calling it “child abuse.”Debate on the Missouri bill stalled when the conservative sponsor, Republican Sen. Mike Moon, struggled to negotiate with Democrats on the legislation. The GOP-led Senate ultimately failed to pass any legislation dealing with the topic before lawmakers left for their annual spring break.“Protecting Missouri's children is not up for negotiation,” Moon wrote in a public letter signed by seven other Republican senators, who vowed to take any action necessary to bring Moon's bill to a vote this week.The issue threatens to derail the Senate. Several Republican senators on Monday spoke against another Republican lawmaker's attempt to combine Moon's bill with a ban on transgender girls competing on school girls' sports teams, fearing that merging the issues might make the legislation unconstitutional.Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have indicated that they may filibuster to encourage compromise, a stall tactic that involves senators talking nonstop.____Associated Press writer David A.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841669,Minnesota moving to fortify state status as abortion refuge,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota is moving to fortify its status as a refuge for patients from restrictive states who travel to the state to seek abortions — and to protect providers who serve them.The state House on Monday passed a bill by a 68-62 vote to prohibit enforcement in Minnesota of laws, subpoenas, judgements or extradition requests from other states against people who get, perform or assist with abortions in Minnesota. The Senate version passed its first committee test last week.The House lead author, Democratic Rep. Esther Agbaje, of Minneapolis, said at a news conference before the debate that a prime example of what supporters are worried about is a Texas law that deputizes individuals to enforce their state's strict restrictions by allowing them to sue to anyone who helps a patient obtain an abortion elsewhere.Democratic House Majority Leader Jamie Long, of Minneapolis, said the bill is needed because Texas-style legislation has been introduced in several states that could put Minnesota providers at risk, as well as residents who might help relatives or friends who come to Minnesota for abortions just by picking them up at the airport.“Before the Dobbs decision last summer, I'd often care for patients from nearby states like the Dakotas or Wisconsin,"" said Dr. Sarah Trexler, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood North Central States, which performs 70% of the abortions in Minnesota. ""But now, for the first time ever, I regularly care for patients from Texas, Alabama, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and the list goes on and on.”Like Planned Parenthood and other providers, Whole Woman’s Health of Minnesota in Bloomington has also seen a sharp increase in patients from out-of-state, more than doubling from 2019 to 26% in 2022.“The most remarkable change has come from Texas, where we only saw 2 patients from that state in 2019 to 96 from February 2022 to March of 2023,” Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman’s Health Alliance, said in an email.Democrats made have abortion rights one of their top priorities for Minnesota's 2023 legislative session. They won a one-seat majority in the state Senate in the November elections while maintaining a wider hold on the House to wind up with pro-choice majorities in both chambers. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed a fast-tracked bill in January to enshrine in state statutes abortion rights that had been protected under a 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court decision.Texas and Oklahoma allow private citizens to sue people they believe have helped someone get an abortion. Minnesota has already adopted some protections that apply to those people under an executive order that Walz signed last June. And Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison pledged that his office wouldn’t cooperate with other states seeking to prosecute women who come to Minnesota for abortions. Several other states, including California and Colorado have also adopted safe haven protections for patients traveling to seek abortions, either by executive order or by statute.A more contentious bill working its way through the Minnesota House and Senate would repeal a long list of state statutes restricting abortion rights — such as 24-hour waiting period and parental notification requirements — that a district judge declared unconstitutional last July. It's meant to ensure that appellate courts can't restore those restrictions.Long demurred on when that bill might come up for a House floor vote. Asked if supporters now have the votes to pass it, he replied, “We'll have the votes when we bring it to the floor.”Republican critics of the various bills argue they've already left Minnesota with essentially no restrictions on abortion at all — at any stage of pregnancy. But their efforts to scale back the legislation and maintain some limits have all failed. Republican Rep. Peggy Scott, of Andover, said the bill passed Monday will give Minnesota a “black eye” by making it a destination and sanctuary for people seeking to end their pregnancies.“We are going to reward breaking the law, we are going to reward behavior that leads to felony convictions in other states. We're going to say, ‘Come to Minnesota, we’ll have you, we'll take you,'” GOP Rep. Anne Neu Brindley said during the debate. “Folks, it's wrong.”___Trisha Ahmed contributed to this story from Minneapolis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841670,US says China and Russia blocking UN action on North Korea,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused China and Russia on Monday of shielding North Korea from any action by the U.N. Security Council for its unprecedented spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, which violate multiple U.N. resolutions and jeopardize international aviation and maritime safety.U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told a council meeting that Chinese and Russian “obstructionism” was encouraging North Korea “to launch ballistic missiles with impunity” and advance its development of more sophisticated and dangerous weapons.After the meeting, she read a statement on behalf of council members Albania, Ecuador, France, Japan, Malta, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom, joined by South Korea, that condemned the launches.It said the growing crisis threatens not only the region but global peace and stability, and called for the Security Council to speak again with one voice. Unlike Thomas-Greenfield in her remarks, the statement did not name China and Russia, though it clearly referred to them.A united Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to rein in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and cut off funding. In the last sanctions resolution adopted by the council in December 2017, members committed to further restricting petroleum exports to North Korea if it conducted a ballistic missile launch capable of reaching intercontinental ranges.China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions, including on petroleum exports, over a spate of ICBM launches. Instead of new sanctions, what's needed now is renewed dialogue between North Korea and the United States, they said, and they maintained that position on Monday.The briefing came in the midst of the largest U.S. and South Korean military exercises i n years, which have included computer simulations, field exercises, and U.S. long-range B-1B bombers training with South Korean warplanes. North Korea said Monday it simulated a nuclear attack on South Korea with a ballistic missile over the weekend, its fifth launch this month to protest the military drills.China’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Geng Shuang, claimed that in 2018 North Korea took “the positive initiative of giving up nuclear weapons in return for security,” telling the council “the U.S. side failed to respond with goodwill … wasting an important opportunity for achieving denuclearization on the peninsula.”Thomas-Greenfield retorted that this was not true, even if North Korea had temporarily stopped testing. “The slew of launches that we’ve seen demonstrate to all of us that (North Korea) was continuing to advance its programs within its own borders,” she said.China’s Geng and Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Anna Evstigneeva, accused the United States of escalating tensions with the current military exercises, dismissing Thomas-Greenfield’s statement that they are longstanding, routine and purely defensive.Both stressed that the Security Council should focus on de-escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and urged members to support their resolution proposed in November 2021, which would lift some sanctions to spur dialogue between the United States and North Korea and lessen the impact of the sanctions on the North Korean population.Geng said their proposed resolution aims “to unleash some positive signals” and encourage North Korea to resume talks and create conditions to ease tensions. Evstigneeva said the resolution “is specifically geared toward arriving at a political diplomatic settlement.”Thomas-Greenfield reiterated the U.S. offer to hold talks with Pyongyang. But she countered that in their remarks Monday neither the Chinese nor Russian envoy even called on North Korea to stop testing, and their resolution would reward it for failing to comply with Security Council resolutions banning ballistic missile and nuclear tests.“What they are doing is depriving their own people of needed humanitarian assistance that would alleviate their suffering and allow for the international community to come in and provide the needed humanitarian assistance, which we are all willing to do without a resolution,” Thomas-Greenfield said.",2023/03/21,,World

North Carolina had one final chance, but turned it over with a second remaining.“Eboni did a great job,” Sheldon said. “It didn’t go as planned and she made a great play there, and that’s what led to that bucket. So I think keeping our composure in that situation was huge, keeping possession of the ball. And that was all Eboni.”Ohio State (27-7) saw its 12-point lead with 7:02 to go erased as the Tar Heels went on a 13-2 run midway through the fourth quarter. The Tar Heels did most of that run without star Deja Kelly, who exited midway through the final quarter with a leg injury. She went to the locker room, but returned to the court a short time later.Trailing 66-63, Kelly made two free throws before Paulina Paris made a layup in transition to give the Tar Heels (22-11) its first lead of the game with 2:09 left.Sheldon scored to give the Buckeyes the lead back with 1:07 left. She added a free throw 29 seconds later to make it a two-point game.Kelly, who finished with 22 points to lead North Carolina, hit a jumper to tie the game at 69 with 9 seconds left.“I asked them to be what they have been all year, which is a group of fighters,” North Carolina coach Courtney Banghart said. “We asked them to be hard to beat, and we thought those things would get us to a Sweet 16. They did all of those things, right, but you got to be so good to win in March, so good, and we just were not quite good enough.”Ohio State led the entirety of the first half, including by as many as nine points in the first quarter, on 46% shooting. Taylor Mikesell went 3-of-6 from beyond the arc in the first half.Sheldon finished with 16 points, Walker added 15 and Cotie McMahon scored 14. Taylor Mikesell had a team-high 17.“This is a great win for us because it puts us in the Sweet 16 but also just I have so much respect for North Carolina,” Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said. “We beat a great opponent today.”X’S AND O’SMcGuff said Ohio State’s final play design was intended to give Sheldon the basketball, but it didn’t unfold according to plan.Walker, who averaged over 14 minutes and 4 1/2 points per game this season, took the inbounds pass from Rikki Harris, looked toward Sheldon after catching the ball, dribbled to the top of the key and hooked it back to Sheldon for the game-winning score.“Eboni made a great decision not passing the initial one to Jacy because she really wasn’t open, and then we swung the ball back around and got it back in her hands,” McGuff said. “I told her in the locker room sometimes it’s about X’s and O’s and sometimes it’s about having the best player on the court.”BIG PICTURENorth Carolina: The Tar Heels allowed an opposing team to shoot at least 50% for the third time all season and first time since December.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841672,Panthers retooled offense designed to help No. 1 pick win,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers aren’t making any secrets about their plans to select a quarterback with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, even if they aren’t saying which one.So, this offseason has been about acquiring the right pieces to help him succeed when he arrives.In recent days the Panthers have agreed to terms with running back Miles Sanders, wide receiver Adam Thielen, tight end Hayden Hurst and backup quarterback and soon-to-be mentor Andy Dalton in free agency. They also plan to add another wide receiver who is a vertical threat in the draft or later on in free agency.“If you’re gonna go with a young quarterback, you have to have a running back, you have to have the tight end and you have to have the receivers,” Panthers general manager Scott Fitterer said Monday. “We feel like we have the offensive line, and we have cemented the starting five.”Ohio State’s C.J. Stroud, Alabama’s Bryce Young, Florida’s Anthony Richardson or Kentucky’s Will Levis are the four QBs the Panthers are considering with the No. 1 overall pick.The team plans to attend their pro days and bring all four in for more complete in-person interviews prior to the NFL draft.Fitterer is hoping the additions of the veteran offensive playmakers helps offset the loss of No. 1 wide receiver D.J. Moore, a difficult, but necessary part of the trade package with the Chicago Bears that allowed the Panthers to move up from the ninth pick to No. 1 overall.Moore had been an integral part of Carolina's offense with 5,201 yards and 364 receptions over the previous seasons.“We wanted to put ourselves in a position to get a quarterback,” Fitterer said. “We didn’t expect to have to include a player in that conversation, especially someone like D.J. Moore. Unfortunately, we had to give up D.J."" to make it work.It's no coincidence that Sanders, Thielen and Hurst all have plenty of NFL experience and come to Carolina from winning teams.The Panthers felt winning experience was necessary to get the young QB off on the right foot.“We really feel like we’re putting this guy in a good position with some of the pieces that we’ve signed,” coach Frank Reich said. “I feel like with the pieces we have put in place he can walk in and be ready to go.”Sanders, Thielen and Hurst also possess a catch-and-run element to their games, which Reich covets.“We think we know how to speed things up at times to get guys catch and run (opportunities),” Reich said. “So to be good in space, to be good after contact — those are big.""As for who'll be the No. 1 pick, the Panthers aren't tipping their hand.They say they are still doing research on the top four guys.Reich has a reputation for working with taller quarterbacks, but said he's open to anything and noted that he was a big believer in Russell Wilson coming out of college. Hypothetically, that is good news for Alabama's Young, who is undersized at 5-foot-10.“If there are 10 categories you look at with every quarterback, the real question is not how you evaluate each of those categories — the big part is how much you're going to weigh each of those categories,” Reich said. “They’re all a factor. Everything’s a factor. But ultimately, it really comes down to being a playmaker, being a guy who can make plays all over the field.”So what qualities do the Panthers weigh the most in the decision-making progress?“That would be like giving away the proprietary formula for Kentucky Fried Chicken, right?” joked Reich.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841674,Trump legal woes force another moment of choosing for GOP,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — From the moment he rode down the Trump Tower escalator to announce his first presidential campaign, a searing question has hung over the Republican Party: Is this the moment to break from Donald Trump?Elected Republicans have wavered at times — whether it was Trump's condemnation of John McCain's war record, his racist attack against a Mexican-American judge, his sexually predatory language caught on video, his alleged extramarital affairs, his decision to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence, his promotion of false allegations of election fraud and his incitement of a violent mob that threatened the lives of lawmakers in both parties.But after almost eight years of near-constant scandal, Republicans have ultimately rallied behind Trump over and over and over again.Now, on the eve of a new presidential campaign season, that loyalty is being tested anew as Trump prepares for the possibility that he may soon become the first former U.S. president charged with a crime. New York prosecutors are wrapping up their probe into whether Trump engaged in an illegal hush money scheme involving a porn actress.“This is another moment — not just this indictment, but the others likely to follow — where Republicans have the opportunity to break with Trump,” said Sarah Longwell, a vocal Republican Trump critic and founder of the Republican Accountability Project. “If they fail to do so, they'll have no one to blame but themselves when Trump is the nominee again.”So far, at least, the vast majority of the Republican Party appears to have made its choice.As charges loom, many party leaders have begun to defend the former president — even as other Republicans with far less baggage line up against him in the nascent 2024 Republican presidential primary.Former Vice President Mike Pence, a likely presidential contender, said over the weekend that Americans don't want to see Trump indicted. Another 2024 Republican prospect, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, said there is a sense that the former president is being unfairly attacked. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a frequent Trump critic also eyeing a White House bid, also said New York prosecutors may be unfairly prosecuting Trump.There are cracks in such support, however.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump's strongest prospective rival, offered a mixed assessment when asked to address the potential indictment on Monday.“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair,"" DeSantis said as some in the audience laughed uncomfortably. ""But what I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that’s an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office. And I think that’s fundamentally wrong.”The ordeal has pushed Republicans back into an uncomfortably familiar place -- playing defense for Trump as he grapples with another scandal. The situation dominated the conversation at the House GOP conference in Orlando, where dozens of congressional Republicans gathered this week.Many hoped to focus on the party's legislative priorities and achievements three months into the House majority. Instead, they faced repeated questions about the implications of Trump's latest legal woes.Republican lawmakers eager to highlight the party's gain with Hispanic voters were cornered -- in Spanish and English -- by questions about Trump’s legal troubles and whether he's still the leader of the party.“Obviously I have great respect for the former president of the United States,"" Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., told The Associated Press. “But as far as who the leader of the party is, I will tell you right now, I think the leader of the party is the speaker of the House. It’s the highest ranking elected.”But Speaker Kevin McCarthy is making clear that he has Trump’s back.The California Republican called the potential indictment “pure politics” and slammed New York prosecutors for New York City's rising crime rates. Like DeSantis in Tallahassee, Republican lawmakers in Orlando repeatedly attacked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, calling him a “George Soros-backed” prosecutor.And instead of using their new clout to advance conservative policy, Republican leaders on Monday announced plans to investigate and interrogate the entities involved in the case against Trump, including the many federal and local prosecutors probing Trump’s actions in various jurisdictions. Beyond the New York hush money case, Trump is facing active criminal investigation in Georgia for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and by federal prosecutors probing his handling of classified documents, among other issues.In a letter to Bragg on Monday, House Republicans demanded communications, documents, and testimony relating to the “unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority and the potential indictment” of Trump.Trump's legal baggage could prove a political liability in the 2024 general election, but his team has long believed that an indictment could give him a political advantage in the primary by forcing his Republican rivals to come to his defense or risk alienating his fierce political base. They point to the Republican response to the federal raid on Trump's Florida estate, when virtually the entire GOP, including DeSantis, ultimately defended him.Some of Trump's 2024 rivals have privately acknowledged the political risks should they break from the former president at such a critical moment.To that end, Trump and his allies seized on DeSantis' approach to Trump's potential arrest as an affront to his MAGA base. The Florida governor said he hoped to stay out of what he called a “manufactured circus.""Donald Trump Jr. condemned DeSantis' response as “pure weakness.”Trump himself attacked DeSantis using his pet nickname for him, “Ron DeSanctimonious"" and promoted a decades-old picture of DeSantis posing with young women when he was a high school teacher.In a message accompanying the photo, Trump mocked DeSantis, going so far as to question his sexuality. The governor, Trump wrote, “will probably find out about FALSE ACCUSATIONS & FAKE STORIES sometime in the future, as he gets older, wiser, and better known, when he’s unfairly and illegally attacked by a woman, even classmates that are ‘underage’ (or possibly a man!). I’m sure he will want to fight these misfits just like I do!”As his party largely lined up behind Trump, some also tried to draw boundaries — especially as he called for large-scale protests. The message evoked similarities with Trump's rhetoric that sparked the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.“I don’t think people should protest this,"" McCarthy said. Despite Trump’s repeated calls for protests, he added: “I think President Trump, when you talk to him, he doesn’t think that either.”Meanwhile, all but a few Republican members of Congress have so far declined to endorse Trump’s 2024 presidential bid. And it’s unclear if statements of support in the spring of 2023 will translate into formal endorsements when the primary season takes off in the spring of 2024.Still, Trump's biggest supporters were oozing confidence.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of just eight House Republicans who have formally endorsed Trump’s third presidential bid, said Americans should be outraged by the so-called political persecution of a former president.If Trump is indicted, she predicted, Trump will win in a landslide.House Republican conference chair, Rep. Elise Stefanik, remains one of Trump's strongest supporters in Congress. She said she spoke to the former president earlier Monday.“I think you’ll see his poll numbers go up,” predicted Stefanik, who has also signed onto Trump’s 2024 bid. “He’s never been in a stronger position.”___Peoples reported from New York.

His detention hearing is scheduled for Thursday.The kidnapping occurred in Matamoros, Mexico, which is located just across the border from Brownsville.According to a federal complaint filed Saturday, Moreno has been charged with conspiring to illegally export a firearm. The complaint said that he admitted to buying firearms for people he knew were going to provide them to a member of the Gulf Cartel in Mexico.The serial number of a firearm he purchased in October 2019 matched that of a gun recovered by authorities that was linked to the March 3 kidnappings, according to the complaint. Moreno said he didn’t apply for a license to export the firearm from the U.S. to Mexico, and knew it would be illegally exported, the complaint said.Moreno told authorities that he received $100 for the purchase of the guns.Four friends who were traveling to Mexico so one member of the party could have cosmetic surgery were caught up in a drug cartel shootout in Matamoros. After a vehicle crashed into their van, men in tactical vests with assault rifles arrived in another vehicle and surrounded them.Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown appeared to have been killed immediately and their bodies were loaded into a truck with the two survivors, Eric Williams and Latavia McGee.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841676,Cruise wants to test self-driving cars all over California,"DETROIT (AP) — General Motors' Cruise autonomous vehicle unit on Monday asked California for permission to test the cars across the entire state.The GM subsidiary already is running an autonomous ride-hailing service in its hometown of San Francisco after testing for more than two years. It doesn't have specific plans yet to expand testing in California, but applying with the Department of Motor Vehicles is a step toward entering cities such as Los Angeles.“While this application doesn’t represent any immediate change to our testing or operations, we hope to continue working with the California DMV to safely and responsibly test our services in other cities in the future,” Cruise spokesman Drew Pusateri said in a statement.If granted, the test permit won't allow Cruise to carry non-employee passengers outside of San Francisco. Testing could be done up to 55 miles per hour (88 kilometers per hour) statewide, Cruise said.Cruise also has been testing autonomous Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles, and carrying employees, friends and family members in central Austin, Texas, and parts of Phoenix.The GM subsidiary is under investigation by U.S. safety regulators for reports that its autonomous robotaxis can unexpectedly come to a halt, potentially stranding passengers. Cruise says it’s cooperating in the probe and has driven 1 million autonomous miles (1.6 million autonomous kilometers) without causing any life-threatening injuries or deaths.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841677,No telling how much more snow coming for Sierra Nevada,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — No one really knows how much snow fell on the infamous Donner Party when the pioneers were trapped atop the Sierra Nevada for months and dozens died near Lake Tahoe in the winter of 1846-47.But this season has now etched its way into the history books as the second snowiest in the 77 years of record-keeping at the Central Sierra Snow Lab — more than 56.4 feet (677 inches, 17.2 meters) with no end in sight.And there's still a chance it could surpass the record of 67.7 feet (812 inches, 20.6 meters) set in 1951-52 when more than 200 passengers on a San Francisco-bound luxury train from Chicago were stranded for three days near Donner Pass west of Truckee, California.Over the weekend, the “winter that just doesn’t want to end” as the National Weather Service in Reno put it, topped the previous No. 2 record of 55.9 feet (671 inches, 17 meters) set in 1982-83. That was the second of back-to-back blizzard buster seasons remembered most for an avalanche that killed seven at a Tahoe ski resort on March 31, 1982.Since December, a parade of atmospheric storms have dumped so much snow on the Sierra that Tahoe ski resorts have been forced to shut down multiple times.The final day of the Nevada high school state skiing championships was canceled. Roofs collapsed under the weight of snow and schools shuttered for days. Interstate 80 closed several times between Reno and Sacramento.“It started early and it seems to just keep going,” said Eric Sage, 45, of Sparks, who shoveled his way through many big winters growing up in Truckee but doesn't remember one like this. “Stacked up, big storm after big storm after big storm — wham, wham, wham.""The official record book keeper is UC-Berkeley’s Central Sierra Snow Lab, founded in 1946 in Soda Springs, California, northwest of Lake Tahoe.“We’ve seen bigger storms in other years and years with higher snow water equivalent totals ... but the relentlessness of this season is likely what makes it most unique,” said Andrew Schwartz, the lab's manager and lead scientist.More snow is forecast over the next 10 days, but nobody knows what the spring will bring.“Historically, some of our big seasons have continued to be active right on through the end of spring,” said Tim Bardsley, the senior hydrologist for the National Weather Service in Reno.The official winter season coincides with the water year, beginning Oct. 1 and ending the following Sept. 30. Sometimes snow continues falling in the Sierra well into June.For this winter to overtake the record in 1951-52, another 145 inches (368 cm) would have to fall — unlikely, but not out of the question.“There’s basically nothing that would indicate just because we’ve been this active, we would then transition the other direction,"" Bardsley said. “I’d almost say the opposite is more likely to be true.”Several of the snowiest winters logged at least one-fourth of their season total after March 15. What's now the fourth-snowiest winter in 2010-11 received 225 inches (572 cm) of its 643 total inches (1,635 cm) — or 35% — post-March 15.The snow lab has records dating to 1880 based on measurements taken by the Southern Pacific Railroad. Those unofficial measurements taken near where the train was stranded in 1952 suggest more snow could have fallen in 1938, and nearly that much in 1880 and 1890.The lab doesn’t formally recognize those numbers because they were from slightly different locations using a different methodology.Mark McLaughlin, a Tahoe-area author of several books on Sierra history and weather, accepts the railroad numbers and believes snow that fell on the Donner Party in 1846-47 is similar to what fell in 1951-52.Ten major storms dumped rain and snow on the mountains the first two weeks of November 1846. The monument at Donner Memorial State Park indicates the snow depth reached 22.5 feet (6.9 meters) before some of the stranded resorted to cannibalism.The now-third-ranked 1982-83 winter came on the heels of the season when Tahoe’s deadliest avalanche struck at Alpine Valley south of Truckee. Some 90 inches (228 centimeters) of snow fell in four days leading up to the disaster.The 1960 Winter Olympics, the first televised, put Lake Tahoe on the map after the world got a look at the snow-covered mountains surrounding the alpine lake with the turquoise waters. But the winter itself got off to a slow start and Olympic officials were in a panic in the weeks leading up to the games.“There was no real snow by New Year’s Day and the Olympics were coming in the third week of February,” McLaughlin said. “Then the storm door opened and it snowed and snowed and snowed. There was so much snow no one could practice ski runs on the mountain.”Author Peggy Townsend and her husband, parents of pro skier Cody Townsend, said they were overwhelmed by the piles of snow when they arrived at their Olympic Valley-area cabin near the base of a Tahoe ski resort last month. They had to park down the road and dig their way in through 10 feet (3 meters) of snow.“We would have to dig out like three, or four times a day, just so we could get to the woodpile,” Peggy Townsend said. After four days, they’d had enough.“When there was a break in the snow,” she recalled, “We just said ‘we’re going to get the hell out of there.’”___Associated Press Writer Jake Bleiberg in Dallas contributed to this report.___This story corrects an earlier version to show 671 inches (17 meters) of snow was recorded in 1982-83.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841678,Trump loses last bid to keep key evidence out of rape trial,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s effort to keep key evidence out of his civil rape trial next month was rejected by a federal judge Monday.Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in Manhattan ruled that key witnesses will be allowed to testify and misogynistic remarks Trump made about women in 2005 when he apparently didn’t realize he was being recorded can be played for a jury that will hear quarter-century-old rape allegations made by a former magazine columnist.A trial in the case filed by E. Jean Carroll is scheduled to start April 25. Carroll and Trump are expected to testify.Carroll said in a 2019 memoir that she was raped by Trump in the mid-1990s in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, an upscale Manhattan department store. She said a chance encounter filled with lighthearted banter turned violent when they entered a small room while teasing one another about who would try on a piece of lingerie.Trump has repeatedly insisted he never met Carroll at the store and that he didn't know who she was. During an October deposition, he misidentified a decades-old photograph of her as one of his ex-wives.In the deposition, Trump was dismissive of Carroll’s claims, saying: “Physically she’s not my type.""Kaplan had previously ruled that taped remarks Trump made in an “Access Hollywood” tape could be used in a defamation case Carroll brought against him before she filed a rape claim against him in November, when a temporary law took effect allowing adult rape victims to sue their abusers, even if attacks happened decades ago.He also ruled that two women who made sexual abuse claims in circumstances similar to those alleged by Carroll could testify at trial.The Access Hollywood tape was revealed just weeks before Trump won the November 2016 presidential election.In the tape, he said that sometimes when he sees beautiful women: “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.” And he added that, “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,” including grabbing women between their legs.Afterward, he issued a rare apology, saying the comments were “locker room banter” caught on a hot mic.Lawyers for Trump and Carroll had agreed that the defamation claim, made in a separate lawsuit, could be tried along with the rape claim, but the judge rejected that proposal Monday, saying the defamation lawsuit could be tried separately or not at all if the Justice Department successfully replaces Trump as a defendant with the United States.In an order Monday, Kaplan ruled specifically that he would allow the “Access Hollywood” tape and testimony by two other women who say Trump attacked them sexually to be included in next month's trial, repeating his rulings from the defamation case.“There is no reason, and Mr. Trump has made no persuasive argument, for me to rule differently,” he wrote.He also said he will allow testimony from two individuals who worked at the department store at the time of the alleged rape to testify, even though Trump's lawyers objected, saying they hadn't been notified in a timely fashion of the testimony and hadn't had a chance to depose the witnesses.The judge said lawyers for Carroll had notified them of the witnesses in a timely fashion.Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, declined comment. A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841679,Braves make apparent SS decision; Díaz focusing on Reds role,"The Atlanta Braves have apparently decided who will replace the departed Dansby Swanson as their starting shortstop. It's not who most people expected it to be.Vaughn Grissom and Braden Shewmake were optioned to Triple-A Gwinnett on Monday. That leaves utility infielder Orlando Arcia as the likely replacement for Swanson, who left the Braves in free agency during the offseason for a $177 million, seven-year deal with the Chicago Cubs.Atlanta announced the moves involving Grissom and Shewmake after a 6-5 exhibition win over the Tampa Bay Rays. Grissom, who had been widely anticipated to be Swanson's successor, went 3 for 4 in the game with an RBI and run scored, raising his batting average to .371 in 12 games this spring.Arcia appeared in only one game at shortstop for the Braves last season, when he made 43 starts at second base and hit .244 in 67 games overall. He hasn't been a primary shortstop since starting 59 games in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season for Milwaukee, which traded him to the Braves the following April.The 22-year-old Grissom made his big league debut last season by hitting .291 with five home runs and 18 RBIs in 41 games for the Braves. He started 39 games at second base and one at shortstop.Arcia and Grissom were needed so much at second base last year because Ozzie Albies missed much of the season with two injuries — a broken foot and finger.Swanson, the first overall pick in the 2012 draft, debuted with the Braves in 2016 and hit .255 in 827 games over eight seasons. He hit .277 while playing in 162 games last season.Shewmake, a first-round pick by the Braves in the 2019 amateur draft, is still looking to make his big league debut.DIAZ ‘DOWN FROM THAT MOMENT’Alexis Díaz is now focusing on what is expected to a prominent role for him in the Cincinnati Reds bullpen after the shock of seeing his older brother get hurt while they played together for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic.Edwin Díaz, the All-Star closer for the New York Mets, is expected to miss the entire season after surgery last week for a torn patellar tendon in his right knee. He was hurt while celebrating a WBC victory.“In regards to my brother, it was tough,” Alexis Díaz said Monday at the Reds camp in Goodyear, Arizona. “I was there celebrating with him and I saw him fall to his knees afterward. ... The next couple days were really tough. We were supposed to have a grand old time. Seeing him in the locker room really put me down right after that.”Alexis Díaz said he has been in communication with his brother through the whole process. He said his brother told him that he's good and will be coming back with a positive mentality.“I feel better now,” the younger Díaz said. ""I've kind of come down from that moment.”Díaz was 7-3 with a 1.84 ERA in 59 games as a rookie for Cincinnati last season. He had 10 saves, seven of them after the start of August.After spending some time with Díaz, manager David Bell said he is confident that the Reds reliever is going to be fine.“It’s one thing when it’s your teammate, but it’s his brother. It is tough,” Bell said. ""He seemed to be in a very good frame of mind. Emotionally, he’s fine and ready to get back to pitch.”WRIGHT STUFFBraves right-hander Kyle Wright, baseball’s only 20-game winner last season, made his first Grapefruit League start.He had stopped throwing for three weeks during the offseason after a cortisone injection in his shoulder in January.Wright allowed five hits (two home runs) and four runs over 2 2-3 innings against Tampa Bay. He was on a pitch limit and departed after 49 pitches.“I wasn’t very good,” Wright said, adding that he was making some adjustments during the outing when he didn't have any strikeouts or walks.But what really mattered is that Wright said his shoulder felt great.“We’ll see how it feels tomorrow. That will be the real test,” he said. “Everything is still trending in the right direction.”Wright had a breakout season last year, going 21-5 with a 3.19 ERA in 30 starts. The 27-year-old was 2-8 in 21 games (14 starts) the previous four seasons combined for the Braves.He is expected to make one more Grapefruit League start, then remain in Florida to pitch in a minor league game after the Braves break camp next week. Wright expressed confidence that he will be ready to pitch for Atlanta at St. Louis in the team's second series of the regular season.APPEL RELEASEDFormer first overall draft pick Mark Appel finally made his big league debut last season, just shy of his 31st birthday. The right-hander is now without a team again.Appel was released Monday by the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. He had an 11.12 ERA in six Grapefruit League appearances this spring, walking six and allowing three home runs over 5 2/3 innings.Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Appel wasn't going to make the team and that the organization didn't have a spot for him in Triple-A.The No. 1 pick by Houston in the 2013 draft out of Stanford, Appel got a $6.35 million signing bonus. He finally made his big league debut last June 29, and had a 1.74 ERA while throwing 10 1/3 innings in six appearances for the Phillies.Appel made it to Triple-A for the Astros in 2015 before being sent to Philadelphia in a multiplayer trade. He decided to quit baseball after the 2017 season following injuries and ineffectiveness, but rejoined the Phillies organization in 2021.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841680,Kidnappers who snatched San Jose baby are sentenced,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Two people who kidnapped a 3-month-old baby from his San Francisco Bay Area home last year were sentenced Monday to prison.Yesenia Ramirez was sentenced to 13 years and four months in prison. Jose Portillo received five years.The two pleaded no contest last August to kidnapping Brandon Cuellar on April 25, 2022.Prosecutors said Ramirez met the boy's family through church and plotted to kidnap the child after lying to her boyfriend — telling him that she had given birth to their baby and was going to bring him home from the hospital.Ramirez took the baby's grandmother shopping and arranged for Portillo to enter the family's San Jose apartment while they were out. This gave Portillo time to take the child while Ramirez helped the woman unload groceries from the car, prosecutors said.Video showed Portillo walking away with the baby in a carrier covered with a white blanket.The boy's mother was at work at the time.After an intense search, the baby was found the next day at Portillo's home a few miles from the apartment.“This incident is a parents’ worst nightmare. We are fortunate it resulted in a positive outcome,” San Jose Police Chief Anthony Mata said at the time.Prosecutors said the two had tried to kidnap the boy several times before, and once tried to cut the brakes on the mother's car.At Monday's hearing, Ramirez cried as she delivered a lengthy apology that eventually was cut short by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Nona Klippen, KRON-TV reported.“I’m sorry for this baby, his mother, father, and all of his loved ones that I have hurt. I am sorry for others that I have manipulated, traumatized, due to my crimes and my actions,” Ramirez said.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841681,"Review says London police racist, misogynistic, homophobic","LONDON (AP) — London police have lost the confidence of the public because of deep-seated racism, misogyny and homophobia, according to an independent review commissioned after a young woman was raped and killed by a serving officer.The Metropolitan Police Service, which has more than 34,000 officers and is Britain’s biggest police force, must “change itself” or risk being broken up, the report published Tuesday said.“It is not our job as the public to keep ourselves safe from the police. It is the police’s job to keep us safe as the public,’’ said Louise Casey, an expert on victims' rights and social welfare who led the review. “Far too many Londoners have now lost faith in policing to do that.”The findings ratchet up the pressure for a major overhaul of the Metropolitan Police after a series of scandals involving its treatment of women and minorities. In a preliminary report released in October, Casey found that the department had failed to properly vet and train officers, and had allowed officers to remain on the job even after they were accused of domestic abuse or racial harassment.Part of the problem is that there is a culture of denial in the department, with leaders adopting a “we know best” attitude that leads them to dismiss outside critics, the review found. Funding cuts, along with the decision to close local police stations and effectively end community policing, also contribute to the situation.Underlying all of this is the way the force is managed, not its size, the inquiry found.“The Met is run as a set of disconnected and competing moving parts, lacking clear systems, goals or strategies,” the report said. “It runs on a series of uncoordinated and short-lived initiatives, long on activity but short on action.”The Casey review was commissioned after a serving officer raped and killed Sarah Everard, a young marketing executive as she walked home from a friend’s house in March 2021, prompting a national outcry as women shared their experiences of being threatened or attacked when walking alone.When hundreds gathered at Clapham Common in south London to draw attention to the violence women face every day, police broke up the rally, saying it was a violation of COVID-19 lockdown rules. Video posted on social media showed male officers grabbing hold of several women and pulling them away in handcuffs to screams and shouts from onlookers.But the Everard case was only one in a series of recent scandals at the Metropolitan Police, known as the Met.In December 2021, two officers were jailed for taking and sharing photos of the bodies of two Black women after they were dispatched to guard the scene where the women had been slain. Another officer was later sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to 48 rapes and a series of other serious crimes committed over a 17-year period.The Met was also accused of homophobia over its failure to stop serial killer Stephen Port, who murdered four young men over a 15-month period in 2014 and 2015.Detectives didn’t initially link the victims, all gay men in their 20s whose bodies were found near Port’s home in east London. They only began investigating the deaths as potential homicides after the family of the final victim pressed for action.Casey’s review found that the department hasn’t treated violence against women and girls as seriously as other forms of violence.The 363-page report also painted an alarming picture of how crimes against women and children are investigated due to a shortage of funding and a lack of specialized officers trained to handle these cases.Officers investigating these crimes are forced to store rape samples in “over-stuffed, dilapidated or broken fridges and freezers,” because they don’t have access to fast-track forensic services, investigators found.A lunchbox in one of these refrigerators contaminated the evidence. Another appliance broke down last summer, meaning the evidence was damaged and couldn’t be used in court.“The de-prioritization and de-specialization of public protection has put women and children at greater risk than necessary,” the report said. “Despite some outstanding experienced senior officers, an overworked inexperienced workforce polices child protection, rape and serious sexual offences.”But the problems extend beyond the treatment of women and girls.Twenty-four years after another inquiry found that institutional racism was a key factor in why the Met failed to investigate the killing of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence, Casey highlighted the fact that the department is still disproportionately white and male.About 17% of London police officers are Black, Asian or mixed race, compared with about 10% a decade ago, according to the latest department statistics. Women account for almost 31% of police officers, up from almost 25% in 2013.Some 40% of London’s population is Black, Asian or mixed race, according to the 2021 census.The report found widespread bullying in the department, with one in five staff members that have protected characteristics — such as race, sexuality or disability — being victims.“Female officers and staff routinely face sexism and misogyny,” the report said.",2023/03/21,,World
