https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824702,10 government officials suspected of graft in Hsinchu stadium saga,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The latest development in the ongoing Hsinchu Baseball Stadium construction saga has revealed that senior government officials neglected their responsibilities, and the contractors, Chuchia Construction (巨佳營造) and AECOM (艾奕康), may face criminal lawsuits for failing to build the stadium to the required specifications.On Wednesday (March 1) Mirror Media published the results of a preliminary report from the Hsinchu City Government's Department of Civil Service Ethics detailing an investigation into the stadium’s construction. The report said that the stadium's waterlogging problems were the result of contractors failing to meet construction standards previously agreed to by both parties.A NT$40.9 million (US$1.34 million) drainage budget was reportedly covertly removed from the plans, but the officials in charge of overseeing the budget ignored this. The report named more than 10 officials suspected of having acted in neglect of their duties, the highest level official being the current Deputy Minister of the Interior Wu Tang-an (吳堂安).In addition to the substandard drainage work, it was also discovered that the main contractor for the project, Chuchia Construction, failed to adhere to the soil thickness requirements stipulated in the contract tendered by Hsinchu City Government in 2018. Within the past few days, the Hsinchu City Government excavated the stadium’s soil and discovered the major deficiency.According to Mirror Media, the city government will not rule out further excavation to determine whether contractors had breached the Waste Disposal Act, or whether civil servants had committed fraud. The Hsinchu District Prosecutors Office is carrying out a separate independent investigation and will determine whether either the construction supervisor AECOM or the construction company Chuchia Construction has civil liability for the failures.To make matters worse, the report detailed an apparent ongoing pattern of industrial safety failures by Chuchia Construction. The government officials responsible for the company's safety record reportedly neglected to do so, allowing the company to win the contract despite its poor record.The Wei Chuan Dragons, the team for whom the stadium was constructed, have not yet been able to use the stadium, and are expected to bring legal action against the Hsinchu City Government over the incident, according to Mirror Media. A letter was sent from the team’s management to the city government in August last year requesting compensation for the ongoing delays to the stadium’s completion, and a suspension of the lease, but an agreement has not been reached.Hsinchu City Government Spokesperson Shih Shu-ting (施淑婷) said that the request for suspension of the lease does not amount to a termination of the lease. In response, the Dragon’s said that ""the relevant matters are all negotiated between (our club) and the city government.""",2023/03/01,1263,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824792,Taiwan CEOs most pessimistic about global economy since 2012,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese business leaders have become their most pessimistic about the future of the global economy since 2012, according to a survey published by PwC Taiwan Wednesday (March 1).While an average of 73% of global CEOs had modest expectations for the year, Taiwan's reached 77%, the survey found, based on 216 written forms and nine in-person interviews with business leaders in the country.Changes in supply chains and staff shortages will force the participating companies to adjust their ways of doing business within the next six years in order to maintain profitability, according to more than 60% of the Taiwanese CEOs surveyed, while in 2023, the main threats come from economic instability, inflation, and political risk, UDN reported.In order to prepare for the expected problems, 75% of business leaders diversified their products and services, while 60% had already cut the cost of doing business. Over the past few years, a significant number of Taiwanese companies moved their supply chains out of China, with Vietnam as one of their preferred choices. Other Southeast Asian nations, India, and Mexico have also attracted their share of investment from Taiwan, PwC said.The company said it used online forms, face-to-face, and telephone interviews to conduct the Taiwan CEO Survey from Oct. to Dec. 2022.",2023/03/01,959,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824799,Turkish fan protests a 'serious warning' to Erdogan,"Sport and politics can't be separated. That statement itself is nothing new, and Turkey is no exception.But something was different over the weekend: After the severe earthquake disaster in the southeast of the country, the public anger spread around the stadiums of the big traditional football clubs and was aimed directly at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government for the first time.In unprecedented scenes, fans of Istanbul clubs Fenerbahce and Besiktas used league matches to emphatically demand the resignation of the government. Lead by the opposition, Erdogan and his ministers have come under heavy criticism over the earthquake disaster.Many are angered particularly by the fact that those in charge approved or turned a blind eye to the construction of earthquake-unsafe buildings directly on a fault line. Another massive point of criticism is the delayed arrival of search-and-rescue teams to the entire affected area.The earthquake on February 6, 2023 has caused immense damage and devastation to a country that has already been struggling with an economic crisis for months. The reactions against the government have now further intensified ahead of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections.The Turkish government has restricted press freedom and freedom of expression in the country for years, and the weekend scenes could lead to a further attempt to silence critical voices in the stands. After the Besiktas match against Antalyaspor, the leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which is an ally to Erdogan's ruling AKP, described the protests as irresponsible and disrespectful to the earthquake victims.""The Nationalist Movement Party strongly condemns the use of sports in dirty politics during such sensitive and painful days for our country,"" Devlet Bahceli wrote on Twitter, calling on clubs to play behind closed doors in order to prevent further protests.  In an initial concrete step, Turkish authorities have banned Fenerbahce fans from attending their team's match at Kayserispor on Saturday.Bahceli added that all fans chanting against the government should be ""investigated and punished."" In light of the events, Bahceli, a Besiktas supporter, canceled his membership of the club.Shortly after the two earthquakes, the government put pressure social media platforms once again in an attempt to silence critical voices as quickly as possible. But thousands of fans chanting slogans against the government at football matches is a new dimension of collective protest. Experts believe that many people have overcome the fear threshold towards the repressive government in Ankara.The two games over the weekend also led to some popular sports commentators coming out in support of the fans, arguing that the voices in the stands should not be silenced. The situation has caused great excitement in the camp of AKP opponents.Sports journalist Bagis Erten told DW that he sees the calls for the government's resignation as a ""social reaction"" rather than a ""political one.""""That's why fears can't be an obstacle. Social reactions have the ability to tear down walls,"" he said. He also points out that governments all across the world have a problem when it comes to fans in football stadiums.""When you suppress the social opposition, like anything you trample on, it seeps through somewhere and then spreads to other places. Terraces in the stadium have always had their fair share of that spread, whether it's in Europe, Latin America or the Middle East,"" said Erten.Sports journalist Kenan Basaran told DW that protests in the stadium ""are a refuge for the suppressed right to protest. On the streets, these protests are forbidden.""Basaren said stadiums are ""more anonymous and crowded"" and give protesters partial protection from the intervention of security forces.""In an ideal democracy, an individual can show their democratic reaction in the streets. Why can't someone, who can shout in the stands shout in the streets? That's the real question.""Besiktas' largest and best-known fan group is named ""Carsi."" The collective is currently on trial in connection with the ""Gezi""-events, the street protests against the Erdogan regime that took place in many cities across the country in 2013.Groups like ""Carsi"" however remain in the minority across the Turkish Super Lig. There is little solidarity with the demonstrators, as many clubs are closely connected to the AKP. Those clubs even went as far as issuing statements criticizing the weekend's stadium protests.Erdogan's hometown club Rize used particularly harsh language in its statement, calling the participants of the stand protests ""scoundrels"" and ""sewer rats."" Another club that disapproved of the fans' behavior is Corendon Alanyaspor. The chairman of the board is the older brother of Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.Even before the AKP, there was a major problem in Turkey regarding the corrupt relationship between sport and politics. But it is fair to say, that this corruption has reached its peak during the AKP era.Sports journalist Inan Ozdemir says that governments in Turkey like to inject politics into sports: ""It was easy for them, as long as they could control the messages in the stadiums."" For many years, the AKP was used to not hearing ""a critical voice against itself.""It is hard to judge, whether the wave of protests in the stands will continue.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824800,Greece train crash: Rescuers search wreckage for survivors,"Rescue crews in Greece on Wednesday scoured the charred wreckage of a passenger train that derailed near the central city of Larissa overnight killing at least 36 people.The incident is already being described as the worst of its kind in Greece's history, with the death toll expected to rise as rescuers work through the debris.At least 66 people have been hospitalized, some of them with serious injuries.The passenger train headed from the capital, Athens, to the northern port of Thessaloniki collided head-on with a commercial freight train that had ended up on the same track just before midnight on Tuesday in the Thessaly region.The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, with the first two catching fire.The train departed from the Greek capital at 7:22 p.m. local time on Tuesday evening and crashed near the city of Larissa.It is not yet known why the trains were traveling on the same stretch, but the passenger train had just emerged from a tunnel.""They were traveling at great speed and one (driver) didn't know the other was coming,"" Thessaly regional governor Konstantinos Agorastos said.Two large cranes on the site were starting to clear parts of the wreckage as morning broke Wednesday. Rescuers worked to free any passengers stuck in the mangled remains, still discovering victims hours later.According to Hellenic Train data, the passenger train was carrying 342 travelers and 10 crew, while the cargo train had two crew on board.Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou on Wednesday said she was cutting short a visit to Moldova to return to Greece.""Unfortunately, I have to interrupt my visit in order to be close to my people, to support those who need it,"" she told a joint news conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed her condolences on Twitter.""The whole of Europe is mourning with you,"" von der Leyen wrote. ""My thoughts are with the people of Greece after the terrible train accident that claimed so many lives last night near Larissa.""European Parliament President Roberta Metsola offered her sympathy to ""all victims, their families and friends.""""Grateful to all rescuers and medical staff on site,"" she added.The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he was ""shocked by the news and images of the collision of the two trains.""""My thoughts are with the people in Greece this morning,"" he tweeted.rc/nm (dpa, Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/03/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824801,France's Macron heads to Africa in bid to improve ties,"French President Emmanuel Macron begins a five-day trip to Africa on Wednesday.He is expected to visit Gabon, Angola, the Republic of Congo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.The trip comes as relations between Paris and several African nations have been put to the test, in particular in the Sahel, where France has troops stationed in the fight against terrorism.A number of African countries were once colonies of France and had maintained close ties with Paris, but recently Macron has had to contend with rising Russian and Chinese influence.Prior to the trip, Macron announced the withdrawal of more soldiers from Africa, adding that the troop strength is to be visibly reduced.Macron also called for a ""mutual and responsible relationship"" with the continent of more than 50 countries, including on climate issues.""To measure our influence through a number of military operations, to rest on exclusive privileged ties with certain leaders, or to consider that certain economic markets are rightfully ours because we were there before — these are things of the past,"" Macron said, urging for a new approach to Africa policy in Paris.The French president's first stop will be Gabon, where he is to attend the One Forest Summit, a meeting to address global forest preservation. In particular, the vast Congo River basin will be discussed.The forests of Central Africa represent the planet's second-largest carbon sink after the Amazon. They are home to a large biodiversity, including forest elephants and gorillas, and bear traces of the settlement of early humanity.But they face threats to their existence from poaching, deforestation for the oil palm and rubber industries, and illegal logging and mineral exploitation.Macron will then head to Angola, Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo in a bid to improve bilateral relations with each of those nations.jcg/nm (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/01,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824803,Ukraine updates: Zelenskyy calls for ICC Russia probe,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for Russian leadership and all those involved in the Russian invasion of his country to be held responsible before an international court.""We will dismantle this entire Russian genocidal system, from the cogs to the architects, and bring them to legal verdicts,"" Zelenskyy said in his daily video address. The comments followed a meeting with International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan in Kyiv on Tuesday.While the Ukrainian president admitted this would not be an easy feat, he said ""responding to Russian crimes in the face of this aggression exactly in terms of the rule of law and exactly with the power of an international court is what will serve as one of the guarantees of the long-term future security of both Ukrainians and other nations.""The invasion of Ukraine by Russia would inevitably have legal consequences for those who planned, approved and implemented it, Zelenskyy went on to say. According to him, not only those who executed plans but also ""the top political and military leadership of the terrorist state"" needed to be held accountable.An investigation into the situation in Ukraine by the ICC is already underway. The court in The Hague looks at war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. However, as the Rome Statute is the legal basis for the court, it cannot take action against Russian leadership as neither Russia nor Ukraine are parties to the agreement.For this reason, Zelenskyy pushed for a special tribunal to be set up at the UN General Assembly in September.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, March 1:Finnish lawmakers are set to vote on a bill that could enable the country to join NATO in a bid to respond to Europe's altered security landscape. The bill is expected to be approved by a large majority in parliament.Sweden and Finland are both preparing to join the defense alliance. They handed in their applications in May 2022, suspending decades of neutrality. Finland shares a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) border with Russia, partly motivating the move.For the two countries to join, NATO's 30 member states must unanimously agree to accept them. Turkey and Hungary have yet to ratify the Scandinavian countries' accession. Hungary's parliament was set to discuss the issue on Wednesday and will vote next week.Turkey has been blocking the two aspirants' applications due to security concerns about Sweden. Ankara says Stockholm is supporting and protecting what Turkey believes to be Kurdish terrorists.Due to Ankara's tough stance on Sweden's accession, there has been speculation that Finland might join NATO first. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has repeatedly urged Turkey and Hungary to accept Finland's and Sweden's applications to join the Western military alliance.The G20 foreign ministers were set to meet in New Delhi on Wednesday, with the war in Ukraine threatening to overshadow India's attempts to forge unity.Russia's Sergey Lavrov was expected to attend the meeting. Top US diplomat Antony Blinken was also due to arrive in New Delhi, however a meeting between the two men remained unlikely as they had not been in the same room since a G20 meeting in July 2022.According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov will use his attendance to accuse the West of wanting to ""take revenge for the inevitable disappearance of the levers of dominance from its hands.""""The destructive policy of the US and its allies has already put the world on the brink of a disaster, provoked a rollback in socioeconomic development and seriously aggravated the situation of the poorest countries,"" an English-language statement from the ministry said.India intended its G20 presidency to focus on issues such as mitigating poverty and securing climate finance, however, the Ukraine war and its global impact are expected to dominate the meeting's agenda.Russia's defense ministry said its military had repelled what it called a massive drone attack on Crimea by Ukrainian forces without any casualties, Russian news agencies reported.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has traveled to China to meet with Chinese leaders, leaving many concerned that Beijing might change its stance on the war in Ukraine. Russia is one of Belarus' closest allies, as Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to use his territory as a staging ground for their invasion just over a year ago.The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said that Chinese leader Xi Jinping will receive Lukashenko, who has been to China on several visits before. The ministry described the relationship between the two as ""comprehensive strategic partners.""The talks were expected to focus on expanding cooperation between the two in the areas of trade, economy, investment and humanitarian cooperation, Belarus' state news agency Belta said. The meeting will also focus on ""the most acute international challenges of today.""The visit by the Belarusian leader came only days after China proposed a detailed plan to stop the fighting in Ukraine.The proposal received a skeptical response globally as it did not mention any new initiatives to end the conflict or request the complete withdrawal of Russian troops.Beijing has not condemned Russia's war in Ukraine. Western leaders have recently warned China against supplying Russia with any weapons.After Russia's invasion of Ukraine just over a year ago, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gave a speech to the German parliament announcing that the German military would receive a special one-off fund worth €100 billion (€106 billion). Since then, Scholz's center-left coalition has been dogged by broadsides from the conservative opposition and critics who say Germany's troops have not benefited from this windfall. So what happened?The top US diplomat met with foreign ministers from the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia, who, unlike Belarus, have not rallied behind Russia in its war in Ukraine. Antony Blinken's visit came just days after the one-year anniversary of Moscow's invasion of its neighbor, which has tested Russian influence in the region.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824823,Taiwan considers limiting ‘make-up’ working days to 3 per year,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The government will consider limiting the Taiwanese practice of having people go to work or class to “make up” for extra holidays off to three days per year, reports said Wednesday (March 1).Because 2023 has six such days listed, the government has received more complaints than usual from the public. As a result, the Directorate-General of Personnel Administration (DGPA) will decide on a new formula by the end of May, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported. One of the possible choices would be to keep the number of make-up days to a maximum of three per year, even though if the current formula is maintained, the number will once again reach six in 2030, per CNA.DGPA Minister Su Chun-jung (蘇俊榮) told RTI he wanted to find a balance between people complaining about the extra work and school days, and those looking for more flexible time off. He said the government might just choose to apply the formula to two or three important festivals a year, such as the Lunar New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival.The DGPA will invite other government departments, including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to discuss the possibilities and submit them to the full Cabinet for a decision by the end of May, Su said.While three of this year’s make-up days have already passed, March 25, June 17, and Sept. 23 are still yet to come. Experts have criticized the practice, saying it had a negative impact on children’s learning and on family dynamics, while others have questioned why an extra holiday should be neutralized by having an extra day of work on a Saturday in the first place.",2023/03/01,4541,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824924,How clan wars leave Muslim Filipino youth traumatized,"Even as a peace deal between the government and the largest Muslim separatist movement brings hope for peace in Mindanao, the cyclical violence of clan wars leaves a lingering trauma on Muslim youth.Rido, the local term for ""clan war"" or fighting between families and kinship groups, is marked by recurring acts of retaliatory violence triggered by a real or perceived infraction. Targets of retaliation can be individuals or entire families, spurring a cycle of inter-generational violence, causing fear and anxiety among the youth for years.""Local clan feuds affect many aspects of their [youth] lives — be it physical, psychological, economical, and even socio-cultural. Their dreams are being ruined. Rido puts the future of Mindanao and Muslim youth at risk,"" Abdul Hamitullah Atar, executive officer of Reconciliatory Initiatives for Development Opportunities (RIDO) Inc., a peace-building NGO focused on mending the societal divide brought by clan wars, told DW.As a child, Haifah Dida-Agun lost count of how many times she needed to flee the family home just to be safe from the violence brought by a feud between two warring clans in their village in Lanao del Sur, Mindanao.Though her family was not directly involved in the feud, at 15, Dida-Agun had to learn how to handle a firearm to protect herself and ensure the safety of her younger siblings.""There was a time when we had to dig a hole inside our house. When there was gunfire, we would go down there just to be safe. It was a very tense situation for me and my family,"" Dida-Agun told DW.On one occasion, fighting among clan members broke out in their school, upending the notion of schools as traditional places of sanctuary.""We had to go into hiding. We had no freedom. We could not go out. We couldn't even go to school. It really affected our dreams to have a peaceful and normal life,"" said Dida-Agun.Volatile clan dynamics and political rivalries contribute to the instability in the southern region of Mindanao, with the intersecting violence of clan wars and insurgency paralyzing communities.In May 2020, the government reported that clan wars had displaced more than 4,500 civilians.In 2009, political rivalry between two families, the Mangudadatus and the Ampatuans, resulted in the deaths of 58 people, including members of the local press. The carnage is seen as the worst case of election-related violence in Philippine history.According to Rufa Guiam, Director of the Research and Development Center, Mindanao State University and author of the book ""Gender and Conflict in Mindanao,"" rido brings different but distinct struggles for men and women.When male family members are primary targets, their mobility is limited and they cannot work or perform their expected duty as the breadwinner. This places a greater burden of generating income on women, in addition to their traditional duties of caring for homes and family members.""In many cases, it causes depression among men. The women become the absorber of the depression and frustration of men,"" Guiam told DW.Like Dida-Agun, Jamal Baulo, 29, was also caught in a clan war between two families in his neighborhood.The recurring violence and conflict in their community left Baulo feeling hopeless about his future and the future of Mindanao.""I always asked myself: Do our leaders care about us? We were not safe and there was always fear,"" Baulo told DW.While the horrors of living through clan wars during their childhood still linger on, it also motivated Dida-Agun and Baulo to advocate for peace so Muslim youngsters can aspire to have a future that is free from violence.Dida-Agun and Baulo both hope that the promise of peace ushered in by the truce between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), signed in 2014, will also pave the way for the non-violent resolution of clan wars.""We are all brothers and sisters, after all,"" Dida-Agun said.Dida-Agun currently works in a non-government organization and, together with the local government, helps communities resolve their grievances through non-violent interventions.Meanwhile, Baulo is employing the combined power of personal narrative and visual storytelling to educate young Muslims about the far-reaching negative impact of rido.Baulo's film highlights the internal struggles of a family affected by rido as told through the friendship of two young men.Film showings are being organized in schools and among non-government youth groups.""Film is a powerful tool to make a good impact on young people. It can influence their beliefs and principles in life and that will affect how they view the issue of rido in our community,"" Baulo said.This story was produced under a reporting grant from the Probe Media Foundation, Inc. and The Asia Foundation.Edited by: John Silk",2023/03/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824925,Can India's push for millets start a food revolution?,"With 2023 declared as the UN International Year of Millets, several events and activities are expected to be rolled out across India aimed at spreading awareness about the ancient grain.The humble millet is believed to have been around for about 7,000 years. In India, archaeological evidence suggests their consumption dates as far back as the great Indus Valley Civilization era.Millets are essentially a group of small-grained cereals like sorghum (known in India as jowar), pearl millet (bajra), finger millet (ragi/ mandua), foxtail millet (kangni/ Italian millet) and many others.The millets are cultivated in at least 130 countries but have generally been relegated to the sidelines by the popularity of rice and wheat.However, millets have several advantages over their more popular cousins. Millets can grow on arid lands with minimal inputs and are resilient to changes in climate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which is leading this year's millet celebrations.""They are therefore an ideal solution for countries to increase self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on imported cereal grains,"" said the UN agency.Millets also appear to have a nutritional advantage. The FAO says they are naturally gluten-free and are a low-cost but rich source of fiber, antioxidants, minerals, proteins and iron.They could be a ""great food option for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, high-blood sugar or diabetes,"" according to the FAO.Millets are primarily grown in Asia and Africa, with India being the top producer followed by Niger, China and Nigeria.India's share in total production of millets in the world in 2022 was 39%, followed by Niger (11%), China (9%) and Nigeria (7%), according to the US department of agriculture.But while India's share of global millet production is significant, the figure is perhaps less so when compared with its yields of wheat and paddy.According to data from India's federal agriculture ministry, India produced around 17 million tonnes of millet in 2020-21 — while the country generated more than 231 million tonnes of paddy and wheat during the same period.Millet production will need to be ramped up if people are expected to ditch rice and wheat in favor of the ancient grain alternative.Harvir Singh, who edits the agriculaural website Rural Voice, feels that the Indian government has put little effort behind its campaign.""When the government wants to popularize something, it launches a mission for that objective, which has set goals and a budgetary allocation,"" Singh told DW. ""But in the case of millets, no such mission has been announced so far.""Price is also a factor. In the commodity markets of India's western state of Maharashtra, ragi was selling at about €43 ($45) per quintal (100 kilos), while wheat was selling for around €29 per quintal.On the retail market, ragi flour is almost two-and-a-half times the price of wheat flour.Reducing the price of millets will require increasing the amount of land used to grow them. But farmers are not keen to make the switch to millets, considering that millions are already struggling to make a living with their paddy and wheat crops.India's push to popularize millets has been in the works since at least 2012-13, when the government-mandated support price (MSP) for millets was raised higher than that of the country's staple foodgrain crops of paddy and wheat.But the MSP is just one cog in the giant wheel of India's agricultural system. Another important factor is public procurement, or the purchase of agricultural products from farmers by the government.Data provided by Food Corporation of India (FCI), the agency responsible for public procurement, shows that the government's purchase of millets has been negligible.FCI's foodgrain stock figures show a stock of 119,000 tonnes of millets — compared to over 16 million tonnes of paddy and more than 15 million tonnes of wheat.However, the sheer magnitude of the benefits of millets has enthused many and they want the federal government to do more.Agriculture policy analyst Devinder Sharma said he has met several farmers across many states who grow millets, but even with the new MSP, their earnings have not increased.""The current MSP is too low,"" Sharma told DW. ""Millets require a virtually negligible amount of water, are an instrument of crop diversification and have multiple health benefits. The government should consider these factors and raise the MSP significantly.""He also dismissed the argument that millets are expensive and said that people who can buy a cup of coffee at restaurants for nearly €4 can easily spend about €1 for a kilo of ragi.Sharma believes people have already developed an interest in millets and clever marketing campaigns can help boost consumption of the ancient, humble grain.Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/01,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824927,German government fights over money,"Money isn't everything, but without money everything is nothing. This saying certainly applies to the state and its tasks. Where the necessary money is lacking, political projects cannot be implemented, which creates frustration, and that's exactly what the governing German coalition of center-left Social Democrats (SPD), environmentalist Greens, and business-oriented Free Democrats (FDP) is now feeling.In mid-March, Finance Minister Christian Lindner is expected to present the key points of the 2024 federal budget. With this document, Lindner, who is also FDP leader, wants to implement one of his most important election promises: To reinstate the debt brake enshrined in the Basic Law, the country's constitution, which limits spending to the amount of money the state takes in. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the debt brake has been suspended several times, which is allowed if the state is in a financial emergency.Lindner has been conducting tough budget negotiations with his government colleagues for months. That's because the debt brake can only be complied with if the government makes massive savings. When Russia invaded Ukraine, Lindner had to take out additional loans on top of the already agreed special debt of €60 billion ($64.1 bio.) for climate protection. Then there was another loan of €100 billion to upgrade the German armed forces and €200 billion in financial aid for German businesses and people to offset high energy costs.These loans came on top of the record debts incurred in the COVID-19 pandemic — and the old debts which were already taken on beforehand. Add it all up, and Germany is sitting on a mountain of debt of more than €2.5 trillion. And the finance ministry must find interest payments, which have increased significantly due to inflation and interest rate increases. While they still amounted to only €4 billion in 2021, they are currently already at around €40 billion. ""This is money that is missing elsewhere,"" Lindner said recently.Meanwhile, the tax revenues forecast for 2024 is not enough to cover the German government's current needs. After the COVID years, health insurers need billions to make up their deficits, and long-term care insurance is under so much pressure due to the aging of society that it needs to be reformed.In addition,more than a million refugees came to Germany last year, and the influx is continuing. Accommodation and care cost billions, and for months, state and local governments have been criticizing the fact that they will not be able to make ends meet with the money they have been allocated.Then there is the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius wants another €10 billion for the armed forces, above the special fund, which is controversial even within his own party, whose parliamentary group leader Rolf Mützenich said that €100 billion should be ""quite sufficient for the coming years.""There are other issues that need to be considered in the budget, he said, arguing that humanitarian aid and development policy should not be neglected in international policy. ""We need to be in sync there,"" he said, backing his party colleague, Development Minister Svenja Schulze. The latter warned that there is great concern among developing countries that Germany could forget about aid to the southern hemisphere over the Ukraine war.The SPD is not alone in fearing that the war and its consequences will massively restrict the coalition's room for maneuver. What will become of the coalition agreement and the many cost-intensive political projects the new government had planned?The list ranges from a basic child allowance to combat child poverty to 100,000 publicly subsidized apartments a year and investments in climate protection, digital infrastructure, and transport routes. Some €10 billion are to be transferred to the Federal pension insurance fund, which is to be invested in the capital market to finance pensions. If the FDP has its way, it could be considerably more than ten billion.Since the projects are not prioritized in the coalition agreement, each party believes that its respective political concerns should have priority. In the face of tight budgets, the conflicts that were predicted when the parties took office are breaking out.The SPD and the Greens are two left-wing parties that care about social justice and ecology and advocate a strong state. In many respects, the neoliberal FDP propagates the opposite: As little regulation as possible, low taxes, and as little social spending as possible.But who should give way, who must suspend or maybe even abandon their goals? In February, a letter became public that Green Economy Minister Robert Habeck had sent to the Lindner on behalf of all Green-led ministries. In it, Habeck made it clear that while the Greens would not question compliance with the debt brake, they were not prepared to sacrifice their projects for it either.Habeck rejected Lindner's austerity plans, proposing instead to increase the state's revenues. But that was not going down well with Lindner.Tax increases or the reduction of tax benefits for company car owners, for example, are out of the question for the FDP. Instead, even in the current situation, they would like to lower taxes for companies and introduce tax breaks for top earners. The first thing the FDP wants to do is abolish the solidarity tax, originally intended to help former East Germany following reunification, which only the richest now still pay. But that alone would cost around €11 billion.Meanwhile, the chancellor is said to have put his foot down in the dispute between Habeck and Lindner. Der Spiegel magazine reported on a meeting of the three politicians in the chancellor's office, at which Olaf Scholz is said to have sided with Lindner. There are to be no higher taxes. The FDP has lost votes at the last five state elections, and the party leader is battered as a result. Scholz does not want to put Lindner under additional pressure.On March 5 and 6, the cabinet plans to meet and deliberate at the federal government's guest house in Meseberg castle. If no agreement is reached there, Lindner will have to leave a blank space among his key points. This is called ""global budget cuts"" and means that as yet unnamed savings will be made across the government. They will have to do this by June when the draft budget must be ready in all its details because that is when it has to be submitted to parliament.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824928,Why is China cracking down on prominent business figures?,"The sudden disappearance of a Chinese billionaire has thrust the spotlight once more upon China's crackdown on prominent entrepreneurs.Bao Fan, one of the most prominent bankers in the country who established China Renaissance in 2005, has been missing for more than two weeks.In a stock market filing on Sunday, China Renaissance Holdings said that Bao was currently ""cooperating in an investigation being carried out by certain authorities"" in China.The company didn't offer further details about the whereabouts or conditions of its chairman and chief executive, whose disappearance raised concerns about a possible crackdown on China's financial services sector.Following Bao's disappearance, the company's shares listed in Hong Kong fell by up to 29%, before rallying by 2.3% on Monday.Some experts describe the disappearances as ""terrifying."" And Bao is not the only victim.Last September, China Renaissance President Cong Lin was taken into custody after an investigation into his work at the financial leasing division of state-owned bank ICBC, according to the economy news outlet Caixin.""We have no idea what type of conditions they are under,"" said William Nee, the research and advocacy coordinator for Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD). ""We don't know if they are being detained at a hotel or whether they are in some type of prison cells.""Nee added that all these practices are against the rule of law, and the trend of prominent entrepreneurs being targeted shows persecution is not only affecting dissidents or ethnic minorities.""In this case, we see some of the core issues in China, including enforced disappearance and being denied access to lawyers, affecting some of the most powerful people in China,"" he told DW.Even though the international community views enforced disappearance as a type of human rights violation, some analysts say the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) views it as ""standard practice.""""The Chinese government has used the same method on many people, and the only reason we know the disappearance of prominent entrepreneurs is that they are big names,"" said Yaqiu Wang, the senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW).Bao is not the first Chinese billionaire to have been forced into disappearance or arrested. Over the last few years, close to half a dozen Chinese billionaires have been endured this process for certain periods of time. Guo Guangchang, nicknamed China's Warren Buffet and the founder of Fosun Group, disappeared for a few days in 2015.Additionally, Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua went missing in Hong Kong in 2017 and his trial reportedly began last July. In 2020, Alibaba founder Jack Ma also vanished from the public eye for several months as he was preparing to publicly list the digital payments company Ant Financial.Some experts say the reason why Beijing is cracking down on entrepreneurs is that they need to ensure their companies or business practices are in line with the CCP's priorities.""Xi Jinping believes this is how the system should work, and while entrepreneurs make profits, pay taxes, and hire people, they also need to make sure their business falls in line with CCP's goals,"" said Dexter Roberts, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Indo-Pacific Security Initiative.""Part of the crackdown is real concerns about [these businesses'] control over sensitive data and part of it is just these companies being influential. For Xi Jinping, it's all about these private companies becoming too powerful and they are challenging state-owned companies. In his view, they are not showing proper respect to the CCP,"" Roberts told DW.Nee from CHRD added that in the cases of Jack Ma and Bao Fan, they were likely targeted by the Chinese government due to Beijing's concerns about their businesses threatening its political monopoly on power or gaining too much control over the financing of the tech sector in China.""The government is trying to curb ambitions of the tech sector and ensure that while they want these companies to be successful, they also want the companies to be under the firm guidance of the party,"" he said.As Beijing's crackdown on prominent entrepreneurs continues, experts say the trend will cause investors to lose confidence in the Chinese market.""The CCP has been suppressing private enterprises for many years, and sometimes their policies can lead to the sudden crackdown on an entire industry,"" said Chinese legal scholar Teng Biao.""The arbitrary arrests and convictions of Chinese entrepreneurs can leave private entrepreneurs at a loss, or cause investors to lose confidence in the Chinese market, China's political future, and China's investment environment. Many international and domestic entrepreneurs have lost confidence in China and have diverted the money they were supposed to invest in China to other places,"" he added.Roberts agreed that the trend is creating a chilling effect among capable entrepreneurs in China.""Xi Jinping and the senior members of the CCP may think they can scare the entrepreneurs into line while letting them keep doing business, creating jobs and paying taxes,"" he told DW. ""Since China's economy is in such a bad shape, they need the private sector more than they realized.""Nee from CHRD added that for Chinese entrepreneurs who hold a different nationality, there is no guarantee that they will be spared in Beijing's ongoing crackdown, as Chinese Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua's case has shown.""If you are a foreign business person, you really need to think carefully about your security and what you would do in the contingency that you were detained in China,"" Nee told DW.""As we see in Bao Fan's case, international laws and standards with respect to detention are not recognized in China. The Chinese government will not abide by international laws and standards,"" he added.Yaqiu Wang from HRW thinks Beijing's crackdown on civil society will only intensify during Xi Jinping's unprecedented third term in office.""Judging from the past ten years under Xi Jinping's rule, the trend of suppression will become more and more serious,"" she said. ""His methods will become more brutal and secretive, and people's basic rights will be less secure.""Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824929,Helsinki forges ahead as Stockholm is stuck behind,"Finnish lawmakers have sealed the deal from their side, ratifying their own bid for NATO membership with a final vote of 184 to 7.  Their previous decision, on whether to support the government in launching the application process, racked up 188 votes for and 8 against after 14 hours of debate on May 17.Now all the Finns can do is wait for their counterparts in Hungary and Turkey, the two remaining NATO members who have not yet approved their accession — with or without their co-applicant, Sweden. Their neighbor on the other side, Russia, is the reason the country sought the NATO security assurances in the first place, and Mosow's brutality in Ukraine has only worsened during the wait.Unanimous approval has turned out not to be a foregone conclusion, despite enormous optimism at the beginning of the process. Hungary is still lagging but the real problems started when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan put the brakes on the two countries' bids, primarily due to their perceived tolerance for Kurdish groups he considers enemies. But it's really Sweden he's focused on.A deal between the three countries at the NATO summit in Madrid to work out their differences hasn't resolved things between Stockholm and Ankara. The officially-designated Kurdish terrorist organization, the PKK, has amped up its visibility in demonstrations where activists have targeted Erdogan personally. Separately, a far-right extremist burned a Koran, stoking Ankara's animosity toward the Swedish government.""We do not have, relatively, a major problem with respect to Finland, but we are always underlining that Sweden should take concrete steps,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last month.Fearing both countries could be blocked if they insist in sticking together, NATO has changed its tack. ""The main question is not whether Finland and Sweden are ratified together,"" Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg now says. ""The main question is that they are both ratified as full members as soon as possible.”Just how soon is ""possible"" is causing some irritation. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, speaking to the press alongside NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg during a parliamentary debate, said she would have hoped Finland and Sweden were already members by now as they had fulfilled all the criteria.""Of course, this strains the open door policy of NATO as well,"" she said. ""It has to do with NATO's credibility.""It's also straining relations between the two neighbors. When Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto first suggested in late January that Finland may have to proceed into NATO without Sweden, his Swedish counterpart immediately demanded clarification. Haavisto was forced to hold a press conference to publicly restate that the preferred path of membership for Helsinki was, naturally, together with Stockholm.But just last month at the Munich Security Conference, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto was blunt about the fact that Finland would go it alone if the opportunity arose. ""Our hands are in a way tied,"" he said. ""We have applied for membership. Should we now say we cancel our application? That we can't do.”Henri Vanhanen, a research analyst with the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, says it's really not an option to wait. ""It would be very hard for decision makers to justify to the people who are over 80% in favor of NATO right now,"" he told DW. ""Also we're seeing over 50% of Finns now in favor of going in NATO at this point, even if Sweden is not ratified.”Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has warned that leaving his country outside NATO alone could create a security problem for both Sweden and for the alliance. But Henri Vanhanen doesn't see it that way.""Sweden would be a NATO invitee surrounded by NATO members and would have Finland on its eastern neighbor in NATO,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it would be the worst possible scenario."" At the moment it's the most likely scenario.Helsinki now faces time pressure on a number of issues. Aside from waiting on the holdout allies, Niinisto has three months from the date of this parliamentary approval to sign the accession protocol himself and have it deposited in Washington, D.C.He has said he wants the process finished by April, when Finland holds parliamentary elections, so that the Finnish flag can be raised at NATO headquarters while those who made it happen are still in office.Edited by: Ruairi Casey",2023/03/01,,

That move could see him forced out of his current residence, the 30-room Royal Lodge, also on the Windsor estate, due to its massive upkeep costs.Andrew reportedly wants to keep living at the Royal Lodge.Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on the reports.lo/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/01,,

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused them of being a haven for Kurdish militants.While Turkey has so far held off on ratifying both countries' applications to NATO, it has indicated that it is ready to accept Finland.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday that Ankara was now favorable to Finland's bid, adding: ""We may separate Sweden and Finland's membership process.""Relations with Sweden, meanwhile, have been strained amid anti-Turkey protests in Sweden. These have involved the hanging of an effigy portraying Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the burning of a Quran in front of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm.Hungary opened the debate on Finland and Sweden's NATO application bids on Wednesday, with the ratification expected between March 6 and 9, although possible delays are expected.Talks between both countries and Turkey are expected to resume at about the same time.rc/ar (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",2023/03/01,,

I love France more than anything … but I can no longer support the current system which is far from meeting the requirements of the top level. It is a sad day but it's necessary for my mental health.""Those were the damning words of France captain Wendie Renard on social media last week as the defender announced her withdrawal from the French national team just months ahead of the World Cup, accompanied by two teammates.""I no longer share the values conveyed by the team's management,"" said forward Marie-Antoinette Katoto, while fellow attacker Kadidiatou Diani said she would be prepared to return to the team once ""necessary, far-reaching changes"" have been made.Although neither Renard, Katato nor Diani mentioned her by name, it was clear who the criticism was aimed at: Corinne Diacre, the authoritarian head coach whose position is looking increasingly precarious.The 48-year-old, who herself made 121 appearances for Les Bleues as a player, became the first woman to coach a men's professional team when she took over second-division side Clermont Foot in August 2014, before accepting the women's national team job in 2017.Renowned as a tough disciplinarian – she kicked former captain Amandine Henry out of the squad in a 15-minute phone call after Henry had criticized her ""tactless and hard-as-granite"" style following France's exit from the 2019 World Cup on home soil – she's been unable to lead the Equipe Tricolore to a major final, most recently losing to Germanyin the semifinal of Euro 2022 in England.""We have some of the best players in Europe, perhaps the world, but we're not having any success,"" criticized Jean-Michel Aulas, president of Olympique Lyon and influential member of the French Football Federation's (FFF) executive committee, telling sports newspaper L'Equipe that Diacre was now in an ""unrecoverable situation.""And now, following the forced resignation of FFF president Noel Le Graet on the back of allegations of ""inappropriate behavior towards women"" including sexual harassment, Diacre's chair is wobbling more than ever.Le Graet, FFF boss since 2011, has been a long-time backer of Diacre and first proposed her for the national team job in 2016. Following the disappointment of Euro 2022, it was the 81-year-old who ensured that Diacre's contract be extended until the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.Following the resignations of Le Graet, Renard, Katoto and Diani, however, she might not even make this year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.An FFF committee is set to decide her future by March 9.This article was originally written in German and adapted by Matt Ford",2023/03/01,,

Bishops and other Vatican managers currently pay subsidized rents.Vatican-owned apartments would now be rented out at the public rates that apply to renters with no connection to the church.Two years ago, Francis ordered cardinals to take a 10% pay cut and reduced the salaries of other clerics working in the Vatican to save employees' jobs.That decision was partly driven by the impact of the coronavirus on the Holy See's income.Since he took over the papacy, Francis has made various changes torestructure Vatican finances and make them more transparent.His hand was also forced after a cardinal, and nine others were caught in a London property scandal.lo/ar (KNA, Reuters)",2023/03/01,,

The girl was found with open sores on her body, surrounded by junk food wrappers, bottles of urine and soiled toilet pads for house-training puppies.The jury was told that when she was discovered, the girl's body was covered in flies and maggots. Her cause of death was linked to inflammation and ulcers stemming from obesity.The 4'8"" (146 centimeter) tall girl weighed 146 kilograms (321 pounds) at the time of her death.The teen had been born with spinal bifida, which causes spinal and neurological problems, and as a result she suffered hydrocephalus, or the build-up of fluid on the brain.Titford had been attending a regular school just months before the coronavirus lockdown began in March 2020. There, authorities said, she was popular with her classmates and was known for her wheelchair basketball skills.The girl's father, Alun Titford, a 45-year-old moving company employee, told the court ""I'm lazy"" before admitting that he stopped caring for his daughter when she reached puberty.He pleaded not guilty in the case, though later admitted his role in the girl's death.He was found guilty of manslaughter and gross negligence and handed a seven-and-a-half-year sentence.The mother, 40-year-old Sarah Loyd-Jones, who pleaded guilty, was given a six-year jail sentence.Among other things, the court was read text message exchanges in which the daughter's pleas for help drew mocking derision from her mother, who refused to help.Local media reported that Lloyd-Jones' lawyer Lewis Power argued she suffered from low intellect and depression.""During the lockdown period, when so many people suffered not just mentally but in socialization, she became gradually overwhelmed. Her coping strategies coupled with lockdown led her to develop major depression and she was no longer able to care for her daughter’s needs.""""It escalated,"" said Powell, ""to the horrendous situation where she withdrew from her everyday responsibilities and led the catastrophic outcome. She accepts she neglected her duties of looking after her daughter.""The media outlet WalesOnline reported that Judge Griffiths cited the mitigating factors of Loyd-Jones' guilty plea as well as a diagnosis for depression in handing down her lighter sentence.The case highlights the consequences of a lack of government oversight.Social services, for instance, had failed to check in on the family for years. No one followed up on the case when the girl stopped visiting her nutritionist and physiotherapist.Swansea Crown Court Presiding Judge Martin Griffiths, who called the case ""horrifying,"" said the girl had suffered ""a long and sustained period of criminal negligence"" at the hands of her parents, who simply ignored the stench as her body ""rotted away alive"" from ulcers.""By the time of her death,"" said Judge Griffiths, ""she was lying in her own filth, surrounded by flies which bothered her and maggots which fed on her.""Griffith cited the repulsive nature of the case in declaring that jury members would be exempted from jury duty for the next 10 years.This report contains material from the AFP news agency.Edited by: Amanda Rivkin",2023/03/01,,

But the crisis is more acute in Australia because its academic year starts in February, not September as in North America and Europe.Zhang said she ""went into panic mode"" as the rule change, after three years of COVID-19 border closures, meant she and about 40,000 other Chinese students also heading to Australia would all be looking for a place to stay.""I knew that finding a rental in Australia won't be easy, but I didn't expect it to be this difficult. Some are subletting their living rooms or balconies. I don't think I can do that,"" Zhang, 25, said via telephone from her home in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong.""I have been looking for a room for about a month now and I have given up,"" added Zhang, who has enrolled for a master's degree in marketing at the University of New South Wales. ""If I get desperate, I could even sleep rough on the streets, like under some bridge, or outside the Chinese consulate.""The University of New South Wales, which welcomed a quarter of its students from China until 2020, said its on-campus accommodation was full and it was refurbishing university apartments to rent to foreign students.A spokesperson for Sydney University, also with a fourth of its students coming from China, said its 2,400 dormitory beds near campus were taken and that it had booked another 700 with third-party providers and negotiated discounts with hotels to accommodate the influx.Analysts say even those planning to defer a semester may struggle to find a bed since many construction projects for foreign students stalled during the pandemic and it takes at least four years to complete one.Conal Newland, national head of Operational Capital Markets at Savills Australia, said the property agency was seeing unprecedented demand. ""It's a perfect storm.""'BIG RUSH'The shortage has meanwhile jumpstarted one of the few subsets of Australian residential property, the student accommodation sector, that languished during COVID.Before 2020, Chinese students accounted for about 40% of the A$40 billion ($27 billion) Australia made educating foreigners annually. That shrank amid COVID-related border restrictions to less than a quarter of the market, which itself halved, hurt also by worsening diplomatic relations.But China's reopening has raised the issue about the availability of beds in a ""welcome sign"" for investors, said Brad Williams, managing director of AMP Capital's diversified infrastructure trust, Australia's third-largest owner of purpose-built student accommodation.Tomas Johnsson, CEO of UniLodge Australia, the country's biggest operator of purpose-built student accommodation, said some developers were even paying more to speed up construction.Highlighting the rush for accommodation, Louis Liu, 22, a Chinese student in Brisbane, and others have started attending property viewings on behalf of students on the mainland. Liu said she films two viewings per day, for up to A$40 a piece.In the broader property market, where most foreign students stay, rents are forecast to jump 11.5% in 2023, Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX economists say, the fastest-ever two-year increase. They rose about 10% last year.Sydney real estate agent Joe Du said he rented a one-bedroom apartment to the mother of a Chinese student for A$1,050 per week, about 40% more than the next most expensive one-bedroom apartment in the neighbourhood. Public records show the unit rented for A$540 in 2022.""We told her there was no need to bid this high, but she is genuinely concerned that her kid might not have a place to stay,"" said Du.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825024,South Korea Feb factory activity shrinks for 8th month,"SEOUL, March 2 (Reuters) - South Korea's factory activity contracted for an eighth month in February, a survey showed on Thursday, highlighting weak domestic and global economic conditions even though the downturn in output and orders eased slightly.
The S&P Global's seasonally adjusted purchasing managers' index (PMI) for South Korean manufacturers stood at 48.5 in January, unchanged from December and remaining below the 50-mark since July, 2022.
The 50-level separates expansion from contraction.
Sub-indexes showed output fell for a tenth month but at a slightly milder pace than a month before, while new orders shrank for an eighth month, with its pace also easing. New orders for exports fell for a 12th month, though the downturn eased from the previous two months.
""PMI survey data for February continued to depict subdued operating conditions in the South Korean manufacturing sector,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
""On a more positive note, South Korean goods producers signalled softer albeit still sharp rises in prices midway through the first quarter.""
Soft domestic and global economic conditions and inflationary pressures, often caused by exchange rate weakness, were linked to subdued overall demand, according to the survey. Currency weakness was cited as a key driving force behind the latest drop in demand from overseas.
Reflecting weak demand, backlogs of work fell at the sharpest pace since July 2020, and stocks of finished goods jumped by the most since November 2007.
The input price inflation softened for a fourth month to the weakest level since November 2020. However, the rise in operating expenses remained sharp overall, largely pressured by a weak exchange rate and rising raw material prices.
At the same time, the rate of output price inflation also softened, with the latest increase the second-weakest in 27 months.
Manufacturers' optimism about future output over the coming year rose for a second month to the highest level in five months, helped by hopes of a domestic and global economic recovery.SEOUL, March 2 (Reuters) - South Korea's factory activity contracted for an eighth month in February, a survey showed on Thursday, highlighting weak domestic and global economic conditions even though the downturn in output and orders eased slightly.The S&P Global's seasonally adjusted purchasing managers' index (PMI) for South Korean manufacturers stood at 48.5 in January, unchanged from December and remaining below the 50-mark since July, 2022.The 50-level separates expansion from contraction.Sub-indexes showed output fell for a tenth month but at a slightly milder pace than a month before, while new orders shrank for an eighth month, with its pace also easing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825034,US seeks allies' backing for possible China sanctions over Ukraine war,"The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four U.S. officials and other sources.The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of 7 (G7), to coordinate support for any possible restrictions.It was not clear what specific sanctions Washington will propose. The conversations have not been previously disclosed.The U.S. Treasury Department, a lead agency on the imposition of sanctions, declined to comment.Washington and its allies have said in recent weeks that China was considering providing weapons to Russia, which Beijing denies. Aides to U.S. President Joe Biden have not publicly provided evidence.They have also warned China directly against doing so, including in meetings between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as during a Feb. 18 in-person meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of a global security conference in Munich.The Biden administration's initial steps to counter Chinese support for Russia have included informal outreach at the staff and diplomatic levels, including the Treasury Department, sources familiar with the matter said.They said officials were laying the groundwork for potential action against Beijing with the core group of countries that were most supportive of sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine a year ago.Asked about the consultations, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said Russia's war made it difficult for China with Europe and others.""It's a distraction for China and a potential blow to their international relationships they do not need nor should they want,"" the spokesperson said.INTELLIGENCEOne official from a country consulted by Washington said that they had only seen scant intelligence backing up the claims about China considering possible military assistance to Russia. A U.S. official, however, said they were providing detailed accounts of the intelligence to allies.China's role in the Russia-Ukraine war is expected to be among the topics when Biden meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House on Friday. Before that in New Delhi on Wednesday and Thursday, the war will be discussed by foreign ministers from dozens of countries, including Russia, China and the United States.Last week China issued a 12-point paper calling for a comprehensive ceasefire that was met with scepticism in the West.The initial outreach by Washington on sanctions has not yet led to broad agreement on any specific measures, the sources said.One source said the administration wanted to first raise the idea of coordinated sanctions and ""take pulses"" in the event that any shipments are detected to Russia from China, which declared a ""no limits"" partnership shortly before the invasion on Feb. 24 last year.""On the G7 front, I think there is real awareness,"" a second source said, but added that detailed measures focused on China were not yet in place.COULD CHINA TILT CONFLICT?The Ukraine conflict has settled into grinding trench warfare. With Russia running low on munitions, Ukraine and its supporters fear that supplies from China could tilt the conflict to Russia's advantage.As part of a related diplomatic push, Washington won language in a Feb. 24 G7 statement to mark the war's first anniversary that called on ""third-countries"" to ""cease providing material support to Russia's war, or face severe costs.""Though the statement did not mention China by name, the U.S. imposed new penalties on people and companies accused of helping Russia evade sanctions. The measures included export curbs on companies in China and elsewhere that will block them from buying items, such as semiconductors.""We've tried to signal very clearly, both in private in Munich, and then publicly, our concerns,"" Daniel Kritenbrink, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told Congress this week. ""We've talked about the implications and the consequences if they were to do so. And we also know that many of our like-minded partners share those concerns.""Among the challenges the United States faces in putting sanctions on China, the world's second-biggest economy, is its thorough integration in the major economies of Europe and Asia, complicating the talks. U.S. allies from Germany to South Korea are reticent to alienate China.Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert under former President Donald Trump, said the Biden administration does have scope for economically restricting private actors within China and that doing so could deter the government and banks from providing further support.""Then the administration can send messages to China in public and in private, with the latter being more explicit, that the U.S. will escalate the sanctions to include targeting Chinese banks with the full range of available options,"" said Ruggiero, now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies group.Washington should make China choose between access to the U.S. financial system or aiding Russia's war, Ruggiero said, citing the sanctions approach to Iran and North Korea.(Reporting by Michael Martina and Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Don Durfee and Grant McCool)",2023/03/02,626,World

Moriarty, retires, the institute said. Described by Bloomberg as ""particularly Hawkish"" toward China, Rosenberger will take the role at a time of increasingly vocal support for Taiwan from U.S. lawmakers and military figures, and during a historical low point in U.S.-China relations.Rosenberger’s departure from her position as the White House Senior Director for China and Taiwan on the National Security Council was reported on Feb. 15. At the time it was speculated that her departure was in preparation for taking the top spot at AIT.Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) and National Security Council Secretary General Wellington Koo (顧立雄) reportedly met with Rosenberger on Feb. 21 during a meeting at the Washington headquarters of AIT, in which they held talks with other senior Biden administration officials. The talks lasted several hours, but no public statement about the meeting was issued.Rosenburger made her most recent trip to the region in December when she visited China with Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink to discuss the eventually scrapped Blinken visit to Beijing and other issues. According to a Chinese foreign ministry statement, Taiwan was discussed during the meeting.A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the talks were frank and wide ranging. “Assistant Secretary Kritenbrink and Senior Director Rosenberger made clear that the United States would continue to compete vigorously, stand up for U.S. interests and values, defend the rules-based international order, and coordinate closely with allies and partners,” the spokesperson said.Reuters reported sources who said that Rosenberger would work to push through a backlog of arms sales from the U.S. to Taiwan. As of November, nearly US$19 billion (NT$582 billion) of weapons Taiwan had purchased from the U.S. were being held up, mainly due to U.S. support for Ukraine.",2023/03/02,900,Politics

It would serve the interest of the U.K. to facilitate bilateral cooperation in this regard, CNA quoted him as saying.Fiona Quimbre, a RAND Corporation analyst who also attended the hearing on U.K. universities’ engagement with autocracies, sounded the alarm about China’s talent recruitment schemes, the workings of student clubs, donations to and investments in schools, and how Beijing uses connections to influence the focus of the U.K.’s academic research.Taiwan has been quick to fill the gap as the world grows wary of the Beijing-linked Confucius Institutes.Last year, a group of British MPs were in talks with Taiwan about providing Mandarin teachers as the U.K. government sought to close the institutes. The Taiwanese government has been expanding the presence of the Taiwan Center for Mandarin Learning overseas, having set up 54 units in the U.S. and 12 in Europe.",2023/03/02,953,Politics

He said this is mainly due to Chinese air pollution and represents the third such intensive wave of pollution arriving from China.Cheng predicted that the impact of the air pollution will be exacerbated by the recent dry weather in Taiwan.The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) also said that due to the impact of a continental cold air mass, the PM2.5 levels in Shanghai today will range between 80 and 115 micrograms per cubic meter. It warned that northeasterly winds may bring foreign pollutants to Taiwan in the early morning.The EPA stated that poor diffusion conditions and weak wind speed will likely lead to an accumulation of pollutants over the western half of the country, where many orange alerts, of air that is unhealthy for sensitive groups, are likely.

(SGX:CHJ) an investment management group specialising in alternative assets, including shipping and real estate in Japan, Hong Kong and China, is pleased to announce its financial results for the six months and 12 months ended 31 December 2022 (""2H2022"" and ""FY2022"" respectively). FY2022 net profit jumped more than 50% y-o-y to a record high of US$27.9 million, driven by a 24% increase in total income and expansion in net profit margins. Following the strong performance in FY2022, the Group proposed a dividend of S$0.08/share. Together with the interim dividend of S$0.065/share (which was paid in September 2022), the Group has more than doubled its dividend payout from a year ago to S$0.145/share for FY2022.   With the positive performance, the Group generated operating cash flow of US$34.9 million, which further strengthened its financial position. Net debt1 fell to US$25.6 million, while net debt to equity2 fell from 35.5% a year ago to 17.0% as of 31 December 2022. As of 31 December 2022, the Group has net asset value of US$1.92/share.   Charter income increased by 37% y-o-y to US$65.3 million in FY2022, driven mainly by higher average daily charter rates for the Group's portfolio of dry bulk carriers during the year. The average daily charter rate for the Group's 10 consolidated dry bulk carriers was US$18,841/day for FY2022 as compared to US$13,561/day in FY2021, and was 2.5 times that in FY2020. Fee income rose 15% y-o-y to US$6.6 million, driven primarily by an increase in arrangement and agency fees as well as brokerage commissions, as the Group closed more arrangement and brokerage commission deals during the year. Recurring asset management, administration fee income and incentive fees remained relatively stable versus a year ago. The increase in charter income and fee income was partially offset by a decrease in sale of properties under development and lower investment returns. Sale of properties under development was lower due to a weakening of JPY vis-à-vis USD in FY2022, as the properties under development are projects in Japan.   Commenting on the results, Chief Executive Officer of Uni-Asia Group, Mr Kenji Fukuyado said, ""FY2022 has been a stellar year for the Group, as we benefitted from a robust bulk carrier market. The positive performance has strengthened our financial position and fundamentals, providing the Group with reserves to capture new growth opportunities and allowing us to reward our loyal investors with the highest dividend in the Group's history."" Business Outlook While the bulk carrier market started to weaken in 2H2022 due to the softening of seaborne dry bulk trade demand and easing of port congestion, industry experts are cautiously optimistic of an improvement in the bulk carrier market through 2023. One of the key factors include the opening up and an improvement in the Chinese economy, which will help to boost demand for seaborne trade, including the bulk carrier market. In addition, supply-demand factors driving dry bulk shipping are expected to be positive, with dry bulk tonne-miles trade demand projected to grow by 2.0% and 2.2% in 2023 and 2024 respectively, while handysize dry bulk ship supply projected to decline by 0.2% in 2023 and 1.7% in 20243 . New emissions regulations could also further reduce supply in the market through slower speeds and retrofit time.   On the property front, the Group's investments consist of mainly industrial and commercial projects in Hong Kong, as well as small residential property projects in Tokyo, Japan. While Hong Kong's property market has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong remains a major financial hub in Asia and is home to a large number of multinational corporations. The Tokyo property market has been robust, driven by a combination of factors including a strong economy and low interest rates. Despite the impact of the pandemic, Tokyo's property market has remained resilient. ""While the bulk carrier market started on a soft note for 2023, the group is cautiously optimistic that our shipping portfolio's performance will improve through the year, underpinned by the favourable supply dynamics for handysize dry bulk ships. For our property investments, as Hong Kong eases its border controls, we are confident that the commercial/industrial property market could also stabilise in 2023. For the Tokyo real estate market, the Group's trademark small residential property projects – the ""ALERO"" series, as well as property asset management and related property operations, will continue to anchor the bottomline of the Group's Japan property business.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825074,OPPO Pledges Carbon Neutrality Across its Operations by 2050 at MWC 2023,"BARCELONA, SPAIN -    Media OutReach - 1 March 2023 - In recent years, the issue of climate change has gathered momentum, with the frequency of persistent hot weather and climate-related natural disasters drawing worldwide attention to the urgent need for action.          Billy Zhang, President of Overseas Sales and Service at OPPO, releases the OPPO Climate Action Report on the first day of MWC, with congratulation from Steven Moore, Head of GSMA Climate Action        OPPO believes that better environmental protection can only be achieved through the parallel advancement of science and technology. Following years of research and analysis, OPPO released    the OPPO Climate Action Report: Climate Pledges and Low Carbon Development Strategy, at MWC 2023. In the report, OPPO pledges for the first time to achieve carbon neutrality across its global operations by 2050. With technical support from global consultancy Deloitte[1] , the report outlines five key areas in which OPPO will work towards achieving this goal: low-carbon manufacturing, reducing the carbon footprint of products, investing in options that generate less carbon, utilizing digital technology to manage carbon emissions, and collaborating on industry standards to address climate change.       Starting in 2020, OPPO has published a sustainability report each year to publicly disclose its plans and practical progress towards sustainability goals. In 2022, OPPO completed its first global inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and used this data as the scientific basis for its carbon reduction strategy. Now, in the new    Climate Action Report, OPPO pledges to make its operations carbon neutral by 2050.       Commenting on this commitment, Tony Chen, OPPO Founder and CEO, said: ""Achieving our goal of becoming carbon neutral will require both determination and patience. Guided by our mission of 'Technology for Mankind, Kindness for the World', we promise to pursue carbon neutrality with the same zeal and commitment that we invest in our technological innovation.""          OPPO pledges to become carbon neutral across its global operations by 2050 and identifies low carbon development roadmap    Promoting green manufacturing and operations through innovation     OPPO has held onto its global position as the fourth-largest phone manufacturer for two consecutive years，with users in over 60 countries and regions worldwide. As its business grows rapidly, OPPO is equally concerned about how to reduce its environmental impact.       Among the carbon emissions generated by OPPO's various operations, factories and data centers are the two most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 62% and 31.9% respectively. While continuing to drive commercial growth, OPPO is also exploring innovative ways to achieve greener manufacturing and business operations. Through energy saving and emission reduction initiatives, by the end of 2022, OPPO has managed to reduce 6000 tons of greenhouse gas emission from its operation each year. This is equivalent to the amount of greenhouse gas absorbed by 3,330 square kilometers of forest in a year.       Since 2020, OPPO has systematically carried out a series of energy-saving upgrades to key machinery in its factories. One such project has involved automating previously manually operated machines. Compared with manual control, the automated equipment can be set to operate precisely according to the real-time requirement, thus reducing power consumption to the bare minimum. For example, with the automation upgrades introduced to the corner cutting machines, power consumption has fallen by 54%.       In addition, OPPO is also working on the construction of carbon neutral data centers. Its first self-built data center, OPPO Binhai Bay Data Centre not only uses 100% renewable energy, but also continues to explore and apply cutting-edge, low-carbon technology. One of the key outcomes of this exploration has been the research and implementation of immersion cooling technology for GPU server clusters.       We are living in a digital era, with ever-increasing demand for data storage, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing. Thus, the power consumption of data centers and their GPU server clusters is also rising significantly. Not only does this increased power consumption present a major challenge, but we must also work out how to dissipate the heat produced as efficiently as possible. Most traditional data centers rely on mechanical equipment such as fans and air conditioners to cool the building, which in turn consumes more energy and produces higher levels of CO2.       In order to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, OPPO is deploying immersion cooling technology for GPU server clusters in its data center. Immersion cooling technology, which refers to the direct immersion of servers in a non-conductive liquid, directly draws the heat generated during operation away through the liquid, without the need for active cooling by devices such as fans and air conditioners. The liquid that has risen in temperature is cooled by circulation and then returned to continue absorbing thermal energy. The heat recovered is then put to good use in other areas such as heating and hot water provision, significantly improving the energy efficiency of the overall system. The deployment of immersion cooling technology leads to a 45% improvement in energy efficiency, and an industry-leading data center power usage efficiency (PUE) as low as 1.15.          OPPO Binhai Bay Data Center deploys immersion cooling for GPU server clusters    Introducing sustainability into the product management life cycle      While constantly thinking about how to improve the user experience of its products, OPPO also aims to provide greener products. To this end, OPPO has made sustainability a key goal in the life cycle management of its products to minimize their impact on the environment.      While designing the packaging of its products, OPPO follows the internationally recognized green packaging principle of 3R+1D (reduce, reuse, recycle and degradable). In 2023, starting in the European market, nearly all plastics have been removed from the packaging of OPPO's smartphones, making it 100% biodegradable and more eco-friendly. Approximately 45% is also made from recycled fibers, sourced from recycled wastepaper or plant-based materials (such as sugarcane and bamboo byproducts), helping to reduce the demand for raw materials.      OPPO has also made technological breakthroughs aimed at improving the durability of its products. For example, OPPO's proprietary Battery Health Engine technology can maintain 80% of the original battery capacity for up to 1600 charging cycles, significantly extending battery life.           OPPO's progress towards low carbon development        The volume of electronic waste generated globally has grown by 21% over the past 5 years, making it the fastest growing category of household waste[2]. To tackle the problem of e-waste pollution, OPPO has established a number of product recycling systems and launched a trade-in service in both domestic and international markets to promote the recycling of used electronic devices. In 2021, 1.2 million phones were recycled in China, amounting to a total weight of 216 tons. This number rose to 1.3 million phones and 240 tons in 2022. In the EU and other regions, OPPO is involved in the Green Dot program as well as partnering with professional recycling firms to help recycle used products.         For a long time, OPPO has not only been investing in low carbon initiatives but has also taken action to inspire more of its peers. During the Global Mobile (GLOMO) Awards at MWC 2023, OPPO Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Jun Liu, was invited to present the Tech4Good award, recognizing companies that have used technology and innovation to make the world better and to solve global challenges. In recognition of its own efforts, OPPO was also invited to join the judging panels for the Best Mobile Innovation for Climate Action Award and the Outstanding Mobile Contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Award.          Jun Liu, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at OPPO, presents the 2023 GLOMO Tech4Good Award to winners       The road to a greener future is a long one, but with its    Climate Action Report and low carbon development strategy, OPPO is already well on the way to achieving this goal. OPPO is committed to playing its part as it works with both partners and the public to build a better future for all.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825092,Young people demand healthier food environments in East Asia and the Pacific,"Young people co-create and launch a campaign to support UNICEF’s ‘Fix My Food’ initiative for healthier food environments for children in the region  

BANGKOK, THAILAND -  Media OutReach - 2 March 2023 - The food systems in East Asia and the Pacific, known for its diverse and vibrant food culture is changing rapidly. Traditional healthy fresh food diets are being replaced by an increasing consumption of highly processed 'junk' food and drink full of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.            Children across the region, are growing up in food environments that promote the sale and consumption of these 'junk' foods and drinks, rather than healthier alternatives. As a result, more than one in three adolescents are drinking at least one sugary drink a day; more than half consume a fast-food once or more a week; and less than half, are eating enough fruit and vegetables every day.   ""Today, children and young people are surrounded by junk-food marketing wherever they go: online, on their way to school, college or university, on television, and even while standing in the checkout-line of the grocery store. The result is that too many children in East Asia and the Pacific have poor, unhealthy diets that are having a devastating impact on their health and well-being. It is about time that we change this."" shared Ms. Debora Comini, Regional Director, UNICEF East Asia and Pacific.   UNICEF has been working closely with governments and partners to introduce policies and legislation to curb the increase in marketing of unhealthy food and drink, such as bans on advertising and sale of unhealthy foods in and around schools, clear front-of-pack nutrition labelling, and taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages amongst others.   To further promote the need for healthier food environments, UNICEF is supporting the  ""Fix My Food"" campaign led by young people to raise awareness of the need to create healthier food environments in China, Cambodia, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Mongolia, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam.   Young people, together with celebrities and influencers from these eight countries were part of a two-day co-creation ""Fix My Food"" workshop in Bangkok - brainstorming ideas and identifying potential partners to help roll out the campaign in their respective countries.   Chef Nak, Ms. Ros Rotanak, Cambodia's first female celebrity chef, and Miss World Vietnam 2019, Ms. Luong Thuy Linh were also part of the co-creation workshop and launch event.     Sharing her thoughts, Chef Nak said ""I strongly believe in preserving, developing and promoting traditional Khmer cuisine as one of the world's most remarkable culinary traditions. Food is much more than just what we eat. It is an essential part of our culture, our families and our communities. I am happy to support these young champions, to preserve, protect and ensure that our food environment is equally accessible to and benefits all.""   ""I strongly believe in healthy eating and healthy lifestyles and have joined this campaign with the hope that together we will be able to change our failing food system. We need to ensure that people, especially children and young people, have the opportunity and the right to make healthy food choices, wherever they are, at home, in and around schools, and in their communities,"" stated Ms. Linh, Miss World Vietnam 2019.   With the young people leading the  ""Fix My Food"" campaign and support from celebrities and influencers, UNICEF hopes to create awareness on the impact of the changing food environment in the lives of girls and boys and the urgent need for governments, the private sector and civil society to take collective action to build a healthier food environment across the region.   Speaking at the event, 24-year-old Mr. Ricardo Valente, from Timor-Leste said ""This campaign is unique, it is designed and led by us and will be implemented by each of us, back in our own countries. We are excited about being part of this movement to make the food environment healthier and more accessible for every child and every young person in East Asia and the Pacific.""   As part of UNICEF's work to mobilize and empower young people to take action, this initiative will be implemented in the eight participating countries and will be supported by UNICEF country offices and partners.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825114,Taiwan rebukes Japanese report about retired military officials selling out country,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Veterans Affairs Council (VAC) Minister Feng Shih-kuan (馮世寬) on Thursday (March 2) denounced a Nikkei report that suggested a widespread tendency among retired Taiwanese military officials to sell out their country.In a series of reports unveiling “the unknown truths of Taiwan” starting on Tuesday (Feb. 28), the Nikkei alleged in an article that up to 90% of retired Taiwanese military officials provide intelligence to China for profit.The article said that top positions in the Taiwan defense ministry have long been held by “Chinese mainlanders,” referring to those migrating to Taiwan after 1945. An army led by such personnel could not possibly be able to fend off Chinese invaders, it said, citing unspecified military sources.According to the Nikkei report, a retiree from the Army said there are still “many spies out there in Taiwan’s military” assisting China. This is the reason the U.S. has been circumspect in its arms sales and aid to Taiwan for fear that intelligence might be leaked to Beijing.Asked to comment on such allegations at a legislative interpellation, Feng, who previously served as Taiwan’s defense minister, appeared irate, rebutting them as “nonsense,” according to CNA.However, Beijing has been recruiting Taiwanese military personnel. Only last week, a former Taiwan Army colonel who had signed statements that guaranteed his surrender to China in a potential cross-strait conflict was sentenced to seven years and six months in jail on corruption charges.Taiwan’s defense ministry on Wednesday (March 1) rejected relevant claims as “fabricated” and hurting the morale of the country’s armed forces. The foreign ministry also slammed the Nikkei for carrying “unverified, misleading” reports and demanded clarifications from the Japanese newspaper.",2023/03/02,3449,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825142,China's Feb incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ up by 61% from 2022,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Incursions by Chinese military aircraft into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) in February increased by over 61% from a year earlier, consistent with a long-term trend line of increasing intrusions.In February, 113 Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) military planes breached Taiwan's ADIZ. That represents a 61.42% increase over the 70 reported by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) in February 2022 and a 182.5% increase from the 40 recorded in February 2021.On Wednesday (March 1), open-source intelligence expert Damien Symon uploaded a map to his Twitter account showing the location of all 113 intrusions by PLAAF aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ. The majority of encroachments occurred in the southwest corner of the zone.There was also a cluster of flights that took place off the northwest coast of Taiwan that crossed the median line. There were a few longer-range flights that covered large swathes of the southeast corner of the ADIZ.The only sector that did not report trespassing by PLAAF aircraft was the eastern portion of the ADIZ. The northeast corner of Taiwan's ADIZ directly borders Japan's southwest ADIZ, which has also been the scene of a large number of incursions by Chinese military aircraft.For his January map, Symon included flights by Chinese military aircraft through the Miyako Strait in Japan's southwest ADIZ. The strait runs between Miyako Island and Okinawa.Chinese military aircraft violations of both Taiwan and Japan ADIZs. (Twitter, Damien Symon image)A chart created by Ben Lewis, an independent defense analyst, shows that the trend line for violation by Chinese military aircraft of Taiwan's ADIZ is steadily rising. The approximate total of PLAAF sorties into Taiwan's ADIZ from 2018 to 2023 has reached 3,341.The most frequently spotted Chinese military aircraft over this period was the Shenyang J-16 jet fighter with 1,018 sightings. This was followed by the Shaanxi Y-8 anti-submarine warfare plane with 370 sightings, Shenyang J-11 fighter jet with 336, Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jet with 294, and Chengdu J-10 fighter jet at 275, rounding out the top five.(Twitter, Ben Lewis image)Symon has also created a map showing all ADIZ violations in 2022 which follows the same pattern, with the notable exception of closer flights that took place after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. Lewis' chart also shows a dramatic spike of 446 PLAAF aircraft spotted in the August to September period.Chinese military aircraft intrusions into Taiwan ADIZ in 2022.

Because there are children who frequent the area, the author expressed concern about their safety, and he reported the case to the animal protection office, according to ETtoday.The cobra is one of the six most venomous snake species native to Taiwan. Because they dwell in low-altitude areas of the country that typically have a high population density, they are often seen by the public.Some Taiwanese netizens on Breaking News Commune were frightened by the photos, making comments such as, ""They even come out in winter, you really have to be careful,"" and, ""It's so scary. It looks like a dangerous place, and it's best not to take children there.""However, others had sympathy for the wild animal, ""Looking at it from another perspective, it is we who have disturbed its life,"" and, ""Are snakes disturbing humans or are humans destroying the ecology?"".Cobra seen next to lamp post.

  SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 2 March 2023 -    Backbase, the Engagement Banking leader, was again ranked as a leader in the Omdia Universe: Digital Banking Platforms, 2023. The report recommends Backbase as a candidate in all digital banking vendor shortlists, particularly for financial institutions seeking a wide-ranging platform that can be co-innovated for specific business goals. Backbase has continued to receive strong recognition by the analyst community as the innovation partner to help banks win in the platform era.   Consumers in APAC have high expectations towards banking services rendered to them, with leading banks continuously upgrading their banking technology to offer advanced banking and beyond banking experience to retain their customers. Built as one unified platform to engage and orchestrate frictionless experiences across all touchpoints at every stage of the customer lifecycle across retail banking, business banking, digital lending, and wealth management, Backbase has helped 150+ banks around the globe and in APAC rearchitect banking around their customers.   Backbase scored consistently strongly across all areas of the evaluation and achieved the highest overall ratings for solution capability and customer experience, according to report authors, Philip Benton and Ouliana Smith. The report credits Backbase retaining its leadership status to its strong solution capabilities and breadth of out-of-the-box journeys, combined with the ability to further customize. The breadth of the Engagement Banking Platform has increased significantly through investment in its off-the-shelf capabilities and its partner ecosystem, they further noted.   “From analyst evaluations, it is clear that all digital banking platforms are not made equal. The Backbase Engagement Banking Platform has been instrumental in modernizing the customer experience for our banking customers in Asia Pacific, launching them into banks of the future. Techcombank for instance comes up often in discussions as a bank which is leading in digital banking transformation, and that, to us, is success, “Riddhi Dutta, Regional Vice President, Asia, Backbase said. “The value Backbase brings is to provide efficiencies and innovation beyond basic digitalization of banking products, in order for banks to differentiate their digital banking services whether deployed on-premise, hybrid or in the cloud. We offer banks the power to hyper-personalize and secure a 360-degree unified view of customers across all lines of business and channels for a truly digital-first experience.”   Omdia recognizes the uniqueness of the Backbase Engagement Banking Platform, as it has been ""designed on a single omnichannel banking platform architecture, as opposed to being built through acquisitions. The platform was created specifically for digital banking and as a facilitator to enable strong customization.""   The report cited banks’ prioritization of enhancing platform functionality to aid self-service and integrating digital banking with other channels to improve sales productivity. For most financial institutions, the authors added, it is not just about choosing the best off-the-shelf product; it’s also necessary to consider a vendor’s ability to enable and drive innovation, offer strong user experience, and provide advice on how to launch new products and services quickly and effectively.

            The sale will also include 23 HARM training missiles, four AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM Guidance Sections, 26 LAU-129 multi-purpose launchers, other relevant equipment, and technical and logistical support, the U.S. Defense and Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a press release. The possible deal will cost a total of US$619 million (NT$19 billion).

            The DSCA said the proposed sale “serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.” It added that the potential sale will help bolster Taiwan’s security and aid in “maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region.”

            The proposed sale will also boost Taiwan’s air defense capabilities and its ability to maintain regional security and interoperability with the U.S., DSCA said. It pointed out that the additional HARM and AIM-120C8 missiles would not affect the military balance in the region.











            The main contractors will be Raytheon Missiles and Defense, based in Tucson, Arizona, and Lockheed Martin Corporation in Bethesda, Maryland.

            Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) thanked the U.S. government for remaining steadfast in its commitments in the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. MOFA pointed out that this is the first potential U.S. arms sale in 2023 and the ninth announced sale under the Biden administration.

            In the face of China's continuous military expansion and provocative behavior, Taiwan will continue to strengthen its defense capabilities and simultaneously deepen its close security partnership with the U.S., MOFA said. Taiwan will also help defend the international rules-based order to ensure peace, stability, and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation?s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.You Can Browse The Sample Report here:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis366486In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Visual Effects (VFX) Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

In terms of ICT Revenue in Europe in 2021, Germany came in first place with US$ 339,074 million. Positions 2, 3, and 4 in this ranking were held by the United Kingdom, France, and Ireland, respectively. Since 2016, Malta has increased by 16.5% year over year, while Italy ha s decreased by 0.2%.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world economy continues to suffer from a series of destabilizing shocks, many companies experienced bankruptcy and a sharp decline in turnover. After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federation?s invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.You Can Browse The Sample Report here:-https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis366492In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global  market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.You Can Browse The Sample Report here:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis366498In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Wide Body Aircraft MRO Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Global Longwave Infrared (LWIR) Technology Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

She hailed Taiwan’s best-ever performance in the index and vowed an effort to continue building an open and fair environment for business and trade while pursuing security in global supply chains.Tsai also expressed hopes to see deepened trade ties between Taiwan and the U.S., building on what has been achieved. The two have proceeded with talks about the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade, the Technology, Trade and Investment Collaboration (TTIC) framework, and the Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue (EPPD).The top ten countries in the 2023 Index of Economic Freedom are Singapore, Switzerland, Ireland, Taiwan, New Zealand, Estonia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825279,Taiwan Ministry of Culture vouchers not valid for foreign movies,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The arts vouchers the Ministry of Culture (MOC) plans to distribute to young people can be used to watch movies, but only Taiwanese ones, reports said Thursday (March 2).The original intention was to hand over culture checks worth NT$1,200 (US$39) to each 18-year-old, but the project’s scope was later expanded to cover all youths from 18 to 21, as well as those born between Sept. and Dec. 2001, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported. The change caused the budget to balloon from NT$200 million to NT$900 million, per the Liberty Times.Responding to questions from lawmakers Thursday about how the vouchers would help support the local arts scene, Culture Minister Shih Che (史哲) noted the program would reach out beyond chain bookstores that benefited from the Arts Fun vouchers launched during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new vouchers would also involve smaller, independent bookshops, he said.The minister emphasized that the culture checks were necessary to help an already vulnerable sector overcome the damage inflicted during the pandemic and the adaptation of consumer habits that followed it.Shih told legislators he wanted to encourage young people to pay more attention to culture, and hoped they would watch more movies. Pressed by the lawmakers, he confirmed the vouchers would only be valid for the viewing of Taiwanese films.As to the timing of the vouchers, Shih named June as the target date, though he acknowledged distribution channels still had to be strengthened in more remote areas of the country.",2023/03/02,1009,Culture

They are expected to use the summit to discourage Beijing from intervening in the war, which began more than a year ago.Host India has refused to condemn the Russian invasion and has called for talks to de-escalate the conflict. This has put New Delhi in an awkward position with Western nations. However, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was confident India would ""make Russia understand this war has to finish.""Borrell told reporters that ""the success of the meeting today will be measured in respect to what we will be able to do on that."" He is scheduled to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on the sidelines of the gathering.Chinese state news agency Xinhua last week quoted top diplomat Wang Yi as saying Beijing was willing to ""strengthen strategic coordination"" with Russia after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had no plans to privately meet with his Russian counterpart, Lavrov. The last time the two met at a G20 gathering in Bali, Lavrov had stormed off, according to officials.""If Russia — President Putin — were genuinely prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy necessary to end the aggression, of course we'd be the first to work to engage, but there's zero evidence of that,"" Blinken said.""Last week, a year since the start of the Russian offensive, a large majority of nations at the UN General Assembly called out this brutal war for what it is,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.Other topics of discussion at the meeting include the climate crisis, and food, energy and fertilizer security.""The G20 was created to give the world hope that our most pressing problems could be resolved. That is why I am traveling to Delhi to put forward Germany's priorities: we are working on solutions to the debt crisis because far too many countries are at risk of collapsing under their huge debt burden,"" Baerbock said.India had wanted its G20 presidency this year to focus on issues such as alleviating poverty and climate finance, but the Ukraine war has so far crowded out other agenda items.G20 finance ministers met in Bengaluru last week, but failed to agree on a common statement due to a lack of consensus on Russia. A ""chair's summary and outcome document"" was issued instead.tg/nm  (dpa, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/02,,

It was a very difficult period, and every Ukrainian experienced this difficulty, but we were still able to provide Ukraine with power and heat,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday during his daily address.Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the first day of spring as a ""major defeat"" for Russia's ambitions in Ukraine.""We survived the most difficult winter in our history,"" he said in a statement.

All locations to be used in the series of exercises have been named as “red beaches,” inspired by the 2017 Ian Easton book “The Chinese Invasion Threat: Taiwan’s Defense and American Strategy in Asia,” the Liberty Times reported.Easton mentioned 14 beaches and coastal areas in Taiwan likely to provide potential invaders with an opportunity to set up a beachhead, while emphasizing that most of the country’s coastline would pose grave problems.The Amphibious 151st Fleet will start its exercises around Zhuwei from March 8 to 9, moving on to Zhiben for a second round on April 12 to 13. Due to the nature of the Navy unit, the Liberty Times concluded the drills would be designed to counter a Chinese invasion.Separately, the Ministry of National Defense is also planning maneuvers off Taiwan’s southwest coast for March 27 to 31 by the 192nd Fleet, a unit specializing in minesweeping.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825401,OctaFX: 5 ways traders fall prey to their emotions and make mistakes,"KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 2 March 2023 - In anticipation of a webinar series on trading psychology by trading expert Gero Azrul, OctaFX presents a comprehensive guide to identifying and overcoming emotions that harm your trading.              Developing a trading strategy is not enough to succeed as a trader. The strategy will give you consistent positive results only after you master the psychology of trading and overcome emotions that negatively impact your decision-making process. Fear, greed, and various biases all affect how you perceive the market and open orders. To handle them and maintain financial discipline, traders use several techniques that the OctaFX expert Gero Azrul will describe at length during the eleven-part  webinar series on trading psychology starting on March 3, 2023.   Let's describe the most common trading psychology mistakes and some ways to avoid them.   Five ways your emotions can influence your trading   At the moment when you have to press that 'buy' or 'sell' button, emotions hit different. Your brain tells you stories of imminent success and utter failure, causing you to make impulsive trading decisions. At the core of it, there are five ways emotions can influence your trading:      Fear of missing out (FOMO). Traders sometimes open new orders when they feel they could earn on a particular market movement, often promoted by financial influencers on social media. However strong it may seem, it is better to avoid placing orders on rumours and first carry out thorough analysis and use risk management tools.         Relying on gut feeling and intuition. This is never a good way of conducting trading activities. As lucky as one might be, after a few winning trades, there will inevitably be a streak of losing ones wiping away all profits and possibly resulting in greater losses.         Gambler's fallacy. Some traders erroneously believe that just because they had several losing trades in a row, the next one would be a winning one. However, the streak of orders-gone-red might not end until the whole deposit is spent.         Hindsight analysis. It often seems easy to identify good entry points for orders in the past. Consequently, trading might seem simpler than it is to beginners, which could lead to upsetting results. While such analysis can be helpful, you should always have a consistent strategy to base your decisions on, as you will likely give way to emotions in the real-time, high-pressure market environment.         Keeping your orders open for too long. Seeking proof that you are right and staying in a trade for too long could result in a costly mistake. Try to stay objective and exit a trade when it's gone past your acceptable loss level.        How to avoid trading psychology mistakes   There are several ways you can put your emotions under control when trading.      Develop a trading strategy and keep to it. A well-defined trading strategy will help you stay focused on your goals and prevent impulsive decisions. Your trading plan should include clear entry and exit points, risk management techniques you are going to use, and a trading schedule based on your preferred time frames and instruments.         Capital protection comes first at all times. Before trying to maximise your profits, ensure your trading capital is protected. A good rule of thumb is to use no more than 4% of your capital on a single trade and keep your loss-per-trade at a maximum of 25%. If you quit it every time it gets there, no matter how you feel about the future market movement, your capital will be quite safe.         Keep a trading journal. A trading journal can help you analyse your trading performance and identify areas for improvement. Keep track of your trades, including entry and exit points, the reason for the trade, and its outcome.         Take a break when you need one. You are more likely to make mistakes if you are stressed or tired. If you have a series of consecutive losing orders, you might also need a break. Get some rest from the emotional pressure and carefully analyse what happened.         Learn from your mistakes. They are inevitable. Remember that mistakes are there to help you refine your trading approach and make it more profitable.        'Trading psychology is critical in achieving your trading goals. Traders who can successfully manage their emotions are more likely to succeed in the long run. However, it is a wide-ranging topic with its points of application on every level of the trading process,' Gero Azrul commented.   In his  webinar series, Gero Azrul will talk in detail about various psychological techniques and ways to make trading less stressful and more effective, as well as show practical examples of implementing those.

Make sure to keep this area clean and free of any potential hazards.Socialization and training are important for helping your pet develop healthy behaviors and relationships with humans and other animals. Start socializing your pet early by introducing them to new people, animals, and environments. This can help your pet become more comfortable and confident in new situations.Enrolling your pet in obedience training or working with a professional trainer can help address any behavior problems and help your pet develop good habits. Make sure to use positive reinforcement training techniques and avoid punishment-based methods.Dental care is often overlooked but is essential for maintaining your pet’s overall health. Poor dental hygiene can lead to tooth decay, gum disease, and other health problems. Regular teeth brushing, using appropriate dental chews, and scheduling regular dental cleanings with your veterinarian can help prevent dental issues and ensure that your pet’s teeth and gums remain healthy.Regular check-ups with your veterinarian are important for monitoring your pet’s health and detecting any potential health problems early. It is recommended to schedule at least one veterinary check-up per year, but older pets or those with underlying health conditions may require more frequent visits. During these check-ups, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam, check vital signs, and may recommend additional testing or vaccinations.Parasites such as fleas, ticks, and worms can cause a range of health problems for your pet, including skin irritation, anemia, and other health issues. Regular use of flea and tick preventives, as well as regular deworming, can help prevent parasite infestations. Talk to your veterinarian about the best parasite prevention plan for your pet.Being prepared for emergencies can help ensure that your pet receives prompt and appropriate care in case of an unexpected illness or injury. Keep a first aid kit on hand that includes basic supplies such as gauze, antiseptic wipes, and bandages. It is also a good idea to have a plan in place for emergencies, such as knowing where the nearest 24-hour veterinary hospital is located.Finally, remember that pets thrive on love and attention. Spend quality time with your pet each day, whether it is playing, cuddling, or simply relaxing together. Your pet will appreciate the time and attention you give them, and it can help strengthen the bond between you and your furry friend.In conclusion, proper pet care involves a combination of nutrition, exercise, preventive care, a safe environment, socialization and training, dental care, regular check-ups, parasite prevention, emergency preparedness, and plenty of love and attention. By following these tips and seeking the advice of your veterinarian, you can help ensure that your pet stays healthy, happy, and well-cared for throughout its life. Remember, pets are a big responsibility, but the love and companionship they provide are worth the effort.",2023/03/02,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825421,Taiwan Banks: Is ESG part of your KYC?,"We have reviewed some aspects of the impact of ESG on Taiwan's banks and now need to take a look at how they should be utilizing and analyzing ESG reports, especially now we are well and truly into 2023.

            But first, we should understand a fundamental process that every bank undertakes with its customers, whether they be corporate entities or individuals. This fundamental process is part of the onboarding of a customer, and it is known as Know Your Customer or KYC in bank jargon.

            If you have recently opened a bank account, you will have been asked to provide a reasonably large amount of physical data (copies of IDs, passports, evidence of address). In addition, you will have filled in a comprehensive set of questionnaires that deal with such issues as the intended use of your account, likely deposit schedules and regular withdrawals.

            If the bank is interested in selling other products to you, they will ask you to complete detailed questions on your risk appetite and your goals for investing.











            This process seems to create agitation, particularly amongst individual and small business customers. As an individual, perhaps you can take some small pleasure in understanding the process for large corporates and listed companies is usually even more detailed.

            The KYC process is mandated by regulators and typically banks take a conservative approach and probably seek to capture even more information than regulations require, but that is up to each individual bank.

            The KYC process also allows banks to “risk rate” their clients, usually into three categories of high, medium, and low. If you are viewed as high risk by your bank, then expect to have your account reviewed and checked on an annual basis (medium risk, usually every three years) (low risk, usually every five years).

            My 30 years of banking experience would lead me to view listed companies as high risk due to the many hurdles they must cross throughout each year to maintain their listing and to ensure they continue to attract investors. So, let’s assume, for the sake of this article, that all Taiwanese listed companies are viewed as high risk by their banks.

            Every year they need to go through this KYC annual review so that their banks remain comfortable retaining the listed company as a client. Yes, it is onerous, but again, it’s an activity expected by the regulators and not an opt-in/opt out activity.
Amended rules

            So, that is just a quick explanation of day-to-day bank activity. Why do I think it is important for you to understand this?

            Well, here we are, already in early March 2023 and listed companies in Taiwan are now required to submit ESG reports. For example, the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) through the Rules Governing the Preparation and Filing of Sustainability Reports by Listed Companies, requires listed companies to submit ESG reports.

            The rules were amended by the TWSE in September 2022 by adding ESG performance indicators to be disclosed in the ESG reports. The aim of the amended rules is to strengthen the disclosure of ESG information.

            Similar rules are to be found in the Taipei Exchange (TPEx) Rules Governing the Preparation and Filing of Corporate Social Responsibility Reports by Listed Companies. Accordingly, in 2023, companies listed on the TWSE and TPEx are required to issue annual ESG reports. These reports must be based on the guidelines set out by:

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), an international independent standards organization that helps businesses, governments and other organizations understand and communicate their impacts on issues such as climate change, human rights, and corruption.
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), an independent nonprofit organization whose mission is to develop and disseminate sustainability accounting standards that help public corporations disclose material, decision-useful information to investors.
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), created in 2015 by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies, banks, and investors in providing information to stakeholders.


            So, the stage is now set for listed Taiwan companies and the ESG reporting that is required of them.
Showing commitment

            But my question is whether Taiwan banks are asking their listed customers for this information as part of either their initial KYC, or per their annual review?

            I acknowledge that perhaps my years in banking have made me somewhat conservative, but I believe Taiwanese banks must be reviewing the ESG reports of their listed customers, and it should become part of best practice (if it is not already being followed).

            The banks should already know the standards for reporting as listed above. If any bank is in doubt, it is time to know and understand those requirements.

            Doing nothing about ESG reporting and waiting for some magical industry wide standard approach is not an option. It must be said that banks, and not just Taiwanese banks, are not that good at cooperating on such issues. Try asking banks about the idea of a centralized onboarding/KYC database and listen to the generally negative responses.

            In my opinion, banks that are not acting now regarding their customer’s ESG reporting standards will attract the unwanted negative attention of both the regulators and the investment community. One possible excuse — although in my opinion, an excuse that does not “hold water” — is the need for additional resources to both analyze and understand ESG reports, even if such resources simply are not available just now.

            Well, there are already quite a few major international ESG rating firms that can provide automated ESG scoring solutions, at a cost, naturally. However, banks should go further.

            They should show their commitment by ensuring they train staff in ESG and the analysis of ESG reports. I know that such staff will command a premium in terms of compensation, but I firmly believe investment in financial technology (FinTech), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and highly trained staff will prove a boon to those banks utilizing such assets in the highly competitive Taiwan banking environment.

            Taiwan banks need to get onboard with KYC/ESG now and senior bank management must step up and meet the challenges as the ESG message must come from the top. Treat your talented ESG staff with the care and respect they deserve. Get on board before the KYC/ESG train leaves the station.

            Again, I fear I sound dogmatic on this issue, and again I make no apologies. It is meant to be dogmatic.

            There are many Taiwan banks that are already taking the correct approach with their KYC and their listed customers’ ESG reports, but I am concerned there may be quite a few that are not as motivated or up to the task. My advice is, resources are available, utilize them and stand out from the crowd.

Temperatures in one carriage rose to 1,300 Celsius after it caught fire, authorities said.To identify some of the victims, relatives had to give DNA samples at a hospital in Larissa.In a televised address on Wednesday night, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis who had earlier visited the site of the crash, said that evidence pointed to a human error.Government spokesman Giannis Oikonomou was expected to update the media at around midday on Thursday.Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis had earlier resigned saying he was taking responsibility for the state's long standing failures to fix a railway system he said ""was not fit for the 21st century.""Nikos Tsouridis, a retired train driver trainer, said drivers involved in the crash had died ""because there were no safety measures.""And why were there no safety measures? The station master made a mistake, he acknowledged it, but surely there should be a safety mechanism to fall back on,"" he said.Greece sold railway operator TRAINOSE under its international bailout programme in 2017 to Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, expecting hundreds of millions of euros to be invested in rail infrastructure in the coming years.The Italian operation has responsibility for passenger and freight, and the Greek state-controlled OSE for infrastructure.",2023/03/02,119,World

Game censorship in China is extremely stringent, and regulatory bodies often ban the licenses of video games that are deemed inappropriate for the cultural development of young gamers. Despite such limitations, China has become one of the largest digital gaming markets in the world, and has grown exponentially in the past few years due to the popularity of mobile games and eSports in the country.The China digital gaming market is classified into three segmentsbased on platforms(PC games, console games, and mobile games),revenue models(freemium, pay to play, and advertising),and game genres(shooter, role-playing, arena-fighting, and others [sports, adventure, strategy, etc.]).Platform Segment Insights
China is a mobile-first country and has the worlds largest mobile subscriber base. The average mobile user owns an affordable handset which allows them to play games on the go. With the increasing availability of reasonably priced yet high-performance smartphones, particularly from home-based brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo, there is high growth potential for Chinas mobile gaming market. The mobile gaming segment is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 20.6% through the forecasted period (2018-2023), and occupy a market share of approximately 74% by 2023. Surprisingly enough, post the lift of the 14-year ban on console games, China is expected to witness a significant boost in its console gaming segment, which is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR during the 2018-2023 period. China-based Subor, which is credited with developing some of the country’s first video game consoles, has already announced the launch of the first high-spec video game console, The Subor Z+.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/china-digital-gaming-market-1/QI042Revenue Model Segment Insights
Chinese gamers categorically demand free-to-play games and make limited in-app purchases. Therefore, the China digital gaming space is largely dominated by the freemium or free-to-play model. This segment is projected to expand at a CAGR of 15.5% during 2018-2023.Game Genre Segment Insights
Although role playing games (RPG) held the largest market share of nearly 40% in the China digital gaming market, due to the availability of a large number of RPG games across PC and mobile platforms, the arena fighting segment is expected to witness a higher growth rate (33.7%) during the forecasted period (2018-2023). Arena games like Kings of Glory/Arena of Valor, League of Legends, etc. from the home company Tencent, have become immensely popular in the country in the last couple of years.

Remote patient monitoring (RPM) occupied a market share of 63% in 2017, being the most prevalent telehealth technology. Recent regulations in countries like the United States (U.S.), Canada, and the United Kingdom (U.K.), mandate the imposition of fines on readmission of patients within 30 days of discharge. These regulations, along with rising healthcare costs, are the significant drivers of RPM adoption. Mobile health (mHealth), having held a market share of 22% in the same year, shows a lot of promise in the wide distribution of medical information to both patients and medical practitioners. Video telemedicine accounted for a share of 15% in 2017.Application segment insights:
The adoption of teledermatology is the highest among the application segments, due to the high cost of specialty healthcare. This segment includes dermatology and makes available advanced imaging technologies. Close on its heels are teleradiology (25%) and telecardiology (24%). Telecardiology is driven by the higher prevalence of cardiac ailments across the world, and specific heart conditions like cardiac arrhythmia which require constant monitoring over a long period. Cancer patients need regular check-ups, which may not be possible for patients who stay far from hospitals. Teleradiology is a boon for these patients, allowing them to lead healthy lives.Regional insights:
North America has exhibited the highest adoption of telehealth market technologies and occupied approximately 49% of the global market in 2017. The region has stringent healthcare regulations, along with a high incidence of chronic diseases and steep healthcare expenses for employers, all of which resulted in the broader implementation of telehealth. Significant government investments in developing telehealth infrastructure have led to the growth of the market in Europe. Currently, the region accounts for a 33% market share. Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa are nascent markets which are expected to exhibit high growth in the future.Request full Report Description, TOC, Table of Figure, Chart, etc. @ -https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/telehealth-market/QI042Table of contentMarket Overview

According to the NASH Education Program, NASH affects around 12% of the worlds adult population. More than 80% of patients with NASH are obese, 44% have type 2 diabetes, and 72% have abnormal blood lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). The increasing prevalence of these ailments is expected to drive the demand for NASH diagnostics over the 2018-2023 period.Programs and initiatives to increase awareness are anticipated to bolster market growth over the forecast period. In 2016, The NASH Education Program was established with the objective of spreading awareness among medical practitioners, patients identified with NASH, and individuals at high risk of developing it. On the other hand, rising investments for the development of accurate, reliable, and readily available diagnostic tests for NASH is expected to drive the market over the forecast period.Diagnostic techniques segment insights:Liver biopsy is one of the broadly accepted diagnostic techniques for NASH detection since it provides accurate results. Liver biopsy is preferred by medical practitioners owing to its ability to determine the degree of steatosis and inflammation accurately. However, the invasive liver biopsy procedure has several disadvantages, such as pain, bleeding, and the possibility of injuring other organs. Thus, the adoption of non-invasive imaging techniques and biomarkers is anticipated to increase significantly. As a result, the market size of the liver biopsy technique is expected to grow at a slower rate than biomarkers, in developed regions like North America and Europe.Companies covered:1. GENFIT SA

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825522,"Traveloka and Philippine Airlines Strengthening their Strategic Cooperation, Supporting Tourism Growth in the Philippines and Southeast Asia","SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 2 March 2023 - Traveloka, Southeast Asia's leading travel platform, is emphasizing its strategic collaboration with Philippine Airlines to provide services to meet travelers' needs.            The initiative with Philippine Airlines, the Philippines' flag carrier and sole full-service network airline, is aligned with Traveloka's commitment to strengthening tourism growth in the Philippines and in the Southeast Asia Region. This strategic cooperation is formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Traveloka and Philippine Airlines that was signed in Manila on Tuesday, 28 February 2023. The MoU was signed by Iko Putera, CEO of Transport Traveloka and Captain Stanley K. Ng, President & COO of Philippine Airlines.   Based on the data from the Philippines Department of Tourism, around 83,000 tourists visited the Philippines from the Southeast Asian region during the early pandemic of 2020, a dramatic drop from the over 526 thousand in 2019 due to global border restrictions. However, by the end of 2022, in line with efforts to recover the economy and tourism sector, the number of Southeast Asian visitors heading to the Philippines reached 188,000 travelers, increasing by more than double.   Iko said that during the post-pandemic period, people's enthusiasm for business and tourism travel has increased along with the return of consumers' confidence in traveling. The surge is mainly driven by the high rate of vaccinations and the re-opening of international borders.   Travel recovery in the Philippines is also seen in Traveloka's internal data from 2021 to 2022. The number of visitors coming to the Philippines from Southeast Asian countries where Traveloka is operating increased by eight times. Meanwhile, the number of passengers using the flight network of Philippine Airlines to various international destinations has almost doubled.   ""Since 2015, Traveloka has expanded to 6 countries in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Our presence in the market shows our commitment to offering services that focus on increasingly dynamic consumer needs. Also, providing easy access through the adoption of technology to fulfill consumers' travel aspirations in Southeast Asia,"" said Iko.   Traveloka understands that consumers have diverse needs and aspirations, including when it comes to planning for their trips. Hence, Traveloka has constantly innovated through its offerings of relevant products while also being open to fostering strategic partnerships and collaborations with various partners in the tourism industry to provide the best service for consumers. One of these strategic partnerships is with Philippine Airlines.   As the most prominent international airline in the Philippines with the largest network of flights to Asia, North America, Australia and the Middle East, Philippine Airlines is always committed to its mission of providing convenience and comfort to consumers, which is constantly a top priority.   Captain Stanley K. Ng, President & COO of Philippine Airlines said, ""We are pleased to forge this new partnership with Traveloka, which will help us fortify our connections with the global market. Philippine Airlines has always made it a top concern to build, sustain and develop the direct air links to countries in the region and beyond, which means reaching out to travellers living all over the world. Our intent is for the partnership to unlock new travel options for our customers to fly with Philippine Airlines to various wonderful destinations all around the Philippines, and to diverse international destinations as well.""   The Philippines is one of the tourist destinations in Southeast Asia that has opened its borders to foreign tourists. This archipelagic country famous for its natural beauty has become an increasingly popular tourist destination worth exploring, from its metropolitan capital city of Manila and longtime popular destinations such as Boracay and Cebu, to various tourist destinations on the rise, such as Siargao, El Nido, Coron, and Balabac Islands.     Recently, Siargao Island has emerged as one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Philippines. Foreign and domestic tourists mingle to surf and enjoy the beauty of the island, making Siargao one of the surfing capitals of the Philippines. El Nido is famous for its spectacular beaches and stunning views of lush tropical islands. A beautiful mix of hidden lagoons, white beaches, and mountains covered by green forest, shading the crystal clear waters. In Coron, tourists are greeted with spectacular underwater views. There are colorful coral gardens, crystal clear water and wrecks of Japanese warships in these waters. In Balabac islands, located at the Southern tip of the Palawan archipelago, tourists are invited to enjoy beaches and small islands that travelers rarely visit.   ""The Philippines is a beautiful country known for its white sandy beaches and amazing natural scenery. Philippine Airlines serves 32 domestic and 39 overseas destinations, a network that makes it convenient for travellers to come to the Philippines and discover the delights of our nation and its warm and friendly people. We look forward to strengthened cooperation with Traveloka that will make it easier for domestic and foreign tourists to visit favorite destinations in the Philippines,"" explained Captain Ng.   In line with the commitment, Iko added, ""Collaboration between Traveloka and the Philippine Airlines provides a variety of choices and flexibility for travelers to be able to enjoy and explore destinations in the Philippines in a more personalized, and unique way. Our platform offers various travel solutions and services, from accommodation options to local activities through Traveloka Xperience. We hope this partnership will positively contribute to tourism recovery in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.""  Hashtag: #Traveloka #MoU #Airlines

Chen told media today that despite not reaching that figure within the predicted timeframe, the population is on track to exceed the 2.5 million mark by around the end of the month.Taipei’s high property prices, relatively low wages, and the relative affordability of nearby New Taipei and Taoyuan are causing people to move away from the city. Not limited to only Taipei, Taiwan itself saw a record population decrease in 2022, dropping by 110,674 people to 23,264,640 in total.The sweetened incentives follow National Development Council predictions that Taiwan’s birthrate may be the lowest in the world by 2035.",2023/03/02,1480,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825534,Taiwan looks to lower COVID category by May,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced that the indoor mask mandate for schools will be lifted on March 6, infection control rules will be relaxed in hospitals in April, and it is planning on lowering COVID's classification in May.At a press conference on Thursday (March 2), CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) said that local COVID cases have steadily dropped. Although Taiwan just had a long weekend for the 228 Memorial Day holiday, Wang said that there does not appear to be an upswing in new cases.Wang said that the outbreak continues to show a flat trend and the number of moderate and severe COVID cases and deaths has decreased in comparison with previous weeks. Therefore, Wang said that the next stages of easing epidemic prevention can be discussed.Wang said the preliminary plan is to loosen regulations in three stages. In the first stage, there will be a loosening of rules in the community with priority given to the completion of a new system exempting mild COVID cases from reporting and quarantine.The second stage will be to loosen requirements in medical institutions, research the establishment of special wards, and revise nosocomial infection control operations. The third stage will be to downgrade the classification of COVID from a Category 5 communicable disease to a Category 4.Wang said that only when COVID is reclassified as a Category 4 communicable disease will the CECC be downsized or disbanded.He pointed out that in April, the World Health Organization will discuss whether to end COVID's designation as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Then, in May, Wang said that the U.S. and Japan would begin to downgrade their classification of the disease.With the loosening of the indoor mask mandate on school campuses on March 6, Wang noted that preparations for the additional easing of regulations will begin next week. He estimated that the first stage of easing epidemic prevention measures will start in March, the second stage will take place in April, and the center will strive to complete the downgrading of COVID by May.Wang added that this process could even occur more rapidly if everything goes smoothly. He added that discussions on the disbanding of the CECC will not be held until these stages are complete.",2023/03/02,2553,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825651,Dispute over a Picasso: Is 'Madame Soler' looted art?,"Madame Soler's gaze is grave, alert and focused. This was the intense look that painter Pablo Picasso captured in 1903 of the wife of his friend, tailor Benet Soler.The portrait, part of Picasso's Blue Period, has since become the subject of a protracted and bitter dispute between the heirs of Jewish banker and art collector Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (1875-1935) and the Bavarian State Painting Collections. Both sides are claiming rightful ownership of ""Madame Soler.""The Bavarian State Painting Collections is the custodian of a large part of the public art collections belonging to the Free State of Bavaria, as well as the Bavarian museums and public art galleries in which these artworks are exhibited.This dispute over ""Madame Soler"" is complicated because the parties disagree on whether the painting was sold under duress — in the context of the persecution and dispossession of Jews in Nazi Germany starting in 1933. Yet, there is no conclusive evidence to this end.Since it is not possible in Germany to legally sue for statute-barred restitution claims — and because US courts have denied jurisdiction — the dispute over ""Madame Soler"" has reached an impasse. Public pressure is being used to break this deadlock.There is one possible recourse in Germany in such cases: the Limbach Commission.Set up in 2003 by the German government, the commission can be called upon to mediate in disputes involving the restitution  of Nazi-looted artespecially from persecuted Jewish citizensduring the Third Reich, which are now held by museums, libraries, archives or other public institutions in Germany. It can then review the case and make legally non-binding — though morally no-less important — recommendations to settle the dispute.However, the disputing parties must both agree to the Commission reviewing their case. The Bavarian State Painting Collections, however, has shown itself unwilling to take this step.Together with his first wife, Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy had amassed a considerable private collection of modern artists in Berlin, which may have included Picasso's ""Madame Soler"" as early as 1913/14, but at the latest from 1930.But in 1934, the manager of the Lucerne branch of the art dealer Justin K. Thannhauser noted that there was evidence of intentions to sell. Thannhauser, himself a Jew, had helped to establish the painter's worldwide fame with his major Picasso exhibition in Munich in 1913.Mendelssohn-Bartholdy died of a heart attack on May 11, 1935 and his second wife became his heir.In August 1935, ""Madame Soler"" was listed by the Thannhauser Gallery in Berlin as ""purchased.""In October 1935, Thannhauser offered the painting for sale along with four other works by Picasso. But he himself came under increasing pressure in Nazi Germany, went to Paris and fled from there in 1940 — with many unframed works in his luggage — to the USA.""Madame Soler"" henceforth became part of Thannhauser's private collection in New York — prominently placed and clearly visible to guests.In November 1964, the Bavarian State Painting Collections acquired Picasso's ""Madame Soler"" for 1.7 million Swiss francs or 1.6 million Deutschmark from Justin Thannhauser through a company based in Vaduz, Liechtenstein.The Mendelssohn-Bartholdy heirs doubt that the painting was sold without pressure on their ancestor, or that it was sold at all. Apart from the internal documentation of the Thannhauser Gallery, there is no direct evidence of the purchase itself. It is therefore also possible that the painting was only sold on commission by Thannhauser. This is the argument of Julius H. Schoeps, historian, holder of the Federal Cross of Merit and descendant of Mendelssohn-Bartholdy — not only in the statement of claim, but also in his book ""Who owns Picasso's Madame Soler?"" published in 2022.He considers it probable that Mendelssohn-Bartholdy gave the paintings to Thannhauser on commission, in order to find a buyer before they were confiscated by the Nazi authorities. He had not sold a single painting before, but between 1933 and 1935 he sold 15 of his paintings. The Free State of Bavaria, however, maintains that the painting ""does not constitute cultural property seized by the Nazis.""In the case of the four other Picasso paintings that were sold, the heirs have reached settlements with the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and with the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation. In each case, the works remained in the collections in exchange for the payment of an undisclosed sum of money. The National Gallery in Boston returned its Picasso to the heirs.Since it does not currently look as if a restitution law will be introduced in Germany soon or if the Limbach Commission processes will be reformed to allow a right of appeal, even unilaterally, the only recourse left is public debate.Of course, the Bavarian State Painting Collections can continue to insist on its position and try to sit out the controversy over ""Madame Soler."" But, the emphatic insistence of the heirs that an injustice has been done could be reason enough for the Limbach Commission to seek clarification.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/02,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825652,Are Belarusian 'guerrilla' activists targeting Russia?,"On the morning of February 26, several explosions occurred near the Machulishchy airbase near Minsk in Belarus. The Association of Security Forces of Belarus, known as BYPOL, a Belarusian anti-government group comprised of former law enforcement officers, some of whom are located abroad, whose aim it is to  restore democracy in the country claimed responsibility for what they said was an act of sabotage that had seriously damaged a Russian A-50 surveillance aircraft.The Belarusian Hajun project, which tracks the activity of the airspace of Belarus, confirmed the act of sabotage, as did the Telegram channel Zamkadomby. The Russian military journalists Yuri Kotenok and Semyon Pegov reported that the aircraft had most likely been attacked by drones. At the time of writing, there were neither photographs nor videos of the incident. Nor had any officials expressed themselves on the matter.On February 27, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko met with the secretary of the country's security council, the minister of the interior, the head of the KGB, and border security, but no explanation for the explosions was proffered. Dimitri Peskov, spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, also did not address the media about the issue.In spring 2022, after the full-scale invasion Ukraine, Belarusian activists began sabotaging the railroads to impede Russian military shipments. Subsequently, several so-called ""railway guerrillas"" were arrested. Many of them have since been convicted of terrorism and sentenced to lengthy prison spells, some of over 20 years.But according to Alexander Azarov, the founder of BYPOL, the government wasn't able to find most of the guerrillas. He told DW that further radical action was planned . ""We have found potential targets for other guerrilla actions,"" he said, adding that the Belarusian security forces had ""relaxed"" after the arrests and had removed many guards.Azarov said that the attack on the airfield required four months of planning. ""It's difficult to communicate and clarify things with guerrilla activists in Belarus from outside of the country. It's also hard to deliver the necessary supplies, arrange an escape route and organize security,"" he explained. He said that it was no accident that the surveillance aircraft had been selected as a target. ""It's very important for the Russian military. It's like the flagship of their air fleet. It does reconnaissance on Ukrainian territory and delivers exact data on the targets of missile attacks.""According to BYPOL, there was only one Russian A-50 surveillance aircraft in Belarus — in the city of Machulishchy, where it was attacked by drones. ""There were two explosions — in the middle section of the plane where its satellite is located, and on its fuselage,"" Azarov said. He believes the aircraft suffered irreparable damage: ""Whether it can be flown again remains to be seen."" Azarov didn't reveal how many people took part in the action, or whether or not members of the military were among them. However, he did insist that it was a ""group of Belarusians that have since left the country and are now in safety.""The Belarusian Hajun project has reported that a Russian A-50 aircraft with the registration number RF-50608 landed in Belarus on January 3, 2023. It has apparently been deployed 12 times since arriving.The same aircraft was in Belarus on February 24, 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the Hajun project the Russian air force has nine such aircraft, six of which have been updated. Each is estimated to be worth around $330 million (€309 million).Mykhailo Samus, director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, says that Russian surveillance aircraft can find targets from up to 500 kilometers (310 miles) away on the ground, in the air or on the sea. These include mobile and stationary missiles, aircraft, tanks, rocket launchers, and air defense systems. The data is then shared with destructive weapons. ""There aren't many planes like those. Some sources say there are only 10 of them. They're being actively used a lot in the war in Ukraine,"" says Samus.Ryhor Nizhnikau from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs in Helsinki, believes that the destruction of the surveillance aircraft is comparable to the sinking of the Moskva missile cruiser in the Black Sea in April, 2022. ""Sure, the Moskva was the only ship of its kind, and Russia has 10 planes [like the one that was recently sabotaged],"" he emphasized. ""But in light of the sanctions against Russia, it will be difficult to find a replacement. An aircraft like that is full of microchips and technologies that are imported from the West.""Nizhnikau thought politicians in Minsk and Moscow were covering up the incident. ""They were completely unprepared and somewhat shocked,” he said. He explained that the act of sabotage had occurred when Minsk had already warned that any ""operation"" against Belarus could compel the country to enter the war. But neither Russia nor Belarus wanted to change their relationship. ""Moscow is satisfied with the situation in Belarus and Lukashenko wants to demonstrate that he has control in his country. The attack is untimely for both parties, which is why they're choosing to ignore it,"" said Nizhnikau.He added that if it turned out that Ukrainians were responsible for a sabotage attack in Belarus it would be worse for the regime in Minsk than reports about an aircraft having been blown up by Belarusian activists. In the latter case, he speculated that Lukashenko could tell the Kremlin something along the lines of ""you want us to take part in the war, but we're being attacked ourselves.""A connection between the attack and Ukraine on the other hand, would constitute a devastating political setback for Lukashenko, who ""has stated repeatedly that he would be forced to react to an attack from Ukraine, and that he would definitely stand by Russia if that happened."" Nizhnikau added that Russia did not want to react because it had neither the resources nor the will to do so.However, Nizhnikau expected a strong reaction within Belarus: ""There will be a desire to demonstrate that such actions can't go unpunished – whether they're aimed at the state or the Russian army, as was the case with the railway guerrillas."" He said that he would not be surprised if people were arrested for liking posts about the explosions in Machulishchy on social media. Even people who were near the airfield and, therefore, merely at the wrong place at the wrong time, could be subject to repression.Minsk would also want to show Moscow that Belarus is capable of protecting Russian aircraft on its territory, he added: ""They'll want to be sure this doesn't set a precedent, which could cause Russia to send troops to monitor its military equipment in Belarus.""BYPOL's Azarov said that a young woman who lives near Machulishchy had already been arrested. There were also indications that additional patrols had been deployed in Belarus. ""There are a lot of armed soldiers on the border to Ukraine,"" Azarov said. ""Intensive vehicle border inspections are being carried out as well. In the meantime, the secret service is trying to find out who took part in the sabotage action in Machulishchy.""This article was originally written in Russian.",2023/03/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825653,Germany: How does its Kazakh oil deal benefit Russia?,"This week, Kazakhstan shipped the first batch of crude to Germany through the Druzhba pipeline system as the German government looks to shore up supplies for a key refinery in Eastern Germany that until the turn of the year was fed almost exclusively by Russian oil.The shipment of 20,000 tons, or about 145,000 barrels, is part of Germany's broader plan to cut its dependency on Russian oil. Europe's largest economy stopped buying oil from Russia this year even as pipeline crude oil remains exempt from a European Union embargo on Russian oil prompted by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Kazakhstan, a Russian ally, aims to transport 1.2 million tons of crude oil to Germany this year. The country's state-run pipeline operator KazTransOil has already received approval from its Russian counterpart Transneft to deliver 300,000 tons through the Druzhba pipeline this quarter.Druzhba, which means ""friendship"" in Russian, is one of the largest oil pipeline systems in the world with the capacity to carry 2 million barrels per day.The Kazakh oil is headed to Germany's PCK refinery in Schwedt, located 120 kilometers (74 miles) northeast of Berlin. The refinery was until this year supplied with oil from Russia.The Schwedt refinery — which provides 90% of Berlin's fuel and is a key employer in an already economically backward region — has been on a sticky ground ever since Germany decided to halt piped oil imports from Russia.Germany — which relied on Russia for more than a third of its oil needs before the war in Ukraine, importing 687,000 barrels per day of crude in November 2021 most of it via the Druzhba pipeline — has managed to replace most of the Russian supplies in a relatively short space of time. However, it has struggled to find alternatives for Schwedt, which is not connected to the Western German pipelines and supply routes. That has left the refinery working at just 60% of its capacity.The supplies from Kazakhstan would ensure the refinery works at a higher capacity utilization level so that it remains economically viable.The refinery, which was partly owned by Russia's Rosneft until the German government took control last year, is currently being primarily supplied with crude from global markets, including the United States, through a pipeline leading from the Baltic Sea port of Rostock.Russia stands to collect additional revenue in the form of a transit fee that Transneft would earn for allowing the oil to be shipped through its pipeline network — a welcome source of cash for Moscow at a time its oil revenues have been hit by Western sanctions and price caps.Moreover, the oil must be transported through thousands of kilometers across Russian territory, putting the supply at the mercy of Russian goodwill.""We have to observe how Russia acts regarding the flow through the Druzhba,"" a spokesperson at the German Economy Ministry said on Monday, adding that it was difficult to predict Russia's actions as shown by last year's gas supply freeze.Oil from Kazakhstan is not subject to the EU embargo, nor does it fall foul of Germany's voluntary ban on pipeline oil from Russia.Oil from the country is first pumped to Russia where it is blended with Russian crudes before being exported from Russian seaports. Last year, Kazakhstan rebranded its cargo as KEBCO to dissociate it from Russia's REBCO (Russian export blend crude oil), or Urals, to avoid falling in the crosshairs of Western sanctions.However, the blending of crudes in Russia has raised concerns, especially in Poland through which the Kazakh oil will flow to Germany, that it would be difficult to ascertain the origin of the oil.The German Economy Ministry says while it's unavoidable that some Russian oil will end up in Germany, it's important that no money would be flowing to Russia as the oil supplies would be bought not from a Russian firm, but a Kazakh one.Edited by: Rob Mudge",2023/03/01,,
