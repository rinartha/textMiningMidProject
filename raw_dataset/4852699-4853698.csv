https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852715,Greece's PM makes border wall extension an election pledge,"THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — Greece’s prime minister promised Friday to extend an existing wall across all of the country’s land border with Turkey as he campaigned for the country's general election.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who called the May 21 election earlier this week, presided over a ceremony to sign his center-right government's decision to nearly double the length of the existing steel border wall over the next year.The wall currently spans 37.5 kilometers (25 miles), and the government plans to extend it by 35 kilometers over the next 12 months. More than 100 kilometers of wall will be added to that by 2026, government officials said.Border security remains a high-profile issue in Greece due to long-standing disputes with Turkey and a mass migration of refugees and migrants into the European Union during 2015-16 that largely was triggered by war in Syria and Iraq.Mitsotakis and other officials accused their political opponents from the left-wing Syriza party of trying to undermine the project and to block the government's attempt to obtain European Union funding for it.“I would like to express my regret that there are political forces in Greece today that are fighting this project,” Mitsotakis told supporters during his campaign stop in Orestiada, a town near the Greece-Turkey border.“Let them state their position clearly: Will they tear down the wall that we have already built and return to a policy of open borders? Or will they preserve it and help secure Greece’s borders?” Mitsotakis asked.Syriza officials accused the government of misrepresenting the opposition's position, adding that the EU's executive commission already ruled out providing direct funding for border walls.“We are not going to tear down anything,” European Parliament Vice President Dimitris Papadimoulis, who heads the Syriza delegation in the EU legislature, told Greek radio station Real FM. “And of course, we support EU funding for border security needs, like funds for night vision cameras and coast guard vessels.”Papadimoulis accused the government of pandering to far-right voters and trying to distract attention from a deadly rail disaster last month that has triggered public anger and cut into Mitsotakis’ lead in opinion polls.The government argues the wall has functioned as an effective deterrent against illegal migration, helping prevent more that 250,000 crossings at the land border last year.___Follow AP's coverage of global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration___Gatopoulos reported from Athens, Greece.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852716,"Final Four: At Florida Atlantic, it's not 'F-A-Who?' anymore","HOUSTON (AP) — Nobody will ever mistake Tobacco Road for 777 Glades Road, which is the address of one of history’s most unexpected Final Four party crashers.But there, across the street from a strip mall anchored by a Whole Foods in the upscale retirement town of Boca Raton, Florida, sits one of the fastest-growing, most-diverse college campuses that very few basketball fans had heard of until this month.Florida Atlantic University has barreled its way onto the sport’s biggest stage, adding “Final Four” to a hoops resume that, until now, could have been scribbled down on the back of a cocktail napkin.It’s one of those unique situations where the little guys — in this case, the ninth-seeded Owls, anchored by 7-foot-1 center Vladislav Golden out of Russia – aren’t so little. But even with the 21,000 or so students on its main campus, the school president – at least for now -- doesn’t want anyone mistaking FAU for anything other than an underdog.“Our basketball program is sort of representative of what FAU is,” said Stacy Volnick. “In my mind, they seek their opportunity to go farther than most might have imagined they would. Literally, we are a school that gives opportunities to students who might not otherwise have them.""That was, in a nutshell, precisely why the school was formed.Dedicated in 1964 with a grand-opening speech from none other than President Lyndon Johnson, FAU started as a two-year school for upperclassmen and graduate students.Some thought the beach might be a good place to put FAU, but as one of the members of the state control board argued, “we want to educate them, not give them a bath.""So, the fifth school in Florida's state university system was placed on an old Army air base in a still-sleepy region of a still-sleepy state where the system was dominated by Florida State and the University of Florida — the school Alabama football coach Bear Bryant liked to call a “sleeping giant.”Now, FAU is the sleeping giant. It happened over decades.As South Florida got bigger, so did FAU. It became a four-year college in the 1980s, and today it bills itself as a world-class research school that is growing its medicine programs with an eye on building the state’s second public dental college.It boasts of being Florida's most diverse public university, and a school with no “equity gap"" — no difference between success rates of low-income and Pell-grant-eligible students and the rest of the student body.Famous alums? It’s a tight list. One is renowned orthopedic surgeon Marc Philippon. Another is Scott Thompson, the man more familiar to the public at-large as the comedian Carrot Top.In a way, his story mirrors those of lots of students who come to FAU.“I originally wanted to go to Florida. I loved the Gators,” Thompson said. “I applied, I got accepted, but it wasn’t something I could really afford.”A friend mentioned FAU, which was closer to the water, and closer to his childhood home on Florida’s central Coast.“I decided to give it a whirl, and that’s really how I ended up in comedy,” said Thompson.He started telling jokes at an on-campus bar called the Rathskeller that hasn’t changed much since his first open-mic night there in the late 1980s.These days, everyone at FAU is smiling.Volnick makes no secret about leaning into one of the old saws of academia: that sports serves as the front door to your university. In college sports, it’s often a coin flip as to whether that’s a good thing or not. At FAU, Volnick said 2022 was the largest fundraising year in school history. That was before the basketball team made the Final Four.And while FAU will never be mistaken for North Carolina or Duke, neither will it be confused with Colorado or Oregon or Wisconsin or any of the dozens of flagship universities that stand as focal points in typical college towns. It is in Boca Raton, a well-to-do retirement town where nearly 25% of the population is 65 or over (compared to 17% nationwide) and the average resident is more concerned with that day’s pickleball game than what the Owls are doing.It didn’t stop them from trying. In 1993, FAU set out on building a Division I sports program, a move that brings with it a commitment to spending more, growing more and dealing with more outside pressures.In 2001, former University of Miami coach Howard Schnellenberger, an acolyte of Bryant himself, came out of retirement and built the football program from scratch with an early capital raise of $13 million. A program that began with 22 scholarship players found itself in the New Orleans Bowl by 2007.“It’s been a great romance and it’s produced, I think, a wonderful child,” Schnellenberger said then in an ESPN.com interview.Now, the hoops program is all grown up, too, which brings some good things and some challenges.Their coach, former Florida assistant Dusty May, is certain to become a more popular commodity. The school is set to move from Conference USA to the higher-profile American Athletic Conference next season.While FAU certainly benefited from the newly wide-open transfer rules that have hit college sports, it still needs more love on the name-image-likeness (NIL) scene, which is propped up by “collectives” that are loosely affiliated with the universities and can offer big bucks to prospective players. There’s no lack of money in South Florida — billionaire John Ruiz has reportedly bankrolled some $2 million in NIL earnings for Miami players — only a question of how FAU can tap into it.For now, though, the school the locals used to call “Find Another University” has made a name for itself. And everyone, it seems, is taking this place seriously.""Nobody really knew what FAU was when I went there,” Thompson said. “But you look at it today, and it’s a whole different school.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852717,How a little-known agency holds power over TikTok's future,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Under pressure from the U.S. government, TikTok is now facing the music with the possibility of a nationwide ban if it defies a government order to sell to an American company — unless the popular social media app can convince a high-powered panel that its data security restructuring plan sufficiently guards against national security concerns.At the heart of this social media business and national security drama is the increasingly tense relations between the U.S. and China.The video-sharing platform with 150 million U.S. users is best known for quick snippets of viral dance routines and has been under scrutiny for years by federal authorities who say that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could share sensitive user data with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.Having already banned the shipment of certain technologies to China, and recently passing new legislation banning the app on government devices, lawmakers want to pursue a nationwide ban on the app if the tech firm can’t be sold to an American buyer.Enter: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The little-known but potentially potent government agency known as CFIUS is tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns and holds power to force the company to change.WHY IS CFIUS SCRUTINIZING TIKTOK?For at least two years, the U.S. government has tried to force TikTok ownership to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, though CFIUS’ review of the social media app goes back at least to 2019.Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin confirmed in 2020 that CFIUS was reviewing whether then-President Donald Trump could ban TikTok in the U.S. Its members agreed that TikTok cannot operate in the U.S. in its current form because it “risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,” Mnuchin said at the time.As geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. have soared in recent months, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified last week before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He was grilled about online safety and user privacy in a hostile hearing that did little to ease lawmakers’ concerns. Chew was repeatedly questioned about the Chinese Communist Party’s influence on ByteDance but deflected.“TikTok is not available in mainland China, and today we’re headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, but I’m not saying that the founders of ByteDance are not Chinese, nor am I saying that we don’t make use of Chinese employees, just like many other companies around the world,” he added. “We do use their expertise on some engineering projects.”WHAT IS CFIUS?Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen oversees CFIUS, a committee made up of members from the State, Justice, Energy and Commerce Departments among others, which investigates national security risks from foreign investments in American firms.The committee screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security. The committee’s powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA. In September, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals – such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or risks to Americans’ sensitive personal data.SELL, BAN OR ORACLE?Defying CFIUS’ orders to sell ultimately could mean doing business with the company may violate the law. That would suck the life out of its business operations, such as banking, payroll, advertising, and app store services.But the company said it’s already mitigating national security concerns with a $1.5 billion mitigation plan called Project Texas that would route all U.S. user data to servers owned and maintained by the U.S. software giant Oracle.“When that process is complete, all protected U.S. data will be under the protection of U.S. law and under the control of the U.S.-led security team. Under this structure, there is no way for the Chinese government to access it or compel access to it,” Chew said.While CFIUS can adopt such mitigation agreements, it’s not clear if the committee will accept TikTok’s proposed alternative, said Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University technology law professor. If CFIUS rejects TikTok’s preferred solution, Chander said the federal agency should have an obligation to explain how it finds that plan to be insufficient given that it amounts to an enormous restructuring of the company.“TikTok proposes lots of well-paid, third-party auditors that would be doing this kind of routine monitoring,” Chander said. “This is an expensive proposition for TikTok but by no means would I treat this as window dressing.”Though Chew last week also insisted that the company was not interested in a sale, TikTok has considered it before. TikTok had advanced negotiations with Microsoft after the company was put against the wall by the Trump administration in 2020, facing either an outright ban and CFIUS’ divestment order. Microsoft said TikTok ultimately rejected their offer, and though TikTok later said it would sell to Oracle and Walmart, it doesn’t appear that Project Texas amounts to a sale, Chander said.Should TikTok agree to a sale in the future, not only would CFIUS have to approve that transaction, but the Chinese government – which has said it won’t support forced divestment – could also intervene.WHAT'S NEXT?Leaders in the U.S., European Union, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Taiwan have also banned TikTok on government-issued devices and at least two countries have banned TikTok outright.Afghanistan’s Taliban leadership last year banned it on the grounds of protecting young people from “being misled,” while India imposed a nationwide ban on TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in 2020 over privacy and security concerns. The ban came shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian soldiers and injured dozens.Historically, CFIUS has focused on things like shipping and manufacturing when reviewing transactions for national security concerns, but it signaled deeper interest in popular social media when it ordered the dating app Grindr to divest in 2019, Chander said.The function of CFIUS was also in the spotlight last year after billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter, plunging the microblogging platform into chaos. Yellen waffled on whether or not CFIUS would or could review that sale, given Musk’s investments in China as well as significant Saudi interest.",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852718,Oddsmakers skeptical of scoring spike from MLB's new rules,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Here's one baseball fans might not have bet on: At least one prominent oddsmaker thinks starting pitchers will go deeper into games this season.Eric Biggio, baseball lead trader for Caesars Sportsbook, thinks Major League Baseball's new rules — including a pitch clock and limits on infield shifts — could hedge the trend of managers going early and often to their bullpens. That goes against conventional thinking that a clock meant to hurry pitchers would likely aid hitters.Starters' innings have been drastically reduced in recent years in favor of a parade of hard-throwing relievers. The strategy has contributed to a decrease in scoring and lack of action in games, part of what prompted MLB to make the changes.There were some indications in spring training that pitchers may try weaponizing the clock, which gives players 30 seconds to resume play between at-bats, 15 seconds between pitches with nobody on and 20 seconds with runners on base. Batters must be alert to the pitcher with 8 seconds left.Some, including Mets ace Max Scherzer, tried turning the clock into a cat-and-mouse game during spring exhibitions. Biggio is wagering pitchers can find an upper hand there.Starters are “going to dictate the tempo of the game and they’re going to be able to frustrate the hitters,” Biggio said. “So I think, especially in the early part of the year, you might see starters stall a little bit longer. The pitch count will be lower. They’ll be putting more balls in play.“On the flipside is relievers that traditionally took a little more time, they might take a little to adjust.”Biggio anticipates the effect to be minimal but still enough that those expecting more scoring may need to adjust their thinking this season, which began Thursday.Even with infield shift limits that could boost batting averages, Hal Egeland, senior sports trader for BetMGM, is also skeptical about a rise in scoring.He noted teams are still allowed to employ an outfield shift, such as moving a left fielder into center or even right field.“There are people that believe that it’s more important the outfield shifting than actually the infield shifting,” Egeland said. “The outfield shifting data-wise shows a greater difference between the batting average on balls in play.”No longer having infield shifts could affect player proposition bets, both operators said, and both referred to Minnesota Twins slugger Joey Gallo as a test case. The left-handed hitter will likely hit leadoff against right-handed starters, and he has always batted deeper in the order before signing with the Minnesota Twins in December.Gallo is the poster child of the modern-day analytics player, one who ends the majority of his plate appearances with either a home run, strikeout or walk. He is a career .199 hitter but has a .325 on-base percentage and has topped out at 41 homers in a season. Gallo faced the outfield shift in spring training in which left field was vacated, but its unclear how it will play out if defenses position themselves creatively against him for a full season.Another area to watch is stolen bases, especially since baserunners will be able to better time pitchers, who are limited to two pickoff attempts per batter. Larger bases have also slightly shortened the distance between bags. Baserunners were 21 of 23 on stolen base attempts across the 15 opening day games Thursday, compared to 5 for 9 in seven games on the first day of last season.Analytics might still win out, to where the numbers of stolen bases don't increase as much as expected.“That's the one market that I think we’re going to have the most difficulty early on in deciphering how much of an increase,” Egeland said. “We don't want to overadjust, where we push these overs so far out. That’s the one that’s going to be the most difficult for us early on and I think for teams as well. I think teams are still trying make sure it's worth it to steal because some analytics suggest that stealing a base isn’t really worth it.""___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/31,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852719,Italy temporarily blocks ChatGPT over privacy concerns,"ROME (AP) — Italy is temporarily blocking the artificial intelligence software ChatGPT in the wake of a data breach as it investigates a possible violation of stringent European Union data protection rules, the government's privacy watchdog said Friday.The Italian Data Protection Authority said it was taking provisional action “until ChatGPT respects privacy,” including temporarily limiting the company from processing Italian users' data.U.S.-based OpenAI, which developed the chatbot, said late Friday night it has disabled ChatGPT for Italian users at the government's request. The company said it believes its practices comply with European privacy laws and hopes to make ChatGPT available again soon.While some public schools and universities around the world have blocked ChatGPT from their local networks over student plagiarism concerns, Italy’s action is “the first nation-scale restriction of a mainstream AI platform by a democracy,” said Alp Toker, director of the advocacy group NetBlocks, which monitors internet access worldwide.The restriction affects the web version of ChatGPT, popularly used as a writing assistant, but is unlikely to affect software applications from companies that already have licenses with OpenAI to use the same technology driving the chatbot, such as Microsoft’s Bing search engine.The AI systems that power such chatbots, known as large language models, are able to mimic human writing styles based on the huge trove of digital books and online writings they have ingested.The Italian watchdog said OpenAI must report within 20 days what measures it has taken to ensure the privacy of users' data or face a fine of up to either 20 million euros (nearly $22 million) or 4% of annual global revenue.The agency's statement cites the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and pointed to a recent data breach involving ChatGPT “users' conversations"" and information about subscriber payments.OpenAI earlier announced that it had to take ChatGPT offline on March 20 to fix a bug that allowed some people to see the titles, or subject lines, of other users’ chat history.“Our investigation has also found that 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus users might have had personal data revealed to another user,” the company had said. “We believe the number of users whose data was actually revealed to someone else is extremely low and we have contacted those who might be impacted.”Italy's privacy watchdog, known as the Garante, also questioned whether OpenAI had legal justification for its “massive collection and processing of personal data” used to train the platform's algorithms. And it said ChatGPT can sometimes generate — and store — false information about individuals.Finally, it noted there's no system to verify users' ages, exposing children to responses ""absolutely inappropriate to their age and awareness.”OpenAI said in response that it works ""to reduce personal data in training our AI systems like ChatGPT because we want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.”“We also believe that AI regulation is necessary — so we look forward to working closely with the Garante and educating them on how our systems are built and used,” the company said.The Italian watchdog's move comes as concerns grow about the artificial intelligence boom. A group of scientists and tech industry leaders published a letter Wednesday calling for companies such as OpenAI to pause the development of more powerful AI models until the fall to give time for society to weigh the risks.The president of Italy's privacy watchdog agency told Italian state TV Friday evening he was one of those who signed the appeal. Pasquale Stanzione said he did so because “it's not clear what aims are being pursued"" ultimately by those developing AI.If AI should “impinge"" on a person's “self-determination” then “this is very dangerous,'' Stanzione said. He also described the absence of filters for users younger than 13 as ”rather grave.""San Francisco-based OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, announced this week that he’s embarking on a six-continent trip in May to talk about the technology with users and developers. That includes a stop planned for Brussels, where European Union lawmakers have been negotiating sweeping new rules to limit high-risk AI tools, as well as visits to Madrid, Munich, London and Paris.European consumer group BEUC called Thursday for EU authorities and the bloc’s 27 member nations to investigate ChatGPT and similar AI chatbots. BEUC said it could be years before the EU's AI legislation takes effect, so authorities need to act faster to protect consumers from possible risks.“In only a few months, we have seen a massive take-up of ChatGPT, and this is only the beginning,” Deputy Director General Ursula Pachl said.Waiting for the EU’s AI Act “is not good enough as there are serious concerns growing about how ChatGPT and similar chatbots might deceive and manipulate people.”___O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852743,Myanmar: What's next for Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD party?,"Myanmar's ousted democracy party has vowed to fight on after the military government dissolved the party and dozens of others.Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) failed to meet a registration deadline of March 28 ahead of a promised election.Suu Kyi, 77, is currently serving a 33-year prison term after facing a variety of charges imposed by the military.Her supporters say the charges were contrived to prevent her from participating in politics, but the pro-democracy party has vowed to continue, mobilizing its supporters and hoping for a future change in circumstances.Myanmar's new Political Party Registration Law — which came into force in January 2023 — makes it difficult for political parties to stand for election and oppose junta control.Parties are now obliged to recruit 100,000 members within three months of registration — 100 times higher than the previous requirement.And those looking to run for election must also open offices in at least half of Myanmar's 330 townships and contest at least half of all constituencies. They must also prove they hold funds of 100 million kyat (€43,800, $47,000).Some 63 parties enrolled under the new law, while 40 failed to register, according to an announcement by state-run media.Myanmar politician Bo Bo Oo, who is a member of the NLD, dismissed the junta's tough registration law.""In our view, since the coup, the [State Administrative Council] did get the power illegally. Then its effort on forming new [Union Election Commission] and making a new Party Registration Law are also illegal. We don't recognize the SAC's illegal written law.""The military has promised ""free and fair"" elections since the coup but with conflict continuing throughout the country, the junta extended Myanmar's state of emergency by a further six months in February, leaving no set date for new polls.Currently, the clear favorite to win any upcoming poll is Myanmar's military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the political party that was hammered in the last elections.But military opposition and Western politicians have said elections under these conditions would be a sham.Aung Thu Nyein, a political analyst from Myanmar, said the registration law was created to favor certain political parties.""[The] 2022 Political Party Law is the most restrictive and it's creating a distorted playing field. The law is made to decide who will the winner and losers in the next elections, which will not be conducive to a liberal democracy.""In a press release, the German Foreign Ministry slammed the junta's decision to dissolve the pro-democracy party.""We condemn the actions of the junta, which is acting without any basis in democracy or rule of law. With the dissolution of the parties, there is now a risk of a further escalation of violence in Myanmar and an accelerated destabilization of the country,"" the statement read.""We call on the military in Myanmar to immediately end the violence, particularly the attacks on civilians and the brutal repression against the opposition, and to release all political prisoners.""The National League for Democracy emerged from Myanmar's 1988 democracy uprising against military rule. It was led by Aung San Suu Kyi and won Myanmar's general elections in 2015 and 2020.Following the 2020 victory, the military made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud.In February 2021, the military removed the ruling government and installed its officials as a ""temporary"" administration, with General Min Aung Hlaing taking charge.The NLD has since lacked direction, Aung Thu Nyein said.""The party lacks leadership and proper guidance to its voters and general population. It is understandable, many of its top leaders are in prison, and many have fled to the border, but the NLD leadership fails to make a strategic decision, in regards of this critical juncture,"" he added.But the democratic party have had it tough. Despite winning two elections, Myanmar's military has hinted at cracking down at its operations and some 1,235 NLD members have already been arrested by the military.But perhaps even more alarming is that 26 arrestees have died during prison interrogations. Another 64 members were killed, according to NLD data.With pressure mounting, questions remain about whether the party can continue to function under military control.However the National League for Democracy remains defiant, its members say.""Since the coup, our offices have been closed and we have been connecting through other ways,"" said NLD politician Kyaw Htwe.Bo Bo Oo added that his party continues its dialogue both on local and international levels.""From central level to the grassroots, despite the executives [who] were hunted by the junta, we convene regular meetings and run the party mechanism well. We are seeking and demand for the political prisoner's release and we continuously try hard to end the dictatorship. We open our dialogue gate for the ASEAN Five Point Consensus, and [make it] clear to the world that our speaker is Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.""However, Bo Bo Oo believes it will take a long time for things to change under the current military regime.""I see no end to the impasse under Min Aung Hlaing. We will get a chance after his era. We are mobilizing the people and looking forward [for] a political turning point for the people power struggle. Party card carrying members are not happy but very optimistic for the future,"" he added.Myanmar's coup sparked mass demonstrations across the country, but the junta has violently cracked down on opposition, which has in turn fueled an armed resistance movement from people defense forces and ethnic minority groups.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a human rights watchdog based in Thailand, 3,185 people have been killed by the military, while over 17,000 people have been imprisoned for political reasons. The UN said over 1 million have been displaced because of the conflict.Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/31,,

In a bid to force the government's hand, his party dissolved two provincial assemblies, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in January. Provincial elections are traditionally held jointly with national polls.Under Pakistan's constitution, elections for the two provincial assemblies would need to be held within 90 days of their respective dissolvements. But the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) refused to accommodate this deadline after the military said they were unable to provide security for polls in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province. The two provincial elections are reportedly to be held in early October.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court intervened and took a so-called ""suo-motu"" notice last month, making use of the discretionary power of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and allowing the court to take cognizance of an issue which it deems is in the public interest and starts hearing on it. But even the court itself seems to be divided. The government has now passed a bill to curb the suo-moto power and some judges in the top court are supporting the motion.This week, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) — an independent rights group — criticized the feuding political parties for undermining the democratic norms.""Not only the politics but the society has become deeply divided. We are heading towards an uglier in-fight within and among state institutions... unless political parties sit together and resolve issues through dialogue in larger national interest,"" Harris Khalique, HRCP secretary-general, told DW.Separately, senior PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry told DW that the crisis was sparked by the ""deep state,"" in a veiled reference to the country's powerful military.""Pakistan is facing an unprecedented political, economic and constitutional crisis,"" he said. ""The regime change operation [Khan's ouster] has gone wrong and now we see a divide between people and the 'ruling junta,'"" Chaudhry added.Analysts believe the clashes between institutions will escalate, with judiciary, politics and constitutional crises becoming immersed with the financial breakdown.""I see the crisis as one that is deepening, and it is very difficult to see a way out,"" warns Madiha Afzal, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.""All Pakistan's institutions are muddied — the military, the legislature and civilian government, the judiciary. The military and judicial branches are both completely politicized and polarizing; they don't have the trust of the people, and they can't pull Pakistan out of the current crisis,"" she told DW.In normal circumstances, Pakistani judiciary is tasked with resolving a conflict between the lawmakers and the executive branch by interpreting the constitution. But this also seems uncertain.""The recent case before the apex court, related to holding of elections in two provinces where the legislatures were dissolved prematurely, lay bare how deeply divided the top court is,"" Osama Malik, a legal expert in Islamabad, told DW.""The Supreme Court's infighting resulting in abject failure to impartially adjudicate, at this seminal moment, is not just a serious constitutional crisis, but symbolic of a nation that has reached levels of dysfunctionality not seen before,"" said Malik.Khan's PTI party says the only way out of the crisis is to immediately conduct fresh elections.""The only way forward is free and fair elections and restoration of constitutional order. People are not accepting the present regime who is trying to stay in power only by tyranny. The Supreme Court wants to restore constitutional order and is facing resistance from ruling Junta,"" asserted Chaudhry.The current government is taking tough financial measures in a bid to revive an IMF bailout. The crisis has left people scrambling to secure basic food items, with the value of the rupee is plummeting. Brookings Institution Fellow Afzal says political parties also unable to resolve their conflict.""The state is playing a heavy hand with the opposition. In the meantime, while these institutions play their political games, the common man is dealing with backbreaking inflation, 46% [on an annual level] last week. The only way out is elections, which are to be held sometime this year; and these elections must be free and fair, without sidelining the current opposition"" she told DW.Pakistan's military still holds a lot of power and influence in the country's politics. This influence is often amplified by their allies in country's judiciary, which tends to side with the military leaders in a time of crisis.""Unless politicians are able to sit together and push back against the military's intervention in our politics, we are headed for a disaster in a manner we have seen in the past. Except this time the polarization is perhaps at its worst,"" Imaan Mazari, a lawyer, told DW.""Wrongs that resulted from the military-judicial nexus require redressal and there is a need for free and fair elections that should not be delayed unless we want to descend into complete anarchy.”Analysts suggest the state institutions must work within their constitutional roles and create a balance of power for the strengthening of democracy.""All issues must be finally resolved on the floor of the parliament. Those political stakeholders who are not represented in the parliament must be included in these processes by the government of the day through direct talks,"", says HRCP chief Harris Khalique.""Judicial overreach needed to be curbed and trichotomy of power between legislature, executive and judiciary must be respected by all. All institutional tussles will subside if parliament is considered supreme and all political parties begin broad-based dialogue with open hearts and minds,"" according to the activist.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/31,,

(AP) — Two Memphis police officers and a suspect were wounded in a shooting during a foot chase in the city, authorities said.The shooting occurred after officers responded to a report of a person with a gun at a convenience store shortly before 7:30 p.m. Thursday, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.The two officers and the suspect, who was outside the business before the chase began, were hospitalized in critical condition following the shooting in the Whitehaven neighborhood, authorities said.The bureau on Friday identified the suspect as Charles Williams II, 47, and said he has been charged with attempted second-degree murder and aggravated assault.Williams will be booked into jail after he is released from the hospital, the bureau said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852748,Minneapolis and state agree to revamp policing post-Floyd,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The city of Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights signed a “court-enforceable settlement agreement” Friday to revamp policing in the city where George Floyd was murdered by an officer nearly three years ago.The agency issued a blistering report last year after an investigation found the police department had engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade. The City Council approved the settlement in an 11-0 vote. Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero signed it soon after.""The agreement isn't change, in and of itself, but it charts a clear roadmap to it,” Frey said at a news conference.Lucero said: “This agreement serves as a model for how cities, police departments and community members across the country can work together to address race-based policing and strengthen public safety.”The state agency launched its investigation shortly after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes on May 25, 2020, disregarding the Black man's fading pleas that he couldn't breathe. Floyd's death sparked mass protests around the world, forced a national reckoning on racial injustice, and compelled a Minneapolis Police Department overhaul.Chauvin was convicted of murder. He and three other officers on the scene are serving prison terms.“We didn't get here overnight, and change also won't happen overnight,"" Frey said. ""This problem that we now face, it has taken hold over many generations, many administrations, mayors and chiefs, and clearly our Black and brown communities have taken the brunt of this.”Lucero said the legally binding agreement requires the city and the police department to make “transformational changes"" to fix the organizational culture at the heart of race-based policing.She said it includes measures to ensure force is used “only when it is objectively reasonable, necessary and proportional” and never “to punish or retaliate.” Officers must de-escalate conflicts when possible. There will be limits on when and how officers can use chemical irritants and Tasers. And training in the disputed condition of excited delirium — a key issue in the confrontation that led to Floyd's death — will be banned. Stops for broken lights and searches based on the alleged smell of marijuana are banned.Frey, Lucero and Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the agreement reflects feedback from and the concerns of the community and police officers.“The court-enforceable agreement does not prohibit officers from relying on reasonable, articulatable suspicion or probable cause of criminal activity to enforce the law. We want officers to do their jobs,"" Lucero said.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump and other lawyers who won a $27 million settlement for the Floyd family called the agreement “monumental” and the “culmination of years of heartbreak and advocacy by those impacted by the poor policies and practices of the Minneapolis Police Department.”The U.S. Department of Justice is still investigating whether Minneapolis police engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination. That investigation could lead to a separate agreement with the city known as a consent decree. City officials couldn't provide information on where that stands.Several police departments nationwide operate under federal consent decrees. Justice Department and city officials asked a judge Tuesday to end most federal oversight of the Seattle police department, saying its sustained, decade-long reform efforts are a model for other cities.The Minneapolis settlement, which requires court approval, also governs the use of body-worn and dashboard cameras; officer wellness; and response to mental health and behavioral crises. An independent evaluator must be appointed to monitor compliance.Several council members criticized the police department and other city leaders.“The lack of political will to take responsibility for MPD is why we are in this position today,” council member Robin Wonsley said. “This legal settlement formally and legally prevents city leadership from deferring that responsibility anymore. And I hope this settlement is a wake-up call for city leaders, who the public has watched rubber-stamp poor labor contracts, have signed off on endless misconduct settlements, and then shrugged their shoulders when residents asked then why we have a dysfunctional police department.”Some activists were upset that the agreement wasn’t posted publicly until after the vote.Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said she will ask the state data practices office whether the council acted legally. She said her group must study the agreement before commenting on its merits.“This is not the way to start this process and vote on something the community’s going to have to live with for the next five or six years,” Gross said.Even council members had only about a day to study and discuss the document.“This is something we’ve been waiting for for a long time and my hope is the city will act with fidelity, the city will act with integrity, and the city will follow through.” civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong said.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852749,Trump indictment not expected to affect Wisconsin court race,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The indictment of former President Donald Trump will likely have little impact on the high stakes Wisconsin Supreme Court race to be decided next week, as Democrats try to flip majority control of the court with the fate of abortion access in the state on the line, those closely watching the contest said Friday.Trump has not been directly involved in the race, did not endorse anyone, and the Republican-backed candidate has tried to distance his connections with the former president and the GOP. Additionally, Trump's support among Republicans appears to be waning in the battleground state that he barely won in 2016 and then lost by a similar margin in 2020.“While this (indictment) may get the juice flowing with some of his supporters, some may have a head shake and shoulder shrug,"" said longtime Republican strategist and former state GOP party leader Brandon Scholz. “This indictment thing isn’t really tied into this race. It is a Trump issue.""Charles Franklin, a pollster for the Marquette University Law School, said the indictment could spur a bump in turnout both among Trump's most ardent supporters and his most fervent Democratic opponents. But he didn't think it would fundamentally alter the dynamics of the Supreme Court race between Republican-backed Dan Kelly and Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz to be decided Tuesday.“The classic October surprises are things that involve the candidates themselves, not someone else,"" Franklin said. ""For that reason, I think there’s probably less reason to think this news dramatically changes the Supreme Court race because people would have to know enough to connect Donald Trump to the Supreme Court race and have not been planning to vote, or vote differently, in Tuesday's election.”Protasiewicz's campaign spokesperson, Sam Roecker, said Friday, ""We don’t expect voters to be distracted by what’s happening in New York.”“We’re focused on winning a critical election in four days that will have long-term consequences for millions of Wisconsinites when it comes to issues like reproductive rights and the strength of our democracy,"" he said. “We know voters are focused on this race because it’s an opportunity to return fairness and impartiality to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.”Kelly told reporters after a campaign stop Friday in Watertown that he had “no idea” whether the indictment would motivate people to vote in his race.Supporters of Kelly, who previously served on the state Supreme Court, are hoping the indictment will fire up the GOP base like the raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home the day before Wisconsin's August GOP gubernatorial primary did.Although Trump endorsed Kelly in his run for the court in 2020, Kelly did not seek a Trump endorsement this time and wouldn't even commit to accepting one if it had been offered.Kelly worked for the Wisconsin Republican Party and the Republican National Committee after he lost the 2020 election. He also advised the state’s top Republicans on their scheme after Trump’s loss in 2020 to have fake electors cast Wisconsin’s electoral voters for him.“I am running against probably one of the most extreme partisan characters in the history of this state.” Protasiewicz said during their only debate in March.“Again, this is you being quick to lie,” Kelly responded.Kelly insisted throughout the campaign that his personal politics are irrelevant and emphasized that he’s dedicated to the “rule of law.”The indictment Thursday came after 10 days of early voting across the state. As of Friday morning, nearly 353,00 absentee ballots had been returned. Early voting ends Sunday.“In the last days before an election, things have been set in motion for a long time,"" said Franklin, the pollster. ""People have already been making up their minds whether to vote or not and, if so, who to support. In that sense, these late-breaking things don’t shift support tremendously, particularly when they don’t involve the candidates.”The winner Tuesday will determine majority control of the court, which is expected to rule on the fate of Wisconsin's near-total abortion ban, Republican gerrymandered legislative districts and voting rights heading into the 2024 presidential election. The court came within one vote of overturning President Joe Biden’s win in the state in 2020.Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County circuit judge, has tried to make the race a de-facto referendum on abortion, while also blasting Kelly for his ties to Republicans and his work for Wisconsin Right to Life.Abortion rights groups, including Planned Parenthood, are behind Protasiewicz. The Wisconsin Democratic Party has given her campaign nearly $9 million, helping her to get an advantage over Kelly in television advertising.Kelly's backers include the state and local GOP chapters as well as GOP mega-donors Richard Uihlein and Diane Hendricks.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852750,Stampede at food distribution center kills 11 in Pakistan,"KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — At least 11 women and children were killed in a deadly stampede at a Ramadan food and cash distribution center in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi on Friday, police and rescue officials said, as the country struggles with surging food prices.The stampede happened when hundreds of women and children panicked and started pushing each other to collect food outside a factory in a well-known industrial area, known as SITE or Sindh Industrial and Trading Estate.Business owners during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan often hand out cash and food, especially to the poor.As the stampede began, some women and children fell into an open drain, local police official Mughees Hashmi said. Residents said a wall also collapsed near the drain, injuring and killing people. The incident left the street that leads to the factory littered with wounded people and dead bodies.Several people were also injured in the stampede. Hashmi said eight women and three children died.A survivor, Baby Khursheed, 35, said she went to the factory to collect supplies with two of her elder sisters, Sabira Khatoon and Naseem Bano, who both died in the incident. “There were hundreds of women in the street, the factory staff was allowing only a few of them at a time to collect rations,” she said. The street where people had gathered was narrow, she added.Khursheed, who had bruises, said that as the crowd swelled, a water pipe burst. Cries for help went up and the factory staff tried to control the situation by opening a gate along the street, she said.Murad Ali Shah, the top elected official in the Sindh, has ordered an investigation into the deadly stampede that resulted. He also asked charities and business owners to inform police before organizing such Ramadan handouts.Shortly after the incident, police detained some of the factory's employees for questioning.It is the deadliest stampede at a food distribution point since the start of fasting during Ramadan. With the latest incident, the death toll from stampedes at free food centers across the country has risen to at least 21 since last week.Hashmi said the factory owner who organized the food distribution center had not alerted police about the plan. He said local police were unaware of the distribution, otherwise they might have deployed forces.Local resident Mohammad Arsalan said he lives near the factory where people had gathered since the morning to collect the free food. He said he did not know what exactly caused the incident, but “we heard cries and later learned about this stampede.”Friday's incident comes a day after authorities ordered deployment of additional police at Ramadan food distribution centers to avoid dangerous overcrowding.Cash-strapped Pakistan launched an initiative to distribute free flour among low-income families to ease the impact of record-breaking inflation and soaring poverty during the holy month. While Friday’s incident was not part of that government scheme, crowds have swelled at the distribution centers in recent days.The free flour distribution initiative was launched by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif last week, although his coalition government is facing the country's worst economic crisis amid a delay in getting a key $1.1 billion tranche of a $6 billion bailout package originally signed in 2019 with the International Monetary Fund.On Friday, Pakistan's Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said that a key tranche from the IMF loan will be released soon.Sharif visited a wheat flour distribution center in Islamabad on Friday and met women who had come to collect flour. The premier asked authorities to ensure that people are treated well and there are no further incidents.There was no comment from the prime minister’s office on the deadly Karachi stampede. “That is a provincial subject,” a government official told The Associated Press. “CM Sindh can respond,” the official added, referring to the region’s chief minister.Weekly inflation is 45%, unseen since Pakistan got its independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Rising food costs and soaring fuel bills have raised fears of public unrest.____Farooq reported from Karachi; Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed contributed to this report from Islamabad.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852751,"Canada migrant death toll at 8, after 2 more bodies found","AKWESASNE, Quebec (AP) — The bodies of two more migrants who died trying to cross from Canada into the United States, were found Friday, bringing the death toll to eight, including two children, police in the Mohawk Territory of Akwesasne said.The bodies of six people, described as members of two families of Romanian and Indian descent, were found Thursday in a marshy area of the St. Lawrence River, which forms the Canada-U.S. border.Akwesasne Mohawk Police Chief Shawn Dulude said authorities were still looking for a man, identified as Casey Oakes, 30, who was last seen Wednesday operating a boat that was found next to the bodies.A police helicopter spotted the latest two bodies in the water.“A total of eight bodies have now been recovered from the waters. All are believed to have been attempting illegal entry into the United States from Canada,” Dulude said.A child discovered Friday was a Canadian citizen and a member of the Romanian family, Dulude said. The body of an adult woman believed to be an Indian national was also recovered.Dulude said he didn't know if Oakes was alive or not, adding that he was a person of interest.The territory is known for being a transit point for the trafficking of humans and contraband because of its location. And in February, police in Akwesasne reported an increase in human smuggling into the Mohawk territory.“Our community has been exploited by this,” said Grand Chief Abram Benedict of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne. “This is not the first time that tragedy has happened in our community like this. We’ve had other losses.”Weather conditions in the area were rough Wednesday night, said Lee-Ann O’Brien, deputy chief of the Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service.O’Brien said six of the bodies were located during a search for Oakes who was reported missing Thursday. Oakes of Akwesasne was last seen Wednesday around 9:30 p.m. boarding a small boat departing from the east end of Cornwall Island, located in the St. Lawrence River and on the Ontario side of the Mohawk territory.“This is a heartbreaking situation,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. “We need to understand properly what happened, how it happened and do whatever we can to minimize the chances of this ever happening again.”The Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service said the first body was located around 5 p.m. Thursday in a marsh. The area was searched further by a police marine unit with the help of the Canadian Coast Guard and the Hogansburg Akwesasne Volunteer Fire Department.Air support units with the Quebec provincial police and Ontario Provincial Police also assisted.Post-mortem and toxicology tests have been ordered to determine the cause of the deaths.Akwesasne police say there have been about 80 people trying to cross illegally into Canada or into the United States through the Mohawk territory since January, and most of them have been of Indian or Romanian descent.Akwesasne straddles the Canada-United States border, and has territory in Quebec, Ontario and New York state.“There's always been people coming through here,” Dulude said. “I've always been worried about it. It's just that now there's more attention.”He said it's mostly people going south to the U.S. and it is rare that someone comes north.Tony Jackson, an Akwesasne resident, said the weather Wednesday, when Oakes was last seen, was calm during the day but later turned rough.“The east wind around here creates a lot of waves, five feet tall, maybe taller,” Jackson said. He said he believed Oakes’s boat was less than six meters (20 feet) long.Crossing the river on a little boat with many people on board, “that called for disaster,” he said.He said he had never heard Oakes talk about transporting migrants. But Jackson said he had personally witnessed groups of migrants crossing through fields with bags in hand and also occasionally seen boats carrying large groups of people across the river.“A couple of times in one month, you’ll see a couple of them walking down the road with all their bags,” he said.In April 2022, six Indian nationals were rescued from a sinking boat in the St. Regis River, which runs through Akwesasne Mohawk Territory. A seventh person, spotted leaving the vessel and wading ashore, was later identified as a U.S. citizen. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials described what happened as a human smuggling incident.Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden announced a plan last week to close a loophole to an immigration agreement that allowed thousands of asylum-seeking migrants to move between the two countries along a back road linking New York state to Quebec.The deal closing an illegal border crossing point about 105 kilometers (66 miles) east of Akwesasne took effect Saturday. O’Brien said it has nothing to do with the closure of the Roxham Road illegal crossing into Canada.Early last year, a Florida man was charged with human smuggling after the bodies of four people, including a baby and a teen, were found in Canada near the U.S. border in what authorities believe was a failed crossing attempt during a freezing blizzard between Manitoba, Canada and North North Dakota. The dead were Indian nationals trying to enter the U.S.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852752,Crowded field hopes to avoid Premier League relegation,"LONDON (AP) — A good relegation fight can keep things interesting at the bottom of the Premier League. Usually it doesn't involve nine teams, though.Just four points separate last-place Southampton from 12th-place Crystal Palace heading into the final stretch of the season as the threatened clubs and a few nervous managers try to reverse their fortunes.Palace manager Roy Hodgson calls it “exceptional,” and he's been coaching since the mid-1970s.“You don't normally have almost a whole bottom section of the table all fighting to avoid relegation and you certainly don't see so many teams which most people would say, ‘they can’t get relegated, they’re too big a club to get relegated,” said Hodgson, who at 75 is the oldest manager in league history.The top 11 teams can all still qualify for European competitions and peering across the gulf — an 11-point gap from Aston Villa to Palace — any of the bottom nine could be relegated.Saturday's home game against Leicester will be Hodgson's first back in charge as the replacement for the fired Patrick Vieira. The south London club is on a 12-match winless run and still looking for its first victory in 2023.Backers of Vieira pointed out that the team's struggles came against some top teams. The winless slide includes games against Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool.“We’re in a dogfight. We’ve got a slight advantage but not a very big one,” said Hodgson, who was in charge of Palace from 2017-21.Stats provider Opta says, in fact, Palace has a huge advantage, describing it as the easiest remaining schedule. The team faces only two current top-10 clubs — Tottenham and Fulham — the rest of the way.Everton is 15th but that could change by the time the Toffees host Tottenham on Monday night. The Merseyside club hasn’t been out of the top flight since 1954 and, with a new stadium opening soon, can’t afford to drop into the Championship.It's so tight that last-place Southampton, which hasn't been out of the Premier League since 2011-12, could move up four spots if it beats fellow struggler West Ham on Sunday at London Stadium.Ruben Selles is Southampton’s third coach this season. Six of the bottom nine have changed managers as owners are desperate to remain in the richest league in the world. The exceptions are West Ham, Leicester and Nottingham Forest.“We understand that at this time of the season it can get more tense,” said Forest manager Steve Cooper, who was handed a new contract in October at a time when many thought he’d get fired because his team was in last place.Forest hosts Wolverhampton on Saturday but Opta estimated that Cooper's team has the third-toughest remaining schedule.“We’ve got a period of games to really attack and we can make it what we want of it,” Cooper said. “Hopefully some positive results and performances and then the league will tell its own story. The league position is in our hands, as it is everybody else.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852753,District sued over axing of student paper after LGBTQ issue,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — A former high school journalist and the Nebraska High School Press Association sued Friday over a school district's shutdown of the school newspaper after it published an LGBTQ-focused edition.The federal lawsuit claims Grand Island Northwest Public Schools and its superintendent violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment in May when it closed the Viking Saga newspaper at Grand Island Northwest High School, which has about 700 students. The district later agreed to bring the newspaper back in digital form.“It is hard to find words for what it felt like watching people who were supposed to be supporting our education instead silence us for covering issues impacting our lives,” Marcus Pennell, the former student suing the district, said in a statement. “I was crushed.""An email message left with the school district's superintendent, Jeffrey Edwards, was not immediately returned. Edwards last year called the shutdown “an administrative decision.""Saga newspaper staff were informed of the newspaper’s elimination three days after printing of the June edition, which included an article titled, “Pride and prejudice: LGBTQIA+,” on the origins of Pride Month and the history of homophobia. It also included an editorial opposing a Florida law, dubbed by critics as “Don’t Say Gay,"" that bans some lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity andA May 22 email from a school employee canceling the paper’s printing services said it was “because the school board and superintendent are unhappy with the last issue’s editorial content.” Some school board members publicly stated their objection to the Saga’s LGBTQ content.The lawsuit also states that Pennell, who is transgender, was told in March 2022 that he and others could use only names assigned to them at birth in their bylines and that they could not list their pronouns.The lawsuit seeks a declaration that the district violated the law as well as unspecified damages.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852754,"Shamier Anderson savors career rise, role in new 'John Wick'","New York (AP) — Shamier Anderson is well aware that his Hollywood profile is rising, and he isn’t taking the moment for granted.“I’ve been on the grind for a very long time, and I’m still grinding. And it’s not lost on me that I’m pretty ubiquitous in the marketplace right now. However, my work ethic hasn’t changed,” says the 31-year-old Canadian actor. “I’m lucky, and that’s something that’s not lost on me … I also recognize that this moment will pass, right? And that’s something that humbles me.”Most wouldn’t blame Anderson for indulging in the moment, as his latest film, the Keanu Reeves-led “John Wick: Chapter 4,” debuted last week at No. 1 with a franchise-best $73.5 million domestically at the box office. Anderson plays the Tracker, a bounty hunter, who’s stalked Wick around the world in hopes of collecting a huge payday.“I get to share the screen with people that I used to look up to, that I still look up to, a la Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburne,” said the Wing Chun kung fu student. “Those are the moments that make me go, ‘Wow, things are changing.’”Things are indeed changing, but it’s been a slow and steady journey. He’s starred in the film “Bruiser,” a February release, with Trevante Rhodes, and appeared in movies such as 2020’s “Bruised” with Halle Berry and 2018's “Destroyer” alongside Nicole Kidman. His first film credit came in 2010's “Nostrum.” Each role has served as a building block to form a budding, substantial career.“These are my colleagues. These are my sparring partners. How are we going to get to the truth and do a great job and kill it? And when they call cut, I go, ‘Can I get a picture?’” he said with a laugh, stating working with Reeves was a “pinch me” moment. “I’ve done some incredible films with some incredible A-list actresses and actors, and I still get butterflies … I’m always learning, and I’m learning with a smile on my face.”Anderson grew up Toronto, raised by a single mother alongside his two brothers, one of which is Stephan James who starred in 2018’s Oscar-nominated “If Beale Street Could Talk,” as well as Ava DuVernay’s “Selma.” Hollywood was always in sight for Anderson, who studied musical theater at Wexford Collegiate School for the Arts, but not for James.“I always make a joke saying Stephan has never been to an acting class in his life, and I’ve trained all my life,” said the older brother. “He’s Golden Globe nominated, Emmy nominated, NAACP nominated … he’s more decorated than a Christmas tree at this point. But it just kind of speaks to just how this business works. There’s no blueprint.”However, the siblings are creating their own layout, and it’s now a family business.Following protests after the murder of George Floyd during 2020’s coronavirus pandemic, the brothers formed the Black Academy (Building a Legacy in Acting, Cinema and Knowledge) to battle systemic racism. They also created the Bay Mill Studios production company to amplify Black Canadian creatives. Anderson says the company recently sold a project centered around famed painter Jean-Michel Basquiat to a major streaming service. Though Black music from Canadian artists like Drake, The Weeknd and PartyNextDoor has reached global heights, the film industry hasn't made similar strides.“There are actually a lot of iconic Canadians in the film business: Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, James Cameron, Ryan Reynolds. I mean, it’s a long list … Sandra Oh — a bunch of cool folks,"" he said.""Black filmmakers — Black actors and actresses— that’s where it’s a bit scarce,” said Anderson, who intentionally straddles the line between actor and activist. “There’s not enough Black individuals in the arts at the highest level … there’s no shortage of talent. It’s just opportunity.”To highlight Canada’s wealth of talent, the Black Academy created the Legacy Awards. It's the country’s first Black awards show, described as a mashup of the NAACP Image Awards, Grammys and BET Awards. Deborah Cox was among the performers for the inaugural show, which earned four nominations, including best host, from the Canadian Screen Awards. Honoring a wide range of Black Canadians including athletes, musicians, actors and philanthropists, the show has a multiyear commitment to air on Canadian Broadcasting Corp.And while his social and creative accomplishments are a source of pride, Anderson’s widest smile appears when discussing DJ Shamgod — his musical alias.“I’ve been deejaying for 15 years. I used it as a way to pay for bills, to make money when I wasn’t getting acting work … just recently this past year, I said I’m going to go public with it,” explained the multiformat DJ who performed a set at the John Wick after-party in New York following the premiere. “This isn’t another actor trying to be a musician. I’ve been doing music. I really am on the turntables, and I really throw down.”Anderson will return to “Invasion” on Apple TV+ and has roles in the films “A Lot of Nothing,"" now streaming, and Brad Furman’s “Tin Soldier.” He is light years away from his Scarborough neighborhood watching his mother struggle to make ends meet. But he says his path is a reminder that the tortoise won the race — not the hare.“It’s looking at the little boy in me and going, ‘I told you so. It’s all working out,’” said Anderson. “It’s incredible to see the work pay off.”___Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at: @GaryGHamilton on all his social media platforms.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852755,AP sources: Trump facing at least 1 felony charge in NY case,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump is facing multiple charges of falsifying business records, including at least one felony offense, in the indictment handed down by a Manhattan grand jury, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Friday.He will be formally arrested and arraigned Tuesday in his hush money case, setting the scene for the historic, shocking moment when a former president is forced to stand before a judge to hear the criminal charges against him.The indictment remained sealed and the specific charges were not immediately known, but details were confirmed by people who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information that isn't yet public.The streets outside the courthouse where the arraignment will unfold were calm Friday compared with earlier in the week. There were no large-scale demonstrations for or against Trump, though tourists stopped to take selfies and throngs of reporters and police officers remained assembled.When Trump turns himself in, he’ll be booked mostly like anyone else facing charges, mug shot, fingerprinting and all. But he isn’t expected to be put in handcuffs; he’ll have Secret Service protection and will almost certainly be released that same day.In the meantime, Trump's legal team prepared his defense while the prosecutor's office defended the grand jury investigation that propelled the matter toward trial. Congressional Republicans, as well as Trump himself, contend the whole matter is politically motivated.“We urge you to refrain from these inflammatory accusations, withdraw your demand for information, and let the criminal justice process proceed without unlawful political interference,” Leslie Dubeck, general counsel in the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, wrote in a letter sent Friday to three Republican House committee chairs that was obtained by The Associated Press.The case is plunging the U.S. into uncharted legal waters, with Trump the first former president ever to face an indictment. And the political implications could be titanic ahead of next year’s presidential election. Trump is in the midst of running for president a third time and has said the case against him could hurt that effort — though his campaign is already furiously raising money by citing it.The Trump campaign said it raised $4-plus million in the first 24 hours after news of the indictment broke.Top Republicans also have begun closing ranks around him. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has promised to use congressional oversight to probe Bragg. Reps. James Comer, Jim Jordan and Bryan Steil, the committee chairs whom Bragg addressed in his letter, have asked the district attorney's office for grand jury testimony, documents and copies of any communications with the Justice Department.Trump's indictment came after a grand jury probe into hush money paid during the 2016 presidential campaign to squelch allegations of an extramarital sexual encounter. The indictment itself has remained sealed, as is standard in New York before an arraignment.The investigation dug into six-figure payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both claim to have had sexual encounters with the married Trump years before he got into politics. He denies having sexual liaisons with either woman.Trump also has denied any wrongdoing involving payments and has denounced the investigation as a “scam,” a “persecution,” an injustice. He shouts in all capital letters on his social media platform that the Democrats have “LIED, CHEATED” and more to damage his 2024 presidential run.Trump lawyer Joseph Tacopina said during TV interviews Friday he would “very aggressively” challenge the legal validity of the Manhattan grand jury indictment. Trump himself, on his social media platform, trained his ire on a new target, complaining that the judge expected to handle the case, Juan Manuel Merchan, “HATES ME.”The former president is expected to fly to New York on Monday and stay at Trump Tower overnight ahead of his planned arraignment Tuesday, according to two people familiar with his plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Trump's travel.Trump will be arraigned in the same Manhattan courtroom where his company was tried and convicted of tax fraud in December and where disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial took place. On Friday, officials from the Secret Service and the NYPD toured the courthouse and met about security plans.Court officers ultimately closed and secured access to the 15th floor, where Merchan was continuing to preside over unrelated matters, until Trump's arraignment.Lawyers involved in the cases and some employees were permitted to stay, but media were chased away by officers, who were standing sentry in front of a bike-rack barricade set up in the hallway. Officers yelled at reporters who ventured up, ""This floor is closed,” and ordered them to get back in the elevator and leave.“Officers have been cautioned to remain vigilant and maintain situational awareness, both inside courthouses and while on perimeter patrols, as evidenced by the incident on Tuesday afternoon outside of Manhattan Supreme Court,"" the court said in a statement.Since Trump’s March 18 post claiming his arrest was imminent, authorities have ratcheted up security, deploying additional police officers, lining the streets around the courthouse with barricades and dispatching bomb-sniffing dogs. They’ve had to respond to bomb and death threats, a suspicious powder scare and a pro-Trump protester who was arrested Tuesday after witnesses say she pulled a knife on passersby.Since no former president had ever been charged with a crime, there's no rulebook for booking the defendant. He will be fingerprinted and have a mug shot taken, and investigators will complete arrest paperwork and check to see if he has any outstanding criminal charges or warrants, according to a person familiar who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive security operations.All of that activity takes place away from the public. New York law discourages the release of mug shots in most cases. Less clear is whether Trump would seek to have the picture released himself, for political or other reasons.Once the booking is complete, the former president would appear before a judge for an afternoon arraignment.Even for defendants who turn themselves in, answering criminal charges in New York generally entails at least several hours of detention while being fingerprinted, photographed, and going through other procedures.As for the allegations, as Trump ran for president in 2016, his allies paid two women to bury their accusations. The publisher of the supermarket tabloid the National Enquirer paid McDougal $150,000 for rights to her story and sat on it, in an arrangement brokered by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.After Cohen himself paid Daniels $130,000, Trump’s company reimbursed him, added bonuses and logged the payments as legal expenses.Federal prosecutors argued — in a 2018 criminal case against Cohen — that the payments equated to illegal aid to Trump’s campaign. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation charges, but federal prosecutors didn’t go after Trump, who was then in the White House. However, some of their court filings obliquely implicated him as someone who knew about the payment arrangements.The New York indictment came as Trump contends with other investigations. In Atlanta, prosecutors are considering whether he committed any crimes when trying to get Georgia officials to overturn his narrow 2020 election loss there to Joe Biden.And, at the federal level, a Justice Department-appointed special counsel also is investigating Trump’s efforts to unravel the national election results. Additionally, the special counsel is examining how and why Trump held onto a cache of top secret government documents at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago, and whether the ex-president or his representatives tried to obstruct the probe into those documents.___Weissert reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852756,NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this week,"A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week following the fatal shooting of six people at a Christian school in Nashville. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:___Photo of trans woman holding gun misrepresented after Nashville shootingCLAIM: A transgender woman posted a photo of herself holding a gun and calling for violence against Christians, referencing a “Trans Day of Vengeance.”THE FACTS: A Twitter account posted a years-old photo of MMA fighter and trans woman Alana McLaughlin holding a gun, but she did not author this post calling for violence. A screenshot of the tweet amassed thousands of shares in the wake of Monday’s mass shooting at a private Christian school in Nashville after police said the shooter was transgender. The tweet shows McLaughlin with pink hair and a pink shirt, holding an AR-15 style gun and wearing a Glock-19 pistol with an expanded magazine on her waist, with a transgender pride flag in the background. The caption appears to advocate for violence against Christians, including the verbs “kill,” “behead,” “roundhouse,” “slam dunk,” “crucify,” “defecate in” and “launch.” Some social media posts claimed the tweet was proof McLaughlin was organizing or planning to attend an April 1 protest event outside the U.S. Supreme Court called the “ Trans Day of Vengeance.” But McLaughlin, who lives in Oregon, confirmed she didn’t author the post and was not aware of where this event was taking place or planning to attend. There is no evidence the Twitter account that originally posted the violent tweet, which was later suspended from the platform, has any ties to the planned event. The event website on Wednesday featured language clarifying that it was “about unity, not inciting violence.” Noah Buchanan, co-founder of Trans Radical Activist Network, which is organizing the event, also confirmed to the AP in an email that McLaughlin is not affiliated with the protest, and reiterated that it was not intended to be a violent event. The image of McLaughlin used in social media posts dates to 2020, when it was featured in a Huck Magazine profile about her and other LGBTQ people who said they had decided to arm themselves to stay safe amid violence directed toward their community. “It is entirely defensive,” said McLaughlin, who added that she arms herself to protect against “escalating right-wing threats.” McLaughlin said the photo had been misrepresented in other ways in the past, including in posts falsely claiming she was a soldier fighting in Ukraine.— Associated Press writers Arijeta Lajka and Ali Swenson in New York contributed this report.___Posts falsely identify photos as Nashville school shooterCLAIM: A photo of a person wearing glasses and a baseball cap in a field shows the shooter who killed six people at a Nashville, Tennessee, school on Monday. Another photo shows “Samantha Hyde,” a “trans woman” identified as the assailant.THE FACTS: Neither of the photos, both of which circulated widely on social media, show the person responsible for the attack at the private Christian school in Nashville on Monday. After the shooting at The Covenant School, police gave unclear information on the shooter’s gender. For hours, police identified the shooter as a 28-year-old woman and eventually as Audrey Hale. Then at a late afternoon press conference, the police chief said that Hale was transgender. In an email Tuesday, police spokesperson Kristin Mumford said Hale “was assigned female at birth"" but did use male pronouns on a social media profile. Amid the confusion, social media users shared unrelated photos of other people, falsely claiming they showed the shooter. One photo that circulated widely shows an Instagram user with the handle “Aidencreates,” who crafts and sells miniature buildings online. “Apparently I’m being confused with the Nashville incident that happened today but I have nothing to do with that. I live in Pennsylvania,” the Instagram user clarified in a video that was posted on the platform. The confusion was linked to an online graphic design portfolio credited to Audrey Hale, which featured a link to a similar Instagram handle. Multiple social media posts also featured a manipulated photo of Sam Hyde, a comedian and internet personality whose photo has been featured in numerous memes over the years falsely identifying him as the suspect in mass shootings, including the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida. The posts featured a photo of Hyde that was edited to add long blonde hair and falsely claimed that the Nashville shooter was “Samantha Hyde,” a “trans female.”___Photo of Oklahoma protester misrepresented as Nashville shooterCLAIM: A photo of a person holding a sign featuring pink, blue and white guns and the words “trans rights… or else” shows the shooter who killed six people at a private Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee, on Monday.THE FACTS: The photo does not show the shooter. The person who took this photograph confirmed it was captured in Oklahoma City before news of the Nashville shooting was widespread. The photo circulated widely online after the police chief identified the shooter, Audrey Hale, as transgender. Social media accounts and other sources indicate the shooter identified as a man and may have recently begun using the first name Aiden. “This is the trans shooter, Audrey Hale,” read one tweet shared thousands of times. “The Feds are in the middle of trying to scrub ALL of her social media & pictures from the internet.” The tweet claimed the shooter was a “terrorist” who wanted to kill Christians, “as the sign makes clear.” However, the person holding the sign in the image is not the shooter who opened fire at The Covenant School. The woman who took the photo confirmed to the AP that she captured it about 11 a.m. CDT on Monday at a protest and march in downtown Oklahoma City, hundreds of miles away from Nashville. “It was a protest entitled Bigotry is Bad for Business,” said Chelsea, the photographer, whose last name is being withheld over concerns for her safety. “They protested, they marched. They weren’t violent.” The photographer said she didn’t know the shooting had happened when she tweeted photos from the protest. Social media users then took her photo and misrepresented it as showing the shooter.— Ali Swenson___Nashville outlet did not tweet victim’s father calling for ‘end to tolerance’CLAIM: WSMV-TV Nashville tweeted that the father of a victim of Monday’s Nashville school shooting called for “an end to tolerance” and “the end of the trans evil.”THE FACTS: A representative with WSMV-TV, an NBC affiliate in Nashville said the tweet was fabricated. In addition, the outlet confirmed they did not report that information. The false tweet spread as friends and family members of the six people who were killed in the shooting shared stories about the victims. Police have identified the shooter, Audrey Hale, as transgender, and the bogus tweet alleges that the victim’s dad called for violence against the transgender community. The tweet in the image shows the name and logo of WSMV-TV’s Twitter account, and reads: “Father of murderer girl, 9, at Covenant school shooting, calls for ‘an end to tolerance’ in family statement to the press, vowing ‘to fight with every fiber of my being for the end of the trans evil. The evil that took my daughter. There must be a solution to this evil in America.’” The image doesn’t show a link to a story. The image circulated widely on Wednesday. However, the tweet shown in the image is not real and no such quote has been publically reported from any victim’s family member in any news outlet. The tweet does not appear on WSMV-TV’s Twitter profile and the outlet stated on its own Twitter account that the image was fake. Amanda Hara, an anchor and director of digital at WSMV-TV, confirmed to the AP in an email that the tweet is fake and didn’t come from the outlet.— Associated Press writer Karena Phan in Los Angeles contributed this report.___Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck___Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852757,Marquette's Shaka Smart voted men's AP coach of the year,"Shaka Smart has packed an entire career's worth of experiences into 14 years as a college head coach. He led VCU to an improbable Final Four as a 30-something wunderkind in 2011, guided mighty Texas to a Big 12 Tournament title during six otherwise tepid years in Austin, and now has turned Marquette into a Big East beast.It's sometimes easy to forget he's still just 45 years old.Yet his work with the Golden Eagles this season might have been his best: Picked ninth in the 11-team league by its coaches, they won the regular-season title going away, then beat Xavier to win their first Big East Tournament championship.That earned Smart the AP coach of the year award Friday. He garnered 24 of 58 votes from a national media panel to edge Kansas State's Jerome Tang, who received 13 votes before guiding the Wildcats to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament, and Houston's Kelvin Sampson, who earned 10 before taking the Cougars to the Sweet 16.Voting opened after the regular season and closed at the start of the NCAA Tournament, where the No. 2 seed Golden Eagles were knocked out in the second round by Michigan State and Smart's longtime mentor, Tom Izzo.“I'm very grateful to win this award,"" said Smart, the second Marquette coach to take it home after Hall of Famer Al McGuire in 1971, “but obviously it always comes back to the guys you have on your team.“Early on,” Smart said, “we had a real sense the guys had genuine care and concern for one another, and we had a very good foundation for relationships that we could continue to build on. And over the course of seasons, you go through so many different experiences as a team. And those experiences either bring you closer together or further apart. Our guys did a great job, even through adverse experiences, even through challenges, becoming closer together.”It's hardly surprising such cohesion is what Smart would choose to remember most from a most memorable season.The native of Madison, Wisconsin, who holds a master's degree in social science from California University of Pennsylvania, long ago earned a reputation for building close bonds with players and a tight-knit camaraderie within his teams.No matter how high or low the Golden Eagles were this season, those traits carried them through.“Everything that we go through, whether it be the retreat that we went on before the season, all the workouts in the summer, he’s preaching his culture,” said Tyler Kolek, a third-team All-American. “And he's showing his leadership every single day, and just trying to impart that on us, and kind of put it in our DNA. Because it's definitely in his DNA.”That's reflected in the way Smart, who accepted the Marquette job two years ago after an often bumpy tenure at Texas, has rebuilt the Golden Eagles program after it had begun to languish under Steve Wojciechowski.Sure, Smart landed his share of transfers — Kolek among them — in an era in which the portal has become so prevalent. But he largely built a team that finished 29-7 this season around high school recruits, eschewing a quick fix in the hopes of long-term stability. Among those prospects were Kam Jones, its leading scorer, and do-everything forward David Joplin.“He teaches us lots of things about the importance of each other,” Joplin said. “He lets us know, time and time again, that we can’t do anything without each other, but together we can do anything.”That sounds like a decidedly old-school approach to building a college basketball program.One embraced by a still-youthful coach.“I think being a head coach has never been more complicated, never been more nuanced, and never more all-encompassing,"" Smart told the AP in a wide-ranging interview last week. “Does that mean it's harder? You could say that.“What makes your job less hard,"" Smart said, ""is having a captive audience in your players, and guys that truly understand and own what goes into winning, and that's what we had this past year. But those things just don't happen. There are a lot of steps that have to occur on the part of a lot of people, not just the coach, to get to where you have a winning environment.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World

MLB owners are expected to vote on the agreement next week.The Major League Baseball Players Association, which in September began representing players with minor league contracts, said Friday that more than 99% of minor leaguers who cast ballots approved the deal. About 5,500 players are in the bargaining unit.“It’s a historic day for these players,” union head Tony Clark said in a statement.Minimum salaries will rise from $4,800 to $19,800 at rookie ball, $11,000 to $26,200 at Low Class A, $11,000 to $27,300 at High Class A, $13,800 to $27,300 at Double A and $17,500 to $35,800 at Triple-A. Players will be paid in the offseason for the first time.Minor league players will receive four weeks of retroactive spring training pay for this year. They will get $625 weekly for spring training and offseason training camp and $250 weekly for offseason workouts at home.Most players will be guaranteed housing, and players at Double-A and Triple-A will be given a single room. Players at Low A and High A will have the option of exchanging club housing for a stipend. The domestic violence and drug policies will be covered by the union agreement. Players who sign for the first time at 19 or older can become minor league free agents after six seasons instead of seven.MLB agreed not to reduce minor league affiliates from the current 120. Beginning in 2024, teams can have a maximum of 165 players under contract during the season and 175 during the offseason, down from the current 190 and 180.Players will gain rights to second medical opinions, a 401k plan and arbitration to contest discipline under a just cause standard.The union will take over group licensing rights for players.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852771,Missouri Planned Parenthood sues over transgender inquiry,"Associated Press (AP) — Missouri’s state attorney general is investigating gender-affirming care provided by Planned Parenthood, according to a lawsuit filed Friday by the St. Louis health provider.Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey demanded documents from Planned Parenthood after finding out that the clinic provides “life-altering gender transition drugs to children with any therapy assessment,” spokeswoman Madeline Sieren said in a statement. She described that as a departure from standard care.Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri sued in response, trying to block access to its records. In court filings, the healthcare provider argued Bailey has no authority to investigate the clinic, which is inspected by the state health department.A Planned Parenthood doctor described Bailey’s investigation as a “fishing expedition"" targeting the clinic, which provides gender-affirming care to adults, and teens ages 16 and older. Dr. Colleen McNicholas, the health center’s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that the attorney general’s investigation is “an attempt to help him work outside of the legislative process and eliminate access to transgender care for Missourians.”The Attorney General’s Office cited its ongoing investigation into a transgender youth clinic run by Washington University, “or others in the state providing similar services,” as the reason for the document request, according to a letter to Planned Parenthood dated March 10.Sieren criticized Planned Parenthood for withholding its records.“We look forward to prevailing in this request for information and learning what is truly going on with Planned Parenthood in connection with gender transition issues,” Sieren said in a Friday statement.In February, Bailey launched an investigation into the Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital following allegations of mistreatment by a former employee. The ex-staffer alleged that physicians there did not warn patients and parents enough about potential side effects of puberty blockers and hormones, and that doctors pressured parents to consent to treatment.Planned Parenthood argues in its lawsuit that its clinic has nothing to do with the Washington University center.The lawsuit comes amid a national push to restrict transgender health care, drag shows, bathroom access and how LGBTQ+ topics are discussed in schools. The lawsuit was filed Friday as rallies were scheduled in cities nationwide as part of Transgender Day of Visibility.As the state's top prosecutor, Bailey is following his predecessor’s lead in using the office to take a stand on social issues. Last week, he announced plans to file an emergency rule to restrict healthcare for transgender children. It would require an 18-month waiting period, 15 therapy sessions and additional mental health treatment before Missouri doctors can provide gender-affirming care to minors.“I am dedicated to using every legal tool at my disposal to stand in the gap and protect children from being subject to inhumane science experiments,” Bailey said in a statement announcing the planned rule.His office has not yet filed the rule.Transgender medical treatment for children has been available in the U.S. for over a decade and is endorsed by major medical associations. Many clinics use treatment plans pioneered in Amsterdam 30 years ago, according to a recent review in the British Psych Bulletin. Since 2005, the number of youth referred to gender clinics has increased as much as tenfold in the U.S., U.K, Canada and Finland, the review said.McNicholas, of Planned Parenthood, said Bailey is using the “same playbook” that anti-abortion activists and elected officials have used to restrict abortions.Missouri banned almost all abortions in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.Before that, Republicans fought for years to regulate abortion out of existence in the state. The GOP-led state legislature proposed anti-abortion bills yearly. When increasingly restrictive bans on the procedure were tossed in court, Republican governors stepped in.“If we are to learn anything from our past experience with the state targeting us for the provision of lawful abortion care, we know that other folks who are providing this care are certainly going to be targets,” McNicholas said. “If not now, then soon.”",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852772,EPA approves California rules phasing out diesel trucks,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Biden administration cleared the way Friday for California's plan to phase out a wide range of diesel-powered trucks, part of the state's efforts to drastically cut planet-warming emissions and improve air quality in heavy-traffic areas like ports along the coast.The decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allows California — which has some of the nation's worst air pollution — to require truck manufacturers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission trucks over the next couple of decades. The rule applies to a wide range of trucks including box trucks, semitrailers and even large passenger pick-ups.“Under the Clean Air Act, California has longstanding authority to address pollution from cars and trucks. Today’s announcement allows the state to take additional steps in reducing their transportation emissions through these new regulatory actions,” said EPA Administrator Michael Regan, in a statement.Gov. Gavin Newsom applauded the state's role as a leader for setting ambitious vehicle emission standards.“We’re leading the charge to get dirty trucks and buses – the most polluting vehicles – off our streets, and other states and countries are lining up to follow our lead,” the Democrat said in a statement.The EPA typically sets standards for tailpipe emissions from passenger cars, trucks and other vehicles, but California has historically been granted waivers to impose its own, stricter standards. Other states can then follow suit, and eight other states plan to adopt California's truck standards, Newsom's office said. In a letter last year, attorneys general from 15 states, Washington, D.C., and New York City urged the EPA to approve the California truck standards.The transportation sector accounts for nearly 40% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. Newsom has already moved to ban the sale of new cars that run entirely on gasoline by 2035. The EPA has not acted on those rules.The new truck standards are aimed at companies that make trucks and those that own large quantities of them. Companies owning 50 or more trucks will have to report information to the state about how they use these trucks to ship goods and provide shuttle services. Manufacturers will have to sell a higher percentage of zero-emission vehicles starting in 2024. Depending on the class of truck, zero-emission ones will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035.California has a long legacy of adopting stricter tailpipe emission standards, even before the federal Clean Air Act was signed into law, said Paul Cort, a lawyer with environmental nonprofit Earthjustice.“We have a vehicle problem,"" Cort said. ""We're addicted to our cars and trucks, and that's a big cause of the air pollution that we're fighting.”But Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, said it's too soon to adopt the California standards.“The charging infrastructure is certainly not there,” he said about powering stations for electric vehicles. “And on top of the charging infrastructure, we have the grid issues.”While California was hit this winter by atmospheric rivers that soaked much of the state, it has for years suffered from drought conditions, and in September, a brutal heat wave that put its electricity grid to the test.The announcement came as advocates are pushing for more ambitious tailpipe emissions standards in other states and at the national level.“We don't just fight for California, we fight for all of the communities,” said Jan Victor Andasan, an activist with East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice. The group advocates for better air quality in and around Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city that is known for its dense traffic and intense smog.Andasan and other environmental activists from across the country who are a part of the Moving Forward Network, a 50-member group based at Occidental College in Los Angeles, met with EPA officials recently to discuss national regulations to limit emissions from trucks and other vehicles.But some in the trucking industry are concerned about how costly and burdensome the transition will be for truck drivers and companies.“The state and federal regulators collaborating on this unrealistic patchwork of regulations have no grasp on the real costs of designing, building, manufacturing and operating the trucks that deliver their groceries, clothes and goods,” said Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Association, in a statement.“They will certainly feel the pain when these fanciful projections lead to catastrophic disruptions well beyond California’s borders,” he added.Federal pollution standards for heavy trucks are also getting tougher. The EPA released rules that will cut nitrogen oxide pollution, which contributes to the formation of smog, by more than 80% in 2027. The agency will propose greenhouse gas emissions limits this year.The agency expects the new standards and government investment will lead to zero-emissions electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks carrying most of the nation’s freight.California activists Andasan and Brenda Huerta Soto, an organizer with the People’s Collective for Environmental Justice, are troubled by the impact of pollution from trucks and other vehicles on communities with a large population of residents of color that live near busy ports in Los Angeles, Oakland and other cities as well as warehouse-dense inland areas.Huerta Soto works in Southern California's Inland Empire, where a high concentration of trucks pass through to transport goods. On top of truck pollution, the many cars, trucks and trains that travel through the area burden residents with noises, odors and pollutants these vehicles emit, she said.“We have the technology, and we have the money"" to move toward zero-emission vehicles, she said.___Associated Press writers Tom Krisher in Detroit and Matthew Daly in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.___Sophie Austin is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852773,Mug shot as a political boost? Some politicians have tried,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A celebrity and insatiable publicity hound long before he was president, Donald Trump has been photographed countless times. But never like this.Now that a New York grand jury has voted to indict him for his role in the payment of hush money to a porn actor, Trump will have to appear at district attorney headquarters in Manhattan to be booked, fingerprinted and get a mug shot taken. The former president, the first ever to be indicted, is expected to surrender to authorities early next week.New York law discourages the release of mug shots in most cases, though they have leaked in the past. Less clear is whether Trump would seek to have the picture released himself, for political or other reasons. Within minutes of word of his indictment breaking, his 2024 presidential campaign was sending fundraising messages off the news.Some Trump aides have floated the idea of holding a post-booking press conference — a political trail blazed by Texas Gov. Rick Perry when he surrendered to authorities for his own mug shot in 2014.Indeed, what is a moment of shame for many accused hasn't always been that for politicians. Some have offered large smiles — or at least defiant smirks. They've tried to frame the moment as a political boon, looking to boost their popularity with supporters who see them as being unfairly targeted.Here's a look at how some notable politicians handled their own mug shots:A SMIRK AND A SOFT-SERVE CONEClad in a snappy dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, Perry removed his then-signature black glasses — as mandated by county rules — and offered a smirking half smile in his 2014 mug shot.The Republican was facing abuse of power charges over a veto that prosecutors said he issued to settle political scores. But the governor did his best to convey that he considered the case a waste of time.A group of cheering supporters gathered outside and, when he emerged, Perry told them, “We will prevail."" He then went for vanilla ice cream at a nearby soft-serve joint in Austin, Texas, and tweeted a photo of himself and his lawyers hoisting their own cones under the caption, “And then, ice cream.”Noting the governor's posturing, the Democratic National Committee responded, “This may be a sideshow to Rick Perry but no amount of spin can cover up two felony charges.”Perry was looking to build momentum for a 2016 presidential run that ultimately fizzled in a matter of months — much like the case against him, which never went to trial.PUTTING ON A HAPPY FACEWhile he didn't mark the occasion with a press conference, another Texas Republican, former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, also saw political opportunity in his mug shot.Indicted in Houston in 2005 on accusations of money laundering, DeLay wore a dark suit with his gold House security pin still attached and offered such a wide and toothy mug shot grin that it looked like the resulting photo could have been affixed to a campaign poster. He was convicted, but the verdict was later overturned on appeal.Also smiling broadly in his mug shot was 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee and North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. Edwards, who wore a white shirt and blue tie in his 2011 mug shot, was charged with using nearly $1 million in funds from his 2008 presidential campaign to help cover up an extramarital affair. He was acquitted of one charge, and the jury deadlocked on others.The smile was less deliberate for former Attorney General John Mitchell, who offered a confused-looking half grin, wearing a shirt and tie but no jacket when he was booked in 1974. Mitchell was eventually convicted of conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon. Once the nation's top law enforcement officer, Mitchell ultimately served 19 months in prison.SOMBER SHOTSNot every politician sees criminal charges as a boost to their political future, though.Idaho Republican Sen. Larry Craig was arrested in 2007 by a plainclothes police officer in a men's bathroom at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. The officer said Craig tapped his foot and signaled under the stall that he wanted sex.Craig looked exceedingly uncomfortable in his mug shot in a suit, a tie and an American flag lapel pin — offering a tight-lipped look and wearing glasses that threw back deep light reflections.Craig appeared to be aware that his political career was effectively over. Although he later sought unsuccessfully to rescind his guilty plea and rebuffed calls from his own party to resign his Senate seat, Craig opted not to seek reelection in 2008.Looking equally troubled was Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who wore a blue jogging suit, his famous black hair decidedly less poufy than usual, as he peered impassively into the camera shortly after federal agents showed up around 6 a.m. to arrest him.Serving his second term, Blagojevich was arrested in 2008 and accused of trying to sell the Senate seat that Barack Obama vacated when he won the White House. He was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in federal prison — until Trump commuted his sentence in 2020.Blagojevich kept his sense of humor, though.When New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez was detained last summer while decrying the Supreme Court overturning the Roe v. Wade decision in Washington, she was pictured holding her hands behind her back as if handcuffed — except she wasn't wearing restraints.Blagojevich tweeted a picture of Ocasio-Cortez alongside his own mug shot under the caption, “At least when I get arrested, I get arrested for real!”",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852774,"To conserve, Nevada may try to buy back groundwater rights","CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Marty Plaskett upgraded his farming equipment and spent $60,000 on new sprinklers to conserve water, even before the rural Nevada valley where he farms alfalfa began more strictly managing groundwater.Now, Plaskett is weighing another adjustment: selling off part of his legal right to use water that lies under his land to the state.Even after a wet winter, Nevada and much of the West are still dealing with the effects of a prolonged drought that depleted groundwater supplies. Lawmakers in Nevada are considering a bill to allow the state to buy groundwater rights in diminished basins so nobody could use them again.In the area where Plaskett farms, the state severely overestimated decades ago just how much water was available from wells sunk deep into fractured rock and gravel.The Legislature hasn't determined how much farmers would be paid to give up some rights to groundwater.“It would mainly come down to, number one, the price,” said Plaskett, 57.States throughout the West are grappling with similar issues over how to conserve water deep underground in a variety of political landscapes where experts are skeptical water basins can ever return to sustainable levels. Conservation alone will not be enough, experts say.California implemented a system in 2014 that requires regional agencies to manage groundwater sustainability plans in places where there was little oversight. The state's lawmakers last year proposed spending $1.5 billion to buy senior water rights, but the idea didn’t have enough support.Arizona passed sweeping groundwater management legislation in 1980, though experts said the state isn’t on track to ensure what is pumped out is recharged by 2025.“It’s an indication of this big, transitional time that Western states are in,” said Sarah Porter, executive director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. “We’re taking a different view of groundwater these days.""Much of the spotlight over water scarcity in Nevada has been on the Las Vegas metropolitan area, which relies almost exclusively on the Colorado River. But in large swaths of rural Nevada, more groundwater exists on paper than is actually available.Several decades ago, Nevada's semi-arid landscape was promoted as a place where groundwater was plentiful. The state didn't have a good way to determine just how much water was under the land surface at the time but doled out rights to use it.Those parched landscapes have gotten a temporary reprieve by way of a historically wet winter. But the precipitation won’t be enough to pull rural areas out of a drought or refill aquifers.Other groundwater buyback programs exist across the West. But — unlike the one proposed in Nevada — many are limited to specific regions. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also works with various states to purchase water rights in areas of intense drought. Nevada looked to basins in southeast Oregon and Colorado as models for the proposed program.The Nevada bill — still awaiting a Senate committee vote — could be amended further as its sponsor, Republican state Sen. Pete Goicoechea, addresses concerns over implementation and funding, including the $5 million price tag that some say isn't enough. Proponents are looking for additional funding from the federal government or outside parties that could help foot the bill.And some are grappling with a lingering question of whether the state should pay for irrigators to give up their rights to water that could eventually be curtailed anyway as drought deepens.At a recent bill hearing, Jake Tibbitts, natural resources manager for rural Eureka County in central Nevada, said the state is responsible for over-allocating water rights in areas that have then seen tight-knit farming communities pop up.“Frankly, the state’s culpable on that and needs to provide some soft landing ability for some of these folks,” he said.In about half the water basins in Nevada, there's more water on paper than actual water. And a growing number of basins aren't being replenished at the rate they're being pumped, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources.Nowhere is this more prevalent than in Diamond Valley, about 300 miles (482 kilometers) north of Las Vegas where Plaskett lives on his 1,600-acre (647-hectare) farm. In 2015, the state designated it a critical management area, the strictest regulation for drought management.The state Supreme Court set new precedent last year when it ruled that management plans for these types of critical areas, which are regulated by Nevada's top water official, can deviate from a longstanding hierarchy of water rights determined by seniority.Goicoechea, a third-generation rancher, said he expects those designations to increase in the coming years. Another bill in the state Legislature would require a review of any groundwater management plan every 10 years.If both bills pass, lower-priority water users in Diamond Valley could see water cuts sooner than under the current 35-year plan. But Goicoechea said that could provide an incentive for them to sell rights under the proposed buyback program.“I think before they get to year 10, those people will start looking at it and saying, ‘Hey, there’s a way we can balance this bacon,'” Goicoechea said.Micheline Fairbank, deputy administrator of the Nevada Division of Water Resources, said the agency isn't planning to create more critical management areas, even in basins that could qualify. Rather, the agency encourages more localized plans before it would consider the “most extreme regulatory tool,” she said.Plaskett’s family bought the property in Diamond Valley in the 1960s, before the area had electricity and at a time the state thought there would be four times the amount of water available than what exists today.Plaskett, a recently elected Eureka County commissioner who has lower-priority water rights, isn't sure if he'll sell any to the state. He wonders what else he could sustain on his land or if he could grow the same amount of alfalfa and grass with less water.“There’s so many different things to consider,” he said. “But it’s really hard to talk about until the price structure starts to develop and we get further into the groundwater management plan.”___Stern is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852775,Moscow prison for US reporter was used in Stalin's purges,"Lefortovo prison, where American journalist Evan Gershkovich has been jailed on espionage charges, dates from the czarist era and has been a terrifying symbol of repression since Soviet times.The inconspicuous, pale yellow complex in eastern Moscow was built as a military penitentiary in 1881 and was used for low-ranking convicts sentenced to relatively short terms. But it gained its notoriety after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, when it became a top detention facility for the Soviet secret police.Under Soviet leader Josef Stalin’s Great Terror of mass arrests in the 1930s, Lefortovo was one of the main pre-trial detention facilities for “enemies of the people,” equipped with torture chambers to extract confessions. Stalin’s sadistic secret police chief, Lavrentiy Beria, personally took part in some prisoner interrogations and executions in its basement.Vasily Blyukher, one of the highest-ranking Red Army officers, was among those who died in 1938 after being tortured in Lefortovo.After Stalin’s death in 1953, the prison continued to serve as main detention facility for the KGB, which used it for espionage suspects and political dissidents. Stalin’s younger son Vasily was held in Lefortovo at one point following his father’s death as the country’s new leaders prosecuted him for various offenses.Nobel prize author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who chronicled Stalin’s purges in his “Gulag Archipelago,” spent a night in Lefortovo in 1974 before being expelled from the Soviet Union.Soviet dissidents Vladimir Bukovsky and Natan Sharansky were held there during Leonid Brezhnev's rule and later released in prisoner exchanges, and Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, served time there on corruption charges soon after the leader's death.Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was put in Lefortovo after his 1986 arrest on bogus espionage accusations. He was released without charge 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union’s U.N. mission who was arrested by the FBI on spying charges.Gershkovich, a 31-year-old reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is the first American reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since Daniloff. The Journal denied the allegations and demanded Gershkovich's release.Mathias Rust, a German teenager who astonished the world by landing his light plane on Red Square in 1987 after fooling Soviet air defenses, also was held in Lefortovo until his release the following year.After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the leaders of a hard-line parliamentary rebellion against Russia’s first president, Boris Yeltsin, in 1993 also were held there until their amnesty the following year.Other famous Lefortovo inmates included Russian intelligence officers Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal, both later poisoned in the U.K. in what British authorities described as Moscow-engineered attacks. Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium, while Skripal and his daughter survived their 2018 poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok.Even though it was formally transferred to Justice Ministry jurisdiction in 2005, the Federal Security Service, the top KGB successor agency that is known under its acronym FSB, has maintained de facto control of the facility.All those arrested by the FSB on spying charges and some other high-profile suspects, including government officials accused of corruption, are held in Lefortovo pending trial.Paul Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive and a former Marine, was held in Lefortovo after his arrest in 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the U.S. government have said are baseless. After his conviction in 2020, Whelan was transferred to another prison to serve his 16-year sentence.Lefortovo’s trademark is holding its prisoners in “total information isolation,” said Yevgeny Smirnov, a prominent lawyer who has defended espionage and treason suspects.“No calls, no visitation, no newspapers, nothing,” Smirnov told The Associated Press. “At best, they will receive letters — and even then most likely with a delay of a month or two. It’s one of the tools of suppression.”Smirnov and his colleague Ivan Pavlov said FSB espionage investigations typically last from a year to 18 months, followed by a trial behind closed doors. There have been no acquittals in treason and espionage cases in Russia since 1999, Pavlov said.While Lefortovo has maintained its distinctive Soviet-era feel, one addition was a small Russian Orthodox church built on its grounds with small separate prayer cabins to keep inmates from being seen by others.Authorities maintain a tight lid of secrecy on Lefortovo, not disclosing any details such as the number of prisoners held there. Russian media reports said it hosts no more than 200 prisoners at a time, normally kept in solitary confinement.Writer Eduard Limonov, who spent two years in Lefortovo in the early 2000s after being charged with extremism for his political activities, described its dusty red carpets in the corridors, muffling the steps of inmates, and portraits of Soviet secret police founder Felix Dzerzhinsky in interrogation rooms.Cell doors shut noiselessly, with the silence only broken when guards use clacking devices or banged metal pipes to warn colleagues that they were escorting a suspect to avoid meeting others.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852776,Rodgers moves into 3-shot lead at Valero Texas Open,"SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Patrick Rodgers took a step toward his first PGA Tour victory — and his first Masters appearance — on Friday, shooting a 5-under 67 to take a three-stroke lead midway through the second round of the weather-delayed Valero Texas Open.Rodgers, who finished his opening-round 66 on Friday morning, birdied four of the final five holes in his second round at TPC San Antonio to post a 36-hole total of 11-under 133.“It’s something I’ve always dreamt of,” said Rodgers, who's making his 235th start on tour. “I’m excited for the chance. It’s going to be a really fun next couple of days.”Corey Conners, the 2019 winner in San Antonio, was 8 under after a 72. Michael Thompson shot 68 and was another shot behind.With the tournament in catch-up mode because of hours-long fog delays on Thursday morning, the afternoon half of the draw had no chance of finishing on Friday. Among the players on the course when darkness halted play, Roberto Diaz was 8 under with eight holes to play and Brendon Todd was 7 under with three holes left.Rodgers' tee shot on the 198-yard 16th stopped inside 8 feet, and he had another birdie inside 10 feet at 17. He reached the 593-yard, par-5 18th in two for his closing birdie.“I love to make the rounds feel pretty seamless and easy,” Rodgers said.The 30-year-old Rodgers starred in college at Stanford but is winless since joining the PGA Tour in 2015.Conners fell out of the lead with mistakes in the middle of his round. He four-putted his seventh hole, the par-3 16th, including three attempts within 4 feet. His tee shot on the 17th hooked into the brush, and he took an unplayable lie, leading to bogey.“A little mindless,” Conners said. “That was an unfortunate blemish on the scorecard. Certainly would like to have that over. But that’s how it goes.”Conners, winless since his Texas Open triumph four years ago, rebounded by shooting 2 under on his second nine, with birdies on both of the par 5s.Conners is already in the field at Augusta National next week, but the final spot at the Masters awaits the winner in San Antonio if he's not already eligible.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852777,Review: Boygenius is cohesive and powerful in 'The Record',"“The Record” by Boygenius (Interscope)The internet's favorite indie girls welcome you into the brilliant, colorful world of Boygenius, again.The supergroup, consisting of best friends Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, formed and released their critically well-received self-titled EP in 2018. Five years later, the powerhouse women of Boygenius masterfully recapture the same magic in their first full-length album, “The Record.”Cohesion within the group sneaks up on you like a shadow in the night. The album is soft, brutal and a reflection of a cruel, unrelenting world full of fatalistic imagery, but the love they've discovered in each other and in the music they craft together saves and reignites them.Album single “Emily I'm Sorry,” dives into Bridgers' perspective on a past relationship, apologizing for all the wrongdoing she inflicted on Emily. Dacus and Baker seamlessly harmonize with Bridgers as she sings anxiously, “I’m 27 and I don’t know who I am (Don’t know who I am)/But I know what I want.”“Not Strong Enough” is an uptempo, guitar-heavy, folksy song focused on self-hatred and loathing where Baker's softness shines. She croons contemplating death: “Drag racing through the canyon/Singing ‘Boys Don’t Cry’/Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement?”Standout “Revolution 0"" wistfully tells the story of falling in love on the internet, Bridgers said in a Rolling Stone interview. Some speculate that the song is an examination of the breakup between Bridgers and actor Paul Mescal, her former fiancé. “If it isn’t love/Then what the f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) is it?/I guess just let me pretend,” she whispers sorrowfully with backing from the rest of Boygenius.An ultimate rock jam riddled with electric guitar and drums, the witty “Satanist” forces the group to ponder philosophical questions and if they’re deal breakers. Dacus asks confidently, “Will you be a nihilist with me?/If nothing matters/That’s a relief to me.""“Letters To An Old Poet” is an exemplary closing piano ballad with beautiful production, breathing life throughout the three minutes. Bridgers sings, “You think you’re a good person because you don’t punch me in the stomach.” Dacus and Baker join her in support when she sings she wants to be happy.During the journey into “The Record,” Baker, Dacus and Bridgers bare truths from the deepest parts of themselves, but there's strength in their togetherness — their truths are a little less formidable when they join as one.___For more AP Music Reviews, go to: https://apnews.com/hub/music-reviews",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852778,Harris visits site of grandfather's old home in Zambia,"LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris paused Friday during a whirlwind diplomatic swing through Africa for something much more personal: A visit to the site of her maternal grandfather’s home in Lusaka, where he lived as an Indian public servant in the 1960s.P.V. Gopalan was working with the newly independent Zambia government six decades ago on refugee resettlement and lived at 16 Independence Ave., where Harris visited as a little girl.The home no longer exists; rather, an office building now stands on the plot of land. The location was identified using plot numbers in public records and land surveys, according to a White House official.Harris on Friday said it was “very special” to go back, and she described her grandfather as “one of my favorite people” with a lasting influence on her life.“He believed in the nobility of public service, he believed in fighting corruption,” she said. “These are things he would talk about a lot, and I don’t think until I was older I realized how that subconsciously influenced the way I think.”Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Lusaka pored through public records, spoke with Zambian and Indian authorities, and reached out to former Zambian government officials to identify the precise location of Gopalan's home. Harris' family members also offered memories about the home, which helped with the embassy's search, the White House official said.The confirmation came just in time for Harris' weeklong trip to Africa; the U.S. embassy identified the location while Harris was in Ghana, the first stop of her visit to the continent, a few days ago. The Zambian Ministry of Lands confirmed that 16 Independence Ave. was indeed Gopalan's home, through a March 9, 1967 public lands document.As Harris toured the location, U.S. embassy official Elizabeth Norikane told the vice president that she had been searching for the precise spot for a year.Zambia has celebrated Harris' childhood ties to the country. On the drive from the airport into the city, Harris was greeted by signs that read: “Welcome back to Zambia.”___Associated Press reporter Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852779,Biden's strategy on Trump's indictment: No comment,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Does President Joe Biden have any reaction to the indictment of former President Donald Trump? Is he concerned about possible protests or that the unprecedented indictment could further divide the nation? What does the indictment mean for the rule of law in the United States?Biden's answer on Friday was the same each time: No comment, no comment, no comment.“I’m not going to talk about Trump’s indictment,” Biden said firmly as he departed the White House en route to Mississippi, where he toured storm damage.In his brief exchange with reporters, the Democratic president underscored the broader tactics that his administration is trying to take as it relates to the Republican former president's indictment by a Manhattan grand jury: Take the political temperature down, stay out of active criminal matters, focus on Biden's agenda and priorities.It may become more difficult as Trump's legal matters progress. But at least in their initial approach on Friday, Biden and other top administration officials were sticking to their playbook.""I am not going to comment on an ongoing criminal case as it relates to the former president,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said during a news conference in Lusaka, Zambia, part of her weeklong trip across Africa.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to Mississippi, added: “Look, we’re just not going to comment on any ongoing case, and I will just leave it there.”The press secretary did stress that Biden supports peaceful protests and that the administration is always prepared for any contingencies. Biden found out about the indictment of his predecessor through news reports on Thursday, like other Americans, Jean-Pierre added.But otherwise, the White House would have no comment.The nature of the charges against Trump was unclear because the indictment remained under seal, but they stem from payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.One head of state did have something to say: Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, who appeared alongside Harris during the news conference Friday.When asked what Trump's indictment exemplifies in terms of the rule of law in the United States, Hichilema said that “regulations create a platform or framework around which we agree either as Americans or as Zambians to govern ourselves” and to “live within those confines.”“When there’s transgression against the law, it does not matter who is involved,” Hichilema said. “I think that is what the rule of law means.”But to be clear, Hichilema wasn't talking directly about Trump, either.“I think let’s remove names from your question,” he said in response, later adding: “I take out a name. I put in place of a name what we citizens of our countries, citizens of the global community, must do to -- as we exercise our rights and freedoms.”___Associated Press reporter Chris Megerian contributed to this report from Lusaka, Zambia.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852786,Nyke Slawik: 'We've earned the right to be acknowledged and respected',"DW: Ms. Slawik, you and your colleague Tessa Ganserer have written history: you are the first transgender women in Germany's Bundestag parliament. Does that make you proud?Nyke Slawik: It makes me happy for all queer people in Germany, above all for all transgender people, because they have never had this type of representation before. When I was young, I didn't have any role models in the media or in politics. That was something that I really could have used, to give me the feeling that we are a normal part of society and that we are everywhere. We can also act in this society, actively change something, and not just remain trapped in this victim role. It is an important step for us and our rights.Your transgender identity is only one part of you, but one that you are often asked about. You deal with other issues in the Bundestag: transportation policy, modern social policy, climate protection. Is your transgender identity a blessing or a curse?For me, it was always important to be open about my story and my identity because I know that people feel empowered by it, that it gives them power and that they feel seen.You and Tessa Ganserer have also experienced verbal attacks in the Bundestag, mostly from AfD [Alternative for Germany] representatives. You must have pretty thick skin…You have to have thick skin as a politician because you have to deal with a lot of criticism, and some of that is good and right in a democracy. But many attacks cross the line, are trans-hostile. I am often attacked online and of course some of that sticks, but I do not want to give people the satisfaction of intimidating me and I continue to work toward a society in which no one has to hide.You came out at 17. When did you know you did not identify with the male sex?It was always clear to me. Even as a child I felt it quite strongly. There was a strong desire by those around me to have me fulfill male roles. I remember quite well how I was dragged to soccer and all the hobbies that a supposed boy was expected to have. None of that fit me. And when I hit puberty I had a very strong physical sense that my body was developing in a direction that I could not begin to identify with.After you realized that for yourself who did you tell first? Your parents? Friends?Back then I let a friend know first but unfortunately she was not supportive of me. She told me I would never be a woman. We broke off contact. My parents had a hard time dealing with it in the first weeks and months but then they supported me; my family and my school, tooYour father is from Poland, from a conservative Catholic family. How did he react?When I told him about it he asked me: ""Should I hit you now, or what?"" He wasn't serious. He was overwhelmed but he soon began dealing with the situation facing transgender people and he, too, started supporting me, which surprised me. I was very scared at the time.Polish politician and leader of the Law and Justice party (PiS), Jaroslaw Kaczynski, often makes fun of transgender people, or claims transgender identity is a Western fad. How would you counter that?No matter whether male or female, whether gay, lesbian or transgender — we are part of society. Transgender people carry their identity with them from birth or from early childhood. And the West did not invent transgender identity. Lesbian, gay, bi or trans people are everywhere across the world and they always have been.Would you tell him that transgender people often undergo an agonizing process that no one would take upon themselves voluntarily?Transgender people suffer insults online or on the street every day, or get threatening letters. It has been shown that transgender people have a far higher risk of losing their jobs, doing worse in their career or even ending up homeless. Being transgender does not bring advantages, rather the opposite — it entails lots of challenges. It's also still not easy for those who transition to get medical treatment, access to hormones or possible surgery.Germany's ruling coalition wants to get rid of the ""transsexual law"" from 1980 and replace it with self-determination legislation. When will it become law?Many parts of Germany's transsexual law are unconstitutional. Until just a few years ago it required people who wanted to change their name or marital status to divorce. There were also forced sterilizations. The Federal Constitutional Court declared that unconstitutional.Even though the World Health Organization (WHO) says trans identity is not a psychological disorder the German state still forces transgender people to undergo long therapy sessions and requires two independent psychologists to attest that a trans identity is present. We want to change that so that those affected can submit an application themselves. The law is set to go through the Bundestag this year.The self-determination law would affect name and civil status changes but is also supposed to make medical transitioning easier. How?We want to make gender reassignment surgery a legal entitlement when it comes to service costs. Transgender people suffer psychologically when they have no access to medical services and have to keep writing their insurance companies and wait for months or years for services.Seven years after you transitioned you wrote: ""Before, I used to blame myself for not fitting into this world and did everything possible to attract as little attention as possible. Things are different today. I am proud to be who I am and I would still give everything to ensure that this is no longer a social battle but rather the most natural thing in the world."" A moving statement…I want to be a door opener. We are more than 700 parliamentarians in the German Bundestag, among us, two transgender women. In the world of gender diversity there are far more. There are intersex people who do not fit into a world that only thinks in terms of male-female. There are transgender men and many people who do not identify with the categories male-female.What can one do to get society to be more open and tolerant of minorities?Representation is really important. There are probably many people who may not have contact with transgender people and have prejudices or fears. And I think when they see us and see that we are totally normal people, this fear can be taken away.Even if we are a small part of society we deserve the right to be acknowledged and respected, That goes for other minorities too, whether that is in the area of religion or if it has to do with people with migrant backgrounds: We all have the right to not be attacked and to live our lives as freely and as self-determined as possible.This interview was conducted by Katarzyna Domagala-Pereira and was originally published in German.",2023/03/31,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852799,Journalist's arrest threatens reporting from Russia,"NEW YORK (AP) — The arrest of a Wall Street Journal reporter on espionage charges in Russia has news organizations based outside the country weighing for the second time in a year whether the risks of reporting there during wartime are too great.The Journal and other news outlets continued to press Friday for the release of Evan Gershkovich, He was taken into custody by Russian security officials a day earlier and accused of spying, charges the newspaper vehemently denies.More than 30 press freedom groups and news organizations, including the Journal, The New York Times, BBC, The Associated Press, The New Yorker, Time and The Washington Post, signed a letter Friday to Anatoly I. Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., expressing concern about ""a significant escalation in your government's anti-press actions.“Russia is sending the message that journalism within your borders is criminalized and that foreign correspondents seeking to report from Russia do not enjoy the benefits of the rule of law,” they said.A reporter for The New York Times who was temporarily in Moscow, Valerie Hopkins, left after Gershkovich's arrest, the newspaper said.“This is a significant shift and one that a lot of news outlets that have maintained journalists there will be looking at with alarm,” said Jodie Ginsberg, president of the Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group that promotes press freedom and safety.Gershkovich's arrest comes a year after the Russian government, shortly after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, imposed harsh new restrictions on journalists that threatened punishment for reports that went against the Kremlin's version of events — even forbidding the use of the word “war” to describe the conflict.Some news organizations pulled their journalists out as a result. Some of those journalists returned later when it became clear the restrictions were aimed mostly at Russians.A free-lance Russian journalist, Andrey Novashov, was sentenced to eight months of “correctional labor” for allegedly reporting false information about the Russian military, CPJ said. Ilya Krasilshchik, former publisher of the Latvia-based news site Meduza, was prosecuted on a similar charge but he left the country, CPJ said.Hundreds of Russian journalists have left the country, Ginsberg said.To date, the advocacy group said it was unaware of any non-Russian journalists arrested or prosecuted under those laws. Gershkovich was detained on separate spying charges.“Pretty much any foreign correspondent who is still there is getting ready to depart, or giving that very serious consideration at this point,” said Ann Cooper, who was a National Public Radio bureau chief in Moscow and former executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Gershkovich's arrest is “very unsettling and would make anybody feel uncomfortable,” she said.“Every journalist and news organization has to weigh the circumstances and make their own decision,” Cooper said. “If I were an American correspondent based in Moscow right now, I don’t believe I would stay.”The New York Times does not have a reporter based in Russia now but has sent journalists, like Hopkins, in for periodic assignments, a spokeswoman said. For Tuesday's newspaper, Hopkins wrote about a single father who was convicted of discrediting the army and had his 13-year-old daughter put in an orphanage in a case that stemmed from an antiwar drawing she made at school.One journalist who left and came back, Steve Rosenberg, Russia editor of the BBC, tweeted that he was “shocked by what has happened” to Gershkovich. His Twitter account said nothing about his own status, and the BBC declined comment Friday.CNN has rotated international correspondents like Matthew Chance and Fred Pleitgen in and out of Russia for the past year, and Chance has been reporting from Moscow about Gershkovich's arrest. The network would not say more about its plans for staffing in the country.“We are concerned by the news coming from Russia and are monitoring the situation there closely,” it said in a statement.The Washington Post has three journalists reporting on Russia — Robyn Dixon, Mary Ilyushina and Francesca Ebel — but is not commenting on their whereabouts, a spokeswoman said. Dixon wrote about Gershkovich's arrest from Latvia. In a memo announcing Ebel's hiring last fall, the Post said its Russian team is working from outside the country.The Associated Press story about Gershkovich's arrest, as well as a separate profile of the journalist, carried no bylines or datelines. The AP does not speak about the moves of its personnel for security reasons, but it “maintains a presence” in Russia, spokeswoman Lauren Easton said.Bloomberg News pulled its reporters from Russia last year, with Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait telling staff members then that the new laws seem “designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association.” Bloomberg reporters have not returned to the country, a spokeswoman said on Friday.Even journalists who fled Russia last year continued to report on the country, taking advantage of technology unavailable to predecessors from earlier generations: the Internet, encrypted communications, and mobile-phone cameras in the hands of millions of potential witnesses.Still, Ginsberg said, “technology never replaces being there.”",2023/04/01,,World

He later was an assistant coach for the Bears from 2011-16 under coach Scott Drew.“Our search committee was immediately impressed not only by Coach McCasland and his ability to win at every level of college basketball, all while creating a positive culture built upon toughness, but also his passion for Texas Tech and his vision for our basketball program,” Tech athletic director Kirby Hocutt said.The 46-year-old McCasland replaces Mark Adams, who announced his resignation from his alma mater shortly after Texas Tech finished its season 16-16 with a loss in the opening round of the Big 12 tournament on March 8. Adams was suspended by the school from that game after making racially insensitive comments toward one of his players the previous week.While Texas Tech’s inquiry determined that Adams’ comments were unintentional and an isolated incident, the coach said he stepped down because he and the university felt the incident had become a distraction for the program.North Texas made its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 11 seasons in 2021, and got its first program tournament win by upsetting Purdue as a No. 13 seed in a first-round game. The Mean Green led the nation in scoring defense the past two seasons, holding opponents to 55.7 points a game.The Mean Green won three consecutive Conference USA titles from 2020-22, and were the runner-ups this year to Florida Atlantic, which is in the NCAA Final Four. North Texas clinched the NIT in its fourth game this year against conference foe UAB, which beat the Mean Green in the C-USA tournament semifinal game for its only win in the four. UNT won the 16-team CBI postseason tournament in 2018, McCasland's first season.“He established a program that has won championships, reached new postseason heights, and brought many moments of excitement to Mean Green fans,"" UNT athletic director Jared Mosley said. ""He and his family will be missed in Denton, but we are excited about the foundation that has been built and what is to come for UNT Basketball.”Before North Texas, McCasland was 20-12 in his only season at Arkansas State, which followed his time on Baylor's staff.McCasland was 27 when he got his first head coaching job in 2004, at Midland College in Texas, which he led to the 2007 junior college national championship. He went 56-12 at Midwestern State from 2009-11 with back-to-back NCAA Division II tournament regional final appearances.“I am thrilled for Coach McCasland, his family and Texas Tech. He has worked tremendously hard throughout his career preparing for this moment, experiencing great success at every stop along the way,"" Drew said. ""I have no doubt he will be an asset to our conference, Texas Tech and the West Texas region as a whole.”___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852801,New Mexico Supreme Court blocks local abortion ordinances,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The New Mexico Supreme Court blocked local anti-abortion ordinances Friday pending the outcome of a case centered on constitutional rights to equal protection and due process.The ruling granted a request by Democratic state Attorney General Raúl Torrez and follows the state's recent adoption of a new abortion rights bill signed by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham just weeks ago that overrides any local ordinances aimed at limiting access to abortion procedures and medications.The state already had one of the country’s most liberal abortion access laws, but two counties and three cities in eastern New Mexico recently adopted restrictions that reflect deep-seated opposition to offering the procedure. Torrez's petition and the legislation that was passed during the recent 60-day legislative session aim to override those ordinances and prevent other counties from adopting abortion restrictions.The goal is for New Mexico to remain a safe haven for women seeking abortions, Torrez said in a statement Friday.The legislation and the petition “will make it clear that everyone in the state of New Mexico has a protected, constitutional right to make their own healthcare decisions,” he said. ""Given the attacks we are seeing in Texas and across the country, I am proud to stand with our Legislature and the governor to continue this fight.”Democratic governors in 20 states this year launched a network intended to strengthen abortion access in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision nixing a woman’s constitutional right to end a pregnancy. The decision shifted regulatory powers over the procedure to state governments.In 2021, the Democratic-led New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to abortion even after the federal court rolled back guarantees. The governor also signed a series of executive orders that, among other things, barred state cooperation with other states that might interfere with abortion access.The changes over the past two years have prompted more providers to relocate to New Mexico and bring patients with them.Mississippi’s only abortion clinic relocated to southern New Mexico. Tele-health provider Choix, based in San Francisco, became licensed last year to operate in New Mexico.One of the largest abortion providers that had operated in Texas opened a new clinic in New Mexico’s largest city last week. Officials with Whole Woman’s Health said more than a dozen patients walked through the doors of the Albuquerque clinic in the first week, all of them from Texas. For some, it required a road trip that spanned about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers).“And everybody who cared for the patients was also from Texas. It was remarkably meaningful for the staff. It was Texans serving Texans,” said Whole Woman’s Health President and CEO Amy Hagstrom Miller. “It was just an emotional day for everybody.”Whole Woman’s Health started a fundraising effort last summer to help with the costs of moving equipment and supplies from Texas to New Mexico and for the purchase of a building to serve as its new home.New Mexico's governor also has pledged to spend $10 million to build a new abortion clinic in the southern part of the state near El Paso, Texas.In its order, the New Mexico Supreme Court outlined a schedule for the ongoing case over the ordinances in the cities of Hobbs, Clovis and Eunice, and in Lea and Roosevelt counties. It said briefs due in April should address what, if any, effect the new abortion rights law will have on the case.In an earlier brief filed with the court, a coalition of anti-abortion organizations argued that the attorney general bypassed ordinary litigation procedures by filing the emergency petition in hopes of having the court declare a new constitutional right without the benefit of a lower court taking up the issue.Erin Hawley, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the groups, suggested Friday that it would be “a massive error from the New Mexico Supreme Court if it was to create a so-called ‘right’ to abortion out of thin air.” She also took issue with the legislation barring local ordinances that limit access.“State legislatures should be affirming that life is a human right and ensuring that women and families facing unplanned pregnancies have real support,” Hawley said.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852802,T-wolves backup Naz Reid out indefinitely with broken wrist,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Timberwolves center Naz Reid will be sidelined indefinitely with a broken left wrist that occurred in the previous game, a blow to the team's depth during the stretch run of the regular season.The Timberwolves announced Friday before their game against the Los Angeles Lakers that Reid had an MRI exam in Minneapolis that revealed a fracture of the scaphoid bone. It's between the hand and forearm on the thumb side of the wrist.Reid was hurt in the fourth quarter Wednesday at Phoenix, when he tried to brace himself as he fell to the court after being fouled.The fourth-year player has led the team in scoring in six games this season and averaged 11.5 points and 4.9 rebounds per game with 53.7% shooting from the floor — all career bests. Undrafted out of LSU in 2019, Reid has become a valuable complement to big men Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns with his two-way skills off the bench. He proved to be particularly viable when Towns missed 52 games with a severely strained right calf muscle.“Super disappointed, obviously. He’s having an amazing season for us,” coach Chris Finch said. “He’s upset that he can’t help us down the stretch here. We’re gutted for him, too, but without him we’re not in this position, and we told him that.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852803,Worries grow that Trump indictment will eclipse other probes,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The indictment against former President Donald Trump involving a 2016 hush money payment is raising concerns that it could undermine public confidence in what democracy experts view as far more important investigations.Trump is facing multiple investigations related to his refusal to accept his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. That includes whether he pressured election officials to overturn the results, encouraged fake electors from battleground states and his role in the events that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.Jeffrey Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, called the indictment this week from a New York grand jury “the appetizer to their main course still to come.""“That main course, literally, is democracy at stake and who we are as a nation,” he said.The New York investigation that led to Thursday’s indictment involved payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels at the tail end of the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. But some worry that the charges — which remain under seal — could distract public attention from the other cases, which are more squarely focused on attacks against the country’s democratic institutions and traditions.Larry Diamond, an expert on democracy and senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said he was nervous that the New York charges will “trigger all of the charges of politicization against him and misuse of the judiciary.” It’s a theme Trump has been emphasizing on social media and during a recent campaign rally in Texas.“I would certainly not be opting to have this flimsiest of the cases go first,” Diamond said.The indictment already has rallied Trump’s supporters, both at the grassroots level and those holding public office. The reaction to Thursday’s indictment has exposed the deep political rifts that have increasingly polarized the country since Trump’s rise within the Republican Party.Kathy Clark, a retired police officer from suburban Palm Beach County, stood alongside the road outside Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after the indictment news broke, holding a “Trump Won” banner. Clark, dressed in a red, white and blue cowboy hat and vest, said the New York indictment will backfire.“People who were on the fence are going to see how the government has politicized the judicial system,” she said.Trump has promoted the idea that the investigations are partisan and intended to undermine his campaign as he embarks on his third bid for the White House. On his social media site, the former president cast prosecutors involved in the investigations as the ones endangering democracy.Other supporters lined up quickly behind him, including West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, who called the indictment “a political witch hunt and a political prosecution. And the only reason they’re doing this is because they’re scared. They know that they can’t beat him at the ballot box. That’s why they’re resorting to these terrible tactics.”Polls have shown that a majority of Republicans still support Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, suggesting they already believe he has been wronged by the system even though Biden’s win has been affirmed in multiple reviews, recounts and audits in the key presidential battleground states.Trump’s attempts to overturn those results amid false claims of widespread fraud are at the heart of two other ongoing investigations, including his role in trying to halt the certification of the election results and in the run-up to the violent attack on the Capitol. A special prosecutor also is looking into Trump’s retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, an investigation that could hold the greatest legal peril for the former president.A separate investigation in Georgia’s Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, is looking into the pressure Trump and others exerted on state officials to overturn the results of the presidential election there. The investigation began after a phone call in which Trump urged Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” enough votes to overturn Biden’s win.The payment that Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, made in 2016 to cover up an alleged sexual encounter with Daniels is the one that least involves an attack on democratic norms. But it is the detail that most easily lends itself to Trump’s contention that he is being attacked for partisan reasons.John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, said on CNN recently that the question is what happens after the indictment. If prosecutors fail to get a conviction, “I think the historians will look back and say that is the act that re-elected Donald Trump president.”Diamond, the Stanford expert, said despite his nervousness of the New York case moving ahead first, it will not stop the others.“The other stuff is not going to simply evaporate, and I think for the purpose of the defense of our constitutional system and the defense of the rule of law ... those are the ones that I think should carry the most weight in the public mind,” he said.Roscoe Howard, a former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, said prosecutors in New York are aware of who they are dealing with and the turmoil that will follow. But he said prosecutors aren’t focused on public opinion or the political consequences of a case.Their concern is not about other investigations, but whether their case is ready to go to court, Howard said.“There’s not a prosecutor in this country who will take a case to trial that they think they are going to lose,” he said. “They just don’t do that.”___Associated Press writer Terry Spencer in Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852804,Fencing event in France canceled after Russians readmitted,"PARIS (AP) — A fencing World Cup in France was canceled on Friday after the international governing body voted to let Russians compete.The French Fencing Federation said it would not host the men's Challenge Monal epee tournament near Paris in May following the International Fencing Federation's decision this month to end the year-long exclusion of competitors from Russia and its ally Belarus due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The decision led to a backlash when more than 300 fencers signed a letter of protest and the organizers of another World Cup in Germany withdrew as hosts.Organizers of an upcoming competition in Poland have said they will demand Russians and Belarusians sign a statement saying they do not support the war.The FIE voted to readmit Russians and Belarusians at events from mid-April, even before the International Olympic Committee said on Tuesday it wants sports to allow them to compete again as neutral athletes, as qualification for next year's Paris Olympics ramps up. The IOC has recommended conditions including no Russian or Belarusian entries in team events and a bar on athletes who are contracted to the military, but the FIE has yet to confirm if it will comply.Fencing is an influential sport in Olympic circles. IOC president Thomas Bach is a former fencer who won gold at the 1976 Olympics. Russia's and Ukraine's national Olympic bodies are headed by ex-fencers.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852805,Mexico's president visits city where fire killed 39 migrants,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president on Friday visited the border city where 39 migrants died in a fire at a detention center, expressing pain over the disaster though he was not expected to bring any changes in tough immigration policies.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he was personally devastated by Monday’s tragedy in Ciudad Juarez, which is across from El Paso, Texas.“I confess it hurt me a lot, it damaged me,” López Obrador said before starting out on his trip to Juarez. “It ripped my soul apart.”The president said the fire was the second most painful moment of his administration, exceeded only by a 2019 pipeline fire in the central Mexico town of Tlahuelilpan that killed about 135 people.However, it hasn’t cost him much politically.Many residents of Mexican border cities mourned the death of the migrants in the smoky mattress fire, which was set by some migrants to protest perceived moves to deport them. But in Ciudad Juarez, many peope were fed up with migrants largely from Central America and Venezuela begging for change at street corners and blocking border bridges.They and residents of other cities have been calling for authorities to be tough with migrants, and the U.S. also pressures Mexico to curb the flow of migrants.Ivonne Acuña Murillo, a political science professor at Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City, said López Obrador doesn’t have much maneuvering room to change Mexico’s immigration policy.“It would be difficult, on one hand, because of the enormous pressure from the United States” to stop migrants arriving at the border, Acuña Murillo said. She added that “it is difficult in terms of the president’s own policy goals ... the budget for migration and shelters and all of that is low.”Migrant anger did flare in Ciudad Juarez on Friday, when a group of migrants and their supporters tried to block the president’s motorcade, leading to scuffles. Earlier in the day, he had promised to meet with doctors treating the injured, but it was not clear if that happened.Eager to gain favor with the United States, López Obrador has made life hard for migrants seeking to cross Mexico to reach the U.S. border. He has assigned tens of thousands of army troops and National Guard officers to retain migrants, and allowed the United States to return migrants from Venezuela, Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba to Mexico.But the U.S. has contributed little to helping Mexico shelter or integrate the returned migrants.López Obrador lashed out Friday, saying the U.S. should be spending more on economic development in Latin America to prevent migrants from leaving their homes, rather than sending military aid to Ukraine.“How can you compare what the U.S. government sends to Central America, with the 30, 35 billion dollars it is spending on buying weapons for Ukraine?” he said.Federal Public Safety Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said that the government would close the detention center where the fire occurred and that it would check the conditions in other instalations.On Friday, in the southern city of Tapachula, the biggest detention center for migrants was nearly emptied to review conditions, said a federal official, who who spoke on condition of anonymity. The center, with capacity for about 1,000 people, has been criticized repeatedly for overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and corruption.López Obrador said he will set up a commission to ensure the human rights of migrants are protected. He said the commission will be headed by a longtime migrant activist, Rev. Alejandro Solalinde. It was unclear what powers the commission would have.In the meantime, López Obrador said, “I will concentrate on the medical side, basically. What matters to me is treatment for the injured.”Mexico has turned down a U.S. offer to help provide medial treatment to the injured, most of whom suffered smoke inhalation, saying they were too ill to be moved.Rodríguez said Thursday that 24 migrants remained hospitalized, all of them in apparently either serious or critical condition. Four migrants had been discharged, she said.The migrant accused of starting the fire suffered only slight injuries and already was released from the hospital, presumably into custody.That migrant, along with three officials from the National Immigration Institute and two private security guards at the detention center face charges of homicide and causing injuries. The federal prosecutor's office says it also is investigating others for possible misdeeds.A video from a security camera inside the Ciudad Juarez facility shows guards walking away when the fire started inside the cell holding migrants and not making any attempt to release them. It was not clear whether those guards had keys to the cell doors.There have been years of complaints about poor conditions and human rights violations at migrant detention facilities in Mexico, including inadequate ventilation, food and water, and overflowing toilets.And there is mounting evidence of corruption throughout Mexico's immigration system, in which everyone from lawyers and immigration officials to guards have taken bribes to allow migrants out of detention.Little has been done up to now to address these concerns.___Associated Press writers María Verza in Mexico City and Edgar H.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852807,Lack of big-name teams could take toll on Final Four ratings,"Cinderella teams make for great stories and busted brackets. They don't necessarily make for great television ratings, though.After getting a dream Final Four field last year, CBS and Turner Sports have something very different this weekend with Florida Atlantic, Miami, San Diego State and Connecticut making it to Houston.The lack of recognizable names could affect the ratings.Upsets during the first two weeks have seemingly already taken a toll. The tournament is averaging 9.11 million viewers through the regional finals, which is down 6% from last year. This after the first round on March 16-17 averaged 9.2 million, a record for the most-watched round of 64.Last year's Final Four of Duke, North Carolina, Kansas and Villanova resonated even with casual fans because it was loaded with national brands. It also included Mike Krzyzewski's final tournament as Duke's coach.This year's group doesn't have the same cachet.“The public is telling us that they would rather see the bluebloods. The ratings support that,” said former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson, who now runs his own sports television consulting company. “I think it’s because they're not familiar with teams like San Diego State, Miami or FAU. There was relatively little press attention paid to those teams during the year. Connecticut has a history, but they're the only one of the four that really has had national exposure.”College basketball also isn't different from other sports when it comes to marquee teams translating to bigger audiences.Two of last year's Final Four games rank among the three most-watched college basketball games in cable TV history. The semifinal matchup between North Carolina and Duke averaged 18.5 million on TBS and ranks second, while Kansas' comeback victory over North Carolina averaged 18.1 million.According to Sports Media Watch, which tracked Final Four ratings to 1975, the Baylor-Houston game from two years ago ranks as the least-watched semifinal at 8.36 million (individual semis started being tracked in 2002).The low for a title game on CBS is 2004, when 17.09 million watched UConn defeat Georgia Tech. The overall low was in 2018 on TBS, when 15.99 million viewed Villanova's win over Michigan. CBS and TBS began alternating Final Fours in 2016.Another thing that might factor into ratings this year is that Miami and Florida Atlantic are from the same television markets (Miami/West Palm Beach).There are signs that suggest the viewer drop won't be as bad. Last Sunday's regional final between Miami and Texas on CBS averaged 11.3 million, which was the most-watched basketball game since last year's deciding game of the NBA Finals.Also, the 2011 semifinal between Butler and Virginia Commonwealth — the last time two mid-majors met in a Final Four — was down only 2% from the 2010 early semi, when Butler beat Michigan State.“UConn is a very well-known program but with the other three, that's where the interesting storylines are,"" said Tag Garson, senior vice president of properties for Wasserman Media Group. ""There are pundits who said they were seeded on a line that wasn't reflective enough of the type season they had. There are some tremendous players that will be playing this weekend regardless of which team you are talking about.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852808,Probe of deadly Black Hawk crash begins as Army IDs victims,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The nine service members who died in a crash involving two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters ranged in age from 23 to 36 and were from seven states, the military said Friday, as it released the identities of the soldiers and an investigative team continued its probe of the accident.A military news release said the service members came from Florida, Texas, Missouri, California, North Carolina, Alabama and New Jersey.“This is a time of great sadness for the 101st Airborne Division. The loss of these Soldiers will reverberate through our formations for years to come,” said Maj. Gen. JP McGee, commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and Fort Campbell.Two HH-60 Black Hawk medical evacuation helicopters crashed near Fort Campbell on Wednesday night in southwest Kentucky during a training exercise, killing all nine soldiers aboard the two aircrafts. The crash occurred in Trigg County, Kentucky, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of the Army post that is home to the 101st Airborne Division.A special military investigative team was on the scene Friday but rain and wind have slowed the early work, Army officials said.The two Black Hawks were flying during a training exercise and the pilots were using night-vision goggles, Army officials said. The accident occurred during flying and not during the course of a medical evacuation drill, said Brig. Gen. John Lubas, the 101st Airborne deputy commander.The helicopters carried flight data recorders, similar to the black boxes that investigators use to analyze crashes involving passengers planes. Officials are hoping the devices yield information about the cause.The Army identified the soldiers as: Warrant Officer 1 Jeffery Barnes, 33, of Milton, Florida; Cpl. Emilie Marie Eve Bolanos, 23, of Austin, Texas; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Zachary Esparza, 36, of Jackson, Missouri; Sgt. Isaacjohn Gayo, 27, of Los Angeles, California.; Staff Sgt. Joshua C. Gore, 25, of Morehead City, North Carolina; Warrant Officer 1 Aaron Healy, 32, of Cape Coral, Florida; Staff Sgt. Taylor Mitchell, 30, of Mountain Brook, Alabama; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rusten Smith, 32, of Rolla, Missouri; and Sgt. David Solinas Jr., 23, of Oradell, New Jersey.The four soldiers piloting the two Black Hawks were Esparza, Smith, Barnes and Healy, according to the Army.Dave Busby, who taught Smith in middle school, was among several of Smith’s childhood teachers and classmates who posted tributes on Facebook.“What a great kid. What a tragedy,” Busby said by phone from his home in St. James, Missouri, the small town where Smith grew up. “I’ll be honest I wept — what a shame.”Even as a teen, Smith was ambitious, forward-looking and perceptive, Busby said: “You could tell he was going places.”Solinas' dedication to being a flight medic showed his character, his brother, Aidan Solinas, said in a statement.“We are a faithful family and we are proud David was training to rescue soldiers on the battlefield,” he said. ""Being a flight medic is one of the most difficult jobs that you can do, and illustrates that David was a man of compassion and faith.Gore’s father, Tim Gore, told the Goldsboro News-Argus that his son leaves behind a wife who’s pregnant. Gore, a pastor in Wayne County, said that his son, who was known to family as Caleb, was an infant when the family moved to North Carolina and remained in the state until he joined the Army after graduating high school.“His passion was search and rescue, and if you were wounded on the battlefield, Caleb coming out of that helicopter would be the most beautiful thing you would ever see,” Gore told the newspaper. “He was kind, compassionate, and a gentle giant because he was built like a tank.”Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday ordered flags at state buildings lowered to half-staff from sunrise on Saturday until sunset Monday in honor of the soldiers.Over the last 10 years, the Army’s Black Hawk helicopter has been involved in 40 so-called Class A mishaps, which involve either a fatality or more than $2.5 million in damage. Forty-four personnel died in those cases.Wednesday's crash was the deadliest training incident for the Army since March 2015, when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed off the Florida coast in dense fog, said Jimmie Cummings, spokesperson for the Army Combat Readiness Center at Fort Rucker. Four soldiers from the Louisiana Army National Guard and seven Marine special operations forces were killed.Cummings said the most deadly non-combat Black Hawk crash was in 1988 and also involved Fort Campbell aircraft. The crash killed 17 troops when two helicopters collided in mid-air. The most deadly Army aircraft training incident was a Chinook crash in Germany in 1982, that killed 46 U.S. and international forces. The second was a C-23 Sherpa fixed wing aircraft crash in Georgia in 2001 that killed 21 Army and Air Guard personnel.Fort Campbell also had a multi-aircraft crash in 1996, when two Blackhawks clipped propellers, killing five soldiers. The last deadly aviation accident at Fort Campbell occurred in 2018, when an Apache helicopter crashed during training, killing two soldiers on board.The Black Hawk helicopter is a critical workhorse for the U.S. Army and is used in security, transport, medical evacuations, search and rescue and other missions. The helicopters are known to many people from the 2001 movie “Black Hawk Down,” which is about a 1993 battle in Somalia.___Associated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York and writers Lolita Baldor in Washington, Lea Skene in Baltimore and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World

(AP) — A joint study by two federal government scientific agencies and the commercial fishing industry documents numerous impacts that offshore wind power projects have on fish and marine mammals, including noise, vibration, electromagnetic fields and heat transfer that could alter the marine environment.It comes as the offshore wind industry is poised to grow rapidly on the U.S. East Coast, where it is facing growing opposition from those who blame it for killing whales — something numerous scientific agencies say is not true.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance issued their report Wednesday after a 2 1/2-year-long study of the impacts existing offshore wind projects have on fish and marine mammals.The goal was to solidify existing knowledge of the impacts and call for further research in many areas.NOAA and BOEM are among agencies that say there is no link between offshore wind preparation and whale deaths. Their co-authorship of a report detailing potential negative impacts on fish and marine mammals may intensify an already highly politicized controversy.Asked Friday about the likelihood of this happening, NOAA spokesperson Lauren Gaches reiterated the agency's position that offshore wind is not causing the whale deaths, which remain under investigation.“We will also continue to explore how sound, vessel, and other human activities in the marine environment impact whales and other marine mammals,” she said.The fishing industry is concerned that fish near construction sites may be killed or chased away for prolonged periods even after the turbines are built, according to the report.“Physical changes associated with (offshore wind) developments will affect the marine environment — and, subsequently, the species that live there — to varying degrees,” the report read. ”These include construction and operation noise and vibration, electromagnetic fields, and thermal radiation from cables, as well as secondary gear entanglement.In an interview, Fiona Hogan, research director for the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance, said: ""We wanted to document what was known and not known. As far as we know, this is the first cooperatively developed report that cites all aspects of the potential interactions between fisheries and offshore wind.”The alliance is a fishing industry group trying to improve the compatibility of offshore wind with fishing operations.The American Clean Power Association, an offshore wind industry group, said Friday it was still studying the 388-page report.Andy Lipsky, who oversees the wind energy team at NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center, is a co-author of the report. He said it helps the agencies define the type of monitoring required for long-term study of offshore wind's effects and points out ""needed research on how offshore wind energy changes marine habitats and fisheries.”Several concerns raised in the report mirror many of those raised by opponents of offshore wind, including those who blame preparation for offshore wind farms for killing whales along the East Coast. Since December, 30 whales have washed ashore there.The report said offshore wind turbines can attract fish and marine life, but also repel them. The large underwater platforms are rapidly colonized by smaller marine life which in turn attracts larger predators to the area. Water cloudiness from turbine operations, noise, vibrations and electromagnetic fields could also make them leave the area.Hogan said some disagreement remains on whether wind platforms will be a net attraction or deterrent to fish.Regarding noise, the report said sounds emitted from pile-driving during construction “can be severe, resulting in mortality or injury of hearing tissues.” Noise levels from ongoing operation of the turbines once constructed “are not associated with direct physical injury, (but) long-term exposures may have negative effects on communication, foraging, and predator detection.”In almost every instance, the report called for additional research. The study only dealt with fixed-location wind turbines; a second study will examine wind projects that float on the water's surface.The $150,000 survey was funded by NOAA.___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC",2023/04/01,,World

(AP) — The body of a 2-year-old Florida boy who had been the subject of a frantic search after his mother was slain was found Friday in a lake in the jaws of an alligator, police said.St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway also said the boy's father, 21-year-old Thomas Mosley, will be charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the killing of the boy's mother, 20-year-old Pashun Jeffery, and their young son Taylen Mosley.Searchers, including dive teams and officers using drones, had been intensely looking for the boy since his mother's body was discovered in their apartment earlier this week and he was nowhere to be found.""We are sorry it has had to end this way,” Holloway said during a Friday night news conference.Officers searching for the toddler at a lake a few miles from the apartment complex noticed an alligator “with an object in its mouth” that they quickly realized was a child's body, Holloway said. They fired shots at the reptile, which dropped the body.""We were able to retrieve Taylen’s body intact,” the chief said. The alligator was euthanized.Thomas Mosley is hospitalized with cuts on his hands and arms and has refused to talk to investigators, Holloway said. He does not yet have a lawyer to speak on his behalf.“The father is not talking to us,” he added.Jeffery, who worked at a CVS store, and her son were last seen by family members around 5:20 p.m. Wednesday. Police have said around 8:30 p.m. neighbors heard a loud commotion near their apartment but police were not called.The next day, Jeffery's mother contacted the apartment complex property manager after not hearing from her daughter. That's when they found her dead in what Holloway described as “a very violent crime scene"" in which Jeffery had been stabbed numerous times.Police have not revealed how Taylen Mosley was killed or whether the alligator played any role in that.Thomas Mosley went to his mother's house about 9 p.m. Wednesday with the cuts on his arms and hands, Holloway said, and then admitted himself to a local hospital, where he remained Friday night.Family members said Jeffery and Taylen had just moved into the apartment complex about a month ago.",2023/04/01,,World

My body is frail because of the daily violence and torture,"" she told DW. ""My only goal is to get my culprits punished by the court of law and want my earlier life back.""DW contacted Neelam's husband for comment, but received no response.Neelam's story is not an isolated one. There are several women in the neighboring towns and cities in Punjab who have similar stories of abandonment, abuse and cruelty.Santosh Kaur, who lives in a cramped house in the town of Ludhiana, was married for only 15 days when her husband left for the US.Her parents had mortgaged their house in order to raise enough money for her wedding ceremony and dowry. Now, she is struggling to pay back the loan and also suffers from a heart condition.""My whole family went into depression, she said. ""People used to make fun of me by asking when is your husband coming back and when are you going with him.""In India, more than 40,000 women are duped into marrying non-resident Indians (NRIs) who live abroad in wealthy countries like Australia, Germany and Canada.India's northern state of Punjab is the country's epicenter of abandoned brides. These women are stigmatized by society.Every year, thousands of Indian men immigrate in search of a better life abroad, but they eventually face pressure from their families to return home and get married.In India, where most marriages are still arranged by families, many parents favor their daughters marrying NRIs in the hope that they will have a better life abroad.But this does not always turn out to be the case. Oftentimes they are left behind in India by their husbands who return to their expat lives without them.Satwinder Kaur, who runs the NGO Abb Nahi Social Welfare, provides legal and financial support to help abandoned wives. She also has personal experience dealing with many of their issues — Satwinder's own husband left her in 2015 after which her in-laws threw her out of the family home.She and her team now help more than 400 abandoned wives to document their stories and pursue legal cases against their husbands, which can include having the men's passports revoked.""Our NGO has witnessed an increase in the number of cases and we receive calls every day from different states,"" said Satwinder.""And the government is not helping these women. If they would help, you wouldn't see these women running with elderly parents around the courts and police stations every day.""To address this issue, the Punjab government has now set up the State Commission of NRIs to help women track their runaway husbands and revoke their passports.Rakesh Garg, who formerly headed the commission, told DW that there are many obstacles along the road to justice.A lack of extradition treaties with other countries makes it difficult to pursue the absconders.Garg is pushing for stricter laws passed to make NRI husbands accountable. However, his efforts are complicated by the fact that the commission has not had a chairman for the last two years.""Indian government and state governments are taking steps to address the concerns but the lacuna lies in the investigation process, which is faulty in most of the cases. We need to improve this,"" Garg added.For these distressed women, frustration and helplessness have become part of their everyday lives due to the constant setbacks and delays in getting justice.Traumatized by the sudden and unexpected collapse of their marriages, women like Neelam and Santosh are plunged into debt — with their hopes resting on the government who, at best, appears apathetic towards their plight.Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/31,,

We have some standards inside the dressing room. We have to finish the games, and not Rash (Rashid Khan) and Rahul (Tewatia) all the time.”Williamson hurt his right knee while attempting a difficult catch on the edge of the boundary and left the field in obvious pain.In his absence, Gujarat replaced him with their impact player pick Sai Sudharsan, who scored 22 off 17 balls.Chennai's impact player also made little difference. Fast bowler Tushar Deshpande shared the new ball after replacing Ambati Raydu, and returned expensive figures of 1-51. In the last over, Tewatia finished the game with a six and a straight boundary. Rashid Khan was unbeaten on 10 from a six and a four.Gaekwad smashed three sixes against Gujarat's Alzarri Joseph in his first over and was solid against the legspin of Rashid.However, Rashid bagged Moeen Ali (23) and Ben Stokes (7) in successive overs.Raydu struggled for a run-a-ball 12 before he was clean bowled by Josh Little as Chennai slipped to 121-4 in the 13th over.Gaekwad, after nine sixes and four boundaries, missed out on a deserved century when Joseph's full toss was sliced and gave an easy catch at long-on in the 18th over. Joseph was brilliant at the death when he didn’t concede a boundary in his return spell of three overs and gave up only 15 runs.“Another 15-20 runs would have been good,” Chennai skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said. “We could have batted properly in the middle overs as opposed to trying to muscle the ball.”Gujarat scored at nine an over at the midpoint of its innings, with Gill adding 53 runs with Sudharsan for the second wicket. Gill departed in the 15th over when he mistimed a pull and holed out at midwicket.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

(AP) — The owners of a Florida-based sanctuary made famous by the Netflix docuseries, “ Tiger King, ” say they plan to move most of their big cats to an Arkansas facility and eventually sell their 67-acre (27-hectare) property.Howard Baskin wrote in a post on Big Cat Rescue's website that he and his wife, Carole Baskin, had entered into an agreement with Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge to move most of their big cats to the accredited sanctuary in Arkansas.""""We have always said that our goal was to 'put ourselves out of business,' meaning that there would be no big cats in need of rescue and no need for the sanctuary to exist,"" Howard Baskin wrote earlier this week in the post.Because recently passed federal law and a change in industry practices had reduced the size of the “cub petting” industry at roadside zoos and circuses, there were fewer big cats in need of caring, Baskin said.The cost per big cat of running the sanctuary, as its population dropped from 100 to 41 cats, has more than doubled in the past several years, becoming “an increasingly inefficient use of donor funds per cat to operate a facility like ours,” he wrote.Big Cat Rescue, located near Tampa, and Carole Baskin were the subject of much attention following the release of “Tiger King” in 2020. The streaming series starred gun-toting Oklahoma zookeeper Joseph Maldonado-Passage, also known as ""Joe Exotic."" He was sentenced to 22 years in prison after killing five tigers and plotting to have Carole Baskin murdered.Maldonado-Passage was resentenced to 21 years in prison last year after a federal appeals court ruled that the prison term should be shortened.“Tiger King” spent much of its time focusing on the feud between Carole Baskin and Maldonado-Passage, which included accusations by him that Baskin was behind the disappearance of her ex-husband, Don Lewis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852817,Romania: Andrew Tate's detention replaced with house arrest,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Andrew Tate, the divisive internet personality who has spent months in a Romanian jail on suspicion of organized crime and human trafficking, has won an appeal to replace his detention with house arrest, an official said Friday.The Bucharest Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Tate’s appeal, which challenged a judge’s decision last week to extend his arrest a fourth time for 30 days, said Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT.Tate, 36, a British-U.S. citizen who has 5.5 million Twitter followers, was initially detained in late December in Romania’s capital Bucharest, along with his brother Tristan and two Romanian women.All four won an appeal Friday, and will remain under house arrest until Apr. 29, Bolla said. None of the four has yet been formally indicted. The court ruled in favor of their immediate release. Prosecutors cannot challenge the appeal court’s decision, which was final, Bolla added.As the brothers left the detention facility late Friday in Bucharest, Tristan Tate told a scrum of reporters that “the judges today made the right decision.”“I respect what they’ve done for me and they will be vindicated in their decision, because I’m an innocent man and I can’t wait to prove it,” he said.Some Tate supporters outside the facility chanted “Top-G, Top-G,” using a popular moniker many of Andrew Tate’s fans refer to him as.Later, standing outside what is believed to be the Tate brothers' home near the capital, Andrew Tate said he wanted to thank the judges “who heard us today, because they were very attentive and they listened to us, and they let us free.”“I have no resentment in my heart for the country of Romania or for anybody else,” he said. “I just believe in the truth … I truly believe that justice will be served in the end. There is zero percent chance of me being convicted for something I've not done.”Tate, a professional kickboxer who has resided in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech. He has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence and alleged their case is a “political” conspiracy designed to silence him.DIICOT said in a statement after the December arrests that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were allegedly subjected to “acts of physical violence and mental coercion” and sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group.The agency said victims were lured with pretenses of love and later intimidated, placed under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for the financial gain of the crime group.In January, Romanian authorities descended on a compound near Bucharest linked with the Tate brothers and towed away a fleet of luxury cars that included a Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Porsche. They reported seizing assets worth an estimated $3.9 million.Prosecutors have said that if they can prove the cars’ owners gained money through illicit activities such as human trafficking, the assets would be used to cover the expenses of the investigation and to compensate victims. Tate unsuccessfully appealed the asset seizure.___Stephen McGrath reported from Sighisoara, Romania.",2023/04/01,,World

That appeal will be heard on April 19 but Paratici is stepping away from his duties at the English Premier League club ahead of that.“Given FIFA’s unexpected ruling, the sanctions (against Paratici) may now have multi-jurisdictional effect, although they are still related to the FIGC (Italian soccer federation) appeal,"" Tottenham said in a statement.“In view of FIFA’s decision, Fabio has agreed with the club that he will take an immediate leave of absence pending the outcome of his appeal.”Paratici's absence is likely to have a significant impact on Tottenham at a time when the club is conducting a search for a new manager following the departure of Conte, who left on Sunday — a week after a post-match outburst in which he criticized the players and made withering comments about Tottenham’s ownership.Paratici would have been expected to play a key role in identifying and hiring Conte’s successor, with former Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann among the names linked with the job.Cristian Stellini, the assistant to Conte, has taken charge of the team until the end of the season.Prosecutors had been investigating since 2021 whether Juventus cashed in on illegal commissions from transfer and loans of players. Juventus said at the start of the coronavirus pandemic that 23 players agreed to reduce their salary for four months to help the club through the crisis. But prosecutors claim the players gave up only one month’s salary.Juventus, which denies wrongdoing, was hit with a 15-point penalty in January and bans were handed out to officials including Paratici, former president Andrea Agnelli and former CEO Maurizio Arrivabene.Juve has appealed against the points penalty to Italy’s highest sports court within the Italian Olympic Committee, known as CONI. The appeal hearing at CONI is slated for April 19.Stellini held his first news conference since the departure of Conte, his long-standing friend, and insisted Tottenham was not in a crisis.“A bit chaotic, absolutely a bit chaotic,"" Stellini said, ""but we have big shoulders to consider this type of situation. We had an international break and that helped because we have time to think about everything. The club and every one of us have to take a decision and the decision was taken for the best of everyone.“No, it’s not a club in crisis, absolutely not, because everyone takes the decision for the best and when you take the decision and you follow the process, you are not in crisis.""___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852819,"Factory explosion survivor, on fire, fell into chocolate vat","A woman pulled alive from the rubble of a Pennsylvania chocolate factory after an explosion that killed seven co-workers says flames had engulfed the building, and her arm, when the floor gave way beneath her. That might have been the end, if she hadn’t fallen into a vat of liquid chocolate.The dark liquid extinguished her blazing arm, but Patricia Borges wound up breaking her collarbone and both of her heels. She would spend the next nine hours screaming for help and waiting for rescue as firefighters battled the inferno and choppers thumped overhead at the R.M. Palmer Co. factory.“When I began to burn, I thought it was the end for me,” Borges, 50, told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview from her hospital bed in West Reading, Pennsylvania, just minutes from the chocolate factory where she worked as a machine operator. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board interviewed Borges on Friday, according to her family.The March 24 blast at R.M. Palmer killed seven of Borges’s co-workers and injured 10. Federal, state and local investigations are underway. A cause has not been determined, but the federal transportation safety agency has characterized it as a natural gas explosion.Borges said she and others had complained about a gas odor about 30 minutes before the factory blew up. She is angry Palmer didn’t immediately evacuate. She said the deaths of her co-workers — including her close friend, Judith Lopez-Moran — could've been prevented.Others workers have also said they smelled natural gas, according to their relatives. Palmer, a 75-year-old, family-run company with deep roots in the small town 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia, has not responded to questions about the workers' claims.Speaking in Spanish over videoconference, her eyes bruised and her burned right arm heavily bandaged, Borges recounted her terrifying brush with death.The factory was getting ready for a product switch that day, so instead of running a candy-wrapping machine as usual, she was helping to clean.At 4:30 p.m., Borges told the AP, she smelled natural gas. It was strong and nauseated her. Borges and her co-workers approached their supervisor, asking ""what was going to be done, if we were going to be evacuated,"" she recalled.Borges said the supervisor noted someone higher up would have to make that decision. So she got back to work.Just before 5 p.m., the two-story brick building exploded.Borges, who'd been on a ladder, was thrown to the ground. She heard screaming. There was fire everywhere, and the flames quickly overtook her. “I asked God why he was giving me such a horrible death,"" she said. “I asked him to save me, that I didn’t want to die in the fire.”She began to run. That's when the floor gave way, and she could feel herself falling — into a long, horizontal tank of chocolate in the factory's basement. At 4 feet, 10 inches tall, Borges landed on her feet in chest-high liquid.The chocolate extinguished the flames, but she believes her fall is what broke her feet.The vat began filling with water from firefighters' hoses, eventually forcing Borges to climb out as it reached neck level. She sat on the lip of the tank, then jumped into a pool of water that had formed on the basement floor. Briefly submerged, Borges said she swallowed a mouthful of water before surfacing. She grabbed onto some plastic tubing.And then she waited.“Help, help, please help!” she yelled, over and over, for hours. No one came.The pain grew more intense. The water was frigid. The main supply pipe for the building’s fire suppression system had ruptured — and water was pouring into the basement. She lost track of time but thought she might be there for days.""The only thing I wanted was to get out of there,"" she said.Finally, in the middle of the night, she saw a light and screamed anew for help.Search-and-rescue dogs had alerted their handlers that a survivor might be in the rubble. Now, as rescuers carefully worked their way down to the basement, they heard Borges’s cries.Calling for quiet, the rescuers followed the sound of her voice. They found her in a tight space, in chest-deep water. She made her way to them and was placed in a litter.“She was severely hypothermic and banged up,” conscious but “absolutely confused,” said Ken Pagurek, who helped lead rescue efforts as program manager of Pennsylvania Task Force 1, an emergency response team that deploys to disaster sites around the country.“I think had they not gotten to her when they did, there was a very good chance the number of victims was going to be plus one,” said Pagurek, also a captain in the Philadelphia Fire Department.Her rescue gave hope to first responders who already had pulled two bodies from the rubble in the hours after the blast. Rescuers spent two more days at the pile. They found five more bodies but no additional survivors.Borges now faces surgery on both feet and a long recovery. Her family has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help her pay the bills.Borges, who came to the United States 31 years ago from Puebla state in south-central Mexico, has worked at Palmer for four years. She said she’s seeking accountability.“I wanted to speak so that this will be prevented in the future,” she said. “For my colleague Judy, I want there to be justice.”___Rubinkam reported from northeastern Pennsylvania and Coronado reported from Austin, Texas.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852820,Lourdes shrine reviewing mosaics after Jesuit abuse claims,"ROME (AP) — Officials at the Catholic shrine in Lourdes announced the creation of a study group Friday to decide what to do with one of the French sanctuary’s most famous but now controversial attractions: mosaics by a Jesuit artist who has been sanctioned by the Vatican and his religious order for sexually, spiritually and psychologically abusing women.The Rev. Marko Ivan Rupnik designed the facade of one of the three basilicas at Lourdes with a series of mosaics in 2008 to mark the 150th anniversary of the Marian apparitions that turned the shrine in southwest France into one of the world’s biggest pilgrimage sites, attracting around 3 million visitors a year.In December, the Jesuits revealed that Rupnik had been declared excommunicated by the Vatican in 2020 for committing one of the worst crimes in church law — using the confessional to absolve a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity — and had also been accused by nine women of related sexual, spiritual and psychological misconduct in the 1980s.The Vatican’s sex abuse office, which is headed by Jesuits, decided their claims were too old to prosecute. Amid an outcry and testimony from 15 more people, the Jesuits in February announced a new internal canonical inquiry while toughening sanctions against Rupnik, including preventing him from continuing his artistic activity, since that was presumably where some of the abuse originated.Aside from posing questions about how the Jesuits and the Vatican handled the allegations, the Rupnik scandal has prompted a broader question about what to do with his art, since his mosaics decorate important basilicas, shrines, chapels and churches around the globe, including one of the chapels inside the Apostolic Palace.On Friday, Bishop Jean-Marc Micas, whose diocese includes Lourdes, announced the creation of a study group to consider what to do with the Basilica of the Rosary mosaics, placing the needs of abuse survivors first. Nothing is being ruled out, he said in a statement.“Lourdes is a place where many victims come … to seek consolation and healing. Their distress is great in front of the Rev. Rupnik’s mosaics in this same place: We cannot ignore it,” he said in a statement.In an earlier interview with French Catholic La Vie, Micas said he and the shrine had received letters from abuse victims from around the world seeking a “gesture” from Lourdes. They described Rupnik’s mosaics there as an additional source of pain as they seek healing from their abuse.“If this place, by displaying these works, increases the suffering of people who come there to be healed, this is not possible,” Micas told La Vie.The study group includes the bishop, the rector of the shrine, a survivor of abuse, an expert in sacred art and a psychotherapist. They will come up with the elements necessary to decide what to do with the mosaics, with all options on the table, the statement said.The status of the Slovenian-born Rupnik’s status remains somewhat in limbo as the Jesuits' canonical investigation plays out, even as they have received more complaints against him, Rupnik’s superior, the Rev. Johan Verschueren, told The Associated Press in an email Friday.“Every week one or two new testimonies knock at our door,” he said. “We get ever more, a clear and a comprehensive view of what happened in the past and what is the real nature and size of the case.”While Lourdes is the first major basilica to publicly announce a review of Rupnik’s artistic works, other church entities have taken their distance. The diocese of Versailles, which is home to a church decorated with Rupnik mosaics, terminated all collaboration with him in December.Recently, the religious publisher San Paolo removed Rupnik’s books from prominent display at its store near the Vatican, though his coffee table books, calendars and books on spirituality are available on the website of the Centro Aletti art studio and ecumenical center in Rome that Rupnik founded.",2023/04/01,,World

It's available for download in the U.S. and could face similar scrutiny to TikTok.Leaders at the FBI, CIA and officials at other government agencies have warned that ByteDance could be forced to give user data — such as browsing history, IP addresses and biometric identifiers — to Beijing under a 2017 law that compels companies to cooperate with the government for matters involving China’s national security. Another Chinese law, implemented in 2014, has similar mandates.To assuage concerns from U.S. officials, TikTok has been emphasizing a $1.5 billion proposal, called Project Texas, to store all U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle. Under the plan, access to U.S. data would be managed by U.S. employees through a separate entity called TikTok U.S. Data Security, which is run independently of ByteDance and monitored by outside observers.Some lawmakers have said that’s not enough. But despite skepticism about the project, TikTok says it is moving forward anyway.“We’re investing in a system where people don’t have to believe the Chinese government and they don’t have to believe us,” Andersen said.He also wondered if the skepticism was being driven by something else.“Where are we falling short here?” he said. “At some point you get beyond the cybersecurity risk assessment, etcetera, and you get to ‘We don’t like your nationality.’”TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has said the company started deleting all historic U.S. user data from non-Oracle servers this month and expects that process to be completed this year. During a congressional hearing held last week, Chew said migrating the data to Oracle will keep it out of China’s hands, but also acknowledged China-based employees may still have access to it before the process wraps up.TikTok maintains it has never been requested to turn over any kind of data and won’t do so if asked. But whether those promises, or Project Texas, will allow it to stay operating in the U.S. remains to be seen.The U.S., as well as Britain, the European Union and others, have banned TikTok on government devices. And the Biden administration is reportedly threatening a U.S. ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stakes in the company.On Friday, Andersen said a ban would be ""basically giving up"".“Banning a platform like TikTok is a defeat, it’s a statement that we aren’t creative enough to find another way,” he said.China has said it would oppose a possible sale, a declaration that makes it more difficult for TikTok to position itself and ByteDance as a global enterprise instead of a Chinese company. In 2020, the country had also come out in fierce opposition to executive orders by then President Donald Trump that sought to ban TikTok and the messaging app WeChat.""They were clear about their point of view back in 2020 timeframe when we faced an existential challenge from executive orders under the Trump administration,” Andersen said.Courts blocked Trump’s efforts, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders after taking office. The company has since been in talks about privacy concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multi-agency panel that sits under the Treasury department.Meanwhile, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been pushing bills that would effectively ban TikTok or give the administration more authority to do so. One bill by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley was blocked this week by Sen. Rand Paul, the only Republican who has come out in opposition to a TikTok ban. A small number of progressive lawmakers have also said they would oppose a ban, and argued the U.S. should implement a national privacy law to curtail the problem.Andersen said Friday TikTok would support broad-based privacy legislation.""Our view is that we would really welcome broad-based legislation that applies broadly and evenly,” he said. “What we don’t like, frankly, is legislation that is sort of targeted at one company.”TikTok could also be banned through another bill, called the RESTRICT Act, that has garnered broad bipartisan support in the Senate and backing from the White House. The legislation does not call out TikTok but would give the Commerce Department power to review and potentially restrict foreign threats to technology platforms.___This story has been updated to change Hewlett-Packard Foundation to Hewlett Foundation.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852822,Climate protesters who stormed British Grand Prix avoid jail,"LONDON (AP) — Six climate change activists who stormed the track at last year’s British Grand Prix Formula 1 race in one of a series of disruptive protests against fossil fuels were spared prison sentences Friday.Five of the activists had to be dragged from the track as cars passed by during the July protest on behalf of the group Just Stop Oil, which has staged a series of protests blocking a major highway and targeting priceless artworks with stunts designed to attract publicity.The protesters ran onto the track at the Silverstone Circuit after a crash on the first lap led to a red flag that slowed traffic.“This was not trespass or obstruction of a highway or criminal damage — to put it colloquially this was in a different league,"" Justice Neil Garnham told the protesters in Northampton Crown Court.The group wants the U.K. government to halt new oil and gas projects.Three of the protesters were given suspended prison terms and three were ordered to complete a year of community service.Two of the protesters given suspended sentences — Louis McKechnie, 22, and Emily Brocklebank, 24 — were convicted of gluing themselves to the frame of a 70 million pound Vincent Van Gogh painting days before the speedway protest.The judge said the race track protest had created the risk of injury or death, though he understood they did not intend to cause harm but draw attention to climate change.“I knew I was safe and secure where I was on the track. I understood that where I was would be perfectly fine,” McKechnie testified. “Those drivers are the best drivers in the world. They would not even have flinched at something like this.”The anti-oil group has also splattered tomato soup on the glass covering a van Gogh painting in London’s National Gallery and glued themselves to the frame of a copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” in the Royal Academy of Arts.Similar protests have been staged in other European cities, with participants gluing themselves to Johannes Vermeer’s “Girl With a Pearl Earring” in The Hague and throwing mashed potatoes at a Claude Monet painting in a German museum.Just Stop Oil is backed by the U.S.-based Climate Emergency Fund, which supports youthful disruptive environmental protests.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852823,AP WAS THERE: Uncovering Lyndon B Johnson's stolen election,"ALICE, Texas (AP) — In 1977, Associated Press reporter James W. Mangan's exclusive interview with a South Texas election judge who detailed certifying false votes for Lyndon B. Johnson nearly three decades earlier made headlines across the country.With the win by an 87-vote margin in the 1948 Democratic primary runoff, Johnson, then a congressman, easily defeated his Republican opponent to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, and he eventually ascended to the presidency.Mangan spent three years pursuing the story, which pulled back the curtain on the victory that had drawn suspicions ever since election officials in rural Jim Wells County announced the discovery of uncounted votes in ballot box known as Box 13.Headlines across the U.S. that accompanied the story included: “Polling Official: Phony Votes Stole ’48 Runoff for LBJ”; “LBJ’s election to Senate ‘stolen’”; “Texan Claims Fix in LBJ Election.”Here's the story that ran July 31, 1977:___A former Texas voting official seeking “peace of mind” says he certified enough fictitious ballots to steal an election 29 years ago and launch Lyndon B. Johnson on a path that led to the presidency.The statement comes from Luis Salas, who was the election judge for Jim Wells County's notorious Box 13, which produced just enough votes in the 1948 Texas Democratic primary runoff to give Johnson the nomination, then tantamount to election, to the U.S. Senate.“Johnson did not win the election; It was stolen for him. And I know exactly how it was done,” said Salas, now a lean, white-haired 76; then a swarthy 210-pound political henchman with absolute say over vote counts in his Mexican-American, South Texas, precinct.The controversy over that runoff election has been a subject of tantalizing conjecture for nearly three decades, ever since U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black abruptly halted an investigation, but the principals have been silent. George B. Parr, the South Texas political boss whom Salas served for a decade, shot himself to death in June 1975. Johnson is dead and so is his opponent. Salas, retired from his railroad telegrapher's job, is among the few living persons with direct knowledge of the election.Johnson's widow, Lady Bird, was informed of Salas' statements and said through a spokeswoman that she “knows no more about the details of the 1948 election other than that charges were made at the time, carried through several courts and finally to a justice at the Supreme Court.”The Associated Press interviewed Salas frequently during the past three years, seeking answers to questions that, save for rumors, were left unanswered. Only recently did Salas agree to tell his full version of what happened. In his soft Spanish accent, Salas said that he decided to break his silence in quest of “peace of mind and to reveal to the people the corruption of politics.”Salas says now that he lied during an aborted investigation of the election in 1948, when he testified that the vote count was proper and above board. “I was just going along with my party,"" he says.He told the AP that Parr ordered that 200-odd votes be added to Johnson's total from Box 13. Salas said he saw the fraudulent votes added in alphabetical order and then certified them as authentic on orders from Parr.The final statewide count, including Box 13 votes, gave Johnson an 87-vote margin in a total tally approaching 1 million and earned him the tongue-in-cheek nickname: “Landslide Lyndon.”Texas Democrats were split in 1948. Johnson, then 39, a congressman, represented “new” Democrats in his bid for the U.S. Senate. His primary opponent was Coke R. Stevenson — 60 years old, three times Texas governor, never beaten and the candidate of the “old” wing of the party. They called him “Calculating Coke.”The vote in the July primary was Stevenson 477,077, Johnson 405,617. But a third candidate, George Petty, siphoned off enough votes to deny Stevenson a majority, forcing a runoff between Stevenson and Johnson, set for Aug. 28, 1948.In the interim, Johnson intensified his campaign. One of the places he went stumping was the hot, flat, brush country of South Texas, George B. Parr country, where the Mexican-American vote seemed always to come, favoring Parr's candidate, in a bloc.The power had passed to Parr from his father, Archie, a state senator who had sided with Mexican-Americans in a 1912 battle with Anglos over political control in Duval County. The younger Parr was known as the “Duke of Duval.”Salas said he was Parr's right-hand man in Jim Wells County from 1940 to 1950, but quit over Parr's failure to support a fellow Mexican-American who had been charged with murder.“We had the law to ourselves there,” Salas said. ""It was a lawless son-of-a-bitch. We had iron control. If a man was opposed to us, we'd put him out of business. Parr was the godfather. He had life or death control.“We could tell any election judge: ‘Give us 80 per cent of the vote, the other guy 20 per cent.’ We had it made in every election.""The night of the runoff, Jim Wells County's vote was wired to the Texas Election Bureau, the unofficial tabulating agency: Johnson 1,786, Stevenson 769.Three days after the runoff, with Stevenson narrowly leading and the seesaw count nearly complete, Salas said, a meeting was called in Parr's office 10 miles from Alice. Salas said he met with George B. Parr; Lyndon Johnson; Ed Lloyd, a Jim Wells County Democratic Executive Committee member; and Bruce Ainsworth, an Alice city commissioner. Lloyd and Ainsworth like Johnson and Parr, now are dead.Salas told the AP:""Lyndon Johnson said: ‘If I can get 200 more votes, I’ve got it won.'“Parr said to me in Spanish: ‘We need to win this election. I want you to add those 200 votes.’ I had already turned in my poll and tally sheets to Givens Parr, George's brother.“I told Parr in Spanish: ‘I don’t give a damn if Johnson wins.'”“Parr then said: ‘Well, for sure you’re going to certify what we do.”“I told him I would, because I didn't want anybody to think I'm not backing up my party. I said I would be with the party to the end. After Parr I and I talked in Spanish, Parr told Johnson 200 votes would be added. When I left, Johnson knew we were going to take care of the situation.”Salas said he saw two men add the names to the list of voters, about 9 o'clock at night, in the Adams Building in Alice. He said the two were just following orders and he would not identify them.The AP interview then produced this exchange:Q. When you told Parr you would certify the votes, he said he would get someone else to actually add the names?A. Yeah. And I actually saw them do it. I was right there when they added the names.Q. Were all 200 names in the same handwriting?A. Oh, yeah. They all came from the poll taxes, I mean, from the poll tax sheet.Q. But some were dead?A. No one was dead. They just didn't vote.Q. So you voted them?A. They voted them.Q. You certified?A. I certified. So did the Democratic County chairman. I kept my word to be loyal to my party.Q. Had some of those names already voted?A. No, they didn't vote in that election. They added 'em. They made a mistake of doing it alphabetically.Q. They added them alphabetically, as though they had walked in to vote alphabetically?A. Yeah, that's what I told George B., and he wouldn't listen to me. I said: ‘Look at the A, you add 10 or 12 names on that letter. Why don’t you change it to the other, C or D or X, mix ‘em up?’ George said, ‘That’s all right.' George was stubborn. He would not listen to anybody. But it was stupid. They went to the poll tax list and got those names. For instance, on the A they got 10 or 12 names.Q. People who had not voted?A. That's right. they went on the B the same way, until they complete 200, and I told George, ‘That’s wrong.'Q. While they were doing it you told him?A. Yeah, and he said: ‘It’s OK.'Q. They should have changed the handwriting?A. How? Only two guys? How they going to change it? The lawyers spotted it right away, they sure did.Six days after the runoff, with Stevenson still holding a narrow lead in the statewide count, a second telegram was sent, changing Jim Wells County's vote to: Johnson 1,988, Stevenson, 770.Johnson gained 202 votes; Stevenson 1. They came from Box 13.The next day, the official statewide vote canvass gave Johnson 494,191 and Stevenson 494,104.Stevenson protested. Johnson said that if Stevenson had evidence, it was his duty to go to a grand jury. “I know that I did not buy anybody's vote,” Johnson said.Stevenson went to federal court in Fort Worth and, on Sept. 14, Judge T. Whitfield Davidson signed a temporary restraining order forbidding certification of Johnson as the Democratic nominee. The judge ordered an on-the-spot probe of voting in Jim Wells County.When that inquiry began, on Sept. 27, reporters from around the country showed up in Alice. By then it was national news.The same day, in Washington, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Black agreed to hear Johnson's petition to lift the injection. Johnson's attorney was Abe Fortas, in later years a Johnson appointee to the high court.Stevenson was in Alice that day; Johnson was on President Harry S. Truman's campaign train. During a campaign stop in Temple, Tex., Truman brought Johnson to his side and publicly endorsed him as the next senator from Texas. Also on the train at San Antonio that day, according to Salas, were Parr, who had received a presidential pardon from Truman in 1946 after serving nine months on an income tax conviction, and Lloyd, the Jim Wells County executive committeeman.Salas told the AP he was summoned the next day by Lloyd and told: “Luis, everything is all right. We talked to Truman on the train. Don't worry about the investigation.”Two days later, Justice Black, in an order he dated himself in longhand, voided the temporary injunction against putting Johnson's name on the ballot and ended the investigation. Black said, “It would be a serious break with the past” for a federal court to determine an election contest.Stevenson had lost; Johnson had won.That ended Stevenson's political career. He retired to his Hill Country ranch, insisting until he died in 1975 that the election had been stolen from him. Johnson became a power in Congress, and 15 years later he was president.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852824,US Marine's adoption of Afghan war orphan voided,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — In a highly unusual ruling, a state court judge on Thursday voided a U.S. Marine’s adoption of an Afghan war orphan, more than a year after he took the little girl away from the Afghan couple raising her. But her future remains uncertain.For now, the child will stay with Marine Maj. Joshua Mast and his wife, Stephanie, under a temporary custody order they obtained before the adoption. The Masts will have to re-prove to the court that they should be granted a permanent adoption.Despite the uncertainty, the ruling was a welcome move for the Afghan couple, who had been identified by the Afghan government as the child's relatives in February 2020 and raised her for 18 months. They dropped to their knees in prayer outside the courthouse. As they held each other, the young man wiped the tears from both their eyes with his wife’s headscarf.The Masts quickly left the courthouse after Thursday's hearing, flanked by their attorneys. The parties are forbidden from commenting by a gag order.The dispute raised alarms at the highest levels of government, from the White House to the Taliban, after an Associated Press investigation in October revealed how Mast became determined to rescue the baby and bring her home as an act of Christian faith. But until now, the adoption order has remained in place.“There’s never, ever been a case like this,” said Judge Claude V. Worrell Jr. on Thursday.The girl, who will turn 4 this summer, was an infant when she was found injured in the rubble after a U.S.-Afghan military raid in a rural part of the country in September 2019. She spent more than five months in a U.S. military hospital before the Afghan government and International Committee of the Red Cross determined she had living relatives, and united her with them.Unbeknownst to them, Mast learned about the baby while she was hospitalized, and decided that he and his wife should be her parents. The Masts told Virginia Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore that she was the daughter of transient terrorists who died in the fight, and thus a stateless orphan. He claimed that the Afghan government was prepared to waive jurisdiction over her, though it never did. Moore granted him the adoption.The Masts contacted the couple in Afghanistan, offering to help with her medical treatment. After the U.S. military withdrew and Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in 2021, the Masts helped them evacuate to the United States. Once they arrived, Mast used the adoption order to take the child, and the Afghan couple have not seen her since.The Masts claim in court filings that they legally adopted the child, and that the Afghan couple’s accusations that they kidnapped her are “outrageous” and “unmerited.” They have repeatedly declined to comment to the AP.Judge Worrell, who took over the case after Judge Moore retired in November, said the Afghan couple “were the de facto parents when they arrived in the U.S.” and their due process was violated. Worrell also said from the bench that the Masts knew things that they never told the court, particularly about what was happening in Afghanistan at the same time the judge in Virginia was granting the adoption. He said he wasn’t sure it was intentional, but “the fact of the matter is that the court did not have all the information known to (the Masts) at the time the order was entered.”The ruling is one more twist in what is already a standout case.“Once an adoption is final, it is extremely difficult and rare for it to be overturned,"" said Virginia attorney Stanton Phillips.“This is really, really unusual,” said adoption attorney Barbara Jones. “You just don't hear about this happening.”A Defense Department spokesperson said Thursday it was aware of the ruling and referred the AP to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. Another hearing is scheduled for June.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852825,San Diego State's Final Four run a boon for its conference,"HOUSTON (AP) — The joy around the Mountain West Conference is palpable, stretching from the league office to each of its member schools.After numerous near-misses, San Diego State gave the conference its first Final Four team by beating Creighton in the NCAA Tournament last weekend.“There’s so much excitement, especially in the Mountain West office, because we’re so good in basketball and to finally break through and get this far is just amazing,” Mountain West Commissioner Gloria Nevarez said. “Couldn’t be happier for San Diego State. We’re super excited.”They should be.Getting a team through to the Final Four is a major boost for mid-major conferences — financially, promotionally, for visibility on a national scale, event attendance and recruiting.The financial windfall comes from what the NCAA calls “units,” a tally of wins, automatic qualifiers and at-large bids that determine how much conferences are paid. Each distribution year is assigned a value for a single unit, which is paid to the conferences over the next six years.The deeper a team goes in the bracket, the more units they accumulate. In other words, more money — well into the millions.Larger conferences already have large coffers and distribute the money entirely to their member schools. Smaller conferences use some of the money to cover expenses and distribute the rest to the schools.The additional money allows mid-major conferences to be bolder on the promotional front and upgrade league tournaments. Schools often use the influx of money to upgrade facilities, increase campus video production, even on an extra charter flight here or there.With each unit at $2 million for this year's NCAA Tournament, the Mountain West Conference will pull in an additional $16 million, thanks in large part to San Diego State's run to the Final Four. Florida Atlantic, which will play the Aztecs in Saturday's national semifinals, earned $10 million for Conference-USA.“Not that the Missouri Valley, Mountain West or leagues below those expect to get to the Final Four, but it’s just found money and a great boost to your reputation, your swagger, not to mention financially,” said Greg Elgin, the Missouri Valley Conference's commissioner from 1988 to 2021. “Everything is better when you have that kind of success.”The Missouri Valley Conference had two big financial bumps in a five-year span: Wichita State's run to the 2013 Final Four and Loyola Chicago's run with fan favorite Sister Jean in 2018.Many of the conference's schools used the money to increase video production of sports across campus.When the Missouri Valley Conference first started its digital platform, it produced about 430 events — some simply a shot of the arena video board coupled with the radio feed.The influx of money from the two deep March Madness runs also includes a production stipend, which allows schools to invest more in on-campus production, often with students manning the equipment. Now the Missouri Valley produces about 950 events across all sports.“It was a game changer for our membership because in the past they didn’t have the wherewithal to do a lot of Olympic sports,” said Jack Watkins, Missouri Valley Conference associate commissioner for media.The biggest boon came from the Valley's TV deals.Before Wichita State's run, the conference had a deal for a regular-season package of four men's basketball games on ESPN2, six on ESPNU and a sub license with CBS to broadcast the conference tournament title game.After the Shockers went to the Final Four and opened the next season 35-0, CBS bought the rights from ESPN to show eight regular-season games on the CBS Sports Network and the semifinals of the conference tournament — Arch Madness — which had previously been shown on regional sports networks.Following Loyola Chicago's 2018 Final Four run, CBS told the MVC it was picking up a four-year option on its sub-license with ESPN, extending what originally had been a five-year deal.“When somebody is doing a sub license, you have to prove yourself all the time,” Watkins said. “There was a recognition by CBS that, OK, second Final Four school in a five-year span, and they picked up our option for the last four years.”These deep March runs spread all types of wealth.Attendance at the conference tournaments typically increases. So do applications at individual schools. Recruiting in all sports gets a boost.Name recognition gives programs opportunities previously out of their reach, like multi-team events and off-shore tournaments like the Maui Invitational and Battle 4 Atlantis.“This is the biggest national stage in college basketball and across a lot of other sports,” Nevarez said. “For us to have a team in this moment on this stage, you can’t buy this kind of advertising.”No wonder everyone in the league is so happy.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852827,Florida teen debuts trans visibility film as bans spread,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — A Florida teenager has documented how it feels to be young and transgender for a film set to debut at a festival as transgender people around the world celebrate visibility and lawmakers across the country look to restrict their rights and care.Carys Mullins, 19, who is gender non-conforming and uses she and they pronouns, said their experience inspired conversations with community members for a documentary, “You’re Loved.” The film directed and produced by Mullins is set to premiere Friday at the Tampa Bay Transgender Film Festival on International Transgender Day of Visibility.“That’s a big part of what the festival is,” Mullins said. “A big part of the Tampa Bay Transgender Film Festival is: Look at us.”“You’re Loved” debuts at a time where access to gender-affirming care for transgender and nonbinary young people is under assault across the United States. Florida, Missouri and Texas have regulations banning puberty-blocking hormones and gender-affirming surgeries for minors. At least 11 other states ban gender-affirming care for minors by law: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia.Federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas, and nearly two dozen states are considering bills this year to restrict or ban care.When describing how it feels to be a gender-nonconforming person in their home state, Mullins draws many comparisons.“It feels like you’re under a microscope.”“It feels like we’re all in a circus.”“It almost feels like you’re a guinea pig of sorts for people who have no idea what it’s like to be trans, to be nonbinary, to be gender-nonconforming. They don’t see us as people.”Mullins interwove perspectives from three young transgender people in Florida, Texas and Illinois, along with mental health providers, advocates and allies. They sent participants a set list of questions, depending on their role in the documentary, and edited together their recorded answers.Topher Malone, a Black transgender high school student in Round Rock, Texas, said participating in the documentary gave her space to be herself.“I could share my story,” Malone said. “And, you know, those opportunities don’t come often, especially for Black trans youth.”Malone spoke at a Texas House committee hearing on Monday about a measure seeking to restrict care. The hearing started around 8 a.m. Malone said she wasn’t able to speak until after 11 p.m.“I’m a youth. I go to public school. I’m supposed to be supported by my government,” Malone said, “And so, that not being true is just so difficult.”The bills have a measurable impact on the well-being of transgender youth. Half of transgender adults ages 18 through 34 say they have had suicidal thoughts in the past year, and about a quarter said that they have engaged in self-harm, they had an eating disorder and they misused alcohol or drugs, according to a Washington Post-KFF poll of transgender adults in the U.S.The poll shows nearly 8 in 10 transgender adults overall say living as a gender that is different from the gender they were assigned at birth has made their lives more satisfying.But the poll also shows transgender adults say they are satisfied with their lives at a lower rate than the U.S. adult population as a whole.Transgender adults are especially likely to report feeling anxious, depressed or lonely in the past year. About two-thirds say they have faced discrimination because of their gender identity or expression. And 78% say that growing up, they experienced serious mental health problems such as depression or anxiety.“The landscape right now is urgent,” said Jonah DeChants, senior research scientist at The Trevor Project.However, while the numbers are grim, DeChants does not want them to be the sole focus in conversations about transgender youth. He said polls and surveys have also shown that access to adult role models and communities that affirm their identity can play a significant role in lowering suicide risk.“For me especially as a scientist and a former youth worker, it’s really exciting to see data that firmly shows that being an ally to young people matters,” DeChants said.Florida-based psychologist Dani Rosenkrantz, who also participated in the documentary, sees herself as part of this larger support system for the young transgender and nonbinary people she works with. Despite the challenges she faces operating as an LGBTQ+ therapist in Florida, Rosenkrantz wants to give space for her clients to not only process their grief, but also to find joy in their identities.“Our life isn’t just these awful, sad, real statistics that are really important to know about and resist, but it’s also these beautiful, thriving people.” Rosenkrantz said.Mullins hopes their documentary resonates with transgender people and with the community at large. They see the message of love as universal.“At the end of the day, if you take away these labels and these identities, the whole point of this film is you are loved and you are seen, no matter what experiences you go through,” Mullins said.In Texas, Malone finds her joy in many places: at underground ballroom events, in online communities, and even Monday after the hearing. Malone said there was a rally as they were leaving the state Capitol after midnight, with people shouting, laughing, and dancing.“There was a sense of community,” Malone said. “There was a sense of trans joy in that moment.”",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852829,UN body mulls deep sea mining amid demand for minerals,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Pressure is mounting on an obscure U.N. body based in Jamaica to hit pause on plans to potentially open the world’s deep seas to mining as companies push for permission to extract metals from seabeds in international waters.The International Seabed Authority on Friday closed two weeks’ worth of negotiations without approving rules and regulations to oversee deep sea mining amid growing calls to pause, ban or place a moratorium on the quest to extract minerals from the Earth’s watery depths that are used in green technology like electric car batteries.While the first exploration licenses for deep sea mining were issued in 2001, the authority has yet to receive an application for actual mining. Individual countries and private companies can start applying for provisional licenses on July 10 if the U.N. body does not approve a set of rules and regulations by July 9, which experts say is highly unlikely since they believe the process could take several years.“We know what a crucial period…the council is in at the moment,” Deryck Lance Murray, the authority’s representative for Trinidad and Tobago, said at the closing meeting on Friday.Scientists worry that deep sea mining would disrupt critical ecosystems that regulate climate change, and a growing number of countries are siding with them, including France, Spain, Germany, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.“When in doubt, favor nature,” Edward Aníbal Pérez, the authority’s representative from the Dominican Republic, said at the closing meeting on Friday.He noted that while he is aware of the importance of certain minerals given that mankind is on the brink of an energetic transition, he said deep sea mining is not the sole alternative to meet growing demand.“It is clear there are doubts as to the effects that this activity might cause,” he said.Earlier, France’s representative, Olivier Guyonvarch, said a lack of data on deep sea ecosystems and species prevents a fact-based analysis of potential damage that such mining might cause.“Scientists are uncovering an extraordinary diversity of life in the largely unexplored and unstudied depths of the ocean,” he said.Guyonvarch noted that scientists already know the deep sea plays a large role in mitigating climate change by storing large amounts of carbon.Scientists have warned that deep sea mining would kill species and damage ecosystems by releasing noise, light and dust storms, while companies that support such mining argue it is cheaper and has less of an impact than land mining.More than 30 exploration licenses have been issued so far, with activity mostly focused in an area called the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone, which spans 1.7 million square miles (4.5 million square kilometers) between Hawaii and Mexico. Exploration there has been occurring at depths ranging from 13,000 to 19,000 feet (4,000 to 6,000 meters).The rush and demand for minerals come as a growing number of countries and companies turn to green energy in a bid to reduce pollution.The International Energy Agency noted in a report this year that “industries that were in their infancy” in the early 2000s and 2010s such as solar photovoltaic technology and electric vehicles, “have mushroomed into vast manufacturing operations today.”Demand for minerals including lithium, cobalt and nickel is expected to increase from less than 10 million metric tons to some 150 million metric tons between 2020 and 2050, according to Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.More than a dozen countries have officially called for a ban, pause or moratorium on deep sea mining, although it’s unclear how many other countries support such mining. And while there are 36 members on the authority’s council that have the power to award contracts to governments and private companies, only 12 votes in favor of deep sea mining are needed for it to pass, according to Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, a Netherlands-based alliance of environmental groups.In addition, the ongoing debate is how would the U.N. body approve or reject an application for a provisional license without guidance from a set of rules and regulations, Matthew Gianni, the coalition’s co-founder, told The Associated Press.He added that there is no agreement yet on what a provisional license would allow.And even if a provisional license is granted, it’s not yet clear whether that would be an actual green light for mining or just a provisional approval stating that the company or country cannot sign a contract with the U.N. body until a regulatory framework is created.“All of that is up in the air,” Gianni said.Any decision regarding a provisional license also could be appealed to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852830,'Window into history': Tapes detail LBJ's stolen election,"DALLAS (AP) — The story was a blockbuster: A former Texas voting official was on the record detailing how nearly three decades earlier, votes were falsified to give then-congressman Lyndon B. Johnson a win that propelled the future president into the U.S. Senate.The audio recordings from Associated Press reporter James W. Mangan's interviews for the 1977 story were posted this week on the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum's archival website, Discover LBJ. After Mangan's death in 2015 at the age of 87, his family found the labeled cassette tapes at his San Antonio home and donated them last summer to the library on the campus of the University at Texas at Austin.Luis Salas, the former South Texas election judge, told Mangan for the story: “Johnson did not win that election; It was stolen for him. And I know exactly how it was done.”The story, which made front pages across the country, pulled back the curtain on the razor-thin victory that had drawn suspicions ever since election officials in rural Jim Wells County announced the discovery of uncounted votes in a ballot box known as Box 13 in the days after the 1948 Democratic primary Senate runoff. And now, at a time when election fraud is rare but former President Donald Trump and his allies amplify baseless allegations blaming it for his 2020 loss, the tapes and story show what compelling evidence of actual fraud looks like.Mangan's son, Peter, said listening the tapes was like getting “a little window into history.""On one cassette, he said, it sounds like his father is in his car, reciting what he'd just been told.“You can hear cars going by and he’s kind of, you can tell he’s a little excited, because I think he finally got the goods,” Peter Mangan said.Mark Lawrence, the library's director, said the recordings are “deeply connected to one of the big mysteries and controversies that’s hung around LBJ for decades.” In a 1984 oral history that Salas gave to the library, he said one of the reasons he finally decided to talk was because he had been quite ill.Mangan said in a 2008 AP story that as he worked to convince Salas to go on the record, he told him: “If you die, history will never know what happened.”Lawrence said much is now known about Box 13, thanks to both Mangan's 1977 story and research done later by LBJ biographer Robert Caro, who “essentially reaffirmed” Mangan's story and built on it.“The kinds of irregularities we can see were at work in the 1948 Senate race in Texas were, I think it’s fair to say, pretty widespread across American history and all regions of the country to one extent or another but certainly in the South and along the Mexican borderlands, as recently as the 1940s,” Lawrence said.Salas told Mangan that the powerful South Texas political boss George B. Parr — who wielded control with favors and coercion — ordered that some 200 votes be added to Box 13. Salas said he then watched as the fraudulent votes were added in alphabetical order, with the names coming from people who hadn’t voted in the election.The new votes gave Johnson the primary victory over then-Gov. Coke Stevenson by an 87-vote margin. Johnson — subsequently bestowed with the nickname “Landslide Lyndon” — went on to easily defeat the Republican in the general election, long before the GOP became the dominant force in Texas politics.Johnson, elected to the U.S. House in 1937, had run for U.S. Senate in 1941 and lost to then-Gov. Wilbert Lee “Pappy” O'Daniel in an election widely accepted by historians to have been corrupt, Lawrence said.“The standard story that gets told, and I think there’s an awful lot to it, is that when LBJ’s second chance comes along in 1948, he’s determined not to have the election stolen from him again,"" Lawrence said.Lawrence said the 1948 Senate victory “catapults"" Johnson to national attention. Johnson became then-President John F. Kennedy's vice president and was sworn in as president Nov. 22, 1963, after Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Johnson was elected president in 1964. He decided not to run again in 1968 and died of a heart attack in 1973 at the age of 64.Lawrence said that while the Box 13 incident shows that “LBJ was willing to do what he had to do to maintain political power,"" he was also a man who, “when he had the opportunity, he was more inclined to act on principle.” Lawrence noted Johnson's efforts to “ensure that people were able to vote in fair and equitable elections.”In 1965, Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, which outlawed practices designed to disenfranchise Black voters by banning literary tests and poll taxes. The act also gave the federal government the authority to take over voter registration in counties with a pattern of persistent racial discrimination, although that is no longer the case after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the requirement in 2013.James Mangan retired from AP on Jan. 1, 1989, after a 36-year career with the company that took him to cities across the U.S. and to Europe. With each move, Peter Mangan said, his father held on to the Box 13 tapes.“He always kept these,"" he said, ""so I know they must have been important to him.”",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852831,Developer drops land purchase in historically Black town,"EATONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — A developer on Friday ended plans to purchase a 100-acre (39-hectare) property from the local school system in a historically Black town in Florida following a public outcry that the deal threatened the cultural heritage of the community made famous by Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston.Derek Bruce said in a letter to Orange County Public Schools in Orlando that he had terminated the deal to purchase the land where a former school for Black students stood in the town of Eatonville. The school system said in a statement that it wouldn't consider any further bids for the land.""This decision presents us with a new opportunity to collaborate with the Eatonville community to preserve and celebrate the Town’s historic and cultural significance as the oldest incorporated Black town in the U.S.,"" the school system said in the statement.An association dedicated to preserving Eatonville's cultural history last week sued to stop the $14.6 million deal, claiming it threatened the cultural heritage of the town. The developer had plans to build 350 homes, as well as business spaces, raising fears the project would increase traffic and price out longtime residents of the town.With a population of around 2,350 people, of whom almost three-quarters are Black, Eatonville is perhaps best known through the writings of Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston. The town was the setting for one of her best known works, “Their Eyes Were Watching God.”Founded in 1887, Eatonville was among the early all-Black incorporated municipalities established in the decades after the end of slavery in the U.S. Around 1,200 Black towns or settlements were established in the late 19th century and early 20th century, according to the Historic Black Towns and Settlements Alliance.",2023/04/01,,World

""While Hunter Dickinson’s departure is unfortunate, there are so many reasons to be thankful for and celebrate.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852847,Sinner stuns top-ranked Alcaraz in Miami Open semifinals,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Tenth-seeded Jannick Sinner of Italy stunned top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz on Friday night in the Miami Open semifinals, rallying from a set down to beat the defending champion, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2 in a three-hour thriller.Sinner ended Alcaraz’s winning streak at 10 matches before a packed house at Hard Rock Stadium.Sinner’s powerfully steady baseline game wore down Alcaraz, who appeared to be cramping early in the decisive third set while he also dealt with an apparent finger injury. He will lose the No. 1 ranking to Novak Djokovic.Alcaraz said the cramping began after taking his five-minute bathroom break after losing the second set. “When you stop for five minutes, I know it wasn’t good for me,’’ said Alcaraz, who committed nine double faults and 27 unforced errors. “I struggled with some problems.’’Sinner, the 21-year-old who made the Miami Open final last year but hasn’t been past the quarterfinals of a major, will face fourth-seeded Daniil Medvedev of Russia in the championship match Sunday. Medvedev has beaten Sinner in all five meetings.Alcaraz had been so dominant recently, he hadn’t lost a set since February before Sinner’s rally in the Miami humidity. The Alcaraz hype train has been so breakaway NBA stars Luka Doncic and Jimmy Butler showed up to watch the Spanish star from the teal seats.Alcaraz also fought Sinner in Indian Wells in the semifinals, and it was a taut match but not quite like this. These two young guns are poised for a long and spectacular rivalry. Sinner’s victory ended Alcaraz’s hope of becoming the first man since Roger Federer in 2017 to win the Sunshine Double of Indian Wells and Miami.“For sure it’s one of the best wins,’’ Sinner said. “I changed a couple of things from Indian Wells to here.’’ Sinner declined to discuss the tactical switch but said he feels Alcaraz will likely adjust, too.Medvedev beat fellow Russian Karen Khachanov 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-3 on the same day Wimbledon announced Russians will be allowed back.Medvedev has won 23 of 24 matches — the lone loss to Alcaraz — and is in his fifth straight final.Also Friday, No. 15 seed Petra Kvitova beat unseeded Sorana Cirstea 7-5, 6-3 in the second women’s semifinal. Kvitova will face Elena Rybakina in the final.Alcaraz prevailed in the first set in a tiebreaker but that took a lot out of Alcaraz’s 19-year-old legs. It included a wondrous, 25-stroke rally midway through the first set with Sinner up 4-2. Sinner crushed a backhand passing shot past a diving Alcaraz as a standing ovation ensued.“The first thing that came to mind was that guy is invincible,’’ said Alcaraz, who converted just 3 of 12 break points.Between points early in the third set, Alcaraz was stretching noticeably and waved to the crowd for support. Alcaraz said the cramps started to ease and didn’t blame it on the defeat.“In the second set, I saw him struggling and I tried to push, especially in the first game,’’ Sinner said.Despite Alcaraz getting the second set back on serve, Sinner stunned Alcaraz in the ninth game, breaking him at love to go up 5-4 and then closing it out. Alcaraz had won 21 straight sets.An ATP trainer came out to attend to Alcaraz midway through the second set, examining one of his fingers before the cramps set in.Asked how he deals with this type of defeat, the Spaniard said, “After the match, like the 15, 25 minutes I can’t talk to anyone. ... But after 20 minutes, I start thinking about positive things.’’ ___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852849,Court: 2018 Musk tweet unlawfully threatened UAW efforts,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A 2018 Twitter post by Tesla CEO Elon Musk unlawfully threatened Tesla employees with the loss of stock options if they decided to be represented by a union, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a March 2021 order by the National Labor Relations Board, which ordered that the tweet be deleted. The case arose from United Auto Workers' organizing efforts at a Tesla facility in Fremont, California.Also upheld was the board's order that Tesla reinstate and provide back pay to an employee who was fired for union-organizing activity.Musk tweeted on May 20, 2018: “Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues and give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.”The ruling said that ""because stock options are part of Tesla’s employees’ compensation, and nothing in the tweet suggested that Tesla would be forced to end stock options or that the UAW would be the cause of giving up stock options, substantial evidence supports the NLRB’s conclusion that the tweet is as an implied threat to end stock options as retaliation for unionization.”The UAW, and Richard Ortiz, the worker whose reinstatement was ordered, praised the ruling. ""I look forward to returning to work at Tesla and working with my co-workers to finish the job of forming a Union,” Ortiz said in a UAW email.“This a great victory for workers who have the courage to stand up and organize in a system that is currently stacked heavily in favor of employers like Tesla who have no qualms about violating the law,” said UAW Region 6 Director Mike Miller.Tesla had not responded to emailed requests for comment Friday afternoon.",2023/04/01,,World

City hosts Liverpool in the lunchtime kickoff for a match that has been the most significant in English soccer in recent years. This season, however, Liverpool is way off the title pace and and is simply looking to make the top four to return to the Champions League. A few hours later, Arsenal hosts relegation-threatened Leeds. Arsenal leads second-placed City by eight points but has played one game more. Liverpool is in sixth place, seven points off the top four but with games in hand. At the other end, nine points separate the bottom nine teams in an unusually tight relegation fight. Four of those teams play relegation rivals: Crystal Palace under temporary manager Roy Hodgson hosts Leicester, and Nottingham Forest is home to Wolverhampton.GERMANYBayern Munich hosts Borussia Dortmund for a game that could decide the Bundesliga. Ten-time defending champion Bayern is one point behind Dortmund going into “der Klassiker” and the clash has been given added intrigue with Thomas Tuchel making his debut in charge of the Bavarian powerhouse against his former team. Bayern appointed Tuchel as coach last week after firing Julian Nagelsmann. Eight rounds remain after Saturday’s game. Also, third-placed Union Berlin hosts last-placed Stuttgart, Bayer Leverkusen visits Schalke, Freiburg welcomes Hertha Berlin, Laipzig plays Mainz and Wolfsburg hosts Augsburg.SPAINBarcelona visits Elche in a matchup of the league leader against the bottom side. The front-runner already has a commanding 12-point lead over second-placed Real Madrid. Xavi Hernández may consider rotating his starting lineup following an international break when many players played for their national sides and with a Copa del Rey clash with Madrid looming. Next week, Barcelona hosts Madrid in the second leg of their semifinal. Andreas Christensen, Frenkie de Jong, Pedri and Ousmane Dembélé are injured for Barcelona, while Raphinha will serve a one-game suspension. The game will be the debut of Argentine Sebastián Beccacece as Elche’s fourth coach of the season. Athletic Bilbao hosts Getafe. Veteran Spanish coach José Luis Mendilibar will debut for Sevilla at Cadiz, while Espanyol visits Girona in a Catalan regional derby.ITALYJuventus is without Federico Chiesa, Paul Pogba and Leonardo Bonucci due to injury and Leandro Paredes and Adrien Rabio due to suspension for a match with relegation-threatened Hellas Verona. Juventus won four straight across Serie A and the Europa League before the international break, including an inspiring victory over rival Inter Milan in its last match. Inter restarts against a Fiorentina side that has won seven straight across all competitions and is unbeaten for nine games. Also, Atalanta looks to keep hold of the Europe places when it visits last-placed Cremonese.FRANCELens travels to Rennes for a duel between clubs still fighting for Champions League football next season. With 10 matches left to play, Lens sits in third place, seven points and two spots ahead of the Brittany side.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852854,Canucks' Kuzmenko opts out of wearing Pride jersey,"VANCOUVER (AP) — Canucks winger Andrei Kuzmenko, who is from Russia, will not wear an LGBTQ+-theme warm-up jersey Friday when Vancouver holds its annual Pride night.Vancouver coach Rick Tocchet said that Kuzmenko had discussions with his family and then informed the team of his decision.“I’m not going to get into it because we don’t know the deals that happen over there,"" Tocchet said. ""So I respect his decision.”Kuzmenko, 27, has become a fan favorite in his first NHL season and leads the Canucks in goals with 37.Some of his teammates have publicly committed to wearing the jerseys, which were designed by local artist Christin Hryc and features a rainbow and flowers across the Canucks’ orca logo and rainbow patches on the shoulders.“I think everyone in this room is looking forward to it,” defenseman Quinn Hughes said Wednesday. “And I know in our organization, everyone’s welcome. Every time we’ve done Pride night, I’ve worn the jersey and celebrated the night.”Star center Elias Pettersson said Friday that he, too, is in support of the annual event.“I think it’s important to show that everyone is welcome here,” he said. “And I’ll wear the jersey tonight.”Vancouver has a number of other initiatives planned for Friday, including a drag show outside Rogers Arena and in-game performances. A $20,000 donation is also being made to QMUNITY, a Vancouver non-profit that supports LGBTQ+ people and their allies.Kuzmenko joins five other NHL players who’ve declined to wear Pride jerseys this season. Some have cited their faith and another cited an anti-gay Kremlin law and fears of retribution at home in Russia. Also, the New York Rangers, Minnesota Wild and Chicago Blackhawks opted not to have players wear special Pride-themed jerseys at all this year.Whether a player wears the themed jersey comes down to individual rights, new NHLPA executive director Marty Walsh said this week, adding that the league will likely have more conversations about the issue moving forward.“But I think it’s really important that as a league and as locker rooms, we’re inclusive and that we support all people’s right to support the game,” Walsh said.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852855,Former US intel director's daughter gets 35 years for murder,"ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) — The daughter of former U.S. intelligence director John Negroponte was sentenced Friday to 35 years in prison in the fatal stabbing of a friend after a drunken argument at a Maryland home, prosecutors announced.Sophia Negroponte, 30, of Washington, D.C., was convicted in January of second-degree murder in the 2020 death of 24-year-old Yousuf Rasmussen. Guidelines called for a sentence of 15 to 25 years, but Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Terrence McGann went beyond those guidelines, citing a need for community protection and rehabilitation, and calling her a “struggling, anger-filled alcoholic,” news outlets reported.“That rage drove Ms. Negroponte to stab her friend in the neck,” McGann said.“While nothing can ease the pain caused by this senseless loss of life, we thank Judge McGann for an appropriate prison sentence in this case,"" Montgomery County State’s Attorney John McCarthy said in a statement.Nearly a dozen people, including Rasmussen's mother, Dr. Zeba Rasmussen, gave victim impact statements at Friday's hearing. She remembered her son as charismatic with a “huge caring heart for everybody.” His father, Steve Rasmussen, called his son a gift, saying family and friends will always wonder what they lost with Rasmussen’s killing.All the kind things said about Rasmussen were true, Sophia Negroponte said at the hearing.“He was a very beautiful and loving and caring person. … I am truly sorry,” she said.Sophia Negroponte was one of five abandoned or orphaned Honduran children that John Negroponte and his wife adopted after he was appointed as U.S. ambassador to the Central American country in the 1980s, according to The Washington Post.Rasmussen and Sophia Negroponte attended the same Washington high school and had been drinking, along with another person, on the night Rasmussen was killed, McCarthy said. They argued twice that night and Rasmussen left. When Rasmussen returned to get his cellphone, Negroponte “stabbed him multiple times, one being a death blow that severed his jugular,” McCarthy said.At trial, defense attorney David Moyse urged jurors to consider that Sophia Negroponte was too intoxicated to form specific intent.“Alcohol pervades this case from the start; it pervades her life,” he said, adding, “and it is absolutely at the heart of what happened there that night. And it’s one of the major reasons that this is absolutely not a murder.”Former President George W. Bush appointed John Negroponte as the nation’s first intelligence director in 2005. He later served as deputy secretary of state. He also served as ambassador to Mexico, the Philippines, the United Nations and Iraq.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852858,"At Final Four, UConn in familiar territory as it faces Miami","HOUSTON (AP) — All this buzz about how a wildly unpredictable March Madness led to a Final Four nobody could've possibly seen coming overlooked one small detail.UConn.When the Huskies tip off against Miami in Saturday's second semifinal, they will be two wins away from their fifth national title since 1999. No other school has won more over that span.When the name “UConn” came up with a “4” seed next to its name three weekends ago on Selection Sunday, nobody raised too much of a stink. Four wins later — after no opponent came within 15 points of the Huskies — it's becoming apparent this is a team that might have been overlooked. Or underestimated.“A lot of things happened,” coach Dan Hurley said in explaining how UConn's profile went from world beater to middle of the pack in midseason.Most of that had to do with a string of six losses in eight games starting on New Year's Eve. It was a dry spell that coincided, according to the coach, with a stretch where “we didn't guard anybody for two weeks."" It also included two games against a then-top 25 Xavier team before it lost its star, Zach Freemantle, and a feud Hurley launched against Big East referees that he said distracted him from coaching his team.“We left that behind,"" Hurley said. ""In November, December, February, March, we’ve been as good as anybody.”UConn (29-8) ended the regular season listed eighth in the NCAA NET Rankings, a key guide for the selection committee that rates teams based on the strength of their schedules and other factors. That would've put UConn at a 2 seed. Meanwhile, Miami (29-7) was 35th in those rankings, which would've corresponded with a 7 seed, not the 5 the Hurricanes received.The combined seedings of the four Final Four teams is 23 — the second highest since seeding began in 1979.“How your season starts is not really reflective of how you might be in February and March,” Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said. ""And it’s an impossible task for the committee to seed 1 through 68 and for everything to fall into place.""But things have slotted in nicely for the 'Canes.Their run to the Final Four has been sparked by one player, Isaiah Wong, whose agent put out word that Wong was considering the transfer portal if he couldn't get a better NIL deal, and a few others, Nijel Pack and Norchad Omier, who came from elsewhere to help Larrañaga fill in a few pieces from a team that made the Elite Eight last year. Many viewed an NIL deal worth a reported $800,000 as an obvious reason Pack left Kansas State and chose the Hurricanes.Larrañaga thinks it was more than that.“I hope, and I really do assume, and I'm pretty sure I know, that Nijel saw the opportunity he had with Charlie graduating,” Larrañaga said of the departure of 12-points-per-game guard Charlie Moore.All that sort of shuffling across the country has been cited as a major reason the tournament has felt so jumbled this season, and left us with a Final Four nobody saw coming.Well, maybe not no one.In a sign the Huskies aren't fooling anyone anymore, UConn is a prohibitive 10-13 favorite to win it all, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.Some might argue UConn has been as good as anyone over the past quarter century. With players such as Rip Hamilton, Kemba Walker and Emeka Okafor leading the way, the Huskies won titles in 1999, 2004, 2011 and 2014.But shortly after 2014, the program disintegrated in the wake of recruiting violations and the ugly departure of of coach Kevin Ollie. Hurley got the job in 2018 and saw UConn was ranked 170th on the KenPom analytics rankings.“And you start looking at who was 165 and who was 172, and UConn shouldn’t be in this neighborhood,” Hurley said.The Final Four feels like more familiar territory for this program.ILLNESSUConn's second-leading scorer, Jordan Hawkins, came down with a non-COVID illness and missed Friday's practice. Hurley said he was optimistic that the sophomore, who averages 16 points a game, had been isolated from the team in quick enough fashion to not get anyone else sick.“Hopefully it just doesn’t continue to spread, and hopefully Jordan’s good to go, or at least give us something,” Hurley said.DANCINGSome people would call it a win-lose. Larrañaga is getting buzz for his post-victory locker-room dancing celebrations that looks like a cross between the gopher in “Caddyshack” and Elaine from “Seinfeld.”There's a reason, Larrañaga said, that they call this “The Big Dance,” and he's not going to slow down now.""If I can entertain my players, bring a smile to their face or have them laugh, that’s great because I got thick skin,"" he said. “I don't worry about stuff like that.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852859,Gianna Clemente making name for herself in return to Augusta,"AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Gianna Clemente was halfway through her practice round Friday at Augusta National when she looked over at the 18th green and couldn't help but think of the last time she was here, facing a big putt on the final hole at the home of the Masters.Clemente doesn't recall the details, only that she missed it. This was the 2017 Drive, Chip and Putt Championship. She was 9 years old.“I think I probably left it short. That sounds like me,” she said with a laugh. “We're going to do a little better than that this year.”Six years later, Clemente returns as somewhat of a prodigy. At 15, she is the youngest player to make the cut in the Augusta National Women's Amateur, doing so with a 32 on her closing nine at Champions Retreat.She was only allowed to putt on the 18th green that last Augusta visit. On Friday, Clemente played a full practice round on the same course where the Masters will be played next week. Even for her age, Clemente is not prone to be overwhelmed.Standing on the 12th tee in the heart of Amen Corner was an exception.“I was like, ‘Whoa, this is actually real life.’ Yeah, I was looking forward to the whole day, but playing Amen Corner was really special,” she said.Her odds of winning are long. She is tied after 36 holes, but 12 shots behind Rose Zhang — the NCAA champion at Stanford and the No. 1 amateur in women's golf for the last three years.Still, Clemente already has shown she has game.Last summer, after she was runner-up in the U.S. Girls Junior, she became the first female in two decades to earn her way into three straight LPGA Tour events by Monday qualifying. The last player to do that was Hee-Won Han, a 23-year-old pro. Clemente was 14.Clemente was 5 when she went to the Dana Open in Ohio and posed with Morgan Pressel, a former prodigy herself who qualified for the U.S. Women's Open when she was 12 and went to win a major at 18. They met again at the Kroger Queen City Championship in Cincinnati, this time Clemente as the player and Pressel now in the broadcast booth for Golf Channel.Zhang was 15 when she made the cut in the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur. She played her first LPGA major at age 14 and made the cut. But then, Zhang has been a big deal for a long time.Zhang takes a five-shot lead into the final round Saturday at Augusta. A victory would give her titles in the U.S. Women's Amateur, the U.S. Junior Girls, the NCAA Championship and the Augusta National Women's Amateur in a span of four years.Clemente recalls playing with Zhang during a practice round at a junior event three years ago, and it was another of those few moments that made her catch her breath.“I was definitely watching her game close and comparing it to mine at the time,"" Clemente said. ""Yeah, I’ll never forget that practice round.”Zhang laughed at the memory because she also had been there before, a young teen in the presence of established names in amateur golf.“She was doing so well, and she was so young,” Zhang said. “I think that Gianna is an amazing player, and I kind of knew from the start that she was going to be playing well because her mechanics are great, her swing is great. I think that she’s kind of a bright star for the future.”Clemente's family moved from the Youngstown, Ohio, area to the Florida Gulf Coast, where the weather and home-schooling allows her more time and devotion to golf. This is what she wants.But as much as she's consumed with golf, there is more to life. She turned 15 last week, and Clemente's mother surprised her with tickets to a Taylor Swift concert in Tampa in a few weeks.“My mom hid it from me for three months because she wanted to surprise me for my birthday.” Clemente said. “It was a good surprise.”But this is Clemente, who thrives on competition and loves winning. So when asked whether she was more excited for the concert or the final round Saturday at Augusta National, she didn't hesitate.“Saturday, yeah,” she said. “Not even close.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

(AP) — Family and friends of Evelyn Dieckhaus, one of three children who were killed in a school shooting in Nashville this week, remembered her Friday as a “shining light” and said farewell to a girl who loved art, music, animals and snuggling with her older sister on the couch.The funeral at the Woodmont Christian Church in Nashville’s Green Hills neighborhood was closed to the media. Before the service, the church's senior minister, the Rev. Clay Stauffer, echoed what Evelyn's family has shared about her.“She was a shining light. She was radiant,” Stauffer told The Associated Press. “I think our challenge is to take her light and keep spreading it to a world that has so much darkness and pain.”Evelyn's was the first funeral held for the victims of Monday's mass shooting at The Covenant School, where authorities say a 28-year-old former student killed six people before being shot and killed by police.The church is a couple of miles from the school and is across the street from the Woodmont Baptist Church, which served as the reunification point for surviving children and their parents after the attack.Dozens of people poured into the Woodmont Christian Church's main sanctuary for the service. Many of the women and girls wore pink dresses to honor the grieving family’s request to dress in pink and green “in tribute to Evelyn’s light and love of color.”With the pinkish-purple flowers of redbud trees blooming and mourners donning pastel colors, it looked as much like an Easter service as a funeral for a 9-year-old girl who brought joy and comfort to her loved ones.The other two children killed in the attack, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, were also 9. The three adults who were killed were the 60-year-old head of the school, Katherine Koonce, a 61-year-old custodian, Mike Hill, and Cynthia Peak, a 61-year-old substitute teacher.In an obituary given to The Associated Press by a family friend, Evelyn was described as “a constant beacon of joy” who loved crafting and drawing, playing with her two dogs Mable and Birdie, singing along to tunes by Taylor Swift and from the Broadway show “Hamilton,” and hanging out with her beloved big sister, Eleanor.Stauffer, the minister, said he has been trying to impress upon Evelyn's family, whom he described as “incredible people,” that they're not going through this alone.“We’ll celebrate her life this afternoon, and then we’ll continue to show up and to be there to love and support the family,” he said.That work started as soon as the ambulances, fire trucks and police cars went past his church on the day of the shooting. He went across the street to Woodmont Baptist to help reunite the frightened children and parents.“It’s been surreal and a nightmare that we are waiting to wake up from,” said Stauffer. “It’s been one of the hardest weeks you could imagine.”___Associated Press reporter Adrian Sainz in Memphis contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852861,Russia clashes with US over tactical nukes for Belarus,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia and the U.S. clashed in the United Nations on Friday over Moscow’s plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which neighboring Ukraine denounced as a desperate Kremlin attempt to avoid military defeat and “threaten the world with nuclear apocalypse.”China, without naming Russia, made clear its opposition to the planned deployment.Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya called for the U.N. Security Council meeting following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement on March 25 that his country plans to deploy tactical, comparatively short-range and small-yield nuclear weapons in Belarus.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko upped the ante just before the council meeting, saying Russia might also deploy strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus, which Russian forces have used as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.Kyslytsya said it took only four days for Putin to violate a pledge he made to China’s President Xi Jinping in a joint statement at their recent meeting in Moscow. It declared that all nuclear states should refrain from deploying nuclear weapons outside their countries and withdraw those deployed abroad.The same point was emphasized by the U.S. and Chinese deputy U.N. ambassadors, among others.“We call for the abolition of the nuclear-sharing arrangements and advocate no deployment of nuclear weapons abroad by all nuclear weapons states, and the withdrawal of nuclear weapons deployed abroad,"" said Geng Shuang of China.Calling nuclear weapons “the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads,” Geng reiterated that China opposes armed attacks against nuclear power plants and the threat or use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. He said ""nuclear proliferation must be prevented and nuclear crisis avoided.”Beijing claims to have a neutral stance in the war, but has also stressed its “no limits friendship” with Russia. It has refused to criticize Moscow’s invasion, and late last month released a peace plan calling for a cease-fire and talks between Ukraine and Russia.Kyslytsya welcomed Beijing’s stand, telling the council: “To the credit of the Chinese side, the Chinese side reminded Moscow in a very sensible manner that nuclear war cannot be won and fought, and that nuclear proliferation must be prevented.”Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow is not transferring nuclear weapons but “operational tactical missile complexes,” which will be under Russian control. He insisted this was not in violation of Moscow’s international obligations.Nebenzia accused the United States of destroying key arms control agreements and he repeated Putin's objection to the tactical nuclear weapons the U.S. has deployed in other NATO countries, indicating that this violated the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of global disarmament.Belarus’ U.N. Ambassador Valentin Rybakov said the planned deployment of tactical nuclear weapons was a reaction to “the challenges and risks to national security” his country faces, citing NATO neighbors ramping up their military capacity and Western sanctions. He also criticized the U.S. nuclear sharing with its allies.The U.S. deputy ambassador, Robert Wood, countered that the issue of nuclear sharing within NATO was discussed during negotiations on the NPT treaty, and for close to four decades Washington heard nothing about it from Russia until after its takeover of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.Wood stressed that any allegations that the United States is not in full compliance with the nonproliferation treaty “are just patently false.”He accused Russia of “attempting to manipulate the specter of nuclear conflict” to help win the war in Ukraine.“No other country is inflicting such damage on arms control nor seeking to undermine strategic stability in Europe,” Wood said. ""No other country has raised the prospect of potential nuclear use in connection with the war in Ukraine. … No country is threatening Russia or threatening President Putin.”",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852863,Looking for a Final Four edge? Think offensive efficiency,"HOUSTON (AP) — Adam Seiko and his San Diego State teammates are ready from the moment the ball is tipped to stalk ballhandlers, make aggressive switches and close out hard on any shooter.They're true believers in the oft-repeated notion that defense wins championships.“It should be a staple statement in every program,” Seiko said.Yet as the Aztecs bring that approach to this weekend's Final Four, the reality is different: the teams that have cut down the nets on the final Monday of the season have largely been top-tier offensive teams for the past two decades. That means there's been more return for teams having big-time shot makers compared to a team full of stoppers that packs less offensive punch.“I think most of the teams that go all the way, they have to have a couple of guys that can go get their own bucket or just can score at will,” said Florida Atlantic guard Jalen Gaffney, a UConn transfer.And that sets up best for Miami and Connecticut compared to San Diego State and FAU as the sport reaches its biggest stage after a topsy-turvy season.“It's about when you can't get stops as a defensive team, do you have the firepower offensively to combat not having a great outing on the defensive end?"" said Joel Berry II, the Most Outstanding Player of the 2017 Final Four during North Carolina’s title run and an ACC Network analyst. ""And if you don't have it, it's hard to compete for a national championship.""A look at KenPom data illustrates that point.Seventeen of the last 20 NCAA champions finished in the top 10 in adjusted offensive efficiency, which measures points scored per 100 possessions. Four — Florida in its 2007 repeat, UNC in 2009, Duke in 2010 and Villanova in 2018 — were ranked No. 1. And 14 champions have ranked better in offensive than defensive efficiency, including every year going back to Duke in 2015.By comparison, 10 of the 20 champions finished outside the top 10 in adjusted defensive efficiency for points allowed per 100 possessions. That includes the past two champs, Kansas last year (17th, 91.7) and Baylor in 2021 (22nd, 91.1).Luke Hancock is linked to one of the outliers, having been named Most Outstanding Player of the 2013 Final Four in Louisville's later-vacated run to the trophy. That squad ranked No. 1 in defensive efficiency (84.8) and seventh offensively (117.7), and Hancock appreciates the value of pressure defense after having played for Rick Pitino.And yet, the ACC Network analyst also looks to offense in March Madness.“When you get to this point, it's all about who plays that fluid game and scores points in my opinion,” he said, adding: “I just think you're not going to be able to really compete if you can't score the basketball for six straight games.”There's one glaring example from recent years: Virginia, with a defensive-heavy approach and a slow tempo that is seemingly determined to grind hardwood into dust.The Cavaliers have had first-round tournament exits in three of their past four appearances. But they won the 2019 championship when they had a trio of NBA-bound shot makers in DeAndre Hunter, Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy to complement that defense, including Hunter hitting big shots in the overtime finale against Texas Tech.It's a lesson that UConn coach Dan Hurley has taken seriously, even with his defensive instincts.Last year's team fell to New Mexico State for a first-round exit, and Hurley couldn't overlook the Aggies having more perimeter firepower. So the Huskies added four transfers for the wing.As a result, UConn arrives in Houston having gone from averaging 113.8 points per 100 possessions last year to 120.8 this year, good for third nationally. Throw in a top-11 defense, and the Huskies have rolled through four NCAA opponents.“We knew the defense would come with this team,” forward Alex Karaban said. “We just needed the offensive spurt.”The Huskies' opponent in Saturday's national semifinals is right there with them. Miami ranked fifth nationally (119.6) and has four different players who have tallied at least three 20-point games this year. The offensive versatility, guard Jordan Miller said, takes the pressure off since the Hurricanes know they can score in any situation.“We've been lucky enough to have a really good offense this year,” Miller said. “So to win games, it’s just come down to how many stops we can get. ... And we never really have a problem scoring the ball.”It's a different look in the other semifinal, where FAU has a top-30 unit at both ends while San Diego State is the defensive headliner in Houston. The Aztecs are fourth nationally by holding opponents to 89.8 points per 100 possessions but 75th in offense (110.7).Still, San Diego State was good enough to oust top overall tournament seed Alabama and to hold down a strong Creighton offense in the regional final. That's why leading scorer Matt Bradley isn't worried about data showing offensive teams have a tournament edge.""The thing is, we have lot of size, we have a lot of athleticism, we play really hard on the defensive end,” Bradley said. “I think when you have those three things it gives you a chance to beat anybody.”___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852864,Fiery derailments renew Americans' focus on railroad safety,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Americans are renewing their focus on railroad safety after a string of recent derailments, especially two fiery ones involving hazardous chemicals in Ohio and Minnesota that prompted evacuations.Federal regulators and members of Congress are urging railroads to do more to prevent derailments. They want standards for the trackside detectors used to help identify equipment problems, more notice to states about hazardous chemicals they are hauling, and at least two people at the helm of freight trains.A Senate bill would toughen the penalty for safety violations to up to 1% of a railroad's annual operating income and set standards for the maximum length and weight of freight trains, which have grown significantly in recent years. Trains now routinely stretch beyond two miles (3 kilometers) long.The railroads themselves say they will take steps that include installing roughly 1,000 more trackside detectors. But the industry has a long history of resisting new regulations. The Association of American Railroads trade group has already spoken out against the crew size rule and requiring electronically-controlled brakes.Railroads are generally regarded as the safest way to transport hazardous chemicals across land, and statistics show that 99.9% of those shipments arrive safely. Most derailments don't cause major problems, but there are still nearly three a day somewhere in the country. Just one derailment involving hazardous chemicals can be disastrous.FLAMMABLE TRAIN RULESRegulators established a set of safety rules for trains hauling large amounts of crude oil, ethanol or other flammable liquids in 2015 after several fiery derailments, including one of the worst disasters in railroad history.In 2013, the brakes failed on a parked crude oil train in the hills above the Canadian town of Lac Megantic. The unmanned train rolled downhill and derailed, killing 47 people and causing millions of dollars in damage.Other crude oil crashes, like one that created a massive fireball outside the town of Casselton, North Dakota, in 2013, alarmed regulators because the number of crude oil shipments had skyrocketed as more oil was being produced in areas without many pipelines, like North Dakota.The 2015 rules require railroads to notify states about how many flammable liquid trains they expect to transport each week and to find the safest route possible for them. They also establish a maximum speed limit of 50 mph (80 kph).Neither the Ohio or Minnesota trains that derailed were covered by these rules. To be considered a high-hazardous flammable train, a train must have either a block of 20 or more flammable liquid cars or at least 35 flammable liquid cars in all.Lawmakers and regulators have discussed expanding the definition, so more trains would be covered.ELECTRONIC BRAKESFederal regulators originally proposed that any high-hazardous flammable train would need upgraded electronically-controlled brakes that can stop trains more quickly by applying all cars' brakes simultaneously. Conventional systems apply air brakes sequentially. But they dropped that proposal in 2018 after Congress required them to conduct a detailed cost-benefit analysis.Mike Rush, a senior vice president of safety and operations with the AAR trade group, told Federal Railroad Administration officials this week that considering electronic brakes now would be “a complete waste of time.”He said the major freight railroads spent a decade testing electronic brakes and found only limited benefits. Electronic brakes also were prone to breaking down, he said.Since 2015, it has become much more common for railroads to use multiple locomotives spread throughout a train. That helps stop trains more quickly because the locomotives can send a braking signal at once — though likely not as quickly as electronic brakes would.TANK CAR UPGRADESOne thing in the 2015 rules was a requirement to upgrade DOT-111 tank cars used to haul crude oil and ethanol to make them less likely to leak in a derailment. The tank cars involved in Thursday's BNSF derailment in Minnesota were upgraded triple-hulled DOT-117 cars, but they still ruptured and caught fire.Since 2015, nearly 48,000 of the newer tank cars have been built, and some 41,000 older tank cars have been upgraded to meet a 2029 deadline set by Congress. Another 35,000 older tank cars need to be upgraded or replaced.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg suggested speeding up those upgrades to complete them by 2025 after the Ohio derailment. But the Railway Supply Institute, which represents big tank car manufacturers that own most of the nation’s tank cars, says that’s not possible because of current labor and supply chain shortages.CHEMICAL CONCERNSThe ethanol that spilled and caught fire in the Minnesota derailment is less of a concern than the vinyl chloride that was released after the Ohio derailment or other toxic chemicals railroads routinely carry, like chlorine gas that was released during a 2005 derailment in Graniteville, South Carolina, killing nine people and injuring more than 250.Ethanol is relatively clean burning, but contaminated soil in the area will have to be removed.The vinyl chloride released from tank cars in Ohio out of fear it might explode is associated with increased risk of certain cancers. Officials warned when they burned it that two concerning gases — hydrogen chloride and phosgene, which was used as a weapon in World War I — might be released in the process.That's why so many East Palestine residents remain concerned about potential long-term health impacts even though state and federal officials insist they haven't found alarming levels of chemicals in the air or water. Norfolk Southern has also been ordered to test for dioxins, which may have been released during the February incineration.___Associated Press reporters Steve Karnowski contributed to this report from Minneapolis and Heather Hollingsworth contributed from Mission, Kansas.",2023/04/01,,World

The motive for the police action remains unclear eight years later, but investigators believe drug trafficking was at least partially involved.The students’ bodies have never been found, though fragments of burned bone have been matched to three of the students.The experts group said previously that there is evidence a number of military personnel were following the events of that night closely yet did not intervene to save the students — or even a soldier had infiltrated the teachers' college, which is noted for left-wing activism.Phone intercepts that are part of a drug trafficking case in Chicago have also established close contact between members of the Mexican military and the AGuerrero Unidos gang, which allegedly was given the students after they were seized by police.The experts said Friday that they have asked President Andrés Manuel López Obrador again to instruct the military to share all of its related archives on the case, including phone intercepts that the experts say it has from the time of the abductions.They also stressed the importance of maintaining the independence of the special prosecutor.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852878,Florida House votes to expand 'Don't Say Gay' law,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida could expand what critics call the “Don't Say Gay” law that limits discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation in public schools under a bill the House approved Friday along party lines.The bill, which passed on a 77-35 vote, would ban discussion on those issues through eighth grade, a year after lawmakers received national attention for banning those discussions through third grade. The bill also would prohibit school staffers or students from being required to refer to people by pronouns that don’t correspond to the person’s sex.The measure was among several the House passed that still need Senate approval before going to Gov. Ron DeSantis, including bills that would change the start time for middle and high school students, ban sports fans from running onto a field in celebration, and require all Florida courthouses to designate private lactation places.But the education bill that expands what Republicans call parental rights in education was easily the most debated bill of the day.Democrats said the legislation is harmful to LGBTQ students, teachers and their families, and Republicans are trying to create fear where there doesn't need to be any.“Teachers have literally taken bullets for their students. They do everything they can to keep them safe. They are not indoctrinating our kids. They are heroes, not villains,” said Democratic Rep. Rita Harris. “And this bill causes more of these incredible educators to leave the profession, and some of them to leave the state.Republicans disputed that it was an anti-LGBTQ bill.“This bill doesn’t demonize teachers, it actually liberates them. What this bill does is allow teachers to teach,"" said Republican Rep. Ralph Massullo.He said teachers should focus on subjects like math and English and not be involved in decisions parents should make on teaching children about sexuality.“This bill has nothing to do with what our children's sexual identity is. It’s not marginalizing our children’s sexual identity at all. It’s actually allowing them to be children,” he said.Other bills passed by the House on Friday would:— Set public school start times by 2026 as no earlier than 8 a.m. for middle school students and no earlier than 8:30 for high schools.— Approve a ballot measure to ask voters to make school board races partisan instead of non-partisan.— Create new penalties for fans who run onto professional and college sports fields and courts.— Prohibit students from using school internet access to visit social media websites and require internet safety education.— Increase the number of days a newborn can be surrendered by a parent from seven to 30 days.— Require all Florida courts provide a private place for mothers to nurse babies or pump breast",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852879,Fetterman leaves Walter Reed with depression 'in remission',"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has left Walter Reed National Military Medical Center after six weeks of inpatient treatment for clinical depression, with plans to return to the Senate when the chamber resumes session in mid-April, his office said Friday.In a statement, Fetterman's office said he is back home in Braddock, in western Pennsylvania, with his depression “in remission,” and gave details on his treatment — including that his depression was treated with medication and that he is wearing hearing aids for hearing loss.It was the latest medical episode for the Democrat, who won last fall's most expensive Senate contest after suffering a stroke that he has said nearly killed him and from which he continues to recover.Fetterman, who has a wife and three school-age children, said he is happy to be home.“I’m excited to be the father and husband I want to be, and the senator Pennsylvania deserves. Pennsylvanians have always had my back, and I will always have theirs,” said Fetterman said. “I am extremely grateful to the incredible team at Walter Reed. The care they provided changed my life.""Fetterman, 53, will return to the Senate the week of April 17.Doctors describe “remission” as when a patient responds to treatment so that they have returned to normal social function and they are indistinguishable from someone who has never had depression.In an interview that will air on “CBS Sunday Morning,” Fetterman said the symptoms gathered strength after he won the November election.“The whole thing about depression,"" he said, ""is that objectively you may have won, but depression can absolutely convince you that you actually lost and that’s exactly what happened and that was the start of a downward spiral.”He said he “had stopped leaving my bed, I’d stopped eating, I was dropping weight, I’d stopped engaging in some of the most — things that I love in my life.”Fetterman checked into Walter Reed on Feb. 15 after weeks of what aides described as Fetterman being withdrawn and uninterested in eating, discussing work or the usual banter with staff.At the time, Fetterman was barely a month into his service in Washington and still recovering from the aftereffects of the stroke he suffered last May when he went to Walter Reed on the advice of the Capitol physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan.Post-stroke depression is common and treatable through medication and talk therapy, doctors say.Fetterman’s return will be welcome news for Democrats who have struggled to find votes for some nominations, in particular, without him in the Senate.Fetterman's office also released details of his treatment under medical professionals led by Dr. David Williamson, a neuropsychiatrist.When he was admitted, Fetterman had ""severe symptoms of depression with low energy and motivation, minimal speech, poor sleep, slowed thinking, slowed movement, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, but no suicidal ideation,"" the statement attributed to Williamson said.The symptoms had steadily worsened over the preceding eight weeks and Fetterman had stopped eating and drinking fluids. That caused low blood pressure, the statement said.“His depression, now resolved, may have been a barrier to engagement,” it said.Fetterman had the stroke last May as he was campaigning in a three-way Democratic primary race. He had surgery to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator to manage two heart conditions, atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy.One of Fetterman’s main aftereffects from the stroke is auditory processing disorder, which can render someone unable to speak fluidly and quickly process spoken conversation into meaning. Fetterman uses devices in conversations, meetings and congressional hearings that transcribe spoken words in real time.___Follow Marc Levy on Twitter: @timelywriter",2023/04/01,,World

Mr. Lazzaro trusts he will be vindicated.""His indictment led to the downfall of Jennifer Carnahan as chair of the Republican Party of Minnesota.His co-defendant, 21-year-old Gisela Castro Medina, who formerly led the College Republicans chapter at the University of St. Thomas, pleaded guilty to two counts last year. She testified against Lazzaro.Prosecutors argued during the trial that Lazzaro enlisted Medina, who he initially paid for sex, to recruit other teenagers — preferably minors — who were white, small, vulnerable or “broken.”“He wanted sex, and not just any sex,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Melinda Williams said during closing arguments Friday. “He wanted sex with minor girls under the age of 18. And he had a plan to get it.”Lazarro's attorney, Daniel Gerdts, argued that government's “salacious” prosecution was based on “completely unfounded” allegations.“The prosecution clearly disapproves of Mr. Lazzaro’s playboy lifestyle,” Gerdts said. “And frankly, as the father of three daughters, so do I. The opprobrium is well deserved, but that is not why we’re here.”Carnahan. the the widow of U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn, resigned a week after the charges against Lazzaro were unsealed. She denied knowing about Lazzaro's crimes but his arrest prompted outrage among party activists.Pictures on Lazzaro’s social media accounts showed him with prominent Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852883,Cleanup begins after fiery Minnesota ethanol derailment,"Crews have started removing contaminated soil and damaged railcars left behind by Thursday's fiery derailment in southwest Minnesota.Authorities said Friday afternoon the ethanol fire that burned for hours had been extinguished and that local firefighters were allowed to leave after remaining on site overnight. But large water tanks and railroad firefighting equipment remained at the site to handle any flare-ups as damaged tank cars are removed.The entire town of Raymond, which is about 100 miles (161 kilometers) west of Minneapolis, had to be evacuated after 22 cars, including 10 carrying ethanol, left the tracks. Four of the tank cars ruptured and caught fire. But the several hundred residents were allowed to return home by midday Thursday, and no injuries were reported.This latest derailment only adds to concerns nationally about railroad safety. Lawmakers and regulators want freight railroads to make changes after last month's derailment near East Palestine, Ohio, that forced half that town to evacuate. Even though officials say the area is safe, many residents have lingering health concerns.The Kandiyohi County Sheriff's office said BNSF railroad crews began removing some of the contaminated soil under and around the tracks early Friday morning. And once investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board gave the OK, workers started to remove the damaged railcars.It’s not clear how long the cleanup will take, and no cause of the derailment has been determined yet.The head of the Fort Worth, Texas-based railroad promised a thorough cleanup and said BNSF works hard to prevent derailments like this from happening.NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said the BNSF train had three crew members — an engineer, conductor and brakeman — aboard when it derailed around 1 a.m. Thursday. The train had a total of 14 ethanol cars along with corn syrup it was delivering.Holloway said investigators will work to determine what caused the derailment.The Environmental Protection Agency continued monitoring the air around the derailment Friday, but officials said the agency hasn’t found any worrisome levels of contaminants or particulate matter.",2023/04/01,,World

He had 30 touchdown runs and four touchdown catches.The Packers selected Brockington, a native of the Brooklyn borough of New York City, out of Ohio State with the ninth overall pick in the 1971 draft.Brockington rushed for 1,105 yards his first season in Green Bay, which at the time was an NFL rookie record. He earned All-Pro honors and was named NFL offensive rookie of the year.He followed that up by rushing for 1,027 yards in 1972 while helping the Packers win an NFC Central title.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852885,New Tennessee law allows police officers in private schools,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Friday signed a law allowing private schools to contract with local law enforcement so they can hire school resource officers, days after a Nashville shooting at a private Christian school left six dead, including three children.The Republican governor quietly approved the law without issuing a statement. A spokesperson for Lee did not immediately return a request seeking comment. The law goes into effect immediately.Supporters said the bill was needed to clarify statutes that had kept private schools from working with local governments to hire school resource officers. The law now clears the path for them to do so, but does not make it a requirement.Lee is expected to unveil his own proposals in response to The Covenant School shooting in the coming days. However, he has remained largely out of the public eye this week after announcing that his wife, Maria, was close friends with Katherine Koonce — who was among the six who were shot and killed Monday morning.Republican leaders told reporters that Lee has been meeting with lawmakers this week to discuss possible legislation and budget proposals.In a letter to Lee, Republican Lt. Gov. Randy McNally called for securing windows and glass in school buildings, adding magnetic locks on doors, modernizing camera systems, and increasing armed guards. McNally said later that he also is in favor of red flag laws like one in Florida, but also acknowledged that such a proposal may not clear the GOP-dominant Statehouse.Meanwhile, House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters Thursday that he was willing to discuss any legislative option but held back from committing to pursuing any particular policy proposal.Last year, Lee signed an executive order on school safety measures that directed the state to conduct a report on the use of armed guards in nonpublic schools and assess their need for active-shooter training.Most U.S. school systems conduct active-shooter and lockdown trainings, and The Covenant School had in fact undergone active-shooter training in 2022, which prevented further loss of life during Monday’s shooting, city police spokesperson Brooke Reese said.Around the U.S., private schools generally do not face as many requirements as public schools for developing security plans.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852886,Get it while it's hot: New Mexico boosts chile production,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico produced more than 53,000 tons of its most famous crop during the last growing season, meaning more chile peppers found their way into salsas and onto dinner plates than the previous year.State and federal agriculture officials rolled out the latest numbers this week as New Mexico’s governor signed legislation that established the sweet smell of green chile roasting in the fall as the state’s official aroma.New Mexico’s love affair with the hot peppers runs deep. Chile is one of the official state vegetables, it's on license plates and it forms the basis of the state’s official question: “Red or Green?”The state in 2014 even adopted its own trademark and certification program to protect the reputation and integrity of its signature crop, much like Idaho has capitalized on potatoes, Maine has its lobsters and Florida has its fresh fruits and juices.The numbers released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the New Mexico Department of Agriculture show that more than 90% of the chile produced in 2022 was of the green variety.The value of the crop was estimated at more than $46 million, about $1 million more than in 2021. Chile used for processing — for salsas, sauces and spices, for example — account for most of that value while fresh chile brought in about $4.4 million.While production was up, the land used for planting was actually less than in 2021. That's because farmers are seeing higher yields from their crops due to irrigation and cultivation improvements, said Travis Day, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association.He said the latest figures are exciting news for the industry, which has faced its share of market and labor challenges in recent years.“Our members are finally seeing normality after the COVID pandemic and labor, while still an issue, is slowly getting better,” he said.Day also pointed out that more farmers outside southern New Mexico's chile-growing belt are having success with peppers. About three-fifths of last year's production came from counties other than Sierra, Doña Ana and Luna counties.Doña Ana County is home to Hatch, a village at the edge of the Rio Grande that has come to be known as the “Chile Capital of the World."" Researchers at New Mexico State University have long said that soil conditions, warmer temperatures, the right amount of water and a longer growing season in the region result in a unique flavor.Farmers are expecting a strong season this year — as long as the weather cooperates.Forecasts calling for more moisture could help increase the availability of irrigation supplies, but Day warned that standing water in fields increases the potential for wilt and root rot diseases that could affect the harvest in late July and early August.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852887,UConn players navigate Ramadan fast during Final Four,"HOUSTON (AP) — For UConn players Adama Sanogo, Samson Johnson and Hassan Diarra, a traditional pregame meal before Saturday night’s Final Four matchup against Miami won’t be possible.The three are Muslims who observe Ramadan and began a strict fast from dawn until sunset daily starting March 22 and continuing through April 20. Ramadan is the Muslim holy month and is a time of deep spiritual discipline and contemplation of one's relationship with God.With the sun setting in Houston just 10 minutes before the 7:49 p.m. tipoff, the players will barely have time to eat a snack and chug a drink before taking the court against the Hurricanes.“I’ll drink my coconut water and eat some fruit,” said Sanogo, the team’s leading scorer. “That’s all I need to get ready for the game and I’ll be fine.”James Doran is the team’s associate head athletic trainer and the man in charge of making sure the three players have what they need to navigate playing basketball while fasting. He said the key is planning.“All we did was we basically quizzed them all and asked them, 'What do you want coming out of your fast?’ and they all have been doing it so long that they know exactly what they want right out of the fast,” Doran said.While Sanogo prefers fruit and coconut water, Johnson and Diarra often opt for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and sports drinks.All three say that while fasting during the tournament can be difficult, they’ve been doing it for so long it’s like second nature to them to continue it this week.“It’s not an easy task … but just have faith and believe in God and everything that you do just gets easier,” Johnson said. “With time I got used to it and it’s a lot easier for me now.”The players don’t stress out about fasting during the tournament, but the same can’t be said for UConn coach Dan Hurley.“For me as a coach, navigating it was more like panic,” he said. “And I don’t know much about diet and nutrition and human performance. But we’ve got a great strength coach and athletic trainer that have been able to get up with (Sanogo) early and get some food in him. And then obviously the late tip time helps us more.“It was a bigger challenge out West because we were playing so early, and it was like really in the middle of (Sanogo) probably being at his weakest in terms of those things.”For instance, their game against Gonzaga last Saturday in Las Vegas started so early the three players couldn’t eat until halftime. That left them less than 10 minutes to grab some bananas and sports drinks before returning to the court.All three players said they wake up around 5 a.m. to eat before their daily fast begins. None of them eat breakfast food, with all three opting for meals including steak for their morning meal.Diarra said it’s not the lack of food that impacts him most but rather that he isn’t able to have a sip of water if a game or practice is during fasting hours.“It can be very, very, very hard at times,” he said. “The hardest part is not being able to drink or hydrate yourself throughout the game, throughout the practices. It can be challenging at times, but we find a way to push through it and get it done.”Because of this, Doran and the staff focus on making sure they’re eating and drinking the right things when they can to get through physical exertion.“We really make sure they’re taking in a great amount of electrolytes during the non-fast,” he said. “Because making sure they’re loaded up on electrolytes will help them retain more water while they’re not allowed to drink or not allowed to hydrate.”As the scent of food waiting for the rest of the team wafted through the locker room Friday, Diarra was asked if situations like that made fasting more difficult.He said no, but noted temptations that come from another source.“It’s mostly on social media,” he said. “You don’t want to think about it, but it just pops up on your newsfeed. Recipes, and great food and restaurants, that’s the hardest part.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852888,Raptors' Nurse: Time needed to reflect on coaching future,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Toronto coach Nick Nurse will take time in the offseason to consider if he wants to return to the Raptors for a sixth season or pursue other options.With the Raptors under .500, Nurse's name has been linked to other coaching jobs and there have been reports Toronto could be ready to move on from the coach who led them to the 2019 NBA championship.Nurse joined the Raptors in 2013 as an assistant and was promoted to head coach in 2018 after Dwane Casey was fired. Nurse would enter the final year of his contract next season.“I think I'm concentrated on this job, for sure, and this game,” Nurse said Friday. “But I think that 10 years is a good time to sit back and reflect a little bit, right? I think we're going to do that all when the season ends.”The Raptors fell to 38-39 after a 117-110 loss to the 76ers on Friday night and are in ninth place in the Eastern Conference. They would need to get to sixth place over the final six games to avoid the play-in tournament. They play the next four on the road.“It's been a difficult season from a number of standpoints,” Nurse said.The Raptors have weathered several key injuries this season to rebound to .500 for the first time since early December. But this offseason could be a pivotal one for the Raptors, who have remained solid under Nurse even as the team has suffered key losses such as Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan since winning the franchise's only NBA title.“I'm going to take a few weeks to see where I'm at,” Nurse said. “Where's my head at, just see how the relationship with the organization is. It's been 10 years for me now, which is a pretty good run. I don't know, over those 10 years, we've got to be up there with number of wins for anybody in the league. I don't know what it is, but we've had a lot of good seasons.”Nurse said discussions with president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri and general manager Bobby Webster about his future will be tabled until the offseason — which he hoped could still be a fruitful one.“My head is to make this as long a season as possible,” Nurse said. “This team needs playoff experience. That is where I'm at right now.”___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852890,Boy Scouts bankruptcy plan headed to federal appeals court,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — Attorneys for several insurance companies are appealing a federal judge's decision to uphold the confirmation of a $2.4 billion bankruptcy reorganization plan for the Boy Scouts of America.In an emergency motion filed Friday, attorneys for non-settling insurers asked U.S. District Court Judge Richard Andrews to halt the effect of a ruling he issued Tuesday while they take their case to the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.The BSA's bankruptcy plan is aimed at allowing the Texas-based organization to continue operating while ensuring compensation for tens of thousands of men who say they were sexually abused as children while involved in Scouting.In his ruling, Andrews rejected arguments that the bankruptcy plan wasn’t proposed in good faith and improperly strips insurers and abuse survivors of their rights.The opposing insurers note that an automatic halt to litigation against the Boy Scouts as a debtor in bankruptcy expires after April 11. They fear the BSA could argue at that point that further appeals are moot, thus subjecting them to irreparable harm. They also note BSA lawyers on Thursday refused to agree even to a period of advance notice before causing the bankruptcy plan to to take effect. Attorneys for the Boy Scouts, meanwhile, have asked the bankruptcy judge to approve almost $4 million in funding for “preparatory work” on the trust from which abuse survivors would be paid.The insurers argue the case presents “fundamental questions of bankruptcy law of vital importance that could have widespread impact in mass tort bankruptcies for years to come.”""Even if this Court is satisfied that it has correctly determined the issues, a reasonable possibility exists that the Third Circuit — which has repeatedly cautioned against the dangers posed by mass tort bankruptcies — may disagree on one or more issues the certain insurers or other appellants will raise on appeal,"" attorneys wrote.Doug Kennedy, co-chair of the official committee representing abuse survivors, decried the latest appeal effort, saying it shows a ""callous disregard"" for survivors.“It's time for the objecting insurers to show that they actually care about the people they insure, and stand aside while this plan becomes effective,” Kennedy said in a text.Under the plan, the BSA itself would contribute less than 10% of the proposed settlement fund. The local Boy Scout councils, which run daily operations for troops, offered to contribute at least $515 million in cash and property, conditioned on certain protections for local troop sponsoring organizations, including religious entities, civic associations and community groups.The bulk of the compensation would come from the Boy Scouts’ two largest insurers, Century Indemnity and The Hartford, which reached settlements calling for them to contribute $800 million and $787 million, respectively. That is a fraction of the billions of dollars in potential liability exposure the two insurers faced.Settling insurers, local Boy Scout councils and troop sponsoring organizations would receive broad liability releases as non-debtor “third parties” protecting them from future sex abuse lawsuits in exchange for contributing to the victims’ compensation fund — or even for not objecting to the plan.Meanwhile, other insurers — many of which provided excess coverage above the liability limits of underlying primary policies — have refused to settle. They argue the procedures for distributing funds from the victims' trust would violate their contractual rights to contest claims, set a dangerous precedent for mass tort litigation and result in grossly inflated payments.More than 80,000 men have filed claims saying they were abused as children by Boy Scout leaders and volunteers around the country. A plaintiffs’ attorney has acknowledged that some 58,000 claims probably couldn’t be pursued in civil lawsuits because of statutes of limitations.When it sought bankruptcy protection in February 2020, the Boy Scouts had been named in about 275 lawsuits and told insurers it was aware of another 1,400 claims. According to plan opponents, the huge number of claims filed in the bankruptcy were the result of a nationwide marketing effort by personal injury lawyers working with for-profit claims aggregators to drum up clients.Opponents argue that the BSA, desperate to escape bankruptcy, subsequently colluded with claimants’ lawyers to inflate both the volume and value of claims in order to pressure insurers for large settlements, then transferred its insurance rights to the settlement trust. The trust would be overseen by a retired bankruptcy judge but would work closely with an advisory committee of claimants' lawyers.Some abuse survivors who oppose the plan argue it violates their due process rights because it releases their claims against non-debtor third parties without their consent. Such third-party releases, spawned by asbestos and product-liability cases, have been criticized as an unconstitutional form of “bankruptcy grifting,” where non-debtor entities obtain benefits by joining with a debtor to resolve mass-tort litigation in bankruptcy.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852898,Video of Colorado nightclub attack kept out of public view,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Surveillance footage capturing the attack at a Colorado gay nightclub that left five people dead and 17 others wounded will not be made public until it is presented at trial, a judge ruled Friday.Prosecutors and defense attorneys had argued that releasing the gruesome video could make it difficult to seat an impartial jury and would further traumatize the survivors while disrespecting those who were killed in the Nov. 19, 2022, shooting.“Those individuals deserve the respect of not having the last moments or the most traumatic moments of their lives broadcast and downloadable from a State of Colorado web site,” Anderson Lee Aldrich's public defenders wrote in a March 2 motion.They also argued that, unlike printed court documents, it would be too difficult to redact the video, which shows ""moments of death and severe injury to several people.""Judge Michael McHenry agreed not to make the footage public because attorneys on both sides were opposed. He said he had not received any media requests to do so.Public court records released last month include still images of the attack and its aftermath. District Attorney Michael Allen said in a court filing that the surveillance video would be introduced at trial.On the night of the shooting, Aldrich went to Club Q in Colorado Springs, left and then returned, according to authorities.Surveillance video showed Aldrich entering the club wearing a red T-shirt and tan ballistic vest while holding an AR-style rifle, with six magazines for the weapon and a pistol visible, police Detective Jason Gasper testified during a February preliminary hearing.Investigators said that soon after entering, Aldrich opened fire indiscriminately.The shooting was stopped when Navy information systems technician Thomas James grabbed the barrel of Aldrich’s rifle, burning his hand it was so hot, Detective Ashton Gardner testified.As panicked patrons fled from the dance floor, James and Aldrich tumbled off a landing and struggled over a handgun. Aldrich fired at least once, shooting James in the ribs, Gardner said.After being shot, it is clear from the video that James was tiring, “but he continues to do what he can to subdue the suspect until police arrive,” Gardner testified, noting that James later gave up his spot in an ambulance to someone else who was injured.Army veteran Richard Fierro rushed over to help, grabbing the rifle and throwing it, Gardner said. Fierro then used the handgun to beat Aldrich, telling officers later that he “kept hitting” the suspect until they arrived.Aldrich is charged with 305 criminal counts, including hate crimes and murder. Public defenders have declined to talk about the case, and investigators have not released a motive.Prosecutors and defense attorneys argued during a preliminary hearing over whether Adlrich’s actions were a hate crime. Aldrich, who is nonbinary and uses they and them pronouns, had visited Club Q at least six times in the years before the attack, witnesses testified. The venue has long been a sanctuary for the LGBTQ community in the mostly conservative city.No trial date has been set.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852899,"UN food chief: Billions needed to avert unrest, starvation","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Without billions of dollars more to feed millions of hungry people, the world will see mass migration, destabilized countries, and starving children and adults in the next 12 to 18 months, the head of the Nobel prize-winning U.N. World Food Program warned Friday.David Beasley praised increased funding from the United States and Germany last year, and urged China, Gulf nations, billionaires and other countries “to step up big time.”In an interview before he hands the reins of the world’s largest humanitarian organization to U.S. ambassador Cindy McCain next week, the former South Carolina governor said he’s “extremely worried” that WFP won’t raise about $23 billion it needs this year to help millions of needy people“Right at this stage, I’ll be surprised if we get 40% of it, quite frankly,” he said.Last year, Beasley raised $14.2 billion for WFP, more than double the $6 billion in 2017, the year he took over as executive director. That money helped over 128 million people in more than 120 countries and territories.Beasley said he was able to convince the United States last year to increase its funding from about $3.5 billion to $7.4 billion and Germany to raise its contribution from $350 million a few years ago to $1.7 billion, but he doesn’t think they’ll do it again this year.Other countries need to step up now, he said, starting with China, the world’s second-largest economy which gave WFP just $11 million last year.Beasley applauded China for its success in substantially reducing hunger and poverty at home, but said it gave less than one cent per person last year compared to the United States, the world's leading economy, which gave about $22 per person.China needs “to engage in the multilateral world” and be willing to provide help that is critical, he said. “They have a moral obligation to do so.”Beasley said they’ve done “an incredible job of feeding their people,” and “now we need their help in other parts of the world” on how they did it, particularly in poorer countries including in Africa.With high oil prices Gulf countries can also do more, especially Muslim nations that have relations with countries in east Africa, the Sahara and elsewhere in the Middle East, he said, expressing hope they will increase contributions.Beasley said the wealthiest billionaires made unprecedented profits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and ""it’s not too much to ask some of the multibillionaires to step up and help us in the short-term crisis,” even though charity isn’t a long-term solution to the food crisis.In the long-term, he said what he’d really like to see is billionaires using their experience and success to engage “in the world’s greatest need – and that is food on the planet to feed 8 billion people.”“The world has to understand that the next 12 to 18 months is critical, and if we back off the funding, you will have mass migration, and you will have destabilization nations and that will all be on top of starvation among children and people around the world,” he warned.Beasley said WFP was just forced to cut rations by 50% to 4 million people in Afghanistan, and “these are people who are knocking on famine’s door now.”“We don’t have enough money just to reach the most vulnerable people now,” he said. “So we are in a crisis over the cliff stage right now, where we literally could have hell on earth if we’re not very careful.”Beasley said he’s been telling leaders in the West and Europe that while they’re focusing everything on Ukraine and Russia, “you better well not forget about what’s south and southeast of you because I can assure you it is coming your way if you don’t pay attention and get on top of it.”With $400 trillion worth of wealth on the planet, he said, there’s no reason for any child to die of starvation.The WFP executive director said leaders have to prioritize the humanitarian needs that are going to have the greatest impact on stability in societies around the world.He singled out several priority places -- Africa’s Sahel region as well as the east including Somalia, northern Kenya, South Sudan and Ethiopia; Syria which is having an impact on Jordan and Lebanon; and Central and South America where the number of people migrating to the United States is now five times what it was a year-and-a-half ago.Beasley said McCain, the widow of U.S. Senator John McCain from Arizona who was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and has been the U.S. ambassador to Rome-based WFP and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, “is the right person at the right time” to lead the World Food Program.They've been working together to make sure “she hits the ground running,” he said, But “it’s going to be a very, very challenging time” because of all the money going to the war in Ukraine, and the need to help so many other fragile economies.Beasley said his biggest surprise was believing in April 2017, when he took over the agency and there were 80 million people in the world “marching to starvation,” that “we could end world hunger and put the World Food Program out of business.”What he didn’t expect were the conflicts and wars, the climate shocks, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war, he said, which raised the 80 million in desperate need of food to 135 million right before COVID started spreading in early 2020, to 276 million before Russia invaded Ukraine – “the bread basket of the world” -- in February 2022, and to 350 million now.Beasley said """"it's hard not to get depressed"" but two things give him hope.Seeing little girls and boys smiling in the midst of war and suffering from hunger “inspires you not to give up,” he said, as does the bipartisan support in the often divided U.S. Congress for helping the poorest of the poor around the world.As he returns to his family in South Carolina, Beasley said his dream remains to end world hunger.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852900,Chinese businessman seeks bail in $1 billion fraud case,"NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for a wealthy self-exiled Chinese businessman who developed ties to Trump administration figures including Steve Bannon are seeking bail for him two weeks after his arrest, saying other defendants accused of massive frauds like Bernard Madoff and Sam Bankman-Fried were freed on bail.The lawyers submitted papers in Manhattan federal court, saying Guo Wengui is entitled to bail just as other wealthy defendants have been given the chance to post bail in the past. They also challenged claims by prosecutors that he is a risk to flee, saying he would not leave his wife of 38 years and his daughter as all three seek asylum.Madoff was free for several months in late 2008 and early 2009 before he was jailed after he pleaded guilty in a multibillion-dollar fraud. He was later sentenced to 150 years in prison and died behind bars.Bankman-Fried, 31, was arrested in the Bahamas in December in what a prosecutor called one of biggest frauds in American history. He agreed to return to the United States, where he was freed with GPS monitoring on a $250 million personal recognizance bond after pleading not guilty to charges that he oversaw a massive cryptocurrency fraud.Guo's lawyers proposed a $25 million bail package, including $5 million in cash or property, along with location monitoring and home detention at a Connecticut residence where his wife resides. They also said Guo would be subjected to 24-hour surveillance by a security company with at least one guard on the premises at all times.A spokesperson for prosecutors declined comment Friday.Prosecutors filed a detention letter at the time of Guo's arrest, saying he was a serious flight risk and a danger to the public because his crimes, which they said resulted in robbing thousands of individuals of money, were “ongoing and continually evolving.” They said he was likely to flee because of his wealth, strong proof of guilt and ties abroad.Guo, 54, was arrested on various charges, including wire, securities and bank fraud on March 15 in what was described as a $1 billion fraud. He agreed to be detained at the time, but a lawyer indicated bail would later be sought.Guo's lawyers wrote that since immigrating to the United States in 2015, Guo traveled abroad only three times and not once since 2017. They said Chinese authorities would cause him to “face intolerable risks to his life” were he to leave the United States. They also wrote that he was not a danger to others, especially with strict bail conditions.Prosecutors said the charges stemmed from a complex scheme in which Guo and others lied to hundreds of thousands of online followers before misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars.At the time of Guo's arrest, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Guo had lived lavishly off the proceeds of his crimes, including by purchasing a 50,000-square-foot mansion, a $3.5 million Ferrari, two $36,000 mattresses and a $37 million luxury yacht.Guo was once believed to be among the richest people in China. He left in 2014 during an anti-corruption crackdown led by President Xi Jinping that ensnared people close to Guo, including a top intelligence official. Chinese authorities have accused Guo of rape, kidnapping, bribery and other offenses.Guo has long argued that the allegations against him in China were false, saying they were intended to punish him for publicly outing corruption there and criticizing leading figures in the Communist Party.It was on Guo’s 150-foot (45-meter) yacht that Bannon was once arrested on federal charges. Just before he left office, then-President Donald Trump made the case against Bannon dissolve with a pardon.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852901,Israeli police fatally shoot man at Jerusalem's holiest site,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli police shot and killed a man who they alleged tried to snatch an officer’s gun at an entrance to a Jerusalem holy site early Saturday, raising fears of further violence during a time of heightened tensions at the flashpoint compound.Later Saturday, the Israeli military said a Palestinian driver rammed his vehicle into a group of Israelis in the occupied West Bank. Israeli medics said three people were wounded, two seriously, and the alleged attacker was shot dead.In Jerusalem's police shooting, Palestinian worshippers at the entrance to the site on Saturday morning had a different account, saying that police shot the man at least 10 times after he tried to prevent them from harassing a woman who was on her way to the holy compound, home to Al-Aqsa Mosque in the heart of Jerusalem’s Old City — the third holiest shrine in Islam. The compound, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, is also the most sacred site in Judaism.The police said the slain man was 26-year-old Mohammed Alasibi from Hura, a Bedouin Arab village in southern Israel. The village council called for a thorough investigation of his killing and a general strike Saturday in protest.Hours after the incident, the muddy stone alleyway leading to Al-Aqsa Mosque was still stained with blood. Alasibi's family said he was a physician who had recently passed his exams and earned his M.D. in Romania. He returned to his hometown a month ago, his cousin said, and was caring for his sick father as he worked to get certified in Israel.“He is a polite, kind man from a family of doctors who was going to Al-Aqsa for spiritual reasons,” his cousin Fahad Alasibi said. “If you want us to believe that he tried to attack police, then show us the security footage.”A police spokesperson pushed back on Palestinian accounts, insisting there was no woman walking to the compound at midnight because the complex was closed to visitors under an agreement with an Islamic trust called the Waqf controlled by Jordan.Nonetheless, a few dozen people have been trying to sleep at the mosque overnight during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, prompting Israeli police to intervene and try to evict the worshippers.The police spokesperson said Alasibi first aroused suspicion walking toward the shuttered compound. After being stopped for questioning, the spokesperson said Alasibi jumped on one of the officers and grabbed his gun, managing to fire two bullets toward policemen as the officer struggled to restrain him. Police described the incident as an attempted terrorist attack and said they shot and killed him in self-defense. No officers were injured. The spokesperson said there was no camera on the inner wall of the compound that could have captured the incident.Palestinian worshippers at the compound Saturday disagreed. Noureddine, a 17-year-old who lived in the neighborhood and declined to give his last name for fear of reprisals, said he saw Alasibi confront police who had stopped a female worshipper on her way to Al-Aqsa Mosque. Alasibi’s relationship to the woman was not clear. He said some kind of disagreement broke out between Alasibi and the officers before he heard a dozen shots ring out.“Nothing could justify that many shots,” he said, pointing to chaotic footage he filmed that showed Palestinian vendors and worshippers screaming at the sound of bullets being fired in rapid succession. “They were fired at close range.”His cousin Fahad said Alasibi was worried about making the trip from Israel's Negev desert to Al-Aqsa because his ailing father relied on him. “But he went because praying there during Ramadan means a lot to him,"" he said.The city's contested compound has been a focus for clashes in the past, particularly in times of turmoil in Israel and the West Bank. This year, as violence surges in the occupied territory under the most right-wing government in Israeli history, fears of an escalation in Jerusalem have mounted with the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Israeli police have boosted their forces as tens of thousands of Muslim worshippers flock to Al-Aqsa Mosque for prayers.On Friday, more than 200,000 Palestinians gathered at the compound for noon prayers, which passed peacefully.Noureddine said police forced Palestinian vendors and worshippers out of the area after the incident, beating him and others with batons. Israeli police briefly closed the site before reopening it for dawn prayers.Confrontations at the hilltop compound have triggered wider violence in the region in the past. Clashes at the site in May 2021 helped fuel the outbreak of a bloody 11-day war between Israel and Gaza Strip's Hamas rulers.This year's convergence of Ramadan with the Jewish holiday of Passover could increase the possibility of friction as the Old City hosts a massive influx of pilgrims.For the past year, Israeli-Palestinian fighting has surged in the occupied West Bank. At least 86 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli or settler gunfire this year, according to an Associated Press tally. Palestinian attacks against Israelis have killed 15 people in the same period. Israel says most of those killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting police incursions and people not involved in the confrontations have also been killed.",2023/04/02,,World

A New York judge in a document unsealed on Friday authorized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, to make the charges public, but it was not clear when he would do so.Trump plans to fly to New York on Monday from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and spend the night at Trump Tower before appearing in court early on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump plans to return to Florida afterward, the source said.Susan Necheles, a Trump attorney, told Reuters he will plead not guilty. Necheles said she did not expect the charges to be unsealed until Tuesday.""I am not afraid of what's to come,"" Trump said in a fundraising email on Friday.For nearly two weeks, Trump has been using the various legal troubles he faces to rally supporters and raise money as he seeks his party's nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden next year in a rematch of the 2020 election. His campaign said Trump raised more than $4 million in the 24 hours following the news of his indictment by a Manhattan grand jury.The first American president to try to overthrow an election defeat, inspiring the deadly 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol, has signaled he will continue to run despite the charges.Biden on Friday kept his thoughts on the charges against his political rival to himself, telling reporters: ""I'm not going to talk about Trump's indictment.""After word surfaced on Thursday about the indictment, Trump called himself ""completely innocent"" and a victim of political persecution.On Friday, Trump lashed out at Justice Juan Merchan, the judge expected to oversee the case. Trump wrote on social media that Merchan, who also presided over last year's trial in which his real estate company was convicted of tax fraud, ""HATES ME"" and treated the Trump Organization ""VICIOUSLY."" Trump was not charged in that case, which also was handled by Bragg's office.The specific charges in the new indictment are not yet known, though CNN reported that Trump faced more than 30 counts related to business fraud and the Associated Press reported the former president faced at least one felony charge.Another Trump lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said Trump will not have to wear handcuffs at his court appearance and will likely be released without having to post bail.""He's ready to fight. He's gearing up,"" Tacopina said in a phone interview.Any potential trial is still at least more than a year away, legal experts said, meaning it could occur during or after the presidential campaign.PARTISAN BRAWLTrump, 76, has accused Bragg of trying to damage his electoral chances. Trump's claims have been echoed by many of his fellow Republicans and his potential rivals in the race for the party's presidential nomination.Mike Pence, Trump's former vice president and a possible 2024 candidate, said the charges send a ""terrible message"" to the world about U.S. justice.""I'm very troubled by it,"" Pence said at a forum in Washington.Ahead of the indictment, the grand jury heard evidence about a $130,000 payment to Daniels in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels has said she was paid to keep silent about a sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006.""It's vindication,"" Daniels told the Times of London. ""He's done so much worse that he should have been taken down (for) before.""Senior House of Representatives Republicans have vowed to investigate Bragg and demanded he hand over documents and other confidential material from the investigation. Bragg said Congress does not have authority to interfere with a New York legal proceeding and accused the lawmakers of escalating political tensions. Bragg's office has been the target of bomb threats in recent weeks.""You and many of your colleagues have chosen to collaborate with Mr. Trump's efforts to vilify and denigrate the integrity of elected state prosecutors and trial judges,"" Bragg wrote in a letter to Republican lawmakers.Aside from this case, Trump faces two federal criminal investigations into his efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and his handling of classified documents after leaving office.Trump also faces a separate Georgia investigation into his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss in that state.Officials have stepped up security around the courthouse in New York since Trump on March 18 called on his supporters to protest any arrest. A law enforcement source said police would close streets around the courthouse ahead of Tuesday's expected appearance.On Friday, media outlets were set up outside the courthouse but there was no sign of unrest or protests related to the case.Trump appealed this month for nationwide protests, recalling his charged rhetoric ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack, and warned last week of potential ""death & destruction"" if he were charged.Outside Mar-a-Lago, about a dozen people waved Trump flags and cheered as cars passed by.Sonja Simpson, 62, said the payment to Daniels was not a public concern.""If there were a thing, that's between him, that woman and his wife. Period. Let them work it out,"" Simpson said.Merchandise vendor Ronald Solomon said sales of Trump-themed hats and t-shirts were up sharply after the charges were announced.Some 44% of Republicans said Trump should drop out of the race if he is indicted, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week.The former president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen has said he coordinated with Trump on the payments to Daniels and to a second woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump has denied having had sexual relationships with either woman, but has acknowledged reimbursing Cohen.Cohen pleaded guilty to a campaign-finance violation in 2018 and served more than a year in prison. Federal prosecutors said he acted at Trump's direction.",2023/04/01,,World

""The more the international community pays attention to Taiwan, the more upset they get.""Speaking to reporters in Taipei earlier on Friday, Premier Chen Chien-jen said Taiwan was a ""democratic country"" with the right to go out into the world.""I hope that China will not find pretext to provoke,"" he said, when asked about Beijing's retaliation threat.""China's authoritarian expansion will in fact cause unnecessary trouble, so we here again make this call, hoping that China can reduce its provocative actions.""China has never officially recognised the median line, which a U.S. general devised in 1954 at the height of Cold War hostility, although the People's Liberation Army had until very recently largely respected it.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard, Yimou Lee, Michael Martina, Patricia Zengerle and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel and Sandra Maler)",2023/04/01,743,Politics

Seattle had an open spot on its 40-man roster and assigned Solak to Triple-A Tacoma.Before this season, the 28-year-old Solak spent his entire big league career with Texas. He appeared in 253 games over parts of the past four seasons with the Rangers. Solak’s most productive season came in 2021 when he appeared in 127 games and hit .242 with 11 home runs and 49 RBIs. Solak spent almost all of that season at second base but also played left field, center field and third base in his time with the Rangers.Solak was a second-round pick by the New York Yankees in the 2016 amateur draft.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852919,Mississippi closer to more state police in mostly Black city,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Tensions erupted Friday as the majority-white and Republican-controlled Mississippi House passed the final version of a bill to expand the territory of a state-run police department inside the capital city of Jackson, which is majority-Black and governed by Democrats.Supporters say the proposal is intended to increase safety in the city of nearly 150,000 residents, which has had more than 100 homicides each of the past three years.Opponents say the plan, which also would create a new court with an appointed judge, would stomp on local governance and create unequal systems of justice. About 83% of Jackson residents are Black — the largest percentage of Black residents of any major U.S. city.Officers from the state-run Capitol Police have been patrolling around state government buildings in and near downtown, while the Jackson Police Department patrols the entire city. Critics say Capitol Police are aggressive and expanding the territory could endanger lives.During the House debate Friday, Democratic Rep. Zakiya Summers said many Black parents already talk to their children about being careful around police. She said her biggest fear is that her three sons — Marvin, Mason and Mathis — will be treated with hostility.“While they’re traveling around the city of Jackson and they get pulled over, they’re going to have to keep their hands on 10 and 2. They’re not going to be able to say a doggone thing to that police officer,” Summers said. “The only thing that they’re going to have to do is pray and hope that they can make it back home safely.”Since the bill was filed in January, critics have compared the proposal to past efforts to suppress Black people's rights in Mississippi.“Mississippi has always been first in racism,” Democratic Rep. Solomon Osborne of Greenwood said Friday.The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Trey Lamar, who is white, has said repeatedly that race is not a factor in his proposal. He said he's trying to help Jackson become more welcoming for residents and visitors.“You talk about being offended. I’m offended, as well,"" Lamar said Friday after listening to several lawmakers denounce the bill. ""If I have to stand here and listen to being called a racist because I’m trying to do the right thing, we’re going to talk about the color that matters — and that’s the red that flows in my veins and yours alike.”The bill passed the majority-white and Republican-controlled House on a 72-41 vote. The support came from Republicans and two independents. The opposition came from Democrats and three Republicans.Senators had passed the final version of the bill on Thursday, with 31 Republicans voting yes and 15 Democrats voting no.Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has not said whether he will sign the measure into law, but he has often said Jackson has a crime problem.The proposal for state control has angered Jackson residents who don’t want their voices diminished in local government, and it is the latest example of the long-running tensions between the Republican-run state government and the Democratic-run capital city.The plan would create a temporary court within a Capitol Complex Improvement District inside a portion of Jackson. The judge would not be required to live in Jackson and would be appointed by the Mississippi Supreme Court chief justice. The current chief justice is a conservative white man. The court would have the same power as municipal courts, which handle misdemeanor cases, traffic violations and initial appearances for some criminal charges.Most municipal judges are appointed by city officials. Jackson has a Black mayor and majority-Black city council. An earlier version of the bill would have created a court with broader powers similar to courts with elected judges.",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852921,Judge pauses horse racing anti-doping rules for 30 days,"Horse racing’s new anti-doping program was dealt a blow Friday when a judge in Texas ordered the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority to stop enforcing its rules involving medications and illegal drugs until May 1.Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a 30-day injunction in response to a request for an emergency injunction by the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association and the state of Texas.The two groups filed their request Monday, the same day HISA began enforcing its new anti-doping and medication rules in states where live racing is currently going on.In the filing, the plaintiffs had asked Hendrix to rule in an expedited manner on the request, noting that the Florida Derby and Arkansas Derby — major preps for the Kentucky Derby — are to be run Saturday.""The plaintiffs have shown a serious risk of harm — potential physical injury to racehorses, potential disqualification from Triple Crown prep races, and the burden of coming into compliance with a new anti-doping regulatory scheme without the legally required delayed effective date,” Hendrix wrote.The plaintiffs argued that typically there's a 30-day waiting period before implementing new rules. Hendrix wrote that those procedures should have applied to HISA's enforcement.Lisa Lazarus, CEO of HISA, said the group would accept the judge's ruling and not appeal it, according to the Daily Racing Form.As a result, the affected states will resume responsibility for their respective anti-doping programs.HISA has faced resistance from various factions in horse racing since it was created by federal legislation in 2020 to be the sport's first national regulator. Previously, the 38 U.S. racing states have operated under their own patchwork set of rules.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852922,Taiwan’s MemeDiarya and its AI set to ‘evolutionize life and social media’,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese startup MemeDiarya promises to “evolutionize the way people capture and share their memories and emotions.”The company revealed early Saturday (April 1) at a small press gathering in Starbucks Taipei 101 that it has developed an embedded chip that gathers data from sources that include file metadata, internal sensors, AI scraping, and social media feeds, to create a rich, novel ""3D"" experience called a ""memery.""The app generates curated, filtered, and mixed MPEG-4 videos, JPEG pictures, and 3D reels by utilizing various multimedia platforms and biodata tools such as an internal accelerometer, heart rate sensor, GPS, pedometer, gyroscopes, ECG leads, and calorie counter.The AI compresses all the data collected from these sources and creates a single ""memery"" file (mFile or mF) that can be accessed and shared through the company's proprietary software. The result is a diary entry unlike any other, offering a unique 3D picture of your day.The memery file can be downloaded, streamed, and viewed on most devices with a screen. Once logged in, users can access a virtual space or metaverse where they and other players can interact and communicate through a ""universe of communication possibilities.""(Image Creator photo)The main drawback of MemeDiarya's technology is the requirement for a subcutaneously implanted microchip measuring 13 x 2 mm in the posterior-hip area of the body.Despite this, the procedure is relatively painless and can be completed in just five minutes at a skin clinic without the need for an anesthetic. The chip is injected into the glutes and can be easily recovered as it uses passive RFID technology, and there is little to no scarring.Major corporations, both national and international, have expressed interest in the potentially lucrative AI market that exploded after ChatGPT's release in November of last year. While some predict that deep-pocketed companies will acquire the Taiwan startup, others believe that MemeDiarya's two brother co-founders will retain control of their majority-owned company and go on to monopolize the market.The brothers, Alpha and Jet Lin, stated in a press release that they combined ""memories"" and ""journal entry"" to create the company name ""MemeDiarya, which represents the new wealth of the mind.”They have previously been quoted as saying their technology will “evolutionize life and social media, and the way people share their emotions. Most significantly for us, it adds a whole new level of social media and metaverse retail space, with us being the architects.”Many online commentators, some of whom have trialed the products, said MemeDiarya technology looks poised to revolutionize the military, medical, government, entertainment, and adult entertainment spaces, with potentially limitless applications on Web 3.0 – whenever it arrives.The app has two modes, passive and active, to ensure what it calls “complete user control” over data collection. MemeDiarya said it prioritizes privacy and security and claims to utilize triple encryption plus industry-leading standards for data handling.The chip and multilingual app are set to launch later this year in Taiwan before international distribution. Although there have been concerns about invasive procedures, privacy, and identity, the company is said to have secured enough private venture funding from China to continue independently.However, there are sensitive questions to be faced at some point about potential control of such a dominant communications space, and the ethics of bionics. Also, there has been a political backlash against the involvement of Chinese venture capital funding in the AI/social media/virtual reality space.Despite these drawbacks, MemeDiarya's potential to change the way people communicate their thoughts and emotions cannot be ignored. The technology's ability to collect data from multiple sources and compile it into a rich virtual experience is sure to attract interest from big business and governments because early findings are, the experience is rated very positively by consumers — far above real-life and online interactions.“Like eating candy with a baby,” said financier and crypto writer Tim D’Altonesque from French magazine Fugue. He believes MemeDiarya's 3D technology is a game-changer that will “alter everything forever”:“For reasons of national security and out of commercial interest, a level of interest in mFs is inevitable. Whether it’s just another tech flash point, or a real revolution in virtual reality, social media, and DeFi is beside the point,“ the investor said. “It’s real, I’m in, and betting with the smart money.”(Image Creator photo)",2023/04/01,644,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852935,"Mulkey, LSU women rally in Final Four, reach 1st title game","DALLAS (AP) — Kim Mulkey is back in another national championship game, this time taking the flagship university from her home state there for the first time.It took LSU only two seasons to get there with the feisty and flamboyantly dressed coach, and a big comeback in the national semifinal game that was quite an undercard Friday night.Alexis Morris scored 27 points and had two of her misses in the fourth quarter turned into putback baskets by Angel Reese in a big run as LSU rallied to beat top-seeded Virginia Tech 79-72 in the first semifinal game.“I’m never satisfied. I’m super-excited that we won, but I’m hungry,"" said Morris, who jumped on a courtside table and fired up LSU fans after the game. “Like, I’m greedy. I want to win it all so I can complete the story.”Reese finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds for LSU (33-2), which will play in the national title game Sunday against fellow AP All-American Caitlin Clark and Iowa (31-6), which beat previously undefeated South Carolina 77-73 in their highly anticipated matchup and prevented an all-Southeastern Conference final.“It’s like a dream. It still hasn’t hit me that I’m at the Final Four,” said Reese, the transfer from Maryland who carries the nickname, ”Bayou Barbie."" “I’m just not even believing this right now. It’s crazy how much my life has changed in one year.”Mulkey — in a carnation pink top this time — won three national titles in four Final Four appearances over her 21 seasons at Baylor. She is only the second coach to take two different teams to the national championship game. The other is C. Vivian Stringer, who did it with Cheyney in the inaugural 1982 women’s tournament and Rutgers in 2007.“I came home for lots of reasons,” Mulkey said. “One, to some day hang a championship banner in the PMAC (Pete Maravich Assembly Center). Never, ever do you think you’re going to do something like this in two years.”LSU made five national semifinal games in a row from 2004-08 — the only times the Tigers had made it this far. They lost each of those years.The Tigers had to dig deep for this one, with neither team backing down.Trailing 59-50 after three quarters, LSU went ahead with a 15-0 run over a five-minute span. The Tigers led for the first time since late in the first half when Falu'jae Johnson had a steal and drove for a layup to make it 64-62.Reese had six points in that game-turning spurt, including a basket after Morris' attempted 3-pointer clanked off the front rim. Reese had a second-effort follow of her own miss after rebounding another shot by Morris.Elizabeth Kitley, the 6-foot-6 senior, had 18 points and 12 rebounds for Virginia Tech (31-5), the Atlantic Coast Conference champion that was in the Final Four for the first time. Georgia Amoore and Kayana Traylor each had 17 points, while Cayla King had 14.Amoore set a record for the most 3-pointers in a single NCAA Tournament with 24, though she had a tough night shooting — 4 of 17 overall, including 4 of 15 from beyond the arc. She passed Kia Nurse’s record 22 set in the 2017 tourney for UConn, which lost in the national semifinals on the same court. Arizona’s Aari McDonald had 22 in six NCAA tourney games two years ago.The big run for LSU came right after Amoore made her last 3-pointer with 7:52 left for a 62-57 lead. The Hokies didn't make another basket until King's 3 with 1:19 left.“I think we had a few crucial turnovers as well as missed box-outs where they scored on second-chance opportunities,"" Traylor said. ""I think that’s just what it came down to really.”Morris had opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer for LSU, then had a driving layup before Reese had a layup after a steal by Johnson. That quick 7-0 run prompted a timeout by Hokies coach Kenny Brooks.“They hit a couple of shots, gave them a little bit of momentum. They hit a 3 right off the bat … kind of changed the momentum,” Brooks said. “They were aggressive in the passing lanes. But they also were a little bit more aggressive down low.”Virginia Tech had ended the first half with its own 11-0 run to lead for the first time, at 34-32 on Traylor’s driving layup with 53 seconds left.But it was the Tigers who led for 17:55 of the first half with the Hokies getting off to a slow start shooting — they missed eight of their first nine shots — that an LSU cheerleader had an assist even before they officially had a shot.King was charged with a turnover on a ball that hit the rim and bounced over the top of the backboard and got stuck there. With encouragement from officials and others at that end, a male cheerleader lifted up a female cheerleader, who knocked the ball down.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World

However, Chicago's win combined with the Orlando Magic's 116-109 victory over Washington on Friday night leaves the Bulls three games head of the Wizards for the 10th spot in the East with five games remaining.DeRozan said it's vital the Bulls use this closing stretch to elevate their play if they want to make a postseason run.“We've got to, just for that confidence, that feel, that rhythm and understanding how we need to play,” DeRozan said. “We needed to take these last five games and make sure we are playing great basketball.”James Bouknight had 22 points behind six 3-pointers to lead the Hornets. They had their three-game winning snapped and lost yet another key player to injury.Charlotte’s P.J. Washington, who scored a career-high 43 points Tuesday night in a 137-134 win over Oklahoma City, left in the second quarter with a sprained foot and did not return.“I thought he was off to a good start again,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. “It’s part of it. It’s part of the game.”It's unclear if Washington will miss the remainder of the season, but there's no logical reason for the Hornets to rush him back given they've already been eliminated from playoff contention.It's the latest in a long line of injuries for the Hornets, who played without LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Kelly Oubre Jr., Cody Martin and Dennis Smith Jr. Washington was the only opening day starter who suited up for the Hornets against the Bulls.The Hornets were so thin at one point they had a lineup on the floor that included five players who've spent time with their G League club, the Greensboro Swarm.Chicago jumped out to a 19-5 lead midway through the first quarter, with six Hornets turnovers leading to 10 points. The Bulls, who never trailed, pushed the lead to 16 at the half behind a series of LaVine drives and DeRozan mid-range jumpers.Chicago increased its lead to 28 with about five minutes remaining when four passes led to an open 3 from LaVine. A short while later Billy Donovan emptied his bench.The Bulls had 25 assists.“When we are moving the ball and making good decisions and sharing it and collectively all covering and helping each other defensively it is when we are at our best,” Donovan said.DRUMMOND RETURNSAndre Drummond returned to action after missing the last game due to personal reasons and had six points and 11 rebounds.“For him to come back and be able to do what he did and try to block whatever it is he's dealing with out and focus on basketball, maybe in some way it was a relief for him just to get on the floor,” Donovan said. “I think it speaks to his commitment to the team and to the guys that he wanted to be out there.”TIP INSBulls: Scored 29 points off 22 Charlotte turnovers.Hornets: Svi Mykhailiuk was the only Hornets starter to finish in double figures, scoring 16 points. ...

The 43-year-old spent last season as the St. Louis bench coach.“I know it goes on my record, but they won that game,” Schumaker said. ""Players win games, and I’m just glad to be a part of it.”Luzardo (1-0) struck out five and allowed two hits while walking four in his first start this season. The 25-year-old left-hander had a 3.32 ERA with a 30% strikeout rate in 100 1/3 innings last season.“The next step is being consistent,” Luzardo said. ""I feel towards the end of last year I was able to do that. Just come out and no matter who we’re facing, no matter the situation, I feel it has to be 100% on the attack.”Soler, in his first game in right field for the Marlins, made a leaping grab against the wall on Pete Alonso’s sharp fly ball to right center in the second. He followed with a leadoff shot in the bottom half off David Peterson (0-1).“It was a great play out in the outfield and I took that feeling back to the plate,"" said Soler, the designated hitter in the opener. “The pitcher was throwing fastballs, and I had to be aggressive. If he threw one down the middle, I was going to go for it.”Soler also ran in for a diving catch that robbed Starling Marte for the final out in the eighth. That stranded Daniel Vogelbach, who had pinch hit and doubled off Dylan Floro.Chisholm doubled the lead with an eighth-inning homer off John Curtiss, who made his Mets debut. That proved to be key when Alonso homered in the ninth off A.J. Puk for his first hit this season.Puk then struck out Mark Canha and got Jeff McNeil to ground out for the save, ending a game that took 2 hours, 9 minutes.New York, which had won Thursday's opener, loaded the bases in the sixth after Brandon Nimmo walked and took third on a single by Marte, who then stole second, Francisco Lindor walked, and reliever JT Chargois retired Alonso on a lineout to Chisholm in center.Marte had two of New York’s four hits. Peterson gave up eight hits, struck out five and walked one in five innings.“I like the fact that he only had one walk,” Mets manager Buck Showalter said. “That's probably why he was able to survive.”Garrett Cooper singled twice and had a triple in the first. Miami went 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position.Miami's Nick Fortes was called for a pitch clock violation when he wasn't ready in time to face Tommy Hunter with two outs in the sixth. Fortes swung and missed at the next pitch, falling into an 0-2 count, then grounded out.EURO STEPChisholm, known for his flashy celebrations, Euro-stepped to home plate for the first time this season after his homer. He had 14 home runs last season.THROWBACK UNISThe Marlins debuted the teal uniforms that they will wear on Fridays this season to commemorate the club's 30th anniversary.WEB GEMMcNeil made an alert play in the fifth when Cooper's sharp two-out grounder deflected off Alonso's glove. McNeil grabbed the ball with a dive on the right field grass, popped up and made a one-hop throw to the plate, where Tomás Nido tagged a sliding Jon Berti, who had tried to score from second.“That was a sick play,” Alonso said. “I mean, the ball tips off my glove.

And if Harden hurt after another double-double, he wasn't letting on.“I feel good,” Harden said.Asked how he managed the ups and downs of the often-painful injury, Harden simply said again, “I feel good.”Good might be good enough for the Sixers.Joel Embiid had 25 points and 12 rebounds, Harden had 23 points and 11 assists and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Toronto Raptors 117-110 on Friday night.The Sixers made 30 of 39 shots (77%) in the first half and raced to a 24-point lead that nearly evaporated. Fred VanVleet, who scored 16 points, buried a 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter that pulled the Raptors to 103-101 and silenced the sellout crowd.Embiid, though, steadied the 76ers with a jumper and PJ Tucker buried a 3 that gave them some breathing room. Harden drove to the hoop for a bucket and a 110-101 edge that forced the Raptors to call timeout.The Raptors didn't have another run in them. Scottie Barnes scored 29 points and OG Anunoby had 19.Harden and Embiid combined to make 12 of 16 shots and Harden made all three 3-pointers in the first half. Embiid and Harden showed no ill effects of injuries that hampered them of late.Embiid is playing through a nagging right calf injury that cost him a game — and maybe some MVP votes — Monday at Denver. He said the injury is “good enough” and is trying to survive the remaining games without incident. With Embiid, though, there’s always a small scare for the 76ers. The NBA scoring leader stepped on Anunoby’s foot in the first half and was briefly on his back. He gingerly got up and missed a free throw.“He looked normal tonight,” coach Doc Rivers said. “He didn't look like he had any problems and let's just hope that continues.”Harden has been dealing with a sore left Achilles for the last few months. The 33-year-old Harden said the pain has spiked at times during games. Rivers said Harden's injury has “been managed but it’s always a concern.”The Sixers hit the 50-win mark this season in the fewest amount of games since 2001. The 76ers reached the NBA Finals that season and improbably haven't gone past the second round since. They've lost in the second round each of the last two seasons but remain contenders to at least win the Eastern Conference. That is, if Embiid and Harden are healthy.“They're playing more solid,” coach Nick Nurse said. “I think they know what really each one of them is going to do. They just kind of have a very similar output. It just didn't seem that solidified last year. But it does now.”Philadelphia's best shot at a deep postseason run since Embiid was drafted in 2014 came in 2019 when they lost the East semis in seven games to the Raptors. Under Nurse, the Raptors won the NBA championship that season. Now, Nurse admits he'll need time in the offseason to “ reflect ” on his coaching future, even if it's not in Toronto.The Raptors play hard under Nurse and whittled the first-half deficit to three in the fourth quarter. But they fell to 38-39 and are in ninth place in the Eastern Conference. They would need to get to sixth place over the final six games to avoid the play-in tournament.TIP-INSRaptors: Missed 12 of 14 3s in the first half. ...

Orlando remained four games behind the Bulls, who routed Charlotte 121-91.Banchero, the No. 1 pick in last year's draft out of Duke, is the clear favorite to win Rookie of the Year, and Fultz gave him an endorsement.“I think you just see it, playing both ends of the floor, being able to create, being confident and poised,"" Fultz said.

Peterka and Jordan Greenway also scored for the Sabres, who recovered after giving up a 2-0 lead to improve to 3-0-1 in their last four games. Devon Levi made 32 saves in his NHL debut to help Buffalo pull five points behind Pittsburgh for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference.“I thought our guys would work hard to support (Levi) with it being his first night,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “I thought they did a nice job with that, allowing him to get into the game and into a feel of things. He was very good.”Kaapo Kakko and Adam Fox scored for New York, which has lost two straight but pulled three points behind second-place New Jersey in the Metropolitan Division. Jaroslav Halak made 31 saves.“We were fortunate to get a couple of goals, but we didn’t play well,” Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said. “We had one line show up tonight and play hard every shift. That was it and we were fortunate to get a point.”In the extra period, Skinner gathered the puck after a pass from Owen Power, skated between a pair of defenders and fired a shot past Halak. It was Skinner's 32nd goal of the season.“They got a little bit of a stick on (the puck), I tried to stick with it,” Skinner said. “It was kind of rolling so I just tried to get some good wood on it, and fortunately it found the hole there.”Levi, who played at Northeastern University the past two seasons, signed a three-year entry-level contract on March 17.“It was a dream come true, I’ve dreamt of that moment my whole life,” Levi said. “To have my family and friends here as well who have been dreaming for this moment also their whole lives with me, it’s just incredible to have that support.”Peterka gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead with 8:40 left in the first period when he buried a no-look backhand pass from Dylan Cozens for his 11th.Greenway made it 2-0 at 7:39 of the second when he took a pass from Casey Mittelstadt up the right side and one-handed a shot past Halak for his fourth.Kakko got the Rangers on the scoreboard when he batted a floating puck past Levi after Filip Chytil's shot was blocked wotj 7:43 remaining in the middle period.Fox tied it 2-2 when he poked a loose puck during a net-mouth scrum past Levi at 9:45 of the third for his 12th.“We kind of get into the flow of the game and then we start playing but it’s not going to work,” Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said. “That’s not a sustainable way to play hockey.

Brooklyn moved two games ahead of idle Miami for the No. 6 spot with five games to play.Bridges surpassed 40 points for the second time in three games and the third time since coming to the Nets in February. He finished March with 461 points, the second-highest total by a Nets player in their NBA franchise history in a month behind the 471 scored by Durant last November.Cam Johnson, also part of the Durant trade, had 16 points. The Nets won for the third time in four games following a five-game skid that had dropped them behind the Heat into seventh place. The teams who finish between 7-10 have to go through the play-in tournament to reach the postseason.“Even though we were losing, we felt like we were coming together as a team,” Finney-Smith said. “We haven’t been in that many battles together, but we’re still learning each and other and we’re figuring it out.”The Hawks remained tied for the No. 8 spot with Toronto. Atlanta could have pulled within a game of Miami.But the Hawks never gave themselves a chance after going just 8 for 37 from 3-point range and getting outscored 76-46 in the middle two quarters after leading by eight after one.Dejounte Murray scored 21 points for the Hawks, who had a tough time with New York traffic and perhaps left their legs on the bus. Trae Young had 10 points and six assists, going 3 for 12 and missing all five 3-pointers.Bridges' three-point play with 8:45 left in the third quarter gave Brooklyn a 69-58 lead, the first double-digit advantage by either team. The Nets had doubled that lead about 4 1/2 minutes later when another basket by Bridges made it 91-71.Bridges finished off the quarter by scoring the final seven points as the lead ballooned by 22. He finished 16 for 24 from the field, 5 for 8 on 3-pointers.“He’s been efficient forever. He’s made those 3s, he’s just more aggressive right now because he has to be and it’s a credit to him,” said Hawks coach Quin Snyder, who went against Bridges often when he coached Utah.The Hawks led 33-25 after one, then missed all nine 3-point attempts and shot 29% overall in the second quarter.

An influx of music fans led municipal officials to work overtime to transport large crowds to the venues, per UDN.According to KaohsiungTransportation Bureau, 43,000 traveled to the Kaohsiung National Stadium while 12,000 traveled to Kaohsiung Arena. Officials said all concertgoers were able to leave the two venues within 70 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively.On Friday, the Kaohsiung MRT ran on three-minute intervals, with the daily passenger volume reaching 226,000. Additionally, some 6,813 people were transported by shuttle bus to and from HSR Zuoying Station and Kaohsiung Station.On the roads, traffic was equally bad as Friday, the start of the Tomb Sweeping Holiday, putting more cars on expressways and in downtown areas. Kaohsuing Mayor Chen Chi-mai (陳其邁) visited MRT stations adjacent to the two music venues to monitor traffic conditions.Only one incident was reported when a 29-year old Mayday fan surnamed Wu (吳) collapsed to the ground while leaving the venue at 11:05 p.m. Friday. An off duty nurse passing by used a public AED device to revive the individual before the patient was transported to the hospital. She is recovering while under medical supervision, per UDN.Despite managing large crowds yesterday, municipal officials will face an even bigger test Saturday as both Mayday and A-mei continue their multi-day performances.

""He’s so mentally tough. He’s nicked up a little bit, but he’s a machine. He just keeps going.”Brunson credited his teammates and coaches for his big night, which included seven 3-pointers and nine assists. He finished 18 of 32 from the floor.“They had confidence in me and the ball just went through the hole,” said Brunson, who scored 44 in a loss to Milwaukee on Jan. 9. “I just kept shooting with confidence and that's just how it went.”The Knicks reduced their magic number to one in their first game without Randle, who sprained his left ankle Wednesday and will miss the rest of the regular season. New York hopes he'll be back for the postseason and a potential first-round matchup against the Cavs.New York won the season series 3-1 and denied Cleveland a chance to lock up home-court advantage in the first round.“This loss hurts,” said Donovan Mitchell, who led Cleveland with 42 points. “We need to feel it and be ready to use it when the time comes. Obviously, we control our destiny and we’ll probably see these guys in two weeks.""There is a lot of film to go through. But if we let this affect us, we have no chance in the playoffs.”Leading by three, the Knicks outscored the Cavs 14-2 to open the fourth and get some breathing room in a game played at a frenetic pace. The teams combined for 89 points in the first quarter and 151 in the first half.The Cavs got within 123-116 before Brunson put the Cavs away with a layup following a timeout and then a 3-pointer. He missed a floater in the final seconds that would have given him 50 points.Did he want 50?“Who wouldn't?” he said. “I was going to hold the ball out, but they doubled and I guess that means keep playing. No disrespect to them. They played to the buzzer. I have the most respect in the world for that coaching staff. You got to keep playing.”Brunson, who averages 23.6 points, scored 33 in a wild first half without much defense.The teams combined for 89 points in the first quarter, tying the third most in the first 12 minutes of a game in NBA history. The record of 91 is shared by Utah and Denver (1982), and Miami and Washington (2021).Also, Cleveland's 47 points in the first quarter were the most in the franchise's 53-year history.The Cavs were without two of their top defenders, center Jarrett Allen (groin) and Isaac Okoro (knee).TEMPER TEMPERThe Knicks had a moment of drama.During a timeout in the third quarter, New York starters RJ Barrett and Obi Toppin got into a shouting match and had to be separated.Thibodeau downplayed the conflict.“The cameras are everywhere and it probably happens more than people realize,” Thibodeau said. ""It was the heat of the moment. Sometimes, there is a difference of opinion, but those guys are fine with each other. These things happen.”Later, in the locker, Toppin had his arm around a smiling Barrett.“This is my brother,” Toppin said. “We're good.”RANDLE UPDATEThe Knicks will re-evaluate Randle in two weeks, ahead of the playoffs, which start on April 15 or 16.Thibodeau said the 30-year-old forward, who started the Knicks' first 77 games, is in good spirits and working toward his return.“He's done all he can to prepare himself to play in every game, which is a credit to him. He doesn't miss practice. He doesn't miss games.

The Celtics landed six hours before the game.“We kind of looked at it as a challenge,"" Tatum said. “It was fun figuring it out regardless of how the last 24 hours was. It was rewarding. ... It kind of brought us closer together.” Malcolm Brogdon added 19 points and Derrick White finished with 17. Boston had 17 3-pointers, including five by Tatum.The Celtics (54-24) are 1 1/2 games behind Milwaukee (55-22) and were coming off a 41-point win over the Bucks. Milwaukee is off until Sunday, when it hosts the 76ers. The Celtics have four games remaining.“I trusted our guys,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “I knew we were going to be really competitive. I knew we were going to put ourselves in position to win the game. I could just sense it from our guys.""Talen Horton-Tucker led Utah with 28 points and eight assists. Walker Kessler added 20 points and 10 rebounds.The Jazz (36-41) came in holding the 12th spot in the West and trailing 10th-place Oklahoma City by 1 1/2 games and 11th place Dallas by a half-game. The Mavericks were idle, but the Thunder lost at Indiana.The Celtics took control in the second and third quarters, outscoring the Jazz 66-49.Boston also took advantage of a huge free throw discrepancy for most of the night. The Celtics connected on 21 of 22 attempts, compared to 13 of 14 for the Jazz. But 12 of Utah’s attempts were in the fourth quarter.It was Boston’s players who took issue with the officiating with just over four minutes to play when Blake Griffin and Tatum were whistled for technical fouls 10 seconds apart.A minute after that, Griffin and Kris Dunn got tangled up after a foul by Dunn, leading to a technical on Dunn. Tatum made the subsequent free throw, but Dunn had words for the officials, was assessed a second technical and ejected.“I'm all for the fight, I'm not for fighting,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said. ""Both teams were a little bit chippy.

(AP) — The man named as a person of interest in the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend and her 7-year-old daughter was charged with two counts of murder in their deaths, police in Washington state said Friday.Detectives from the Vancouver Police Department booked Kirkland Warren for two counts of first-degree murder Friday after the Clark County Medical Examiner’s Office determined Meshay Melendez, 27, and her daughter, Layla Stewart, sustained gunshot wounds to their heads, according to a statement.Warren was out on bail pending a long-delayed murder trial in Arkansas. When he was arrested in southwestern Washington early this month on charges that he assaulted Melendez and fired a gunshot into her apartment, he quickly posted bond and was released again.The March 22 discovery of the bodies of the mother and daughter raised questions about why someone facing a murder charge in another state would be released from custody after being arrested in a serious domestic violence offense.Warren was charged with killing an acquaintance in his vehicle in 2017 and leaving the body in a roadside ditch. He told police the passenger was asking him for money and that he shot him because he feared for his safety.His family got him released from custody pending trial by putting up 10% of his $250,000 bond, said his attorney in that case, Mark Hampton. Warren subsequently moved to Washington with the knowledge of his lawyer and prosecutors.Hampton didn't return a phone message seeking comment on the new murder charges Friday. It was unclear if Warren, who was incarcerated in the Clark County Jail, had an attorney for the latest charges.Warren’s March 2 arrest stemmed from a December episode during which police said he assaulted Melendez and then fired a gunshot into her apartment. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.Warren was the last person seen with the mother and daughter before they disappeared, authorities said. A friend told police she had been babysitting Stewart the night of March 11 when Warren arrived to pick her up. Melendez was unresponsive in the car, naked from the waist down.The friend reported Melendez missing March 18. Melendez’s mother also reported her missing, saying the family had not heard from her for a week. The next day, police arrested Warren again. With his bail in Arkansas revoked and his bail in Washington increased to $1 million, he has been in custody since.",2023/04/01,,World

They're even with New Orleans, owning the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Pelicans.“We’ve made some huge climbs, but we’re not finished,” said Davis, who had 38 points Wednesday in tthe win at Chicago. ""We’re hungry to not only make the playoffs but make some noise.""The Lakers improved to 9-4 since losing at home to the Wolves on March 3.“We jumped on AD’s back, and he brought us home,” James said.Mike Conley had 25 points on 7-for-11 shooting with seven assists before fouling out, and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 23 points for the Timberwolves (39-39), who tumbled into ninth place. They entered the evening one game behind Golden State and the cut to avoid the play-in tournament, with the Warriors tipping off later at home against San Antonio.Davis scored 12 straight points for the Lakers over a 3:52 span late in the fourth quarter to seal the steely comeback from a deficit that hit 13 points shortly after halftime. He made five baskets in a row with Wolves center Rudy Gobert on the bench, dominating on the glass, in the post and at the rim.“He’s playing at a super high level right now,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said.The Lakers took charge earlier with a 24-2 spurt over a 6:49 stretch of the third quarter with their defense on lockdown mode. Conley's turn to rest on the bench during that run was ill-timed. Davis rolled his left ankle around the start of the Lakers surge, a breath-holding sequence that only seemed to energize the visitors.“We started to turn the ball over, and the ball started to stick much more,” Gobert said. “We kind of lost our flow offensively, and it really affected our defense.”The Wolves, whose bench was shortened without center Naz Reid and his broken wrist, went 2 for 14 from 3-point range in the third quarter and were outscored 35-18 in a discouraging stretch for a fired-up crowd that included local sports superstars Justin Jefferson and Kirill Kaprizov in floor seats.FEELING BETTERJames has been rebuilding his stamina from the month-long absence to a torn tendon in his right foot, and the second time with this new starting lineup with Davis, Russell, Austin Reaves and Jarred Vanderbilt produced a second win to start this five-game road trip.“I’ll be in the lineup on Sunday, so that’s the best response I can have,” James said.Davis, for his part, said he finished the game on adrenaline and would be fine to play on Sunday, too.WHISTLE STOPGobert ($25,000) and Finch ($15,000) were fined by the NBA for criticizing the officiating Wednesday after their loss at Phoenix when the Suns had 27 free-throw attempts and the Wolves had 12.

Kennard was traded to Memphis on Feb. 9 as part of a three-team deal.The Grizzlies eventually built a 22-point lead early in the fourth quarter following Bane's steal under the Clippers’ basket and a driving layup.Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said the key to the team’s comeback was the ability to make a 7-0 run during the final minutes of the opening quarter.“We got a little spark there,” Jenkins said. “I just started telling the guys we’re starting to feel the pace (better) and the physicality and urgency that we need ... if we hadn’t had that spark at the end of the first quarter to cut it to 13, it may have been a difference outcome.”Norman Powell scored 16 points to lead the Clippers, Ivica Zubac had 15 points and 15 rebounds, and Eric Gordon finished with 13 points.“We knew they were going to make a run, we just didn’t know it was going to be that fast,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “We put ourselves in good position (to win), we just didn’t do a good job finishing the game, taking care of the basketball, taking good shots and getting defensive stops.”Memphis and Los Angeles were playing for the second time in three days in Memphis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852973,"As summer looms, India orders coal power plants to max out","BENGALURU, India (AP) — For the second year in a row, India’s government has ordered the nation’s coal-fired power plants to run at full power. But this year’s order is even more sweeping than last year's — all coal and oil-fired generators will be maxed out for the entire summer, from April through June. Analysts say it will dramatically increase India’s already sky-high greenhouse gas emissions.Seventy miles from Kolkata in India’s West Bengal state, 48-year-old Kakali Halder knows the reason for the order. She and several hundred other seamstresses at Mathurapur Sanghati Swayamber Sangha, a group that make clothing items and share the proceeds between them, have struggled to get orders out when they can’t rely on the electricity.Despite their proximity to the megacity of Kolkata, they lost power almost daily over part of last year’s blistering summer. The machines would go quiet, stopping progress on the uniforms they were on contract to deliver.“Sometimes there were power cuts for up to 12 hours. We had to use the manual tailoring machines and stitch with our hands,” said Halder, the secretary of her group. They lost money they couldn't afford to lose and endured pain working extra to complete work that should have taken half the time.Cooling systems across the country, now more urgently needed as climate change turns up the heat on already sweltering temperatures, were exhausting the grid. Several northern states including West Bengal, Rajasthan and Gujarat faced regular power outages. The government order to keep the coal plants running is an example of a warming planet prompting action that further aggravates climate change.India is the world’s second-largest country by population, and the third-largest emitter. It relies on its abundant coal — plus some imports — for some 70% of electricity. India has hundreds of coal-fired plants and mines dotted around the country. The government expects power demand to reach a high of 229 gigawatts in April.India “has to ensure there is energy security as this is critical for the country’s development and growth,” said Alok Kumar, the most senior official in India’s federal power ministry. He said India is achieving its climate goals fully and will continue to do so.But others see national politics influencing the call to run the generating stations — including the oldest or dirtiest-burning — at full power for the duration of summer. Major regional elections in the politically important southern Indian state of Karnataka will be held on May 10 and the national elections to elect a new prime minister will be held next year.“There is a strong political incentive to ensure regular electricity supply this summer,” said Aditya Lolla, an energy policy analyst at the London-based environmental think tank, Ember.Electricity availability and electricity subsidies acutely affect election results in India and incumbent political parties strive to provide uninterrupted supply, especially when there are elections around the corner.Climate change doesn't just make daytime heat waves hotter. It also often means that temperatures don't cool down as much at night. That's driving up demand for cooling in the evening hours, Lolla said.India’s power consumption grew 10% this February compared to last. Records could be broken in the coming weeks.India currently meets about 10% of its power need with renewable energy. While there is rapid growth in clean energy, it's nowhere near enough to meet peak demand.One thing experts agree is needed is a massive amount of new energy storage, usually large arrays of batteries. The idea for storage is that batteries charge from excess power on the grid during hours when demand is low. Currently, India has only 3 gigawatts of storage, or enough to serve about 3 million homes for a year.“Energy storage is important to ensure uninterrupted supply during extreme weather as well as to shift firmly towards clean energy,” said Ammu Jacob, a scientist at the think tank Center of Study of Science, Technology and Policy. Jacob said without more storage it will be harder to integrate wind and solar energy into the grid even if new renewable energy projects come up, because of its intermittency.One problem for building out storage has been cost, but costs are coming down, Jacob said. And the alternative, damages to lives and livelihoods due to climate change-driven extreme weather, is expensive too.To accelerate India’s energy transition, “international climate finance is essential,” said Lolla of Ember.The country will need to install more than 40 gigawatts of clean energy on average every year to meet its 2030 goal. But it needs a parallel plan to phase down coal-fired power, said Lolla of Ember. India has announced a net zero target for 2070, but its path to get there is still unclear, Lolla said. India fell just shy of meeting its target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022.But for those like Kakali Halder, the more urgent hope is that last year’s power cuts don't return.“All our customers are local and they understand if orders are delayed, but at the same time no one waits forever,” she said.___Follow Sibi Arasu on Twitter at @sibi123___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4852975,Pop icon Leslie Cheung's legacy endures 20 years after death,"HONG KONG (AP) — Fans of late Canto-pop icon Leslie Cheung, one of the first singers to come out as gay in Hong Kong, flocked to the city this week to commemorate their idol’s death 20 years ago — revisiting his legacy of pioneering work made during a socially conservative time.Cheung, who was 46 when he died, was a superstar known for his singing, dancing and acting during the heyday of Hong Kong's entertainment industry in the 1980s and ’90s. His supporters, who span across Asia, fondly remembered his norm-breaking works and called him “ahead of time.""The 20th anniversary of Cheung's death on Saturday drew crowds of both local fans and supporters from mainland China to visit exhibitions about him in Hong Kong. Even the government included concerts and film screenings about him in the city's first pop culture festival, which is slated to officially kick off in three weeks.Outside of the official exhibits, a steady stream of fans visited the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where Cheung had killed himself. The narrow strip of pavement next to the hotel was completely covered by a sea of flowers, cards, origami and posters.The local reminiscences of Cheung prove the late celebrity remains a popular icon across generations of Hong Kongers and reflects the desire for reviving the city's cultural influence, said Anthony Fung, professor of the school of journalism and communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.“After so many years, we hardly find any new icons, new superstars who could reach that level of importance,” he said.Cheung, who was affectionately known as Gor Gor — “big brother” in Cantonese — produced many hits that even non-Cantonese speaking music lovers in other parts of Asia could sing along to. Those include “Monica,” “Sleepless Nights Restless Heart” and “Chase.” He also starred in classic films including John Woo’s “A Better Tomorrow,” Wong Kar-wai’s “Happy Together,” Stanley Kwan's “Rouge” and Chen Kaige’s “Farewell My Concubine.”But behind all of his success, Cheung suffered from depression. He jumped to his death from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in central Hong Kong on April 1 in 2003, sending shockwaves across the city. His death came as his hometown was battling the SARS epidemic, which ultimately killed hundreds and crippled the local economy.“We really miss him. His songs and films take us back to the wonderful time of Hong Kong which is not the same as nowadays. We’ll miss it,” said Justin Cho, a fan from the city who came with his friend to lay flowers at the hotel in honor of the actor.Hong Kong fan Connie Leung, a retiree now in her 60s, recalled her disbelief when she first heard about the news of his death from a former colleague. “I said ‘don’t make such a joke on April Fools’ Day',” she said.She said Cheung's songs never became outdated and his fashion tastes, including his iconic long hair, were modern — even by today's standards.Chris Choi, Cheung's concert choreographer in the 2000s, said the late superstar broke through many gender boundaries by introducing “unisex” ideas, some of which were risky at the time. Among his stage costumes, for example, were seashell culottes and red high heels.“It told people art has no boundaries,” he said.Cheung also broke through the city's cultural status quo by boldly revealing his gay relationship in a conservative local society at that time— a decision that could have ruined his career but has earned him a lot of respect from the gay community, Fung said. The breakthrough was about the plurality of culture that he celebrated, he said.“He actually crossed through the boundary, make a noise and influence on the culture of Hong Kong,” Fung said.Cheung's work not only inspired older generations of fans but also those who were just toddlers when he died.University student Justin Jiang said he was only 3 years old when Cheung died, but he later became a fan in high school after learning more about Cheung's personality and charisma from his legacy of works. This week, the 22-year-old, who lives in neighboring Guangzhou, visited Hong Kong with a friend to pay tribute to his idol.He praised Cheung's boldness in expressing his views and breaking through a society strongly influenced by gender stereotypes years ago.“Gor Gor is very courageous and this is worth learning for us,"" he said.—-Associated Press video journalist Alice Fung contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World

Mason Appleton and Vladislav Namestnikov each had two assists and Connor Hellebuyck finished with 23 saves.Wheeler ended a 21-game goal-scoring drought, Scheifele scored for the first time in 10 games, and Connor had his third score in 19 games.“You need some breaks,” Jets coach Rick Bowness said. “Look at Mark (Scheifele’s) goal. All of a sudden he’s coming around the net, he knocks it in. It’s there. We haven’t had those breaks in a long time. Even that first goal, the tip (by Connor). We haven’t had that luck around the net in a long time and it was good to see.”David Perron and Joe Veleno scored 21 seconds apart midway through the third period for Detroit, and Magnus Hellberg had 23 saves. The Red Wings snapped a two-game win streak and lost for the sixth time in nine games.“I think we had a tough start, but I don’t think I showed up to help the team win today,” said Hellberg, who played his 17th game this season. “I take full responsibility for my performance tonight. It was clearly not good enough. I’m not happy with how I played.”Connor gave the Jets a 1-0 lead at 6:56 of the first period as he tipped Brenden Dillon's point shot past Hellberg's blocker side for his 29th goal of the season.Wheeler got his 16th with 8:03 left in the first as he got a cross-ice pass from Nikolaj Ehlers and beat Hellberg from the right side.“That’s the best he’s skated in a while,” Bowness said. ”I think the goal certainly gave him a big boost. The guys were all very happy for him. It gave the whole bench a boost.”Scheifele made it 3-0 a little more than 90 seconds later as he picked up a loose puck on the left side and quickly put it in for his career-best and team-leading 39th.DeMelo added to the Jets' lead at 1:20 of the second as he fired a shot from the slot past Hellberg for his fifth, and Niederreiter got his own rebound and scored on a backhander for his 23rd with 6:18 remaining in the period.Ehlers pushed the lead to 6-0 at 5:07 of the third with a shot from the slot that went inside the post for his 10th.“Our first look was an east-west backdoor play that we weren’t able to finish and their first look was a deflection that went in,” Detroit head coach Derek Lalonde said. “We couldn’t build any momentum throughout the night. I do appreciate the fact that we won the third period. We kind of battled and hung in there.”Perron got Detroit on the scoreboard during a power play at 10:41 of the third for his 20th. Veleno followed 21 seconds later with his eighth.SLUMP BUSTERSJets coach Rick Bowness has been preaching offense lately and changed his top line for the game to try to spark some productive shooting. Scheifele moved from center to right wing, with Pierre-Luc Dubois in the middle and Connor on the left.The changes all worked.“It’s different, for sure,” Scheifele said of the switch. “I’ve played centre my whole life. It’s definitely an adjustment. But when you play with two good players like (Dubois) and (Connor) it makes it easy.”The last time Winnipeg scored more than three goals was in a 5-4 overtime win at Florida on March 11.UP NEXTRed Wings: At Toronto on Sunday in the second of a three-game trip.Jets: Host New Jersey on Sunday in the second of a five-game homestand.___More AP: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

In the sixth, Javier gave up three straight doubles to Benintendi, Jimenez and Joan Moncada to make it 3-0 and end his night.“I was feeling good, but things didn’t work out for me that inning,” Javier said.White Sox reliever Kendall Graveman (1-1) loaded the bases with two outs in the seventh on two walks and a single. Jake Diekman came on and gave up Alvarez's double to deep left-center, a drive that just eluded center fielder Luis Robert Jr. and bounced off the wall, clearing the bases.“I’ve been there before,” Alvarez said. “I was calm and focused on looking for a good pitch to do damage with.”Four Astros relievers each worked one scoreless inning. Seth Martinez (1-0) got the win and Rafael Montero handled the ninth for his first save.Chicago starter Lance Lynn allowed two runs in 5 2/3 innings.ALL IN A DAY’S RESTWhite Sox INF Andrew Vaughn, who hit a go-ahead two-run double in Thursday’s season-opening win, did not play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853005,"Clark, Iowa end perfect South Carolina season in Final Four","DALLAS (AP) — Caitlin Clark tossed the ball high in the air as the clock ticked down, gave a huge shout-out to her adoring fans and then took off on a gleeful gallop around the court.In the biggest matchup of her life, the dazzling point guard from Iowa had done it all -- poured in 41 points to set a record for the highest-scoring NCAA Tournament semifinal, ended the perfect season of South Carolina and, most importantly, put her Hawkeyes into the championship game.Clark overwhelmed the reigning champions with another sensational show from start to finish, helping Iowa stop the Gamecocks' 42-game winning streak 77-73 on Friday night in the Final Four.“We had nothing to lose. I have all the confidence in the world in this group, and they believe right back in me, and that’s all you need,” Clark said. ”All we do is believe in one another and we love each other to death, and that’s what a true team is. If you want an example of a team, that’s what this is.”The spectacular junior became the first women's player to post back-to-back 40-point performances in the NCAA Tournament. She now has the Hawkeyes in a spot they've never been in before — one victory away from a national championship.They'll have to beat another SEC team to do that as Iowa (31-6) will face LSU in the title game on Sunday afternoon. The Tigers beat Virginia Tech in the other national semifinal.It’s the Tigers' first appearance in the title game as Kim Mulkey became the second coach to take two different teams to the championship game.“I love me some Caitlin Clark,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “We’ve been talking about being mission-focused a lot this year, and we had a game plan and these guys executed so well. That is South Carolina we just beat, folks. Amazing.”Thanks to the riveting play of Clark and the historic year by South Carolina, this was one of the most talked about and highly anticipated matchups in women’s Final Four history,The game lived up to the hype surrounding it— the best player vs. the best team — much to the delight of the sellout crowd of over 19,000 fans.“Tonight showed how fun women’s basketball is,"" Clark said. ""I’m sure some people wished this was a series of seven games.”Coach Dawn Staley and South Carolina (36-1) had kept on winning since taking last year's title.“I don’t think we felt pressure to win the game, we just didn’t perform,” Staley said. “And that hasn’t been us all season long.”“I don’t think our players felt pressure, any other pressures besides wanting to win another basketball game,” she said.This was Iowa’s first appearance in the Final Four in 30 years. The last time the Hawkeyes advanced this far was 1993 under coach C. Vivian Stringer, whose team lost to Ohio State in overtime.Clark wowed the crowd that included Harper Stribe, a young fan of the team who has been battling cancer. She was featured in a surprise video that informed the Hawkeyes’ star that she was the AP Player of the Year.Clark has created quite a stir since going to college in her home state. She led the nation in scoring twice and last weekend had a game for the ages, recording the first 40-point triple-double in NCAA history to lead the Hawkeyes to the Final Four.Now she has them on the doorstep of more history.Trailing 59-55 entering the fourth quarter, South Carolina scored the first five points to take the lead. Clark answered right back with two deep 3-pointers and an assist to Monika Czinano to give the Hawkeyes a 67-62 lead.South Carolina got within 69-68 on Raven Johnson’s 3-pointer before Clark got a steal for a layup with 3:32 left. Neither team scored again until star Aliyah Boston was fouled with 1:37 left. She made the second of two free throws.Clark then scored another layup on the other end out of a timeout to make it a four-point game. After a layup by Zia Cooke with 58 seconds left, the Hawkeyes ran the clock down with McKenna Warnock grabbing a huge offensive rebound off a Clark miss with 18 seconds remaining.Clark hit two free throws after South Carolina fouled her with 13.5 seconds left. They were her 38th and 39th point, moving her past Nneka Ogwumike for the most in a Final Four semifinal game.After a putback by Johnson with 9.9 seconds left got the Gamecocks within 75-73, Clark sealed the game with two more free throws.The loss ended a tremendous season for the defending champion Gamecocks, who were trying to become the 10th team to go through a season unbeaten.“It was physical. You’ve got to give them a lot of credit,” Clark said. “They’re a tremendous team, they’ve had a tremendous year, obviously so well-coached.”Cooke led the Gamecocks with 24 points. Slowed by foul trouble, Boston had just eight points and 10 rebounds as the Hawkeyes packed the paint, brazenly daring South Carolina to shoot from the outside. The defense seemed to bamboozle the Gamecocks, who finished 4 for 20 from behind the 3-point line. They couldn't take advantage of their 49-25 rebounding edge that included 26 offensive boards.1,000-POINT CLUBClark became the sixth player to score over 1,000 points in a season. She joined former Hawkeyes star Megan Gustafson, breaking her school mark of 1,001. Villanova’s Maddy Siegrist also reached that milestone this season. Kelsey Plum, Jackie Stiles and Odyssey Sims were the others to do it.___More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853006,Harris peeks at peppers on farm with climate change in mind,"LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday traveled down a dirt road to tour a farm outside Zambia's capital that’s using new techniques and technology to boost its vegetable crop as she highlighted ways to secure food supplies in an age of global warming.“It’s an example of what can be done around the world,” she said after walking past rows of peppers and inspecting a drip irrigation system.Unlike in the United States, where conversations about climate change usually revolve around replacing fossil fuels with clean energy, the focus in Africa is on expanding access to food. Rising prices stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine have been damaging to poor countries, and global warming is expected to bring more challenges in the coming years.Hunger can also create instability, leading to migration and conflict.“The connection between these issues is quite clear,” Harris said.She is pushing for $7 billion in private-sector investments, mostly to boost conservation and improve food production, to help Africa prepare for the effects of climate change. Her announcement about that goal came as she wrapped up her weeklong visit to Africa, which included earlier stops in Ghana and Tanzania. The trip was intended to advance U.S. efforts to make inroads in a part of the world where China’s influence runs deep.It's the biggest-ticket item that Harris has announced, but more work will be needed to follow through.For example, African Parks, a nonprofit group, has committed to raise $1.25 billion over the next seven years in order to expand its conservation program. Another organization, One Acre Fund, plans to raise $100 million to plant 1 billion trees by the end of the decade.The politics of climate change are complicated in Africa, which has contributed far less to overall greenhouse gas emissions than richer corners of the world such as the United States. According to the International Energy Agency, 43% of Africans didn’t have access to electricity in 2021, and recent outages have caused frustration.In Ghana, Harris was questioned at a news conference about how the West can demand that Africa go green and forgo using its natural resources. She also was pressed on whether wealthy nations would supply $100 billion annually to help poor countries cope with climate change, a commitment made under the Paris climate accord.Harris said it is “critically important that, as global leaders, we all speak truth about the disparities that exist in terms of cause and effect and that we address those disparities.” She said there were opportunities in the “clean energy economy” that could help generate growth in Africa.As for the money, President Joe Biden has requested $11 billion in his proposed budget to meet its international commitments.“We are waiting for Congress to do its work,” Harris said.",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853035,Trump indictment ends decades of perceived invincibility,"NEW YORK (AP) — When Donald Trump steps before a judge next week to be arraigned in a New York courtroom, it will not only mark the first time a former U.S. president has faced criminal charges. It will also represent a reckoning for a man long nicknamed “Teflon Don,” who until now has managed to skirt serious legal jeopardy despite 40 years of legal scrutiny.Trump, who is the early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, is expected to turn himself in Tuesday. He faces charges including at least one felony offense related to hush money payments to women during his 2016 campaign. Like any other person facing trial, he will be booked, fingerprinted and photographed before being given the chance to enter a plea.The spectacle that is sure to unfold will mark an unprecedented moment in American history that will demonstrate once again how dramatically Trump — who already held the distinction of being the first president to be impeached twice — has upended democratic norms. But on a personal level, the indictment pierces the cloak of invincibility that seemed to follow Trump through his decades in business and in politics, as he faced allegations of fraud, collusion and sexual misconduct.“Boy, after all this time it’s a bit of a shock,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio said of the indictment. “You know I always thought of him as the Gingerbread Man, shouting, ‘You can’t catch me!’ as he ran away.”“Given his track record,” he said, “I had trouble imagining he would ever be held accountable.”“These are not things that Donald Trump ever thought in his entire life, nor I, for that matter, that he would ever be confronted with,” Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime fixer and a key witness in the case who served jail time for the payments, told CNN.Of course, some of the celebration by Trump's detractors may be premature. The former president could seek to have a judge quickly dismiss the case. And even if it moves forward, there's no guarantee of conviction. Intensifying investigations in Atlanta and Washington are seen as potentially more serious legal threats.Still, Trump and his team were caught by surprise when word of the New York indictment broke Thursday evening, following news reports that the grand jury hearing the case was set for a weeks-long hiatus. As the deliberations dragged on, some in Trump's orbit had become convinced that the case had stalled and that charges might never be brought. That included Trump attorney Joe Tacopina, who said Friday morning he had hoped the “rule of law would prevail.”Trump, he said on the “Today"" show, was “initially was shocked” by news of the charges, but quickly pivoted to his usual pushback playbook.“After he got over that,"" he said, Trump ""put a notch on his belt and he decided we have to fight now. And he got into a typical Donald Trump posture where he’s ready to be combative on something that he believes is an injustice. ... I think he’s now in the posture that he’s ready to fight this.”In the meantime, Trump and his team have tried to use the news to his advantage, hoping to energize his loyal base by painting the investigation as part of a larger plot to derail his candidacy.Already, the charges have been a boon to his struggling fundraising. The campaign announced Friday evening that it had raised over $4 million in the 24 hours after the indictment became public, far smashing its previous record after the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.More than 25% of donations, according to the campaign, came from first-time donors. The average contribution: $34.His campaign also continued to blast out supportive statements from dozens of top Republicans who have rallied behind Trump, including several of his declared and likely challengers, underscoring his continued hold on the party. Trump has been in contact by phone with key congressional allies, including members of House leadership and top committees, according to people familiar with the conversations, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the response.Trump ally Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., who formally endorsed the former president Friday, said Trump “doesn’t back down"" and was going to ""fight back,"" telling a local radio show it was ""yet another chapter where Donald Trump is going to come back on top in the end.""The media maelstrom has catapulted the former president back into the spotlight he craves, at least temporarily limiting attention being paid to his rivals, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely expected to challenge Trump for the nomination, and has been holding events across the county to promote his book.Trump aides have been discussing other ideas to maximize the situation, including the possibility of holding a press event either before or after the arraignment. Trump is expected to travel from Florida to New York on Monday and stay overnight at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan before heading to the courthouse early Tuesday. He will return to Florida after the arraignment.Trump has long denied that he had a sexual encounter with the porn actor known as Stormy Daniels and has blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for pursuing the years-old case.Trump is also facing continued investigations in Georgia, over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and in Washington, where a special counsel is probing the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as well as Trump's handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and potential obstruction of the investigation.But Sam Nunberg, a longtime former aide who broke with Trump years ago, said that while he no longer supports Trump, he believes the Manhattan case is “a waste of time,"" given the allegations, which remain under seal. And he said he was skeptical it would ultimately matter.“It doesn’t surprise me,"" he said of the indictment. “What would surprise me is if he actually ended up behind bars in prison and I don’t see that happening.”D’Antonio said that sentiment — and a continued belief that Trump will somehow prevail and dodge the charges — continues among the many people who have reached out to him in the last 24 hours, despite the charges.“They're like, he's going to get away with it,"" he said. ""Somehow, he’s going to get it thrown out.”___This story has been corrected to reflect that Trump Tower is in midtown Manhattan, not lower Manhattan.",2023/04/01,,World

Same with the Texas homecoming for Alexis Morris.The standout guards have made it a party of first-timers for the women's NCAA championship game Sunday.Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes knocked off undefeated defending national champion South Carolina 77-73 in the semifinals Friday night.Morris, in her second stint with flamboyant coach Kim Mulkey, led LSU's rally in a 79-72 victory over Virginia Tech in the early game at the Final Four.Clark, the Associated Press Player of the Year, scored 41 points for Iowa (31-6). The Hawkeyes lost 73-72 in overtime to Ohio State 30 years ago in their only previous Final Four appearance.“I think we have to be able to enjoy this for a moment but also reset our minds,” Clark said. “We’re here to hoist the trophy. We’re here to cut down another championship net. We need to take care of our bodies. We need to take care of our minds.”Morris scored 27 points to get the Tigers (33-2) past the semifinals for the first time in their sixth try. The first five were consecutive from 2004-08.Mulkey is just the third coach to take multiple teams to the Final Four after going four times with Baylor and winning three championships. She has a 7-1 record on the big stage.It took Mulkey five years to get Baylor to the championship game. She did it in two with the flagship school in her home state.“You think about all the great men’s players that have played at LSU,” Mulkey said. “You think about all the great women’s players that have played. When they told me none had ever played for a national championship, I was kind of surprised. That’s an accomplishment. That’s a step in the right direction.”Iowa was a No. 2 seed playing the team that had been ranked No. 1 all season. South Carolina was trying to become the first repeat winner since UConn in 2016.The Hawkeyes came to the Final Four with the most losses among the remaining teams, but the best player. And they guaranteed that a No. 1 seed won't win the title for the first time since 2011.Now Clark will match wits with Morris while Iowa figures out how to deal with star LSU post player Angel Reese, who had 24 points and 12 rebounds to tie an NCAA single-season record with her 33rd double-double.The Hawkeyes found a way to overcome the South Carolina size advantage headlined by Aliyah Boston and will have to do it again with Reese.“It’s just a business mentality at this point, and I think we’ve done a really good job of doing that in the past,” said McKenna Warnock, who had a critical offensive rebound in the final minute against South Carolina. “The Big Ten tournament prepares you for this, and I think that’s kind of how we look at it.”Morris, who grew up in Beaumont near the southeast Texas coast, played for Mulkey at Baylor as a freshman before a circuitous career that included stops at Rutgers and Texas A&M.The feisty 5-foot-6 guard is in her second season of a reunion with Mulkey and knows her career is about to end a couple of hundred miles from home.Morris was agitated over questions about matching up against 3-pointer wizard Georgia Amoore of Virginia Tech. The questions will be coming again with Clark on the other side.“It still hasn’t hit me,” Morris said. “Maybe if we’re the standing champions at the end, then maybe I can just let go and just be like ahhh, like relief.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853038,"Freeland's great play, Blackmon HR carry Rockies past Padres","SAN DIEGO (AP) — Left-hander Kyle Freeland made a brilliant defensive play while holding San Diego to three hits in six scoreless innings and Charlie Blackmon hit a two-run homer in the Colorado Rockies' 4-1 victory over the Padres on Friday night.The Rockies have won the first two games of the season against the Padres, who have World Series aspirations after making it to the NL Championship Series last year. Not only are the Padres off to a rough start, but they were booed for the second straight night at Petco Park.Freeland (1-0) made a sensational play to retire Austin Nola opening the fifth. Nola hit a soft dribbler down the third base line and Freeland hopped off the mound, gloved the ball, took two steps and made a jump throw — reminiscent of Derek Jeter — to first baseman C.J. Cron, who made a nice stretch to retire the runner. Freeland ended up sprawled face down in foul territory.He squatted behind the mound for a few minutes and was checked by a trainer and manager Bud Black. He remained in the game.Freeland said he knew third baseman Elehuris Montero was playing back and that he was the only one who had a chance. He said he made the play once before, as a rookie.“It's not an easy play to make — one, fielding the ball; two, getting the transfer; and three, getting up on the throw and making it accurate,"" Freeland said. ""You give it a go. You practice it obviously as a kid all the time trying to be like Jeter.”Manager Bud Black said it might be the best play he's ever seen.“To go as far as he did, then the jump throw with some velocity behind it, what a play,” Black said. “We'll see that one on replay highlight reels forever. That was fabulous.”Freeland, who went 3-1 in five starts against San Diego last year, shut down the Padres and frustrated the superstars at the top of the lineup. Xander Bogaerts singled leading off the sixth but was erased by Manny Machado's double-play ball to end the inning.Bogaerts hit a sacrifice fly off former Padres closer Brad Hand in the eighth.The Rockies took a 2-0 lead in the first on three hits and a walk against Nick Martinez (0-1). Ezequiel Tovar singled leading off the fifth and was aboard for Blackmon's impressive shot to right with two outs. Martinez allowed four runs on six hits in seven innings.Former Padres reliever Pierce Johnson, who signed a free agent with his hometown Rockies in the offseason, pitched the ninth for his first career save.The Rockies are without closer Daniel Bard, who went on the injured list Thursday with anxiety.“It was a ton of fun,” Johnson said. “Just the adrenaline going from warming up to the first guy you face is Manny, that's a pretty good feeling. Those three outs are the hardest in baseball. I think any reliever, the most-coveted role is the closer's role. I was fortunate enough to be that guy today but we're just going to hold down the fort until Bard is back.”REPPING THE AZTECSJoe Musgrove, Machado and Bogaerts wore Kawhi Leonard No. 15 San Diego State basketball jerseys during the Padres' batting practice as a nod to the Aztecs, who play in their first Final Four on Saturday. Musgrove, who grew up in suburban El Cajon, said the NBA star, who usually attends a few Padres games every summer, sent him a handful of jerseys. The Padres will open the gates early before Saturday evening's game and show SDSU's game against Florida Atlantic on the video board.TRAINER'S ROOMPadres: Musgrove, on the injured list with a broken left big toe, is scheduled to face live batters Saturday at the spring training complex in Peoria, Arizona. He said he'll throw five innings and about 75 pitches.UP NEXTRockies RHP José Ureña, who was 3-8 with a 5.14 ERA last year, is scheduled to start Saturday night opposite RHP Michael Wacha, who will make his Padres debut.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853039,Intensity and insults rise as lawmakers debate debt ceiling,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Fights over increasing the nation’s borrowing authority have been contentious in Congress, yet follow a familiar pattern: Time and again, lawmakers found a way to step back from the brink before markets began to panic and the nation risked a dangerous default on its debt.But this year’s fight has a different feel, some lawmakers say.A new Republican majority in the House is itching for a spending showdown, and determined not to yield. They blame what they view as excessive federal spending for higher food and gasoline prices and the growing national debt. Led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they have ruled out passing a “clean” debt ceiling increase even as the White House insists such legislation be passed without conditions. It’s an impasse that shows no signs of easing ahead of this summer’s deadline for action.“Very worried. Very worried,” was how Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., a close McCarthy ally, described his outlook. “And frankly, I don’t see how we get there at this point. There’s no process set up, there’s no dialogue, there’s no discussion.”The political conditions are comparable to 2011, when a new Republican majority swept into power after a resounding election win and was determined to confront a Democratic White House and extract major spending cuts in return for a debt limit increase.To resolve that stalemate, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Budget Control Act. The bill temporarily allowed borrowing to resume, set new spending limits and created a bipartisan “supercommittee” to recommend at least $1.2 trillion more in deficit reduction over 10 years. Republicans and Democrats on the panel failed to compromise, however, triggering automatic reductions in spending.But some damage was done. Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded U.S. debt for the first time that year because it lacked confidence political leaders would make the choices needed to avert a long-term fiscal crisis.In 2013, Obama took a different tack. He made clear early on there would be no negotiations on must-pass legislation to prevent a U.S. default, and he never wavered.A partial government shutdown, which began Oct. 1, swiftly coincided with the prospects of a default. On Oct. 16, Congress passed legislation to end the twin threats and GOP lawmakers who demanded to roll back Obama’s signature health care law got nothing for their efforts. “We fought the good fight. We just didn’t win,” conceded then-House Speaker John Boehner.Republicans say they are determined that Biden, who was Obama’s vice president during both of those debt ceiling battles, will have to follow the path set in 2011 — not the one set in 2013.“President Biden is not President Obama, right?” said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the leader of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. “His poll numbers are in the tank and they’re going to keep going down.”The result, Perry said, is that Biden doesn’t have the political standing to ignore House Republicans.“Look, there’s gonna be shrapnel all around, right. Right?” Perry said. “Everybody might take some wounds from it, but he’s not walking out of this thing unscathed.”After a tumultuous start to the new Congress in which Republicans struggled to elect a speaker, they are taking great pains to show unity. Moderates and conservatives in the House are adamant: Biden must engage.“Any damage in Treasury markets and the bond market, to the economy, will fall at the feet of the president of the United States because he’s the one that started this entire saga saying he wanted no negotiations,” said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla.“He’s got to meet us partway,” added Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia said what concerns him most is that some Republicans believe the damage from a federal default is manageable, rather than to be avoided at all costs.“Some of these people are substituting belief for empirical evidence and don’t accept the warnings of economists, Wall Street, Janet Yellen,” Connolly said.Breaching the debt ceiling is different than a federal government shutdown. The government can continue to operate once the Treasury has exhausted its cash-on-hand. But outgoing payments would be limited to incoming revenue. Not all payments could be made on time and in full. Many fear such an event would shake the foundations of the global financial system.Some lawmakers don’t believe the consequences would be that devastating. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., said breaching the debt limit without an agreement to increase it would force “prioritization of our spending.”“I’m not afraid of that, quite frankly,” Good said.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the government may be unable to pay all its bills as soon as June. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told a House panel this week the so-called X Day is likely to occur in mid-August. He said market pressures will likely build after Congress returns from its July 4th recess.“As we can see from recent events given the banking crisis, the system is very fragile at this point in time,” Zandi said. “Adding the debt limit as an issue for investors would be particularly inopportune.”He said there would be immediate and long-term consequences from a default.“I think under any scenario, we would go into recession, it would be severe, financial markets would be upended,” Zandi said.In the Senate, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is encouraging negotiations. “I think Kevin McCarthy has been most reasonable,” he said.GOP leadership in the Senate has also voiced support for McCarthy’s efforts. But some Senate Republicans say spending fights should be relegated to the annual spending bills that Congress passes to fund government agencies. An increase in the debt limit doesn’t authorize new federal spending — it only allows borrowing to pay for what Congress has already approved.“Look, if we have disagreements on spending, and if we have to close government to resolve things, so be it, but threatening a collapse of the U.S. and world economy without raising the debt ceiling is, in my opinion, a weapon that is too severe,” said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.There have been roughly 80 deals to raise or suspend the borrowing cap since the 1960s. Romney noted that the debt ceiling was extended, with the help of Democrats, multiple times during Donald Trump’s presidency.“Of course, last time you had President Trump as the individual pushing to raise the debt ceiling, but somehow when we have a Democratic president, we find religion,” Romney said.The focus on the debt limit, now at about $31.4 trillion, intensified this week with McCarthy sending a letter to Biden warning that his position of not negotiating “could prevent America from meeting its obligations and hold dire ramifications for the entire nation.”In a formal response, Biden signaled that he would not be willing to meet directly with the speaker until House Republicans released their own budget plan, which he asked McCarthy to do before lawmakers left Washington on Thursday for the Easter recess.“As I have repeatedly said, that conversation must be separate from prompt action on the Congress’ basic obligation to pay the Nation’s bills and avoid economic catastrophe,” Biden wrote.The letters did not appear to generate any progress or good will. Republicans left town without proposing a budget. And McCarthy accused Biden on Thursday of making the decision to put the economy in jeopardy, while seemingly making a crack about the president’s age.“I don’t know what more I can do and how easy. I would bring the lunch to the White House. I would make it soft food if that’s what he wants,” McCarthy said, prompting laughter from other Republicans in the room.____Associated Press staff writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World

Domantas Sabonis added 20 points and 12 rebounds.Shaedon Sharpe had 27 points for Portland, which has won just one of their last 12. The Blazers were officially eliminated earlier in the night when the Los Angeles Lakers beat Minnesota 123-111.Sharpe's layup got Portland within 110-103 in the fourth quarter, but Monk answered for the Kings with a 3-pointer and Sacramento pushed the lead to 124-105 with 4:23 left on Sabonis' dunk.“I feel like our offense is really flowing right now,"" said Kings rookie Keegan Murray, who also finished with 20 points. ""We're getting the ball to the right guy at the right time, and every guy is making plays. So we all have 100% confidence on the floor and it's really fun to watch.”The win got the Kings closer to clinching the Pacific Division title for the first time since the 2002-03 season, but they were thwarted from clinching it Friday night when the Suns beat the Nuggets 100-93 in the later game.While some teams rest players once the postseason is secured, Sacramento coach Mike Brown said his team had loftier goals. Currently the team is the third spot in the Western Conference behind leader Denver and second-place Memphis.""Right now, it's too close to think about resting when there's a chance to get to the second spot,” he said. “So we're going to keep playing and when and if everything gets settled and a certain point, then I think we'll revisit then.”Harrison Barnes has also been vocal about wanting to reach the 50-win milestone. The Kings are at 47-30 with five games left.The Blazers, meanwhile, will miss out on the playoffs for the second straight season. They hardly resemble the team that started the season.Portland (32-45) listed its regular starters out with injuries, including Damian Lillard (right calf), Jusuf Nurkic (right knee), Anfernee Simons (right foot) and Jerami Grant (left quad).The Blazers signed Skylar Mays and Shaq Harrison to 10-day contracts Thursday, and both played Friday. Harrison played this season with the G League South Bay Lakers and Mays, who started, played most recently with the G League's Mexico City Capitanes. Mays finished with 14.Portland kept up for much of the opening half, with Sacramento unable to stretch the lead to double digits until Sabonis' basket made it 61-51 with 3:27 left. The Kings led 71-59 at the break.Portland's Nassir Little hurt his left ankle in the second quarter and did not return.Coach Chauncey Billups didn’t mince words about where the Blazers are at the end of the season.“It always sucks to lose,” he said. To get to this point in the season, I didn’t think we would be here last year, to be honest with you, but we are. These games are tough. Tough on me, tough at all levels.”TIP-INSKings: Murray, who set a rookie record for made 3-pointers against the Blazers on Wednesday, led all scorers with 10 points in the opening quarter.

Nola hit a weak chopper down the third base line and Freeland hopped off the mound, gloved the ball, took two steps, made a leaping spin and threw to first baseman C.J. Cron, who made a nice stretch to retire the runner. Freeland ended up sprawled face down in foul territory.The Rockies took a 2-0 lead in the first on three hits and a walk against Nick Martinez (0-1). Ezequiel Tovar singled leading off the fifth and was aboard for Blackmon’s impressive shot to right with two outs.Former Padres reliever Pierce Johnson pitched the ninth for his first career save.ASTROS 6, WHITE SOX 3HOUSTON (AP) — Yordan Alvarez hit a go-ahead three-run double in the seventh inning and Houston rallied past Chicago.Kyle Tucker hit a two-run homer in the sixth and made a spectacular catch at the wall in the seventh to rob Andrew Benintendi of extra bases and keep the World Series champion Astros within a run.Eloy Jimenez hit two RBI doubles for the White Sox, both off Astros starter Cristian Javier.White Sox reliever Kendall Graveman (1-1) loaded the bases with two outs in the seventh on two walks and a single. Jake Diekman came on and gave up Alvarez’s double to deep left-center, a drive that just eluded center fielder Luis Robert Jr. and bounced off the wall, clearing the bases.Four Astros relievers each worked one scoreless inning. Seth Martinez (1-0) got the win and Rafael Montero handled the ninth for his first save.GUARDIANS 9, MARINERS 4SEATTLE (AP) — Steven Kwan became the second player in Cleveland franchise history with five RBIs in either of the first two games of the season and the Guardians took advantage of three errors by Seattle.Kwan had a two-run double and two-run single to go along with a sacrifice fly, and the Guardians rebounded with 13 hits after getting shut out by Seattle on opening day. Larry Doby in 1953 was the only other player in Cleveland’s history to have five RBIs in one of the first two games.Kwan’s soft double in the fourth inning ended the night for Seattle starter Robbie Ray and gave Cleveland a 5-3 lead. Ray (0-1) produced a dud of a debut to this season after he looked impressive in spring training, walking five and recording just 10 outs in his 91 pitches.Nick Sandlin (1-0), Eli Morgan, Enyel De Los Santos, Trevor Stephan and Emmanuel Clase combined for 5 1/3 scoreless innings, allowing two hits with eight strikeouts. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_MLB",2023/04/01,,World

She now has the Hawkeyes in a spot they’ve never been in before — one victory away from a national championship.They’ll have to beat another Southeastern Conference team to do that as No. 2 seed Iowa (31-6) will face No. 3 seed LSU in the title game on Sunday.Coach Dawn Staley and top-seeded South Carolina (36-1) had won 42 in a row, including last year’s championship game.Trailing 59-55 entering the fourth quarter, South Carolina scored the first five points to take the lead. Clark answered right back with two deep 3-pointers and an assist to Monika Czinano to give the Hawkeyes a 67-62 lead they would not relinquish.As the final seconds went off the clock, Clark threw the ball high in the air and galloped around the court.Zia Cooke led the Gamecocks with 24 points. Slowed by foul trouble, Aliyah Boston had just eight points and 10 rebounds.LSU 79, VIRGINIA TECH 72DALLAS (AP) — Alexis Morris scored 27 points and had two of her misses in the fourth quarter turned into putback baskets by Angel Reese in a big run as LSU rallied past top-seeded Virginia Tech.Reese finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds for No. 3 seed LSU (33-2), which is going to the national championship game for the first time and will play second-seeded Iowa.The win came in the second season since coach Kim Mulkey returned to her home state to take over a Tigers program that lost five consecutive national semifinal games from 2004-08 the only other times they made it this far.Mulkey, who won three national titles at Baylor, joins C. Vivian Stringer as the only coaches to take two different teams to the national championship game.Trailing 59-50 after three quarters, LSU went ahead with a 15-0 run over a five-minute span in the fourth period.Elizabeth Kitley had 18 points and 12 rebounds for Virginia Tech (31-5), the Atlantic Coast Conference champion that was in the Final Four for the first time.

The Warriors joined Houston in 2016-17 — by James Harden, Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson — as the only teams to do so. Just one other 3 was made by the rest of Golden State's players all night.“It’s not easy to make 200 3s in a season, so credit to Jordan, he works his tail off every day, same with Steph, just really cool that we have 200 (3-point) guys and I get to play with two of them,” Thompson said, predicting All-Star games for Poole soon. “He’s our future. We got so lucky to get a guy like him at the 28th pick, that doesn’t happen often.”Curry shot 11 for 21 and 7 of 11 from deep, and Thompson also hit seven 3s as the defending champions stayed put in sixth place in the Western Conference standings. They have an identical 41-37 record to the fifth-place Clippers, who hold the tiebreaker based on divisional record.This might have marked the final time Gregg Popovich faced off against dear friend, pupil and former assistant and player Steve Kerr. They shared a hug and some words after the final buzzer.Golden State reserve Anthony Lamb delivered a timely left-handed block with 5:04 remaining on Malaki Branham’s driving layup attempt.Keldon Johnson scored 22 points off the bench, Branham had 19 points and seven rebounds and Sandro Mamukelashvili added 13 points and 11 rebounds in San Antonio’s sixth straight loss overall and sixth in a row on the road.Thompson pushed his NBA-leading 3-point shot total to 285 while helping the Warriors to a 43-point fourth quarter after trailing 88-87 heading into the final 12 minutes. They beat the Spurs for the fourth straight time and swept all three games of the season series.Jonathan Kuminga drove through paint for a two-handed slam early in the fourth, then Curry hit from deep the next time down for a 95-90 lead before Poole's 3 from 29 feet.Draymond Green dished out 11 of the Warriors' 37 assists.3-POINT FESTCurry appreciated the Warriors' 3-point shooting achievement.“Nice to accomplish feats that are rare in NBA history,” Curry said. “It's special and obviously JP coming into his own as a great shooter and balancing just scoring overall and also stretching the defense out, it's awesome.”Poole missed his initial three from deep.PRAISING POPKerr has imagined any game might be his last with pal Popovich on the opposite bench. He cherishes each meeting.“I mean the last couple of years, I’ve wondered. I think we faced the Spurs in San Antonio last year when it was their last home game and I thought that might have been it and I think it’s just going to be strange whenever he does decide to hang it up,” Kerr said before the game. ""It’ll be strange not seeing him on the sidelines. We’ve all sort of taken it for granted for a long time now but wat he’s meant to the league and to so many of us, it will definitely be a sad day when he retires.”TIP-INSSpurs: Popovich heard former C LaMarcus Aldridge announced his retirement and plans a wine-themed gift. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853045,South Carolina's streak ends in maybe Boston's final game,"DALLAS (AP) — South Carolina's shot at perfection is over, and so is its chance to repeat as national champion.The Gamecocks couldn't get past Iowa and Caitlin Clark in the women's Final Four.With All-American Aliyah Boston plagued by foul trouble in what very likely was her final game, and Clark scoring almost every point for the Hawkeyes in the fourth quarter, South Carolina lost 77-73 in the national semifinals on Friday night, ending its 42-game winning streak.The Gamecocks had won their first 36 games this season to get to the Final Four for the third year in a row with a group led by Boston.“It felt like any other game. We just didn’t perform,” Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley said. “We didn’t make more plays than we needed to make, especially down the stretch, and that hasn’t been us all season long. But I never, I don’t think our players felt pressure, any other pressure besides wanting to win another basketball game.”There hasn't been a repeat national champion since UConn won four in a row from 2013-16. That streak by the Huskies ended when South Carolina won its first title in 2017, in the same arena where this year's Final Four is being played.South Carolina was the first undefeated team since UConn in 2018 to lose in the Final Four. The Gamecocks missed a chance to become the 10th team to finish a season without a loss.While the 6-foot-5 Boston is a senior, she could return for another title chance because of the COVID-19 season that didn't count against any player's eligibility. But she is also projected to be one of the top picks in the WNBA draft, maybe the first one.“I would tell her to go,” Staley said. “She's great. She's ready. She's ready to see single coverage, she's ready to make the next step to the league.”Boston finished with eight points and 10 rebounds in 25 1/2 minutes on the court. She was scoreless in the first half, when she took just one shot and was limited to only eight minutes after two early fouls.“I haven't decided,” Boston said about her future. “The decision is a big decision. I was going to have to really write down the pros and cons of everything, and so whether we won or not, it would still be something I would consider.”After trailing into the fourth quarter for only the second time this season, Staley’s team quickly erased a four-point deficit in the first minute. Raven Johnson hit a 3-pointer and after a turnover by Clark, Boston had a driving layup to put the Gamecocks up 60-59.That was their last lead. Clark hit a 3 and went on to score 16 of Iowa's 18 points in the final quarter.South Carolina's roster lists seven players who are seniors or graduate students. Boston is among the five of those who could return for another season.“She's meant everything to our program. She has been the cornerstone of our program for the past four years. She elevated us. She raised the standard of how to approach basketball,” Staley said. “I slept very well know she was with our program, and I'll sleep well knowing that's she's OK, and she will definitely make her mark at the next level.”___AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/01,,World

After Nick Ahmed grounded out to third, Evan Longoria doubled into the left-field corner. That set up Lewis, who sent a 383-foot shot to left-center for his first career pinch-hit homer, making it 2-1.“It was a good one,"" Lewis said. “I try to just be ready for it.”The Dodgers had the potential tying and go-ahead runs on base with two outs in the eighth. Miguel Vargas walked and took second on a wild pitch by Scott McGough before James Outman drew a walk. But Miguel Rojas lined into the glove of shortstop Ahmed to end the threat in a game that lasted two hours and 41 minutes.Mookie Betts drew a leadoff walk against McGough in the ninth. He got erased when Freddie Freeman grounded into a fielder's choice to first against Andrew Chafin, who got his first save. Will Smith grounded out before Max Muncy flied out to left to end the game.“It's a great win,” Chafin said. “We finally made it work.”Drey Jameson (1-0) got the win with four innings of relief. He struck out five and walked three.“Drey did a great job coming in,” Arizona starter Merrill Kelly said. “He's going to get really big outs and be a really big player down in our bullpen.”The Dodgers wasted a sharp outing from Dustin May, who scattered three hits while pitching into the seventh inning for the first time in his career. He struck out four and walked one in his season debut. The big right-hander with the flowing red hair had an abbreviated season last year after coming off Tommy John surgery in 2021.Throwing free and easy all night, May gave up a double to Corbin Carroll in the second, a single to Christian Walker in the fourth and a two-out single to Gabriel Moreno in the seventh.Betts homered in the seventh for the Dodgers' lone run.Kelly gave up three hits in 3 2/3 innings.

Phoenix traded for the 13-time All-Star in a deadline deal back in February.“I like how we played in the first half, but it was a bad second half for us,"" Durant said. “We just let our foot off the gas a little and they were playing extremely hard. ... We've just got to do a better job of sticking with it.”The Nuggets rested a big chunk of their starting lineup, including reigning MVP Nikola Jokic, guards Jamal Murray and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and forward Michael Porter Jr. But they still showed fight after trailing 60-40 at halftime.“I am immensely proud,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “You are down 27 points on the road, second half, second night in a row. Every reason just to roll over and play dead and get ready for Sunday at home. Guys just wouldn't do it.”The Suns pushed their advantage to 27 midway through the third quarter, but the Nuggets pulled to 84-74 heading into the fourth quarter. Denver cut it to 97-93 in the final minute, but Josh Okogie nailed a corner 3 to seal it for the Suns. Okogie had 14 points on 5-of-8 shooting, including four 3-pointers, and Chris Paul had 13 assists.Aaron Gordon had 26 points, nine rebounds and six assists to lead the Nuggets. Bruce Brown scored 16 points and Reggie Jackson had 13. The overmatched but feisty Nuggets got 22 points from the bench.“It was our energy and our effort,” backup guard Peyton Watson said. “We know we were missing guys but that doesn’t change the culture here. We always want to play hard, get stops.”Durant shot 11 of 15 from the field in a dominant performance two days after a rough shooting night in his home debut against Minnesota. The 34-year-old star has battled knee and ankle injuries over the past few months, but appears to be getting healthy as the Suns continue to cling to the No. 4 spot in the Western Conference playoff race.The Suns scored just 16 points in the fourth quarter on Friday, but managed to hang on for the victory.“We're trying to find that rhythm and trying to get wins at the same time,” Booker said.KD ON CLARKPart of the Suns' postgame chatter in the locker room had nothing to do with beating the Nuggets.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853070,Gender equality: coming to a Formula One racing team soon?,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Taking a break in the paddock after watching Max Verstappen during a practice session Saturday at the Australian Grand Prix, Melbourne teenager Kaitlyn Bourne was loving her day at the track.The 17-year-old Bourne, who was wearing a clear plastic poncho over a Red Bull sweater on a wintry day at Albert Park, is a massive fan of Australian Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo, who is sitting out this season.But Bourne, who comes from a motorsport-loving family and watches every Grand Prix race, hopes that one day she will have the chance to support a female F1 driver.“It is still a very male dominated sport, so it would be good to bring in more females. I think it could happen,” she said.There has not been a woman driver in a Formula 1 race for more than 40 years. But with estimates suggesting that 40% of current Formula 1 fans are female, the motorsport industry is making a concerted effort to ensure that changes.The highest-profile female driver in recent years has been Danica Patrick. The now-retired American is the most successful woman in the history of American open-wheel car racing — her victory in the 2008 Indy Japan 300 is the only win by a woman in an IndyCar Series race.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said this week in Melbourne he believes gender equality in the sport is inevitable.“I think it is fantastic to see the amount of girls, females, that are showing interest in Formula One now and we’re seeing it at all levels,” he said. “I think the interest is growing. It is appealing to more women to get involved in the sport, whether that is from an engineering basis, or across all aspects of the organization.“As the sport does become more accessible, and we are pushing to make it more accessible, I think that is something that will naturally happen anyway.”Horner was responding to reports that a team evenly divided between men and women from the cockpit to the executive offices was looking to enter F1 within two to three years.Former British American Racing founder Craig Pollock told CNN last week he hoped to debut “Formula Equal” from the 2025 or 2026 season.FIA chief executive Mohammed ben Sulayem posted on social media that he had instructed his staff to consider launching an “expressions of interest” process for prospective teams.Pollock said he had interest from financial backers for his proposal to field an 11th team.“Our ambition is to deliver and build opportunities and pathways for women to get to the very top level inside motorsports,” Pollock told CNN. “The concept and the idea is to try and build a Formula One team (that is) 50% male, 50% female, which is extremely hard to do if you have an existing Formula One team. It’s a lot easier with a clean sheet of paper.”Alpine team principal Otmar Szafnauer said the importance of equality in Formula One was clear to all participants.“So anything we can do to increase diversity in F1, I think everyone here would welcome it,” he said.Bourne, whose interest in Formula One increased via the Netflix hit series Drive to Survive, said the introduction of the W Series in 2019 was a step in the right direction. That series was criticized for not including any female drivers, even from the W series.“I think it is getting better. I know there is a women’s series now. So that is good,” she said.Aaliya Ally, who is also from Melbourne, was attending the race with a friend.“In terms of gender equality, I think it is good that there are more opportunities for women,” she said. “But I hope that it continues to get better and better and that they keep expanding it.”___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

(AP) — Jason Robertson had a goal and three assists, with his goal breaking a tie with 22 seconds remaining in the second period in the Dallas Stars' 5-2 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on Friday night.Robertson has 42 goals and 95 points, breaking Mike Modano's season scoring record for the Stars. Modano, who had 93 points in 1992-93, spoke to the team afterward.“When you are breaking records of guys like Mike Modano, that is something pretty special,” Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. “That's rare air. That's the kind of things you'll be able to tell your grandkids about.""Joe Pavelski, Roope Hintz, Jamie Benn and Max Domi also scored for Dallas, which swept the four-game season series while outscoring the Coyotes 20-6. Benn scored his 32nd on a power play five minutes into the third period for a 4-2 lead, and Domi scored into an open net with 1:01 remaining.Dallas (41-20-14) moved a point behind Minnesota and two points ahead of Colorado for the Central Division lead. The Stars play the defending Stanley Cup champion Avalanche in Denver on Saturday. Colorado has a game in hand on both.“They are kind of the measuring stick, Stanley Cup champs,” said Dallas goaltender Jake Oettinger, who had 16 saves and is scheduled to start Saturday. “It’s going to be a great test for us, back to back, going to a great barn and play a great team. I think everyone is going to be really excited.”Robertson gave the Stars a 3-2 lead after taking a pass at the blue line and working his way into the middle of the ice before putting a wrist shot through a small window.“I didn't know if I could beat the ‘D,’ so pulled up and tried to shoot through them,” Robertson said. “Lucky it went in.”DeBoer: “He's got that sneaky shot that he can beat goalies from distance. There's not many guys that can do that in this league. It was a huge goal timing-wise for us.""Jusso Valimaki and Connor Mackey scored for Arizona and Karel Vejmelka had 26 saves. The Coyotes have lost six straight.Clayton Keller assisted on Valimaki’s goal to extend his points streak to 14 games, the longest since the franchise relocated from Winnipeg in 1996. Keller is tied with Vancouver’s Elias Pettersson for the longest active points streak in the NHL.“I don't think, we played with enough urgency today,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said.Pavelski scored his 23rd goal 1:23 into the game. Esa Lindell’s pass from the let circle caromed in off Pavelski as he was being checked in front of the net.Valimaki scored on a power play five minutes into the first period and Mackey scored after a Dallas turnover late to give the Coyotes a 2-1 lead after the first period.Hintz scored his 34th goal of the season 53 seconds into the second period, when he roofed a quick wrist shot from the right circle to tie it at 2-2.""We wanted to get in and out of here as clean as possible, and I think we did that,"" deBoer said. “We got on our heels a little in the middle of the first, but came out in the second and third and kind of made sure we were going to win that game.”KELLER MAKES HISTORYKeller finished March with 24 points, the most in a calendar month in Coyotes’ history. Teemu Selanne holds the franchise record with 27 points in a month, in January and March of 1993, when the franchise was located in Winnipeg.NOTES: The Stars loaned G Scott Wedgewood to Texas of the American Hockey League on a conditioning assignment Friday. Wedgewood, who has a 2.92 goals-against average in 18 games, was acquired from the Coyotes last March for a 2023 third-round draft pick. … Vejmelka played in his 100th NHL game. … Coyotes F Laurent Dauphin (upper body) missed his fourth straight game but is expected to return Saturday. … Coyotes D Victor Soderstrom received a double-minor high sticking penalty when he hit Hintz into the boards with 7:47 remaining.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853072,Kwan leads Guardians' outburst in 9-4 win over Mariners,"SEATTLE (AP) — Steven Kwan's big night put him with select company in Cleveland's record book.Kwan became the second player in franchise history with five RBIs in either of the first two games of the season, and the Guardians took advantage of three errors by Seattle in a 9-4 win over the Mariners on Friday night.Kwan had a two-run double and two-run single to go along with a sacrifice fly, and the Guardians rebounded with 13 hits after getting shut out by Seattle on opening day.Larry Doby in 1953 was the only other player in Cleveland’s history to have five RBIs in one of the first two games.Kwan said he was trying to set a tone right away going nine pitches on the first at-bat of the game. He struck out, but felt it showed Cleveland was going to have tough at-bats against Seattle starter Robbie Ray.“I take that to heart. There’s only so much I can do in the beginning of the at-bat,” Kwan said. “But if I can kind of set the tone for everybody else and that’s really important.”Kwan’s soft double in the fourth inning that barely landed fair ended the night for Seattle starter Robbie Ray and gave Cleveland a 5-3 lead. Ray (0-1) produced a dud of a debut to this season after he looked impressive in spring training, walking five and recording just 10 outs in his 91 pitches.“I just hit it and was praying. I don't think in that moment you're really conceptualizing anything,"" Kwan said. “You're just reacting and just watch.”Kwan followed an inning later with a two-out, two-run single on a 3-2 pitch from Trevor Gott.Cleveland also capitalized on a combination of bad luck and bad defense by Seattle that led to five unearned runs.The Guardians’ first two runs scored when Teoscar Hernández’s throw from right field clipped Mike Zunino as he returned to first base and created chaos. The ricochet sent the ball offline toward the Cleveland dugout and allowed Oscar Gonzalez to tag up and score from third. Ray was first to the loose ball, but his throw to the plate to get Gonzalez was wide of catcher Cal Raleigh and rolled to the Seattle dugout, allowing Andrés Giménez to score from second base.“Our base running was excellent. We made them fight for everything,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. “Zunino got in the way of that throw and I know that’s not by design, but that really helped us. Our base running then took over from there and really helped.”In the fifth inning, Kolten Wong dropped the feed from shortstop J.P. Crawford at second base on a potential inning-ending double play. Cleveland went on to score three unearned runs in the inning, including Kwan’s single and an RBI single from Amed Rosario.“That was very uncharacteristic to how we usually play,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “Was really not our best night, the combination of the walks and miscues in the field, and a team that does a really good job of putting the ball in play.”Reigning AL Rookie of the Year Julio Rodríguez led off with a double, his first hit of the year. He added an RBI double in the fourth off Kwan’s glove in left field. Raleigh also had a two-run double, but Seattle was held scoreless by Cleveland’s bullpen.Nick Sandlin (1-0), Eli Morgan, Enyel De Los Santos, Trevor Stephan and Emmanuel Clase combined for 5 1/3 scoreless innings, allowing two hits with eight strikeouts.UP NEXTGuardians: RHP Aaron Civale was 5-6 with a 4.92 ERA in 20 starts last season for Cleveland. He has a 5.50 ERA in three career appearances against Seattle.Mariners: RHP Logan Gilbert is 1-1 in three career starts against Cleveland. It will be his first home start since Sept. 30, 2022, when he allowed one run in eight innings the night Seattle clinched a playoff berth.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

Mikael Backlund had two assists and Jacob Markstrom finished with 14 saves.“I think it speaks volume to the character that we have in this room,” Stecher said. “Tonight, it seemed like any time we scored, we took a step backwards. It’s not something you want to do but at the end of the day, we find a way to get two points and stay in the (playoff) hunt.”Calgary remained two points out of a playoff spot with five games left in the regular season.“We were pretty resilient,” Calgary coach Darryl Sutter said. “There was a lot of things that could have taken you out of the game right? But it actually helped us in some ways.”Elias Pettersson, Conor Garland, Anthony Beauvillier and Aidan McDonough all scored for Vancouver, which lost its second straight in overtime to fall to 3-0-2 in its last five games. Thatcher Demko stopped 36 shots.“We battled. It’s tough,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said. “They had six power plays. We couldn’t handle their forecheck. I thought they were dumping a lot of pucks. And we tried to have a game plan, I thought a couple of guys didn’t execute.”In the extra period, Backlund sprung Toffoli for a breakaway and the Flames forward made no mistakes, putting a shot up and over Demko to end the game.The Flames forced overtime with a late power-play goal after Pettersson was called for high-sticking. Noah Hanifin sent a hard shot off the end boards from the point and the puck bounced to Huberdeau, who fired it past Demko from the bottom of the faceoff circle, tying the score 4-4 with 3:13 remaining in the third period.Flames were 1 for 6 with the man advantage and the Canucks went 1 for 2.Vancouver was outshot 11-6 in the first period, but led 1-0 going into the first intermission.Garland started the scoring 8:30 into the game as he sprinted into Calgary territory on a breakaway and fired a shot under Markstrom’s glove for his 14th goal of the season.Pettersson made it 2-0 with a power-play goal 36 seconds into the second as he blasted a rocket past Markstrom from the top of the faceoff circle for his 36th goal of the season. It extended his point streak to a career-high 14 games, with eight goals and 12 assists in the stretch.Toffoli tucked a backhanded shot in for his career-high 32nd to get the Flames on the scoreboard at 2:55 of the second.The Flames tied it about six minutes later as Backlund’s shot ricocheted of Demko’s pad and Coleman batted the puck in from the top of the crease for his 18th.The Canucks took a 3-2 lead when McDonough got his first NHL goal with 7:48 remaining in the middle period when he knocked in the rebound of Sheldon Dries' backhander.“It was great,” said McDonough, who celebrated the achievement on the ice with his childhood friend and Canucks teammate Jack Rathbone. “Obviously, you dream about scoring that on the driveway or in the backyard your whole life. And to get one there was, it was pretty special.”Stecher tied it with 4:08 left in the period as he got a cross-ice pass from Nazem Kadri and fired a shot past Demko for his second.The Canucks went ahead again just 14 seconds later as Nils Aman found Beauvillier at the side of the net on a 2-on-1.Vancouver led 4-3 after 40 minutes despite being outshot 26-12. Calgary had 11-2 edge in the third period.HOCKEY PRIDEThe Canucks held their annual Pride night, featuring themed warm-up jerseys, special entertainment before and during the game, and video messages from people in the LGBTQ community.Vancouver forward Andrei Kuzmenko skipped warm-ups in order to avoid wearing the special uniforms, designed by a local artist.

This FONOP “upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law by challenging the restrictions on innocent passage imposed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and Vietnam,” the 7th Fleet said in a statement. The maneuver also challenged “the PRC’s claim to straight baselines enclosing the Paracel Islands,” it added.
The 7th Fleet maintained that illegal maritime activities in the South China Sea “pose a serious threat to the freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for South China Sea littoral nations.”
The U.S. safeguards freedom of navigation for all nations, and as long as certain countries continue to make unlawful territorial claims, it will continue to defend the rights and freedoms of the sea, the 7th Fleet said.










China defense minister spokesperson Tan Kefei (譚克非 ) blasted the operation, and accused the U.S. Navy of “undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea.” “We sternly demand the U.S. side to immediately stop such provocative behaviors, otherwise it would take the serious consequences of every eventuality it caused,” he said.

Ukrainian counteroffensives took back large areas from August through November.Then the fighting got bogged down in attritional warfare during the bitter winter and into the muddy, early spring thaw.Now, Kyiv can take advantage of improved weather to seize the battlefield initiative with new batches of Western weapons, including scores of tanks, and fresh troops trained in the West.But Russian forces are dug in deep, lying in wait behind minefields and along kilometers (miles) of trenches.HOW HAS RUSSIA FARED SO FAR?The war has exposed embarrassing shortcomings in the Kremlin's military prowess.The battlefield setbacks include Russia's failure to reach Kyiv in the early days of the invasion, its inability to hold some areas and its failure to take the devastated eastern city of Bakhmut despite seven months of fighting. Attempts to break the Ukrainian will to fight, such as relentlessly striking the country's power grid, have failed too.Moscow’s intelligence services badly misjudged Ukraine’s resolve and the West’s response. The invasion also depleted Russian military resources, triggering difficulties with ammunition supplies, morale and troop numbers.Russian President Vladimir Putin, apparently concerned that the war could erode public support for his government, has avoided an all-out push for victory through a mandatory mass mobilization.“The Russians have no end of problems,” said James Nixey, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a think tank in London.Realizing he cannot win the war any time soon, Putin aims to hunker down and drag out the fighting in the hope that Western support for Kyiv eventually frays, Nixey said.Russia’s strategy is designed around ""getting the West to crumble,” he said.WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE UKRAINIANS?The Ukrainian military starts the season with an influx of powerful weapons.Germany said this week that it had delivered the 18 Leopard 2 tanks it promised to Ukraine. Poland, Canada and Norway have also handed over their pledged Leopard tanks. British Challenger tanks have arrived too.Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said he’s hopeful Western partners will supply at least two battalions of the German-made Leopard 2s by April. He also expects six or seven battalions of Leopard 1 tanks, with ammunition, from a coalition of countries.Also pledged are U.S. Abrams tanks and French light tanks, along with Ukraine soldiers recently trained in their use.The Western help has been vital in strengthening Ukraine’s dogged resistance and shaping the course of the war. Zelenskyy recognizes that without U.S. help, his country has no chance to prevail.The new supplies, including howitzers, anti-tank weapons and 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition, will add more muscle to the Ukraine military and give it a bigger punch.“Sheer numbers of tanks can drive a deeper wedge into Russian holding positions,” Nixey said.In their counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces will look to break through the land corridor between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula, moving from Zaporizhzhia toward Melitopol and the Azov Sea, according to Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov.If successful, the Ukrainians ""will split the Russian troops into two halves and cut off supply lines to the units that are located further to the west, in the direction of Crimea,” Zhdanov said.WHAT MIGHT THE END GAME BE?The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, reckons that Ukraine will need to launch a series of counteroffensives, not just one, to get the upper hand.The operations would have “the twin aims of persuading Putin to accept a negotiated compromise or of creating military realities sufficiently favorable to Ukraine that Kyiv and its Western allies can then effectively freeze the conflict on their own regardless of Putin’s decisions,” the institute said in an assessment published this week.Nixey has no doubt that each side will keep “tearing chunks out of each other” over the coming months in the hope of gaining an advantage at the negotiating table.A make-or-break period may lie ahead: If Kyiv fails to make progress on the battlefield with its Western-supplied weapons, allies may become reluctant to send it more of the expensive hardware.The stakes are high: Defeat for Ukraine would “have global ramifications, and there will be no such thing as European security as we (currently) understand it,” Nixey said.___Associated Press Writer Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853102,"Credit Suisse takeover hits heart of Swiss banking, identity","GENEVA (AP) — The UBS takeover of embattled rival Credit Suisse has shaken Switzerland’s self-image and dented its reputation as a global financial center, analysts say, warning that the country’s prosperity could grow too dependent on a single banking behemoth.The uncertain future of a union of Switzerland’s two global banks comes at a thorny time for Swiss identity, built nearly as much on a self-image of finesse in finance as on know-how with chocolate, watchmaking and cheese.Regulators who helped orchestrate the $3.25 billion deal have a lot on their plates as UBS checks the books of its rival, cherry-picks the parts it wants and dispenses with the rest.“The real question is what’s going to happen, because we’ll now have a mastodon — a monster — that will be increasingly too big to fail,” said Marc Chesney, a finance professor at the University of Zurich. “The danger is that over time, it will take more risks knowing that it is too big for the Swiss state to abandon it.”After studying the numbers, he said, the total value of exotic securities — like options or future contracts — held by the merged bank could be worth 40 times Switzerland’s economic output.“Over time, UBS will control the Swiss state, rather than the other way around,"" Chesney said.The neutral, prosperous country of about 8.5 million people enjoys the highest gross domestic product per capita of any country its size. Switzerland's relatively low-tax and pro-privacy environment draws well-heeled expats, and it regularly ranks among the most innovative countries. Over generations, it has become a global hub for wealth management, private banking and commodities trading.That climate also has bred a reputation as a secret haven of billions in ill-gotten or laundered money, with the Tax Justice Network ranking Switzerland second only to the U.S. in financial secrecy.That was on display this week when a U.S. Senate committee's two-year investigation found that Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.Such turmoil at the Switzerland's second-largest bank, which also includes hedge fund losses and fines for failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine ring, made it vulnerable as U.S. bank collapses stirred market upheaval this month.Now, many conservatives are reviving their calls for Switzerland to turn inward.Christoph Blocher, a former government minister and power broker of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party, blasted the Credit Suisse-UBS deal as “very, very dangerous, not just for Switzerland or the United States, but the entire world.”“This has to stop,” he told French-language public broadcaster RTS. “Swiss banks must remain Swiss and keep their operations in Switzerland.”If Switzerland wants to be a strong financial center, it needs a strong globally significant bank, said Sergio Ermotti, who was CEO at UBS for nine years and will return to help shepherd the takeover.“For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail' — it's rather ‘too small to survive,’"" Ermotti said at a news conference this week. ”And we want to be a winner out of this.”Gregoire Bordier, scion of an illustrious Geneva banking family who chairs the Association of Swiss Private Banks, played down the size of the merged institution, estimating that it would have roughly the same weight in Switzerland as Dutch giant ING does relative to the Netherlands' economic output.“Rather than arranging the dissection of the last great ‘universal bank’ in this country — and let rival finance companies benefit — it's above all necessary to roll out much greater control measures for the new UBS,” Bordier told the Tribune de Geneve newspaper.Still, he acknowledged that the combined entity's potential importance within Switzerland was ""another question,” saying he reacted to the banks' shotgun marriage, announced on prime-time TV, as if watching “a bad soap opera.”Critics say the federal government was asleep at the wheel and hadn’t learned from the 2008 global financial crisis.Blocher’s protégé, Ueli Maurer — who was finance minister until stepping down in December — championed a hands-off approach to banks like Credit Suisse to let them sort out their own troubles.The Credit Suisse rescue is a stain on regulators and the idea that putting money into a Swiss bank means it’s “rock solid and safe,” overseen by the world's best financial managers, said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC.“That reputation has gone up in smoke, and it’s very hard to regain that reputation,” Marenzi said. “Unfortunately, a reputation that you built up over years and decades and maybe even centuries, you can destroy really quickly.”Beyond banking, Switzerland’s image has been unsteady recently, generating debate ahead of parliamentary elections in October.A web of bilateral deals with the European Union, Switzerland's biggest trading partner, are clouded under a standoff with Brussels. The country's constitutionally enshrined commitment to “neutrality” has angered Western nations that are blocked from shipping Swiss-made arms to Ukraine so it can fight Russia.Swiss diplomats, who have been intermediaries between Iran and Saudi Arabia since the countries broke off ties in 2016, were absent as China brokered an agreement this month to restore relations between the Mideast rivals.Scott Miller, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland who is a former UBS executive in Colorado, upshifted the debate about how the European country interprets its idea of neutrality.Miller told the Neue Zuericher Zeiting newspaper this month that Switzerland was facing its ""biggest crisis since the Second World War” and urged the Swiss to do more to help Ukraine defend itself — or at least not block others from doing so.Before the bank marriage was engineered on March 19, Credit Suisse was hemorrhaging deposits, shareholders were dumping its stock and creditors were rushing to seek repayment.Since then, some smaller Swiss banks have reported an influx of deposits from Credit Suisse customers. Staffers face the prospect of sweeping job cuts, though details may take weeks or months to iron out.The fallout is far from over.A special session of Parliament next month is expected to discuss the takeover, including “too big to fail” legislation and possible penalties against Credit Suisse managers.Sascha Steffen, a professor of finance at Germany’s Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, said “having such a huge bank isn’t necessarily bad,” pointing to efficiencies.But creating a behemoth could make it harder for small businesses to get credit. The way the takeover was done — using emergency measures to tweak Swiss law and shucking the bondholder-shareholder pecking order on losses — has unsettled investors.“The false marriage that was initiated by the government was something markets don’t really like, particularly when there was no involvement of other stakeholders whatsoever,” Steffen said.“The attractiveness as a place to invest is definitely damaged,” he said.___AP Business Writers David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, and Courtney Bonnell in London contributed.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853103,Charles wins hearts in Germany as soft power pays off,"BERLIN (AP) — King Charles III won plenty of hearts during his three-day visit to Germany, his first foreign trip since ascending to the throne following the death of his mother, Elizabeth II, last year.Charles' tour saw a number of firsts that show the importance both countries placed on it — at a time when London and Berlin are trying to rebuild relations frayed by Britain's departure from the European Union.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier took the unprecedented step of welcoming Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, at the Brandenburg Gate with military honors Wednesday. A day later, Charles became the first monarch to address the Bundestag, the German parliament, stressing the long-standing close ties between both countries and the importance of future cooperation.Observers in both Germany and the U.K. said the trip sent a strong signal about the enduring strength of British-German relations.Jens Zimmermann, a lawmaker from Germany's center-left Social Democrats, said Charles sent a “clear message” by speaking to parliament partially in German.""The speech in the Bundestag was very well-received,"" Zimmermann told The Associated Press. “It was much more political than you might have expected. It was very connecting — I think that was very good.”In the speech, Charles emphasized that London and Berlin have provided considerable aid to Ukraine in its efforts to fend off Russia’s invasion — praise that will have been gratifying to a German government more used to claims it's not doing enough to help Kyiv. Zimmermann said Charles thanking Germans for taking in so many Ukrainians seeking shelter from the war might also be seen as a roundabout criticism of the British government's recent anti-refugee policies.Although King Charles cannot pass legislation or directly impact British policy, the “soft power” of his visit should not be underestimated, Zimmermann said.Others said that after the pandemic's long-distance diplomacy, in-person visits like Charles' can help deepen and renew relationships between leaders.“I think as coronavirus has faded, we’ve been reminded of the value of face-to-face meetings,” said Bronwen Maddox, chief executive of the Chatham House think tank.“And it just does add something to relationships, particularly between heads of state, who are very insulated,"" she said. ""I think it has been received very well.”Charles originally planned to visit France first, but anti-government protests there led both governments to postpone that part of his trip. The new itinerary put the focus on Germany, where Charles has family roots and the royals have long been the subject of keen interest.That fascination was on display among the German public at Charles' appearances. Despite the wet and cold spring weather, well-wishers waited patiently to greet Charles and Camilla at their stops in Berlin and Hamburg, a city that sees itself as having a particularly close connection to Britain due to its long seafaring and trading ties.Charles and Camilla also laid a wreath at the remains of St. Nikolai church to commemorate the more than 30,000 people, mostly German civilians, who were killed in Operation Gomorrah, the Allied bombing of Hamburg in July 1943. A boat trip and a farewell reception involving musical performances, including by a Beatles cover band and a sea shanty group, rounded off the king’s visit on Friday.Michael Kruse, a lawmaker with the pro-business Free Democrats who like Zimmermann is a member of the German-British parliamentary group, said the two countries continue to have many common economic interests despite Britain's divorce from the EU.“The channel has widened due to Brexit,” he said. “That's why the visit by Britain's head of state was all the more important.”Kruse voiced a hope shared by many in Germany, that London will find its way back into the 27-nation bloc.“My hope is still that the British will someday recognize Brexit was a mistake and return to the EU,” he said. “The door should always be open for this. Until then, we say: see you again, King Charles III.”___Danica Kirka in London contributed.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853104,"Small areas reopen near Fukushima nuclear plant, few return","TOKYO (AP) — Evacuation orders were lifted in small sections of a Japanese town just southwest of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant on Saturday, in time for the area’s popular cherry blossom season, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida joined a ceremony to mark the reopening.The area of about 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) where entry restrictions were lifted is part of Tomioka town, most of which had already been reopened since an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered triple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Former residents and visitors celebrated the latest reopening as they strolled along a street known as “the cherry blossoms tunnel.”Koichi Ono, 75, was back to the neighborhood where he grew up and lived all his life until he was forced to evacuate. “After 12 years, I can finally return to my life here,"" he told NHK television. “The disaster hit when I was just starting my retirement life, so I'm starting all over again.”Ono, who learned indigo and vegetable dying while evacuating, wants to open a workshop to serve as a meeting place for people. “I hope more people come and visit.”At the ceremony, Kishida pledged to keep working to reopen all no-go zones.“The lifting of the evacuation is by no means a final goal, but the start of the recovery,” Kishida said.The 2011 disaster caused massive amounts of radiation to leak from the plant, and more than 160,000 residents had to evacuate from across Fukushima, including about 30,000 who are still unable to return home.Tomioka is one of 12 nearby towns fully or partially designated as no-go zones. The two sections in Tomioka that reopened for the first time in 12 years represent one-fifth of the worst-hit no-go zone and were selected by the government along with several other locations in the region for intensive decontamination.But jobs, daily necessities and infrastructure remain insufficient, making it difficult for younger people to return, and families with small children worry about possible radiation effects.""The living environment and many other things still need to be sorted out,” Tomioka Mayor Ikuo Yamamoto told reporters.In the newly reopened Yonomori and Osuge districts of Tomioka, just over 50 of about 2,500 registered residents have reportedly returned or expressed intention to go back to live. Only about 10% of the town’s pre-disaster population of 16,000 have returned since large areas of Tomioka reopened in 2017.Town surveys show a majority of former residents say they have decided not to return because they have already found jobs and educations and built relationships elsewhere.The evacuation order was lifted in several sections of another hard-hit town, Namie, northwest of the plant, on Friday. The reopened area accounts for only about 20% of the town.“I have mixed feelings because there are many residents who still cannot return or have no idea when they can return,"" said Namie Mayor Eiko Yoshida at an evacuation-lifting ceremony on Friday.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853105,Verstappen takes pole position at F1 Australian Grand Prix,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Max Verstappen will have his best chance of claiming an inaugural Australian Grand Prix title after taking pole position in his Red Bull for Sunday’s third race of the Formula One season on the Albert Park circuit.Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton is among rivals sharing renewed hope after the dominance Red Bull has had over its rivals was diminished during Saturday’s qualifying session.Verstappen, a two-time world champion, was not pleased with the performance of his RB19 despite setting a track record around the circuit on Saturday.After setting a lap record during practice earlier on Saturday, the drivers’ championship leader set a benchmark of 1 minute, 16:732 seconds in the final session of qualifying.“I have been on the podium once, but I want to be on a different step this time,” Verstappen said after claiming his first pole position in Australia.His teammate Sergio Perez, who sits just one point behind the Dutch driver in the championship, will start from the back of the grid after enduring a horrible day in Melbourne.After declaring Red Bull would win every race this season after their supremacy in Bahrain, Mercedes driver George Hamilton shared the front row of the starting grid after recording a time 0.236 seconds slower than Verstappen.Hamilton will start in third position on what was an encouraging day for Mercedes, with Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso qualifying fourth.“This is totally unexpected. For us to be up in the two front rows is a dream,” Hamilton said. “To be this close to Red Bull is incredible. I think this gives everyone in the team a boost and a glimpse of hope. This will spur everyone on. It will inspire everyone to continue to push.”Verstappen, who won the season-opening race in Bahrain, was progressively faster on Saturday but raised concerns about his car on the lap prior to setting the new mark.“Downshifts are getting worse as well,” Verstappen said.Verstappen said he has confidence in the Red Bull’s reliability. But he was surprised by how close the Mercedes pair finished.“I think the last run was very good. The whole weekend has been very tough … but it all worked out in Q3,” he said. “I think we always try to fine-tune and we will continue to do that. I think tomorrow we will have a good race car, but it is quite tricky on the tires.”Russell and Hamilton believe Perez, who won the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix two weeks ago, will struggle to contend after his difficulties on Saturday, saying passing is difficult around Albert Park.Perez endured a difficult Saturday as he struggled to retain control of his RB19. After experiencing difficulties in the third and final practice session earlier on Saturday, the 33-year-old’s wheels locked at Turn 3 early, with Perez ending up in the gravel.In a sharp exchange with his team over radio, Perez complained the mechanical problem was the same issue that plagued him during P3 earlier in the day — “it was the same (expletive) issue again,” he said.Melbourne’s Oscar Piastri will start from 16th on the grid when driving in his home Grand Prix for the first time after his McLaren failed to progress past the initial qualifying stage. McLaren’s struggles continued with Piastri’s teammate Lando Norris, who will begin from 13th position.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853108,"NBA, players reach deal for a new labor agreement","The most financially successful era in NBA history will continue uninterrupted for at least six more years, after the league and its players came to a tentative agreement on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement that will kick in this summer.It took more than a year of bargaining, with the intensity and expectation growing in recent days, and the handshake agreement was struck in the wee hours of Saturday morning — shortly after the league intended to tell the National Basketball Players Association of its plan to opt out of the current CBA on June 30.Instead, a deal got done, at least in principle. “The NBA and National Basketball Players Association have reached a tentative agreement on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement, pending ratification by players and team governors,” was the league's only comment, coming shortly before 3 a.m. Eastern.Technically, it will be a seven-year deal, though either side can opt out a year early — meaning labor peace is only assured through the 2028-29 season. It will also begin the era of an in-season tournament, something Commissioner Adam Silver has wanted for years.Barring a change to the current plan, teams will be given an 80-game schedule for next season in August. Those 80 games will include “tournament” games — probably four — that will count in regular-season standings. All teams will have two more games added to their schedule eventually so the full 82-game slate is played; the two teams that make the tournament final will be playing an 83rd game that won't count in the standings.Among other details, per a person familiar with the negotiations who spoke to The Associated Press: players will generally have to appear in at least 65 games in order to be eligible for the top individual awards such as Most Valuable Player; the maximum value of contract extensions will rise; and a third two-way contract will now be available to teams — which could potentially see roster sizes grow from 17 to 18. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the National Basketball Players Association released specifics publicly.Another new part of the CBA will be a second luxury tax level that, when reached, will keep teams from using their midlevel exception to sign players. That was a clear compromise, given how some teams wanted the so-called “upper spending limit” that would have essentially installed an absolute ceiling on what can be spent each season and help balance the playing field between the teams that are willing to pay enormous tax bills — like the reigning NBA champion Golden State Warriors — and those who aren't.“Players lose again ... Middle and Lower spectrum teams don’t spend because they don’t want to,” Golden State's Draymond Green posted to Twitter. “They want to lose. So increase their spending capabilities, just to increase them. They continue to cut out the middle. And this is what we rushed into a deal for?”National Basketball Players Association President CJ McCollum, a guard for the New Orleans Pelicans, said he welcomes input from all players, but stressed, “You can’t make everybody happy. That’s impossible.“You’ve got to be able to do what’s best for the collective,” McCollum said after the Pelicans defeated the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night. “There’s 450 players and 450 different opinions, including myself. … It’s about finding a happy medium in certain areas.”The new CBA won't include a return to the policy that would allow high school players to enter the NBA draft. It was discussed and has been an agenda item for months, but the rule won't be changing anytime soon — probably not for at least the term of the next CBA.“We also appreciate that there is a lot of benefit to really having veterans who can bring those 18-year-olds along,” NBPA executive director Tamika Tremaglio said in February during an NBPA news conference at All-Star weekend. “And so, certainly anything that we would even consider, to be quite honest, would have to include a component that would allow veterans to be a part of it as well.”Silver said Wednesday, at the conclusion of a two-day Board of Governors meeting, that he was hopeful of getting a deal done by the weekend — a clear positive sign. The current CBA, which took effect July 1, 2017, came with a mutual option for either the NBA or the NBPA to opt out after six seasons, or June 30 of this year.Saturday's agreement doesn’t end the process, though it's obviously a huge step forward.The owners will have to vote on what the negotiators have hammered out, and the players will have to vote to approve the deal as well. Then comes the actual writing of the document — the most recent CBA checked in at around 600 pages containing nearly 5,000 paragraphs and 200,000 words. Much of it will be the same; much of it will need revising.And while these talks went on for more than a year, this is the second consecutive CBA to be negotiated without the dysfunction that accompanied the talks in 2011 — when the league wound up locking out players for 161 days and had to eventually shorten the 2011-12 season from 82 to 66 games.There was no appetite for a work stoppage, not after a 2021-22 season in which the NBA revenue topping $10 billion for the first time and basketball-related income reaching $8.9 billion, another record. Silver said the NBA is on pace this season for more sold-out games than ever before.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853166,Kenyan opposition leader to sue over alleged attempt on life,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga has denounced the point-blank firing of a tear gas canister at local journalists during his latest anti-government protest as a “primitive act of intolerance,” and he vows to go to court over what he called an attempt on his own life.In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, the 78-year-old longtime candidate for president spoke more about his grievances over last year’s election — a loss upheld by Kenya’s top court — than the rising prices or other painful economic issues affecting Kenyans at large.Known for his prominent role in the fight for multi-party democracy decades ago, Odinga on Friday warned against attempts by President William Ruto’s administration to declare the current protests illegal.“It’s a violation of a fundamental right to demonstrate,” said Odinga, who vowed to continue the twice-weekly protests in the capital, Nairobi, and elsewhere that began last week and have been marked at times by violence.He spoke before traveling to Kisumu, his stronghold in western Kenya, which has also been rocked by the demonstrations.The independent Policing Oversight Authority has said it is investigating four incidents of police shooting and killing of protesters since the demonstrations began — Odinga said his party is still compiling a toll — and private property belonging to former President Uhuru Kenyatta’s family has been attacked. The Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome said one officer died after Thursday’s protests and 20 were seriously injured.Diplomats, human rights groups and religious leaders have expressed alarm as memories of Kenya’s deadly post-election violence in 2007 remain fresh for many, and the African Union has called for dialogue. U.S. Sen. Chris Coons this week met with Odinga and Kenya’s vice president.As footage circulated on social media of a man firing the tear gas into a vehicle and injuring journalists, the Media Council of Kenya on Thursday called March 2023 the “darkest month for Kenyan media since the clamor for multi-party democracy” in the 1980s.Odinga asserted that an attempt was made on his life Thursday as he rode around Nairobi neighborhoods rallying thousands of residents. He showed The Associated Press dents in his armored vehicle that he said were left by bullets.“We could hear gunshots and we thought they were shooting in the air, but we heard the car being hit several times,” Odinga said.“That’s when I decided to take cover and lie on the seat. There is no mistaking that the intention was basically to kill, an attempt on my life, which is unfortunate. So, if this vehicle was not armored, the story would be different,” he said.Next to his official vehicle were two escort cars whose rear windshields were shattered. Inside the vehicles, the strong smell of tear gas was still present.Odinga says he has instructed his lawyers to proceed to court over the incident.As the chaos played out, Kenya’s president was elsewhere in Nairobi promoting the country as a “regional investment destination” at a American Chamber of Commerce summit.Ruto last commented on the protests on Tuesday during a visit to Europe, when he said Kenyans must obey the rule of law.Odinga said he has had no contact with Ruto since the protests began. “We say we are ready with conditions for negotiations, but the other side is being contemptuous, they are not listening,” he said.The anti-government protests will continue on Mondays and Thursdays until the government hears opposition demands on last year’s election and on the economy, Odinga said.“We are saying the high cost of living is not something that can be left to wait. Kenyans have suffered seriously, and we are saying subsidies should be reinstated now,” he said, referring to popular subsidies on fuel and maize that Ruto’s administration ended.The year-on-year inflation rate in Kenya was 9.2% in February, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, largely driven by rising prices for food, fuel and transport. The price of the staple fortified maize flour was up 21.5% from a year ago.Amid the frustration by many Kenyans, Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki, who oversees the police, on Wednesday warned that the violence and disruption of daily life “portend real and imminent danger of our country sliding into irretrievable anarchy.”Odinga said people who loot and attack are criminals who should be dealt with within the law, but he placed blame outside his supporters.“The gangs are imported into town to make it appear as if the demonstrators are causing chaos. Those are organized groups,” he asserted.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853167,"Pope Francis leaves hospital; 'Still alive,' he quips","ROME (AP) — A chipper-sounding Pope Francis was discharged Saturday from the Rome hospital where he was treated for bronchitis, quipping to journalists before being driven away that he's “still alive.”Francis, 86, was hospitalized at Gemelli Polyclinic on Wednesday following his weekly public audience in St. Peter's Square after reportedly experiencing breathing difficulties. The pontiff received antibiotics administered intravenously during his stay, the Vatican said.In a sign of his improved health, the Vatican released details of Francis' Holy Week schedule. It said he would preside at this weekend's Palm Sunday Mass and at Easter Mass on April 9, both held in St. Peter's Square and expected to draw tens of thousands of faithful. A Vatican cardinal will be at the altar to celebrate both Masses, a recent practice due to the pontiff having a troublesome knee issue.But Francis is scheduled to celebrate Holy Thursday Mass, which this year will be held in a juvenile prison in Rome. Still unclear was whether he would attend the late-night, torch-lit Way of the Cross procession at Rome's Colosseum to mark Good Friday.Before departing Gemelli Polyclinic late Saturday morning, Francis comforted a Rome couple whose 5-year-old daughter died Friday night at the Catholic hospital. Outside, Serena Subania, mother of Angelica, sobbed as she pressed her head into the chest of the pope, who held her close and whispered words of comfort.Francis seemed eager to linger with well-wishers. When a boy showed him his arm cast, the pope made a gesture as if to ask “Do you have a pen?” Three papal aides whipped out theirs. Francis took one of the pens and added his signature to the child's already well-autographed cast.The pontiff answered in a low voice that was close to a whisper when reporters peppered him with questions, indicating he had felt unwell — “I felt sick,"" he said, pointing to his mid-section — a symptom that convinced his medical staff to take him to the hospital Wednesday.Asked how he felt now, Francis joked, “Still alive, you know.” He gave a thumbs-up sign.Francis exited the hospital from a side entrance, but his car stopped in front of the main entrance, where a gaggle of journalists waited. He opened the car door himself and got out from the front passenger seat. Francis had a cane ready to lean on.After chatting, he got back into the white Fiat 500 car that drove him away from Gemelli Polyclinic. But instead of heading straight home, his motorcade sped right past Vatican City and went to St. Mary Major Basilica, a Rome landmark that is one of his favorites.There, startled tourists rushed to snap photos of him as he sat in a wheelchair, which he has used often to navigate longer distances in recent years due to a chronic knee problem. When he emerged after praying, residents and tourists in the street called out repeatedly, “Long live the pope!” and clapped.Francis spent 10 days at the same hospital in July 2021 following intestinal surgery for a bowel narrowing, After his release back then, he also stopped to offer prayers of thanksgiving at St. Mary Major Basilica, which is home to an icon depicting the Virgin Mary. He also visits the church upon returning from trips abroad.Before leaving the hospital Saturday, Francis, while chatting with journalists, praised medical workers, saying they ""show great tenderness.""“We sick are capricious. I much admire the people who work in hospitals,” he said. Francis also said he read journalists' accounts of his illness, including in a Rome daily newspaper, and pronounced them well done.Francis stopped to talk to reporters again before he was driven into the Vatican through a gate of the tiny walled city-state, where he lives at a Holy See hotel. Speaking through an open car window, he said: “Happy Easter to all, and pray for me.''Then, indicating he was eager to resume his routine, he said, “Forward, thanks.”In response to a shouted question from a reporter, who asked if the pope would visit Hungary at the end of April as scheduled, Francis answered , “Yes.”On yet another stop, he got out of his car to distribute chocolate Easter eggs to the police officers who drove the motorcycles at the head of his motorcade.Given his strained voice, it was unclear if the pope would read the homily at the Palm Sunday service or deliver the usually lengthy “Urbi et Orbi” (Latin for to the city and to the world) address, a review of the globe's conflicts, at the end of Easter Mass.He told reporters that after Palm Sunday Mass, he would keep his weekly appointment to greet and bless the public in St. Peter's Square.As a young man in his native Argentina, Francis had part of a lung removed, leaving him particularly vulnerable to any respiratory illness.__Gregorio Borgia contributed reporting.",2023/04/02,,World

Charter’s spirit of peace, but also disappointed by seeking excuses for China’s plans for invasion and expansion, according to the MOFA statement.The ministry described Taiwan as being on the frontline for the defense of democracy, and as continuing to cooperate with other free nations in promoting an open Indo-Pacific as part of a stable and prosperous world.",2023/04/01,1965,Politics

Saturday was the first day of a two-week spring vacation for most schools in Britain.While the port said bus passengers faced the longest delays, local media reports showed long lines of cars and trucks as well. Ferry operator DFDS said that due to the heavy traffic, it was offering a “shuttle service” that would put passengers on the next available ship as soon as they check in.“Whilst freight and car traffic was processed steadily regardless of the additional challenging weather conditions and high seasonal volumes, coach traffic suffered significant delays due to lengthy French border processes and sheer volume,” the port said in a statement.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853206,Those who stayed hope to make Michigan a national champion,"ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Those who stay will be champions has been a Michigan football mantra for generations, dating to Bo Schembechler saying those six words to his first team in 1969.The two-time defending Big Ten champion Wolverines, who played their spring game Saturday, are thrilled many key players chose to stay this season in the hopes of handling unfinished business.Jim Harbaugh's last two teams beat rival Ohio State, went on to win conference championship games and lose in the College Football Playoffs.“It's not perfect, 13-1, but that’s we keep striving for,” Harbaugh said entering his ninth season. “We keep chasing that perfection.”Motivated to help Michigan win its first national title since 1997, several players chose to come back this year instead of entering the NFL draft.All-America running back Blake Corum, all-Big Ten offensive guards Zak Zinger and Trevor Keegan along with linebacker Michael Barrett, defensive lineman Kris Jenkins, cornerback Mike Sainristil and receiver Cornelius Johnson were among those who stayed.“Selfishly, really happy,” Harbaugh acknowledged.J.J. McCarthy is, too.“Those are the guys that we need to win a national championship,” said McCarthy, who beat Big Ten-championship winning quarterback Cade McNamara to be the team's starter last season. “They're some of the roots of our program, roots of our culture. Just being able to have them back, it’s an extreme blessing. They could go off and make their millions and go into the pros, but they decided to stay back and accomplish something that has been accomplished in a long time.”The Wolverines are expected to have a shot at contending again.Two-time defending national champion Georgia is a strong favorite followed by Alabama, the Buckeyes and Michigan, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.In addition to the having players who put their NFL dreams on hold, Michigan has McCarthy, dual-threat running back Donovan Edwards, linebacker Junior Colson and cornerback Will Johnson to put plenty of playmakers on both sides of the ball.Harbaugh also bolstered the roster with a relative influx of transfers. He has added former Stanford center Drake Nugent, ex-Indiana tight end A.J. Barner, former Nebraska linebacker Ernest Hausmann and ex-Coastal Carolina defensive end Josaiah Stewart to increase competition for jobs.As talented as the Wolverines appear, they will have have plenty of reasons to push themselves this summer and into the season after finding out painfully how much of a gap that there is between them and college football's best.Georgia humbled Michigan with a 34-11 win in the semifinals last year and TCU scored 51 points in a six-point win against the Wolverines in the semifinals three months ago.A potential distraction also is looming over the program.Michigan received notice earlier this year that the NCAA is looking into potential rules infractions in the Harbaugh-led program.The investigation involves impermissible texts and calls — including some by Harbaugh — to high school prospects during part of a pandemic-related dead period for contact with potential recruits. The NCAA also is looking at whether a member of Michigan’s off-field football staff violated rules by doing on-the-field coaching during practice.Harbaugh told NCAA investigators in multiple meetings that he will not agree to an unethical conduct charge, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details of the investigation have not been shared.Publicly, Harbaugh has declined comment and may dodge more questions about an investigation that may potentially linger through the 2023 season and perhaps even longer if he, the school and NCAA engage in an off-the-field dispute.___Follow Larry Lage on Twitter at https://twitter.com/larrylage___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 Sign up for the AP Top 25 newsletter here: https://link.apnews.com/join/6nr/morning-wire-newsletter-footer-internal-ads",2023/04/02,,World

Shipments to the United States rose 1.6%, while those to the European Union fell 1.2%.Semiconductor exports slumped 34.5%, in the eighth month of falls, but with the pace easing from a month before. Car exports jumped 64.2% to a record amount, but petrochemical products fell 25.1%.Imports in March fell 6.4% to $59.75 billion, versus a 3.5% rise in the previous month and a 6.6% fall expected by economists. It was the fastest drop since August 2020.As a result, the country clocked a trade deficit of $4.62 billion in March. It was the 13th consecutive monthly deficit, but the smallest since September 2022.(Reporting by Jihoon Lee; Editing by Choonsik Yoo, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Raju Gopalakrishnan)",2023/04/01,,World

Business owners during the Islamic holy month often hand out cash and food, especially to the poor. An initial report from the police says nine women, aged between 40 and 80, and three children, aged between 10 and 15, died in the crush.Police said the eight arrests include the factory manager, who did not tell local authorities about the Ramadan alms giving.“Factory management did not open the inside gate of the factory and, due to the narrow street, the people at the tail of the line pushed elderly women and children,” Superintendent of Police Investigations Dr. Hafeez Bugti told the media during a visit to the site. “As a result, pressure increased enormously, and women and children became the victims of the stampede.”Police say they issued and publicized an order saying that any person or organization planning to distribute food or other things to the poor must inform authorities in advance.The chief minister of Sindh province, where Karachi is located, announced compensation for people injured in the stampede and relatives of the victims. Murad Ali Shah said each family who lost a loved one will receive 500,000 rupees, while everyone injured will receive 100,000 rupees.Funerals were held Saturday for some of the deceased: Naseem Begum, 50, and Ma’afia Begum, 55, were buried in Karachi’s Orangi Town neighborhood. Shehzadi Umar, 60, was laid to rest in her hometown of Mirpur Mathelo, some eight hours from Karachi.At least 23 people have died in Ramadan food stampedes since the start of the holy month. On Saturday, police fired tear gas at crowds who gathered to receive free flour bags in the northwestern city of Peshawar.Cash-strapped Pakistan launched an initiative to distribute free flour among low-income families to ease the impact of record-breaking inflation and soaring poverty during the holy month.While Friday’s stampede was not part of that government program, crowds have swelled at the distribution centers in recent days. The free flour distribution initiative was launched by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif. His coalition government is facing the country’s worst economic crisis amid a delay in getting a key $1.1 billion tranche of a $6 billion bailout package originally signed in 2019 with the International Monetary Fund.Weekly inflation is 45%, unseen since Pakistan got its independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Rising food costs and soaring fuel bills have raised fears of public unrest.Neither Sharif nor Pakistani President Arif Alvi have commented on Friday’s stampede.",2023/04/01,,World

Odisha Day, referred to as Utkal Divas, was the first official event celebrated by the people of Odisha living in Taiwan. Residents of Taichung, Hsinchu, and Zhongli gathered to commemorate the creation of the state on April 1, 1936.

The celebration kicked off at noon with all the attendees reciting their state’s anthem, followed by speeches and cultural exchange activities including performances and games. Odia people gather on this day to highlight and appreciate the progress they have made in science, agriculture, and tourism.

Odisha, which used to be known as Orissa, was created on the basis of language during British rule. Several Odia-speaking regions came together and demanded their own state to recognize their distinct culture and language. Odia is one of the six classical languages in India alongside Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, with a verified historical presence of over 1500 years.

Odia Samaja Taiwan is a cultural society composed of scholars, working professionals, and families from Odisha living in Taiwan. Formed in November of last year, their mission is to share their rich heritage with others and celebrate their culture despite being far from India.

The event holds a greater global significance by encouraging immigrants to come together as a community and honor their roots, and preserve their cultural identity. Some attendees mentioned, “It is hard to feel in touch with our rich culture when we live far from India, coming to this kind of event makes me feel connected.”

One of the organizers echoed this sentiment.“Immigrants should celebrate their roots and proudly share their culture.”Odisha immigrants in Taiwan gather and celebrate their culture on April 1. (Odia Samaja Taiwan photo)",2023/04/01,760,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853264,Gerhard Richter's gift to Berlin now on show,"The ""Gerhard Richter: 100 works for Berlin"" exhibition promises to be a magnet for visitors. Gerhard Richter is one of the most highly regarded contemporary artists in the world, which makes the collection of paintings the artist gave to the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation in 2021 on permanent loan, shortly before his 90th birthday, very valuable.In determining the distribution of his estate, the artist left his birthplace, Dresden, and his hometown, Cologne, empty-handed. Richter chose Berlin, which celebrated the decision as a ""sensation.""The approximately 100 works are now on display at the Neue Nationalgalerie, and they are earmarked to find a home in the future Museum of the 20th Century.The current exhibition was developed in close collaboration with the artist.Nearly 90 works from several creative phases since the 1980s are on display beside Richter's ""Birkenau"" Holocaust cycle, including photographic-like paintings made with his characteristic wiping technique, such as ""Squatters' House"" (1989), ""4,900 Colors"" (2007) and ""Strip"" (2013/2016).The show also features overpainted photographs, in which Richter explored the field of tension between photography and painting.Richter's four-part ""Birkenau"" (2014) cycle — large abstract color canvases, crisscrossed with deep gray streaks and complemented by triplets of green and red — take center stage at the Berlin show, however. The works were created from photos secretly taken by a Jewish prisoner in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in August 1944.Art critics like to refer to Gerhard Richter, who lives in Cologne, as the ""Picasso of the 21st century."" In fact, the Dresden-born artist is one of the most successful contemporary artists. His works hang in the world's most important museums, where they fetch record sums on the art market. The art world has showered him with prizes.Richter shares little more than fame with Picasso, the pioneer of modern art in the 20th century. Even though the German artist also loves women and married three times, unlike the illustrious Spanish artist, Richter shies away from the limelight. He rarely gives interviews and avoids the stomping grounds of the glamorous art world.What he does have in common with Picasso is that he has moved from one style to the next while other artists were just discovering them.This can be observed through his early Pop Art paintings and first attempts at abstract expressionism in the early 1960s, which he declared to be ""Capitalist Realism."" It was Richter's ironic and consumer-critical response to Socialist Realism, the official art doctrine in East Germany at the timeHe has painted landscapes in the Romantic tradition, cloud paintings and seascapes, still lifes and portraits. Richter has brought representational painting into the age of photography.He has reinvented himself over and over again, at times with photorealistic depictions of nature or blurred paintings, or with glass and mirror objects, installations and overpainted photos, as well as large-scale paintings with bright colors.Constant stylistic disruption are the hallmark of his art. Few artists have explored the possibilities of painting like 91-year-old Gerhard Richter.The exhibition ""100 Works in Berlin"" will be on display at the Neue Nationalgalerie from April 1, 2023 to 2026.This article was originally written in German.",2023/04/01,,

Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the college of cardinals, has said that he would help the pope during this year's ceremonies.Health problems, including colon surgery last year, have led to speculation that the pope may follow his predecessor and retire rather than keep the job for life.ab/sms (AFP, Reuters, AP)",2023/04/01,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853268,Ukrainian court puts an Orthodox leader under house arrest,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Kyiv court ordered a leading priest to be put under house arrest Saturday after Ukraine's top security agency said he was suspected of justifying Russian aggression, a criminal offense. It was the latest move in a bitter dispute over a famed Orthodox monastery.Metropolitan Pavel is the abbot of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery, Ukraine’s most revered Orthodox site. He has denied the charges and resisted the authorities' order to vacate the complex.In a court hearing earlier in the day, the metropolitan said the claim by the Security Service of Ukraine, known as the SBU, that he condoned Russia’s invasion was politically driven and that he had “never been on the side of aggression.”After the court's ruling, a monitoring bracelet was placed around his ankle, despite his objections that he has diabetes and should not wear it. The house arrest was to last two months.“I am accepting this,” he said shortly before the bracelet was attached. “Christ was crucified on the cross, so why shouldn’t I accept this?”Earlier in the week, he cursed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, threatening him with damnation.The monks in the monastery belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has been accused of having links to Russia. The dispute surrounding the property, also known as the Monastery of the Caves, is part of a wider religious conflict that has unfolded in parallel with the war.The Ukrainian government has cracked down on the UOC over its historic ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader, Patriarch Kirill, has supported Russian President Vladimir Putin in the invasion of Ukraine.Many Orthodox communities in Ukraine have cut their ties with the UOC and transitioned to the rival Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which more than four years ago received recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.The UOC has insisted that it’s loyal to Ukraine and has denounced the Russian invasion. But Ukrainian security agencies say some in the church have maintained close ties with Moscow. The agencies have raided numerous holy sites of the church and then posted photos of rubles, Russian passports, and leaflets with messages from the Moscow patriarch as proof that some church officials have been loyal to Russia.The government had ordered the monks to leave the compound by March 29. It claims they violated their lease by making alterations to the historic site, and other technical infractions. The monks rejected the claim as a pretext.Dozens of UOC supporters gathered outside the monastery on Saturday, singing hymns in the rain. A smaller group of protesters also turned up, accusing the other side of sympathizing with Moscow.“They wash the brains of people with Russian support, and they are very dangerous for Ukraine,” said Senia Kravchuk, a 38-year-old software developer from Kyiv. “They sing songs in support of Russia, and that’s horrible, here, in the center of Kyiv.”Third-year seminary student David, 21, disagreed. Dressed in a priest’s robes and with a Ukrainian flag draped round his shoulders, he insisted the Lavra priests and residents were in no way pro-Russian. The state, he said, was trying to evict hundreds of people from Lavra without a court order.“Look at me. I’m in priest’s clothes, with a Ukrainian flag and a cross around my neck. Could you say that I’m pro-Russian?” said David, who declined to give his last name because of the tensions surrounding the issue. “The priests are currently singing a Ukrainian hymn, and they’re being called pro-Russian. Can you believe it?”In other news Saturday, Zelenskyy condemned the U.N. Security Council for allowing Russia to assume its presidency. The council’s 15 members each serve as president for a month, on a rotating basis.Zelenskyy said Russian artillery had killed a 5-month-old boy in the town of Avdiivka on Friday, “one of hundreds of artillery attacks” each day, and added that Russia presiding over the Security Council ""proves the complete bankruptcy of such institutions.”Two civilians were reported killed in Russian shelling on Saturday, one each in the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, Ukrainian authorities there said.Zelenskyy also said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday about defense cooperation.While Ukraine is preparing for a counteroffensive expected later this spring, Russian forces have kept pressing their effort to capture the city of Bakhmut. Fighting in that stronghold in Ukraine's east has dragged on for eight months.Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said during a Saturday visit to the military headquarters overseeing the action in Ukraine that Russia's defense industries have boosted production of ammunition “by several times.”The U.K. Defense Ministry said in an analysis Saturday that the Russian offensive overseen by Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian military, has fizzled.“Gerasimov’s tenure has been characterized by an effort to launch a general winter offensive with the aim of extending Russian control over the whole of the Donbas region,” the British ministry said on Twitter. “Eighty days on, it is increasingly apparent that this project has failed.”The ministry said Russian forces have made only marginal gains in the Donbas ""at the cost of tens of thousands of casualties."" Russia was ""largely squandering its temporary advantage in personnel” from a partial mobilization of 300,000 reservists Putin ordered in the fall, the U.K. analysis said. ___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/04/02,,World

Taipei filed its membership application in Sept. 2021, less than a week after China, causing concern that Beijing might try to interfere and block Taiwan’s access.The fact that an advanced economy like the U.K. needed a rigorous review process lasting two years before being accepted, should be a positive sign for Taiwan, according to Yen Huai-shing (顏慧欣), senior deputy executive director of the Taiwan World Trade Organization (WTO) and RTA Center at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER).She said that as Taiwan’s contributions to stable supply chains and to the semiconductor sector were significant, there was a strong chance that the country would be allowed to join ahead of China. Yen added that Taiwan’s promises of legislation and execution were consistent, inspiring reliability, CNA reported.In contrast to Taiwan, China’s actions after joining the WTO were somewhat different from its promises, causing some credibility problems, Yen said. China's high level of control over state-run enterprises was also a factor which might slow down its bid to join CPTPP, amid other measures seeming to go in the opposite direction from market liberalization.",2023/04/01,2716,Business
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853277,AI experts disown Musk-backed campaign citing their research,"Four artificial intelligence experts have expressed concern after their work was cited in an open letter – co-signed by Elon Musk – demanding an urgent pause in research.The letter, dated March 22 and with more than 1,800 signatures by Friday, called for a six-month circuit-breaker in the development of systems ""more powerful"" than Microsoft-backed MSFT.O OpenAI's new GPT-4, which can hold human-like conversation, compose songs and summarise lengthy documents.Since GPT-4's predecessor ChatGPT was released last year, rival companies have rushed to launch similar products.The open letter says AI systems with ""human-competitive intelligence"" pose profound risks to humanity, citing 12 pieces of research from experts including university academics as well as current and former employees of OpenAI, Google GOOGL.O and its subsidiary DeepMind.Civil society groups in the U.S. and EU have since pressed lawmakers to rein in OpenAI's research. OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Critics have accused the Future of Life Institute (FLI), the organisation behind the letter which is primarily funded by the Musk Foundation, of prioritising imagined apocalyptic scenarios over more immediate concerns about AI, such as racist or sexist biases.Among the research cited was ""On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots"", a paper co-authored by Margaret Mitchell, who previously oversaw ethical AI research at Google.Mitchell, now chief ethical scientist at AI firm Hugging Face, criticised the letter, telling Reuters it was unclear what counted as ""more powerful than GPT4"".""By treating a lot of questionable ideas as a given, the letter asserts a set of priorities and a narrative on AI that benefits the supporters of FLI,"" she said. ""Ignoring active harms right now is a privilege that some of us don't have.""Mitchell and her co-authors -- Timnit Gebru, Emily M. Bender, and Angelina McMillan-Major -- subsequently published a response to the letter, accusing its authors of ""fearmongering and AI hype"".""It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or 'potentially catastrophic' future,"" they wrote.""Accountability properly lies not with the artefacts but with their builders.""FLI president Max Tegmark told Reuters the campaign was not an attempt to hinder OpenAI’s corporate advantage.""It's quite hilarious. I've seen people say, 'Elon Musk is trying to slow down the competition,'"" he said, adding that Musk had no role in drafting the letter. ""This is not about one company.""RISKS NOWShiri Dori-Hacohen, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut, told Reuters she agreed with some points in the letter, but took issue with the way in which her work was cited.She last year co-authored a research paper arguing the widespread use of AI already posed serious risks.Her research argued the present-day use of AI systems could influence decision-making in relation to climate change, nuclear war, and other existential threats.She said: ""AI does not need to reach human-level intelligence to exacerbate those risks.""There are non-existential risks that are really, really important, but don't receive the same kind of Hollywood-level attention.""Asked to comment on the criticism, FLI's Tegmark said both short-term and long-term risks of AI should be taken seriously.""If we cite someone, it just means we claim they're endorsing that sentence. It doesn't mean they're endorsing the letter, or we endorse everything they think,"" he told Reuters.Dan Hendrycks, director of the California-based Center for AI Safety, who was also cited in the letter, stood by its contents, telling Reuters it was sensible to consider black swan events - those which appear unlikely, but would have devastating consequences.The open letter also warned that generative AI tools could be used to flood the internet with ""propaganda and untruth"".Dori-Hacohen said it was ""pretty rich"" for Musk to have signed it, citing a reported rise in misinformation on Twitter following his acquisition of the platform, documented by civil society group Common Cause and others.Musk and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.(Reporting by Martin Coulter; editing by Philippa Fletcher and Giles Elgood)",2023/04/01,408,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853296,Alaska Native Scouts feted 67 years after rescuing Navy crew,"GAMBELL, Alaska (AP) — Bruce Boolowon, then a lean 20-year-old, and a group of friends were hunting for murre eggs in a walrus skin boat on a remote Alaska island in the Bering Strait when they saw a crippled airplane flying low.“Something was wrong,” Boolowon, now 87, recalled of that day in 1955. “They came in and one engine was smoking.”Long before drones or weather balloons became military targets, a U.S. Navy P2V-5 Neptune maritime patrol aircraft had been attacked at about 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) by two Soviet MiG-15 fighters roaring out of nearby Siberia. The plane's right engine was destroyed and the pilot was making a controlled crash landing.Its 11 crewmen had injuries in varying degrees of severity, caused either by the bullets sprayed by the two jet fighters, shrapnel or the fireball that erupted when the Neptune landed wheels up on the tundra of St. Lawrence Island and fuel tanks stored in the plane’s belly exploded.“And as the plane decelerated, the fireball didn’t. And it rolled forward. It burned everybody,” the navigator on the flight, David Assard, told the Anchorage Daily News in 2015. Several of the men had severe burns.The men took refuge in a ditch on St. Lawrence Island — just 40 miles (64 kilometers) from Siberia and 715 miles (1,151 kilometers) west of Anchorage — to avoid the exploding ammunition and waited, but for what they weren’t sure. When the armed Siberian Yupik Eskimo egg hunters showed up, the Navy men didn’t know if they were about to be captured or rescued.“Well, they were glad to see us and that we were Americans,” Boolowon told The Associated Press.They were not only friendly faces but members of the First Scouts unit of the Alaska National Guard who lived on the island and whose job it was to monitor the Soviet Union given their proximity. The 16 guardsmen and an unknown Air Force member helped the crew get medical attention and alerted military authorities the men were safe.On Tuesday, the guardsmen were honored with Alaska Heroism Medals, giving the Alaska Native men the recognition that wasn’t available 67 years ago. Boolowon, then a corporal, is the sole survivor, and family members of the other 15 received the medals on their behalf.Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, the adjutant general of the Alaska National Guard, not only approved the medals for the men, he personally handed them out at the ceremony held with a driving snow outside. Residents filled the gym at John Apangalook School in Gambell, home to the King Polar Bears — or Qughsatkut in Siberian Yupik— sports teams. Family members receiving medals sat in honored seats on the gym floor, and Saxe posed for photos with each after presenting the medals and a certificate. A community luncheon followed.“I’m glad we’re going to get recognized a little bit for saving the crewmembers,” Boolowon said.Shortly after the June 22, 1955, rescue, two of the guardsmen, MSgt. Willis Walunga and SSgt. Clifford Iknokinok, received honorific letters and certificates from the Navy and National Guard. They were taken to Washington, D.C., and presented “Wings of Gold” with the Honorary Naval Aviator Program designation. They were only the second and third persons so honored after the program started in 1949.The other 14 only received letters. “I don’t know why they didn’t include us,” Boolowon said of the Navy designation.There were no other medals available to the men for their deeds because it wasn’t a combat mission, and the rescue was considered a peacetime affair.“The families felt like that the members should have received a better award than a letter of appreciation,” said Verdie Bowen, the director of the state Office of Veterans Affairs. “The best one that we could find that fit this feat of valor was the state of Alaska’s Heroism Award,” he said. It honors Alaska National Guard members who distinguish themselves by heroism, meritorious achievement or going beyond the call of duty.Boolowon was with Iknokinok, Walunga and others in the first boat to arrive at the crash site, where they found the men.He said they weren’t scared it was a Soviet aircraft because they were familiar with the U.S. plane from its frequent maritime patrols out of Naval Air Station Kodiak. On this mission, the plane was looking for icebergs and navigational aids in the Bering Strait. The wreckage of the plane still sits 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) from the village.Boolowon and two other men from the first boat went to Gambell to get medical supplies, stretchers and more help. Another boat arrived, and the guardsmen eventually took the men to the village for treatment by a local nurse at a clinic and a church until a transport plane arrived about 12 hours later to take them to Anchorage. Seven of the injured were later flown to California to recuperate.The June 22, 1955, attack was labeled a possible “mistake” by embarrassed Soviet leaders and came at a problematic time for the Soviet Union. A summit to de-escalate Cold War tensions was planned the following month in Geneva with President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin and the prime ministers of Great Britain and France.After learning the plane was shot down, Eisenhower directed Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov during the 10th anniversary meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco.Molotov was unaware of the incident but promised an investigation. The Kremlin wired Molotov his instructions, which included presenting Dulles “with a conciliatory note that admitted the incident could have been ‘due to a mistake,’” David Winkler, the historian at the Naval Historical Foundation, wrote in his 2017 book ”Incidents at Sea: American Confrontation and Cooperation with Russia and China, 1945-2016.”It was the first time the Soviets both ever expressed regret and paid reparations, Winkler told the AP last summer, and the summit went on as planned. The Soviets agreed to compensate the U.S. for the plane, sending just over $35,000 (about $400,000 today) in reparations. The money was split among the crewmen.In the early 1990s, Assard travelled to Gambell to thank them and presented the village with a bronze plaque.“We were very fortunate in landing on an American island and being found by American Eskimos,” Assard, the flight navigator who is now deceased, told the Anchorage newspaper in 2015. “They couldn’t have been more gracious.”The other 13 guardsmen posthumously awarded medals were Pfcs. Holden Apatiki, Lane Iyakitan, Woodrow Malewotkuk, Roger Slwooko, Vernon Slwooko and Donald Ungott; Sfc. Herbert Apassingok; Sgt. Ralph Apatiki Sr.; Cpls. Victor Campbell, Ned Koozaata and Joseph Slwooko, and Pvts. Luke Kulukhon and Leroy Kulukhon.JoAnn Kulukhon accepted medals on behalf of her two uncles and plans to prominently display them in her home. “I'm so proud of them,"" she said. “I know they're happy.”As for receiving his own medal, Boolowon said the recognition is simply for work well done.“I’m glad we did our duty as a guardsman,” he said.___AP Investigative Researcher Randy Herschaft in New York contributed to this report.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853297,AP Was There: US crewmen shot down by Soviets arrive home,"OAKLAND, California (AP) — Editor’s Note: Sixteen Alaska Native men were honored this week for rescuing the crew of a U.S. Navy patrol plane shot down over the Bering Strait by Soviet fighter jets nearly 70 years ago. With that belated honor, The Associated Press is republishing its story filed July 3, 1955, from Oakland, California, detailing the arrival of seven of the injured Navy crew members.____In cheerful spirits, despite wounds, burns and bandages, seven U.S. fliers whose Navy patrol plane was shot down June 22 by Russian jet fighters over the Bering Sea arrived here today from Anchorage, Alaska.A huddled group of families and friends watched at Alameda Naval Air Station as the seven stretchers were eased out of their hospital plane shortly before 3 a.m. A woman burst into tears.She was Mrs. Nellie Janke of Alameda, who had caught sight of her husband, chief electronics technician Elmer R. Janke, swathed heavily in bandages. She rushed forward to greet him.Aviation machinist mate Thaddeus Maziarz of Oakland propped himself up to greet his wife, Ruth, and 6-year-old daughter Carol, and then gaze long and happily for the first time at his son and namesake, Thad Jr., 5 weeks oldAnd aviation ordnanceman Martin E. Berg of Alameda, despite hands made clumsy and awkward with bandages, clasped his wife in a hard embrace.The other arrivals, whose families lived too far way to come, are Ens. David G. Assard, Terryville, Conn.; aviation technician Edward Benko, Chicago; airman technician Charles W. Shields, Clawson, Mich., and aviation ordnanceman Donald E. Sonnek, Minnesota Lake, Minn.Then the group, part of the 11 whose misadventure in northern seas touched off a diplomatic storm while the United Nations was in session at San Francisco, were loaded onto an ambulance bus for the 10-mile ride to Oak Knoll Hospital in the Oakland foothills.Ensign Assard talked briefly to newsmen about the details of the unprovoked attack on the Neptune patrol plane flying out of Kodiak Naval Station over international waters between Alaska and Siberia. The U.S. plane managed a forced landing on St. Lawrence Island.“There were two MiGs that attacked us,” said Assard. ""We know there were two because Sonnek saw them both.""All of a sudden, I saw bullets. They sprayed the whole fuselage of our plane. Every tracer bullet I saw was hitting something. Three of the crew members got hit. We didn't get a chance to fire back although we had ammunition aboard.""Our port engine caught fire and Lt. Fischer (Richard H. Fischer of Pittsburgh, Pa., the pilot) said we had to ditch.""When we landed on St. Lawrence Island the bomb bay exploded and that's when we got burned. The crew was wonderful. We all got out and headed for a gully. Lt. Fischer tried to help us, tending to our wounds.“After about 45 minutes, some Eskimos came after us in a boat from a nearby village. They said they had seen our plane coming in low with smoke coming from it and knew we were in trouble.”Capt. Louis King, the Air Force physician who accompanied the men on the flight from Anchorage, said the men stood the trip well and all are in “good condition.”The Russians, through foreign minister V.M. Molotov, expressed regret at the incident and offered to pay half the damges. This fell short of American demands.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853298,"Doomsday plot? After 3 years, slain kids' mom to stand trial","BOISE, Idaho (AP) — It has been more than three years since police announced that two kids were missing from a rural eastern Idaho town, and each twist in the grim investigation has seemed stranger than the last.Their mother claimed to be a deity, her estranged husband wrote in divorce papers. She called the children “zombies” before they vanished, a friend told police. A handful of followers seemed to buy into her doomsday claims, Arizona investigators reported.Those are just some of the details that could be aired in court starting next week, when Lori Vallow Daybell stands trial on murder, conspiracy and grand theft charges in the deaths of 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow, and Tylee Ryan, who was last seen a few days before her 17th birthday.Her husband, Chad Daybell, faces the same charges. And they are both also charged in the October 2019 death of Daybell's late wife.Here's a look at what is known and what is next in the bizarre case:HOW DID THE CASE BEGIN?JJ's grandparents, Larry and Kay Woodcock of Louisiana, were increasingly worried about the kids in 2019. For the first half of the year, Lori Vallow Daybell was still married to JJ's father, Charles Vallow, but the two were estranged and he had filed for divorce.In the divorce documents, Vallow claimed his wife believed she was a god-like figure, sent to usher in the apocalypse and carry out the work of 144,000 believers.Their marriage ended suddenly in July when Lori's brother, Alex Cox, shot and killed her husband outside the family's suburban Phoenix home. Police initially determined the shooting was in self-defense and Cox was never charged.Vallow Daybell, the kids and Cox moved to eastern Idaho, and JJ's grandparents struggled to reach him by phone. The Woodcocks said Vallow Daybell wouldn't tell them why the child was always unavailable. They grew suspicious and called police.WHEN DID THE CASE BECOME A MURDER INVESTIGATION?Rexburg police performed a welfare check in November of 2019, and said Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell — an Idaho man who had known Lori for months — lied about the children's whereabouts.When police returned the next day, the couple had left town.Police determined Tylee Ryan was last seen in September headed into Yellowstone National Park with her mom and other family for a day trip, and JJ was last seen by school officials several days later.The search spanned several states and continued until June 2020, when the children's bodies were found buried in the yard of Daybell's eastern Idaho home.Detectives meanwhile learned that his previous wife, Tammy Daybell, had unexpectedly died in October 2019 of what was initially reported as “natural causes,” and the family had declined an autopsy.Chad and Lori married just two weeks after Tammy's death. Authorities exhumed Tammy Daybell's body and expanded their investigation.WHAT DO PROSECUTORS SAY HAPPENED?Prosecutors say the Daybells espoused strange doomsday-focused beliefs to further their alleged plan to kill the kids and Tammy Daybell, then collect life insurance money and the kids' social security and survivor benefits.Several family members and friends described to detectives a group led by Lori and Chad that met to pray, believing that they could drive out evil spirits and seek revelations from “beyond the spiritual veil.”Though the beliefs Vallow Daybell’s friends described to detectives were loosely based in theology from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they veered into the extreme.In police reports, one friend said Vallow Daybell told her she could “teleport” between Arizona and Hawaii, and that Daybell said he had a “portal” in his home where he could receive revelations and travel to other realms.Vallow Daybell’s close friend Melanie Gibb told investigators that the couple used a scoring system to determine whether people were good or evil, and that they believed people became “zombies” when they were possessed by evil spirits.The group would spend time praying to get rid of the zombies, and believed that if they were successful the possessed person would physically die, freeing their trapped soul from “limbo.”Vallow Daybell called JJ and Tylee “zombies” several times before they died, Gibb told investigators.WHAT DO DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAY?Vallow Daybell is being represented by eastern Idaho-based attorneys John Thomas and James Archibald.She has pleaded not guilty in the case, and her attorneys have submitted formal notice that they intend to offer an alibi.In that court document, Vallow Daybell's attorneys said she was in her own apartment in Rexburg, Idaho, when the children died at a nearby apartment where her brother lived. The attorneys said she was with a couple of friends, “and/or Chad Daybell.”Her attorneys also wrote that Vallow Daybell was in Hawaii with other friends when Daybell’s previous wife died the next month.Daybell's attorneys haven’t offered details about his planned defense, other than saying in court that Daybell and Vallow Daybell will have “ mutually antagonistic defenses ” — a legal term that generally means a jury would have to disbelieve one defendant in order to believe the other.WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE TRIAL?Vallow Daybell’s trial is expected to last up to 12 weeks. Jury selection begins Monday.The judge has banned cameras from the courtroom and the trial was moved to Boise to increase the likelihood of finding jurors that aren't deeply familiar with the case.Her husband will be tried later.Prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty against both defendants. But just two weeks before the trial was to begin, 7th District Judge Steven Boyce granted a request from Vallow Daybell's defense attorneys to take the death penalty off the table.The judge said the decision was made because of the volume of evidence that was turned over to the defense team. Vallow Daybell has not waived her right to a speedy trial, so it could not be delayed.Daybell still faces the death penalty in his case.ANY OTHER CHARGES?Vallow Daybell has also been indicted in metro Phoenix on a charge of conspiring to murder Charles Vallow. The indictment says she conspired with her brother, Alex Cox, in Vallow's death.Cox was never arrested in the case. He died five months after Vallow was killed from what medical examiners said was a pulmonary blood clot.Idaho likely won't agree to extradite Vallow Daybell to face the Arizona charges until the case against her in Idaho is completed. She has not yet entered a plea in the Arizona case.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853299,Fatal fire complicates border city's tensions with migrants,"CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) — When Irwing López made it to Ciudad Juarez on the U.S.-Mexico border in January, the 35-year-old construction worker thought he had survived the worst and was steps away from his goal.He'd traversed jungle and raging rivers, and evaded Mexico’s notorious cartels, traveling thousands of miles from his native Venezuela. But then he found himself in a purgatory between U.S. immigration policies that pushed him back to Mexico and the unrelenting pursuit of Mexican immigration agents.And on Monday, López was reminded just how fragile his situation is. His friend and fellow Venezuelan Samuel Marchena was detained by immigration agents and hours later became one of the 39 migrants who died in a fire at a detention center.López, who sleeps in a shelter and washes windshields at stoplights for cash, said he won't give up trying to enter the U.S., but he recognizes he's not welcome in this sprawling border city that has grown tired of migrants in its community.“My dream has become a nightmare,” López said recently, waiting to weave between cars at a light.Tensions have simmered between migrants and residents in Mexican border cities for several years, with large camps set up near crossings by those who can’t afford housing or cling to unrealistic hopes that U.S. authorities will suddenly admit them. In Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million estimated to have as many as 25,000 migrants, constant new arrivals facing an indeterminate wait were already the subject of heated debate. The deadly fire and accompanying attention have only added to the strained situation.Many border residents take pride in their cities as beacons of diversity and hospitality, but challenges mounted after the U.S. introduced a practice under which migrants were forced to wait in Mexican border cities for an appointment to enter the U.S. to seek asylum or other legal status.An opaque system of waiting lists for a chance to apply for U.S. asylum managed by nongovernmnetal groups or individuals topped 55,000 names in 11 Mexican border cities in August, according to a report by the Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas, Austin.Additionally, a Trump-era policy that ended last year resulted in more than 70,000 people waiting in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court.And since March 2020, the U.S. has returned migrants from several countries, largely Guatemala and Honduras, to Mexico under a rule designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In January, the Biden administration introduced a glitch-plagued app to exempt migrants from the pandemic-era rule, known as Title 42, and it is now scheduling about 740 appointments per day along the border.López has found the application, called CBPOne, to be complicated and frustrating, but U.S. authorities have scheduled about 63,000 appointments through the app since Jan. 18.U.S. authorities have already returned López to Mexico twice after he crossed the border without an appointment. Once they allowed his sister, her husband and cousin who he had traveled with from Venezuela to remain in the U.S.“Right now, this is a border of uncertainty, insecurity,” said the Rev. Javier Calvillo, director of the Casa del Migrante shelter. Like many, Calvillo fears fallout from the fire could aggravate the existing chaos, which he blamed on a lack of coordination among local, state and federal officials.In early March, hundreds of migrants crossed one of the international bridges here on the false rumor that U.S. authorities would let them enter. The incident shut down traffic for hours on a vital link to El Paso, Texas, angering residents.Mayor Cruz Pérez Cuellar started asking Juarez residents to stop giving money to panhandling migrants, warning that his patience was running out. He insisted there was room in the city's shelters and work available for migrants who want it, leaving no need for them to clog intersections.“We’re going to have a stronger posture in this sense, taking care of the city,” he said March 13. “A crucial moment has arrived to put a stop and have a breaking point ... because they can affect the city’s economy and thousands of Juarez (residents).”After the fire, critics accused the mayor of being behind the roundup of some of the migrants detained that day. In response, Pérez Cuellar softened his rhetoric to say the city would bolster efforts to tell migrants about opportunities for work and shelter. He said city police could not legally take migrants to the immigration detention center and that he did not know of migrants' complaints that police often took their possessions and extorted them.Mexico has arrested five people on charges of murder and causing injury: three immigration officials, two private security guards and the migrant they accuse of setting fire to mattresses in the facility. They say they plan to arrest at least one more.Estrella Pérez, a 24-year-old nurse and Juarez resident, said she was sorry about what happened, but didn't disguise her unhappiness with the increase in migration through the city, especially of Venezuelan migrants. She said they're not looking for work.She accused migrants of “invading” the streets and bridges. Despite the tragedy of the fire, she said, “there are going to be few people who change their perspective of them,” adding that people are no longer willing to tolerate new arrivals.On Wednesday, Belen Sosa of Caracas, Venezuela, plodded with her husband and a teenage daughter across a dusty clearing in Ciudad Juarez overlooking the Rio Grande and the U.S. border fence.She described the indignations of living in limbo while seeking an appointment to apply for U.S. asylum and said migrants live in fear of detention and harassment as they search for odd jobs.The family weighed whether to turn themselves in to a cluster of U.S. Border Patrol agents Wednesday and risk immediate removal, as hundreds of migrants flocked to a gate in the border fence. Sosa previously worked as a forensic technician in a morgue in the Venezuelan capital.“People are tired of the mistreatment,” she said. “They want to make us out to be delinquents. Migrating isn’t a crime. What crime are we committing?”Luis Vázquez, owner of a hamburger stand in the city, conceded that many fellow residents are fed up with migrants, again emphasizing the outsized presence of Venezuelans who tend to be more visible and vocal than the Central Americans moving through the city. But he said ultimately the city’s history as a border crossing would win out.“What Juarez has is that it has always helped people, and never left them alone,"" he said ""And with this opportunity, many of us are going to help them.”Yannerys Vian, a 31-year-old Venezuelan, carefully maneuvered her pregnant belly between cars to sell candy at an intersection.The deaths in the fire made her angry, but not ready to quit. She said she left Venezuela in September after her young daughter died from lack of medical attention. She set out for the U.S. with her husband and 3-year-old son, making it to Juarez in December.On Wednesday, she joined the migrants crossing again on the rumor the U.S. would let them enter. Many turned themselves over to authorities at an opening in the border fence, but Vian balked, fearing the she'd be passed back to Mexico, which would in turn send her family farther south, erasing the gains they made.“What happened filled me with hate, with anger,"" she said. “What they did to those people was a crime, but I won’t give them the satisfaction of sending me back.” __AP writers Morgan Lee in Ciudad Juarez and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853300,"At least 26 dead after tornadoes rake US Midwest, South","WYNNE, Ark. (AP) — Storms that dropped possibly dozens of tornadoes killed at least 26 people in small towns and big cities across the South and Midwest, tearing a path through the Arkansas capital, collapsing the roof of a packed concert venue in Illinois and stunning people throughout the region Saturday with the damage's scope.Confirmed or suspected tornadoes in at least eight states destroyed homes and businesses, splintered trees and laid waste to neighborhoods across a broad swath of the country. The dead included at least nine in one Tennessee county, four in the small town of Wynne, Arkansas, three in Sullivan, Indiana, and four in Illinois.Other deaths from the storms that hit Friday night into Saturday were reported in Alabama and Mississippi, along with one near Little Rock, Arkansas, where city officials said more than 2,600 buildings were in a tornado's path.Residents of Wynne, a community of about 8,000 people 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Memphis, Tennessee, woke Saturday to find the high school's roof shredded and its windows blown out. Huge trees lay on the ground, their stumps reduced to nubs. Broken walls, windows and roofs pocked homes and businesses.Debris lay scattered inside the shells of homes and on lawns: clothing, insulation, toys, splintered furniture, a pickup truck with its windows shattered.Ashley Macmillan said she, her husband and their children huddled with their dogs in a small bathroom as a tornado passed, “praying and saying goodbye to each other, because we thought we were dead.” A falling tree seriously damaged their home, but they were unhurt.“We could feel the house shaking, we could hear loud noises, dishes rattling. And then it just got calm,” she said.Recovery was already underway, with workers using chainsaws and bulldozers to clear the area and utility crews restoring power.Nine people died in Tennessee's McNairy County, east of Memphis, according to Patrick Sheehan, director the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.“The majority of the damage has been done to homes and residential areas,” said David Leckner, the mayor of Adamsville.Gov. Bill Lee drove to the county Saturday to tour the destruction and comfort residents. He said the storm capped the “worst” week of his time as governor, coming days after a school shooting in Nashville that killed six people including a family friend whose funeral he and his wife, Maria, attended earlier in the day.“It’s terrible what has happened in this community, this county, this state,” Lee said. “But it looks like your community has done what Tennessean communities do, and that is rally and respond.”Jeffrey Day said he called his daughter after seeing on the news that their community of Adamsville was being hit. Huddled in a closet with her 2-year-old son as the storm passed over, she answered the phone screaming.“She kept asking me, ‘What do I do, daddy?’"" Day said, tearing up. ""I didn’t know what to say.”After the storm passed, his daughter crawled out of her destroyed home and over barbed wire and drove to nearby family. On Saturday evening, baby clothes were still strewn about the site.In Memphis, police spokesman Christopher Williams said via email late Saturday that there were three deaths believed to be weather-related: two children and an adult who died when a tree fell on a house.Tennessee officials warned that the same weather conditions from Friday night are expected to return Tuesday.In Belvidere, Illinois, part of the roof of the Apollo Theatre collapsed as about 260 people were attending a heavy metal concert. A 50-year-old man was pulled from the rubble.“I sat with him and I held his hand and I was (telling him), ‘It’s going to be OK.’ I didn’t really know much else what to do,"" concertgoer Gabrielle Lewellyn told WTVO-TV.The man was dead by the time emergency workers arrived. Officials said 40 others were hurt, including two with life-threatening injuries.Crews cleaned up around the Apollo on Saturday, with forklifts pulling away loose bricks. Business owners picked up glass shards and covered shattered windows.In Crawford County, Illinois, three people were killed and eight injured when a tornado hit around New Hebron, said Bill Burke, the county board chair.Sheriff Bill Rutan said 60 to 100 families were displaced.“We’ve had emergency crews digging people out of their basements because the house is collapsed on top of them, but luckily they had that safe space to go to,” Rutan said at a news conference.That tornado was not far from where three people died in Indiana's Sullivan County, about 95 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Indianapolis.Sullivan Mayor Clint Lamb said at a news conference that an area south of the county seat of about 4,000 “is essentially unrecognizable right now"" and several people were rescued overnight. There were reports of as many as 12 people injured, he said.“I’m really, really shocked there isn’t more as far as human issues,” he said, adding that recovery “is going to be a very long process.”In the Little Rock area, at least one person was killed and more than 50 were hurt, some critically.The National Weather Service said that tornado was a high-end EF3 twister with wind speeds up to 165 mph (265 kph) and a path as long as 25 miles (40 kilometers).Masoud Shahed-Ghaznavi was lunching at home when it roared through his neighborhood, causing him to hide in the laundry room as sheetrock fell and windows shattered. When he emerged, the house was mostly rubble.“Everything around me is sky,"" Shahed-Ghaznavi recalled Saturday. He barely slept Friday night.“When I closed my eyes, I couldn’t sleep, imagined I was here,” he said Saturday outside his home.Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. On Saturday, Sanders requested a major disaster declaration from President Joe Biden to support recovery efforts with federal resources.Another suspected tornado killed a woman in northern Alabama’s Madison County, officials said, and in northern Mississippi's Pontotoc County, authorities confirmed one death and four injuries.Tornadoes also caused damage in eastern Iowa and broke windows northeast of Peoria, Illinois.The storms struck just hours after Biden visited Rolling Fork, Mississippi, where tornadoes last week destroyed parts of town.It could take days to determine the exact number of tornadoes from the latest event, said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the Storm Prediction Center. There were also hundreds of reports of large hail and damaging winds, he said.“That’s a quite active day,"" he said. “But that’s not unprecedented.”More than 530,000 homes and businesses were without power as of midday Saturday, over 200,000 of them in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.The sprawling storm system also brought wildfires to the southern Plains, with authorities in Oklahoma reporting nearly 100 of them Friday. At least 32 people were said to be injured, and more than 40 homes destroyed.The storms also caused blizzard conditions in the Upper Midwest.A threat of tornadoes and hail remained for the Northeast including in parts of Pennsylvania and New York.___DeMillo reported from Little Rock.

It has eight staff, six of them female.Moezuddin Ahmadi, the director for Information and Culture in Badakhshan province, said the station violated the “laws and regulations of the Islamic Emirate” several times by broadcasting songs and music during Ramadan and was shuttered because of the breach.“If this radio station accepts the policy of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and gives a guarantee that it will not repeat such a thing again, we will allow it to operate again,” said Ahmadi.Station head Najia Sorosh denied there was any violation, saying there was no need for the closure and called it a conspiracy. The Taliban ""told us that you have broadcast music. We have not broadcast any kind of music,” she said.Sorosh said at 11:40 a.m. on Thursday representatives from the Ministry of Information and Culture and the Vice and Virtue Directorate arrived at the station and shut it down. She said station staff have contacted Vice and Virtue but officials there said they do not have any additional information about the closing.Many journalists lost their jobs after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. Media outlets closed over lack of funds or because staff left the country, according to the Afghan Independent Journalists Association.The Taliban have barred women from most forms of employment and education beyond the sixth grade, including university. There is no official ban on music. During their previous rule in the late 1990s, the Taliban barred most television, radio and newspapers in the country.",2023/04/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853303,"'War of the states': EV, chip makers lavished with subsidies","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — States are doling out more cash than ever to lure multibillion-dollar microchip, electric vehicle and battery factories, inspiring ever-more competition as they dig deeper into their pockets to attract big employers and capitalize on a wave of huge new projects.Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas have made billion-dollar pledges for a microchip or EV plant, with more state-subsidized plant announcements by profitable automakers and semiconductor giants surely to come.States have long competed for big employers. But now they are floating more billion-dollar offers and offering record-high subsidies, lavishing companies with grants and low-interest loans, municipal road improvements, and breaks on taxes, real estate, power and water.“We’re in the second war of the states,” said John Boyd, a principal at the Florida-based Boyd Company, which advises on site selections. “That’s how competitive economic development is between the states in 2023.”The projects come at a transformative time for the industries, with automakers investing heavily in electrification and chipmakers expanding production in the U.S. following pandemic-related supply chain disruptions that raised economic and national security concerns.One of the driving forces behind them are federal subsidies signed into law last summer that are meant to encourage companies to produce electric vehicles, EV batteries, and computer chips domestically. Another is that states are flush with cash thanks to inflation-juiced tax collections and federal pandemic relief subsidies.The number of big projects and the size of state subsidy packages are extraordinary, said Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas professor who researches government economic development strategies.“It is kind of a Wild West moment,” Jensen said. “It’s wild money and every state seems to be in on it.”Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and is critical of corporate subsidies, said 2022 set a record for the number of billion-dollar-plus incentive deals. At least eight were finalized, though that figure might be higher since such deals can be cloaked in secrecy and take time to come to light.Eighteen of last year's 23 known “megadeals,"" in which state and local incentive packages to private companies exceeded $50 million in value, were for semiconductor and EV plants, according to the group's data.More than $20 billion in public money was committed to subsidizing those known megadeals, according to Good Jobs First data. That total eclipsed the previous record of $17.7 billion that was committed to subsidizing such deals in 2013.Many of the companies drawing the biggest subsidy offers — such as Intel, Hyundai, Panasonic, Micron, Toyota, Ford and General Motors — are profitable and operate around the globe. Some lesser-known names in the nascent EV field are getting big offers too, such as Rivian, Volkswagen-backed Scout Motors and Vietnamese automaker VinFast.The subsidy offers are generally embraced by politicians from both major parties and the business elite, who point to promises of hundreds or thousands of jobs, massive investments in construction and equipment, and what they contend are immeasurable trickle-down benefits.Still, academics who study such subsidies find them to be a waste of money and rarely decisive in a company's choice of location.In a 2021 paper arguing that subsidies are driven by politicians for their own benefit, researchers from The Citadel, the College of Charleston and the University of Louisville-Lafayette wrote that studies conclude “they do little, if anything, to promote meaningful improvements in economic outcomes.”The mounting cost of competing for the projects hasn't dissuaded states from trying. On the contrary, they're clambering to outdo each other.Michigan was stung by hometown Ford's $11.4 billion commitment in 2021 to build electric vehicle and battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky. It responded by pledging more than $2.5 billion for electric-vehicle projects by Ford and GM and plants by makers of EV batteries and battery components.Pennsylvania has yet to lure a microchip or EV factory, and the state's business elite are sounding the alarm after watching neighboring Ohio land a $20 billion Intel plant.In his first budget speech to lawmakers, newly inaugurated Gov. Josh Shapiro said Pennsylvania needs to “get in the game"" and warned that it would take money.Jabbing a finger in the air, he brought the room to a standing ovation, saying: ”It’s time to compete again here in Pennsylvania!”Oregon lawmakers hoping to attract a major semiconductor plant are advancing legislation that would marshal $200 million in subsidies and loosen decades-old protections against urban sprawl.The aim is to procure huge plots of land with ready-made utilities. That has elicited protests from conservationists who say the state mishandled developable land and agricultural groups that warned of the permanent destruction of high-quality farmland.Dick Sheehy, a retired site selection consultant who traveled the world to inspect possible locations for semiconductor makers, told a panel of Oregon lawmakers in January that states are tipping the scales over better-qualified competitors by offering larger incentive packages.“The money the state is putting up is so large that certain companies can’t afford not to look at it,” Sheehy said.In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott promised to win passage of “economic development tools” during the current legislative session, saying the state lost out on a massive Micron semiconductor plant because it couldn't match the $5.5 billion in tax credits offered by New York.""The CEO of Micron was basically begging me because he really wanted to do business in Texas. He knew Texas was a better place. He said, 'Please could you come up with some more?'"" Abbott told a Greater Arlington Chamber of Commerce crowd in February. ""We gave every penny that we could give.”Asked about Abbott's assertions, Micron declined to address Abbott's description of the phone call with CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, but it called New York the most competitive state and listed reasons why it is the “ideal home” for its plant.Those included a compelling case made by top officials — including Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer — plus an attractive local workforce, local research and development partners, and a good quality of life for employees.In Oklahoma, frustration among lawmakers has been bubbling over since the state lost out on a string of projects: first a Tesla plant to Texas, then a Panasonic EV battery plant to Kansas and, just days ago, a Volkswagen EV battery plant to Canada.That latest loss led state Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Treat to create a committee to figure out what went wrong in Oklahoma's bidding for a “megaproject.”Business-friendly Oklahoma shouldn't keep losing out to other states, Treat said.“You never know if you’re being used so they can go to that other state so they can say, ‘Hey, Oklahoma is willing to do this,’"" Treat said in an interview. “And they intend on going to that state the whole time.”___Associated Press writers Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City and Andrew Selsky in Salem, Oregon, contributed to this report.___Follow Marc Levy on Twitter: @timelywriter",2023/04/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853314,Lanterns and crescents: more retailers court Ramadan buyers,"With her 3-year-old daughter sitting inside a red Target shopping cart, Aya Khalil looked through the aisles with anticipation. The author was on a mission: See for herself that her children's book about a boy and his grandmother baking for an Islamic feast was actually carried by her local Target store in Toledo.“Oh my God! ... It’s right there,” Khalil said on spotting “The Night Before Eid.""“Oh yeaaaaah!” her daughter joyously exclaimed. Khalil giggled.For Khalil, it was a pinch-me moment as an author -- and also a big deal as a mother.“This didn’t happen when I was growing up. It was like, ‘Are things really changing now?’” she said. “I’m just really happy that now my own kids will be able to see that and that they’ll know that their stories are valid and ... are out there like a totally normal thing.”For this year’s Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started last week, Target rolled out its first dedicated Ramadan and Eid collection, including decoration kits with crescent and lantern-shaped cutouts. It’s one of the latest signs of big retailers in the United States catering to Muslim shoppers' needs.Many Muslim Americans enthusiastically welcomed the recognition, applauding retailers that are making it easier for them to bring their families the cheer that ubiquitously and publicly marks some other faiths’ holidays.“As stores have accommodated for Easter and Christmas for centuries, I’m glad to see them bring in Ramadan items,” said Hass Beydoun of Dearborn Heights, Michigan. “We welcome it, because they are welcoming our culture and beliefs in their stores.”Others echoed the sentiment on Target’s website: “Thank you so much for making Ramadan decor mainstream,” one shopper wrote. “We feel seen and heard!” wrote another.Still, some have been debating the merits of buying Ramadan decor from big box retailers in America, where Muslims make up a small but growing part of the population, to encourage representation, versus supporting small, Muslim-owned businesses that have made such items. Some others caution against excessively commercializing a religious period.Ramadan is a month of fasting, increased worship and charity. It’s often a time for festive gatherings; on social media, some share photos of their decorated homes or swap ideas for DIY Ramadan decor and children's activities. Ramadan is followed by the Eid al-Fitr holiday.Target’s new Ramadan and Eid collection is sold online and in a few hundred stores in areas with numerous Muslim shoppers. The retailer, which didn’t provide sales figures, said it received positive feedback from shoppers and that the collection is part of its commitment to diversity and inclusion.Party supplies retailer Party City started selling Ramadan and Eid items in 2018 and has since increased such products amid growing demand. More than 280 stores, particularly in locations with large Muslim populations, carry the items, which include lantern string lights and table runners reading “Ramadan Mubarak,” or “Blessed Ramadan.”“Our goal is to offer authentic and inclusive celebration options to all of our customers, particularly those who are underrepresented in the retail industry,” said Susan Sanderson, Party City's senior vice president of brand marketing.Walmart Inc., the nation’s largest retailer, said it recently started carrying items related to Ramadan and Eid but the merchandise is sold only online, not in stores.Still, that’s a change from when Jomana Siddiqui received an Eid present in Christmas gift wrap in 2011; at the time, Siddiqui, whose business is based in Fullerton, California, said she didn’t see American retailers carrying merchandise for Ramadan or Eid. She tried to get malls and stores to put up signage acknowledging the Muslim holy days but was rebuffed.From 2014 to 2016, she worked with Macy’s at South Coast Plaza mall in Costa Mesa, California, to design the display towers with “Happy Ramadan” signs for an event. In 2018, she started selling her own items at a pop-up shop at Macy’s in Westminster, California.Even now, Siddiqui is struggling to convince major retailers to sell her modern-style items like “Ramadan Blessings” platters -- and Ramadan and Eid-appropriate gift wrap sheets. She contends many retailers treat American Muslims, who are racially and culturally diverse, as a monolith and says they should avoid cultural stereotypes.“Putting camels and palm trees on something doesn’t speak to Indonesian Muslims or a Mexican Muslim,” she said.Fatima Siddiqui, who lives in the metro Detroit area and owns a calligraphy art business, wrote on Facebook that amid the excitement at retailers carrying Ramadan decorations, community members shouldn’t forget to support Muslim-owned small businesses.Responses varied. Some shoppers said that while supporting such businesses is important, so is buying from the big, national ones to encourage more representation and for Muslim children to feel celebrated. Others argued that decorations offered by many of the small businesses were often expensive or that big retailers were more accessible. Others suggested buying from both.“Why wouldn’t retailers partner up with small businesses to showcase their products that are handcrafted with thoughtful meanings?” said Fatima Siddiqui. This year, she organized a Ramadan market in Canton, Michigan, where vendors sold items including banners, wreaths and serving trays.“Ramadan decor boosts our excitement and mood,” she said. “It helps our younger generation feel special because of the obvious displays of Christmas and other non-Islamic holidays.”The decor can spark educational conversations with non-Muslims, said Yasmen Bagh, who lives in Jersey City and has founded a business selling outdoor inflatables in such shapes as mosques and lanterns.“It brings awareness to your neighbors,” she said. “The images that they see on TV and what Muslims look like is usually like a bad guy; it’s changing that.”Bagh is conflicted about big retailers stepping into the Ramadan and Eid space. “As a Muslim, it makes me happy; as a business owner, it makes me worry.”Some other business owners say there’s room for everyone. And while some Muslims argue a focus on decor and other material items can distract from the month's spiritual essence, others say a balance can be struck and that the products help children get engaged.Mainstream retailers have gradually paid more attention to Muslim customers. Macy’s sells modest wear, including hijabs. Nike unveiled a hijab for Muslim female athletes in 2017, sparking mixed reactions and a discussion about inclusivity in sports. Other activewear brands followed with their own athletic hijabs. Since 2021, Mattel’s American Girl brand has been selling an Eid al-Fitr celebration outfit, which includes a long-sleeved turquoise abaya dress, for its 18-inch dolls.The move to embrace Muslim shoppers is part of a broader strategy by retailers to better connect with increasingly diverse generations of customers. Some critics dismiss the effort as a marketing tactic to boost the bottom line.Sabiha Ansari, co-founder and vice president at American Muslim Consumer Consortium, a nonprofit dedicated to developing the American Muslim consumer market, said she doesn’t mind whether the goal is to make a dollar. She’s just happy companies are embracing products catering to Muslims.“People want to be recognized,” she said.Back in Toledo, Khalil, the author, said her book is, first, for the Muslim children and, even adults, who haven’t seen themselves in books. It tells the story of Zain, who helps his grandmother who is visiting from Egypt, where Khalil was born, bake traditional cookies covered in powdered sugar for the feast. He shares the treats with his classmates, who love them.For this Ramadan, Khalil spruced up her home with lights, lanterns and signs, mostly from small businesses. Her kids also painted a craft kit—that one was bought from Target.___Associated Press reporter Mike Householder in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, contributed.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853315,Man City routs Liverpool 4-1 without injured Haaland,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — No Erling Haaland, no problem for Manchester City.Even without the Premier League’s leading scorer, Pep Guardiola's team came from behind to rout Liverpool 4-1 on Saturday and stay in pursuit of first-place Arsenal.Haaland, who has scored 42 goals in all competitions this season, was ruled out of the game at Etihad Stadium after failing to recover from a groin injury.But even after falling behind to a strike from Mohamed Salah, City powered back with goals from Julian Alvarez, Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and Jack Grealish to keep the pressure on Arsenal and deliver another blow to Liverpool's Champions League qualification hopes.City’s dominance was so complete that by the end Jurgen Klopp said the result could have been even worse for his team.“We just had to follow as they did whatever they wanted,” the Liverpool manager said. “We were lucky they weren’t in a greedy mood.”The game represented one of the biggest remaining tests in City’s league campaign and defeat would have allowed Arsenal, which beat Leeds 4-1 later in the day, the chance to extend its lead at the top to 11 points.That looked like a real possibility when Liverpool scored against the run of play early on, with Diogo Jota bursting past City's high defensive line and laying off to Salah to sweep a shot into the corner.But City evened the score when Alvarez, Argentina's World Cup winning striker, converted Grealish's cross in the 27th.Liverpool had no answer to City's attacking quality in the second half, with De Bruyne poking home a cross from Riyad Mahrez less than a minute after the restart.Gundogan added a third from close range in the 54th, and Grealish got a deserved goal to round off the scoring in the 74th.It was Guardiola’s 100th home win in the league with City in 128 games at Etihad Stadium. He is the quickest manager to achieve that feat, beating Arsene Wenger’s record of reaching that total in 139 games.“Our display was almost perfect from the first minute to minute 93 in the way we played against a team, our big rival in the last seasons,” Guardiola said.Liverpool remains seven points off fourth-place Tottenham and still hasn't won a league match at Etihad Stadium since 2015.Klopp's team has now lost three straight games since routing Manchester United 7-0 last month.“In the end, we had moments but in general how we lost everything, unacceptable,” Klopp said.The Liverpool manager said “four-ish” of his players “had an OK game, and the rest were somewhere I don’t know.”___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853316,"After Nashville, Congress confronts limits of new gun law","WASHINGTON (AP) — Nine months ago, President Joe Biden signed a sweeping bipartisan gun law, the most significant legislative response to gun violence in decades.“Lives will be saved,” he said at the White House.The law has already prevented some potentially dangerous people from owning guns. Yet since that signing last summer, the tally of mass shootings in the United States has only grown. Five dead at a nightclub in Colorado. Eleven killed at a dance hall in California. And just this past week, three 9-year-olds and three adults were shot and killed at an elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee.A day after that school shooting, Biden’s tone was markedly less optimistic than it was the signing ceremony.“What in God’s name are we doing?” he asked in a speech Tuesday, calling for a ban on so-called assault weapons like those that were used to kill at The Covenant School in Nashville. “There’s a moral price to pay for inaction.”Biden and others had hailed last year's bipartisan gun bill — approved in the weeks after the shooting of 19 children and two adults at a school in Uvalde, Texas — as a new way forward.Several months in, the law has had some success: Stepped-up FBI background checks have blocked gun sales for 119 buyers under the age of 21, prosecutions have increased for unlicensed gun sellers and new gun trafficking penalties have been charged in at least 30 cases around the country. Millions of new dollars have flowed into mental health services for children and schools.But the persistence of mass shootings in the United States highlights the limits of congressional action. Because the law was a political compromise, it did not address many Democratic priorities for gun control, including universal background checks or the ban on “assault weapons” for which Biden repeatedly has called.Now, in the wake of the Nashville shooting, Congress appears to have returned to a familiar impasse. One of the top Republican negotiators on the gun law, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, has said new compromise is unlikely. In the House, the new GOP majority favors fewer restrictions on guns, not more.Asked Thursday about a way ahead, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said legislation alone cannot solve the gun violence problem. He said Americans need to think deeply about mental illness and other factors that drive people to act.In contrast, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Congress should “act with the fierce urgency of now.”“Our classrooms have become killing fields,"" he said. “Is that acceptable in America?”Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the lead negotiator on the 2022 bill, says he thinks it represented a paradigm shift in how Congress considers gun legislation. But, he said, “I don’t think that will happen all at once.”“This is sickening, but the opportunities for legislative change normally come after really terrible mass shootings,” said Murphy, who has been the lead Senate advocate for gun control since the 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. “I hate that, I wish that wasn’t how it works.”Tensions were running high on both sides of the Capitol this past week.On Wednesday, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., stood outside the House chamber and yelled that Republicans are “cowards” for not doing more on gun control, eventually arguing with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who advocated for allowing teachers to carry guns.“More guns lead to more deaths!” Bowman screamed at Massie. “Children are dying!”In the Senate, Republican Ted Cruz of Texas tried on Thursday to force a vote on legislation that would boost police presence at schools. He all but blamed Democrats, who had blocked the same legislation last year, for the Nashville shooting and called the 2022 law “meaningless.” Murphy angrily objected to Cruz's bill, arguing that Cruz wasn't serious about compromise and that his move was a stunt for the cameras.Despite the frustrations, lawmakers who negotiated the compromise last year say they see slivers of hope.Murphy said the implementation of the new law, and some of its early successes, will ultimately persuade Republicans to get on board with more legislation.“What happened last year was seismic for Republicans,” Murphy said.In terms of the bill's success, “People don’t get excited about the mass shootings that didn’t happen,” Murphy said, and that can be a challenge as they talk about it and contemplate what more could be done. But the dynamics can change quickly, he said.While Republicans in the past might have tried to shy away from gun measures even if they supported them, Cornyn and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., have been promoting the new law and have discussed it frequently. Late last year, they joined Murphy, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and FBI Director Christopher Wray on a visit to an FBI facility in West Virginia for a briefing on how the background checks were working.“I am proud to see this commonsense legislation already making a difference,” Tillis said in a statement afterward.According to recent data obtained by The Associated Press, those who were flagged in the stepped-up background checks and prevented from buying a gun included an 18-year-old in Nebraska who had made terroristic threats and was prone to violent outbursts, a 20-year-old drug dealer in Arizona and an 18-year-old in Arizona who had been previously charged with unlawful possession of weapons and was found carrying fentanyl. All were attempting to purchase long guns.Tillis said he is aware of a separate case in his home state where a person under 21 who had been charged with assault and battery and assaulting a police officer was flagged and prevented from buying a gun.""It's just one of those bills that's going to age well,"" Tillis said, noting that the number of denials of gun sales is a very small fraction of total sales.Cornyn said that so far, the bill “seems to be working.” But he said he doesn't expect Congress to go any further any time soon. He said would strongly oppose an “assault weapons” ban, as Biden is proposing.When Biden and other lawmakers talk about “assault weapons,” they are using an inexact term to describe a group of high-powered guns or semi-automatic long rifles, such as an an AR-15, that can fire 30 rounds fast without reloading.Most Republicans are steadfastly opposed to such a ban, arguing that it would be too complicated, especially as sales and varieties of the firearms have proliferated. There are many more types of these high-powered guns today than in 1994, when the ban was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.Law- abiding citizens own those guns, Cornyn said, and “no law-abiding citizen is a threat to public safety.”Despite the current standstill, John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, says last year’s bill was proof that they can break gridlock.“It was never the finish line,” he said.___Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853317,Chaplains made part of Ukraine's military as war drags on,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — To the haunting chants of a church choir in Kyiv’s 11th century Saint Sophia Cathedral, the first group of chaplains to join the Ukrainian military’s command structure graduated in a ceremony Saturday.Although chaplains have ministered to Ukraine's armed forces for years, they worked as embedded civilians rather than as officers. Now, they will sign contracts to serve in those armed forces, undergo a six-week training program and get inducted.The first group of military chaplains to fall under this new system began training Feb. 20. In their new assignments, they won't use weapons but are expected to know general military concepts and tactical medicine, Ukrainian authorities said.“We had intense psychological training, military training,” Gennadiy Rohmanenko, who was among the graduates who received the rank of junior lieutenant, said. ""It means that we can put together church duty and military duty. The motto of chaplains is ‘Being there,’ God’s presence in the army. This is the mission of the chaplain.”Creating the Ukrainian Chaplaincy Service came in response to legislation passed at the end of 2021. With Ukraine entering its second year of war against Russia’s invasion, the need for chaplains to support its soldiers is greater than ever.The 30 chaplains who went through the first training came from five religious organizations: the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, the Ukrainian Evangelical Church, the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian-Baptist Churches and the interdenominational Council of Christian Churches and Religious Organizations.Rohmanenko has worked as an army chaplain since 2014, initially as a volunteer and then as an embedded civilian, so he knows what the mission requires.The job entails “guardianship and spiritual shepherding or spiritual consoling,” Rohmanenko said, noting the importance of showing a service member direction.“In the rear of the battle, military operations, a person sometimes loses his bearings,” he said. “Therefore, the most difficult thing for a soldier in battle is to remain human. So chaplains need to do everything to save a soldier’s soul after their combat duties.”Another freshly minted junior lieutenant, Yevren Flysta of the 105th Brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces, said soldiers are, first and foremost, “a spiritual person, and he must have strength, he must have support.”Destructive forces, Flysta said, “affect (a soldier’s) internal self-esteem, self-perception. Therefore, our task is to preserve a person as a person, a person of spiritual strength.”___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/04/01,,World

All three had 2-1 records in their pool and Australia missed out on points difference just five months after winning the delayed 2022 Hong Kong Sevens for the first time in 34 years.Australia paid for having to come from behind to beat Spain 12-7, then was routed by the U.S. 24-5 after scoring in the first minute and being tied 5-5 at halftime.The quarterfinals on Sunday feature Fiji, the most successful team in Hong Kong, against South Africa, which has never won here; series leaders New Zealand and Argentina in a showdown; the U.S. against Britain; and Spain playing France.Fiji lost to Argentina in the knockout rounds of the last two world series events, but in their match on Saturday Fiji came from 14-5 down with three converted tries in five minutes in winning 26-19.Napolioni Bolaca put Fiji beyond reach when he shrugged off tackles by Santiago Vera Feld and Rodrigo Isgro on the Argentine 22, placed the ball and picked it back up, and slipped away from Joaquin Pellandini to score between the posts.Argentina dropped into a quarterfinal with New Zealand. They have met in two finals already this season: Argentina won in Hamilton in January and New Zealand won in Los Angeles five weeks ago.New Zealand won its pool match against South Africa 12-7, with Cody Vai's second-half try the only difference.South Africa finished pool runner-up when it beat Kenya 26-17 with a spectacular try from Siviwe Soyizwapi, who caught a short kickoff in the air amidst two Kenyans and zoomed 40 meters to the line.France was also unbeaten after beating both Uruguay and Britain 17-14.The first Hong Kong women's tournament was down to four teams: Heavyweights New Zealand and Australia face first-time semifinalists this season, Fiji and Britain respectively.New Zealand and Australia comfortably handled Canada and Ireland, but Fiji downed the United States 19-14 after a last-minute try by Reapi Ulunisau after Ilisapeci Delaiwau stripped the ball in a tackle.

It was the first trip to the capital of Cairo for a Syrian foreign minister in over a decade.Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad met with Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry, according to Ahmed Abu Zaid, a spokesperson for the Egyptian foreign ministry.Syria’s state-run SANA news agency reported that Mekdad would discuss bilateral ties and the latest developments in the region and the world.Mekdad’s visit comes as the two countries inch toward re-establishing ties. It's been more than a decade since Syria was globally isolated after President Bashar Assad’s brutal crackdown on mass protests against his rule in the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. The unrest quickly descended into protracted civil war.For years, many public figures in Egypt have urged the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi to restore ties with Assad’s government. They also pushed for Damascus’ return to the Cairo-based Arab League.Syria was suspended from the Arab League and other pan-Arab organizations. But in recent years several Arab countries have begun restoring ties with Assad’s government after it regained control over most of the country, thanks to military assistance from Iran and Russia.A devastating earthquake that stuck Turkey and Syria in February has intensified moves to normalize ties with Syria. Several Arab nations dispatched senior officials and sent aid to show solidarity with Syria and Turkey.El-Sissi spoke with Assad by phone after the earthquake hit and sent Shoukry to Damascus, where he met with Assad.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853341,"Wisconsin Supreme Court control, abortion access at stake","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and likely the future of abortion access, Republican-drawn legislative maps and years of GOP policies in the key swing state rests with the outcome an election Tuesday that has seen record campaign spending.The winner of the high-stakes contest between Republican-backed Dan Kelly and Democratic-supported Janet Protasiewicz will determine majority control of the court headed into the 2024 presidential election. The court came within one vote of overturning President Joe Biden’s narrow win in 2020, and both sides expect another close race in 2024.It's the latest election where abortion rights has been the central issue since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June. It's also an example of how officially nonpartisan court races have grown into political battles as major legal fights play out at the state level.All of it has fueled spending that will double, and likely triple or more, the previous high of $15.4 million spent on a state court race in Illinois in 2004. Democrats have spent heavily for Protasiewicz and Republicans for Kelly.Democrats are trying to flip control of the court, which has had a majority of conservative justices the past 15 years. That has allowed the court to uphold an array of Republican priorities, including banning absentee ballot drop boxes last year and affirming the 2011 law all-but ending collective bargaining for most public workers.“The policy direction of Wisconsin is going to be determined in large part by this Supreme Court race,” said University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Barry Burden. “Everything from abortion to disputes over the 2024 presidential election are going to land in the lap of this court. And the winner will be the deciding justice on these issues.”Protasiewicz, 60, has tried to make the race a referendum on abortion, running on a Democratic-backed agenda that includes her loudly voicing her “personal values"" in support of abortion rights.The court is expected to rule on a lawsuit challenging the state's 174-year-old law banning nearly all abortions.That law, enacted a year after statehood, went back into effect after the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, leading to an end to abortions being provided in Wisconsin. Democrats, including Gov. Tony Evers who won reelection in November, have seized on the issue.“Abortion was a real motivator for Democrats and independents,"" Burden said. “It's been amped up in this election because the court has a real role in determining the policy.”Protasiewicz won the backing of Planned Parenthood and other similar groups as she focused on abortion without saying how she would rule on the pending case challenging the ban. But she's promised that Kelly would vote to uphold it.Kelly hasn’t said whether he thinks the ban is legal. But he has expressed opposition to abortion in the past, including in a 2012 blog post in which he said the Democratic Party and the National Organization for Women were committed to normalizing the taking of human life.Kelly also has done legal work for Wisconsin Right to Life, one of three anti-abortion groups that has endorsed him.Abortion isn't the only hot political issue Protasiewicz has embraced. She also called the Republican-drawn legislative maps upheld by the current court “rigged” and said she would welcome revisiting them.The state Supreme Court upheld Republican-drawn maps in 2022. Those maps, widely regarded as among the most gerrymandered in the country, have helped Republicans increase their hold on the state Legislature to near supermajority levels, even as Democrats have won statewide elections, including Evers as governor in both 2018 and 2022 and Biden in 2020.When asked in an interview on Wisconsin Public Radio whether he thought the GOP-drawn maps were fair, Kelly punted.“I think that’s a political judgment,” he said, adding that his view was “entirely irrelevant.”Kelly was appointed to the state Supreme Court by then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, in 2016. He served four years before being defeated in 2020 on the same ballot as the Democratic presidential primary. Kelly was endorsed by then-President Donald Trump that year.Protasiewicz has tried to paint Kelly as an “extreme partisan” and a “true threat to democracy” given his ties to Republicans, including advising them on the plan to have fake GOP electors cast their ballots for Trump following the 2020 election even though he had lost.Four of the past six presidential races in Wisconsin have been decided by less than a percentage point, including Trump’s victory in 2016 and Biden’s win in 2020.Kelly, 58, has tried to distance himself from his previous Republican clients and his political beliefs.“I don’t talk about my politics because I understand they are not relevant to the work of the court,” he told the Dane County Bar Association in March. “We’re there to decide questions of the law and that’s it.”Protasiewicz is a former prosecutor who was first elected as a Milwaukee County judge in 2014.Kelly has accused Protasiewicz of being “bought and paid for” by Democrats and crossing the line by all-but declaring how she would rule on cases expected to come before the court. Kelly also tried to paint Protasiewicz as soft on crime, citing cases she handled as a judge, while also accusing her of “straight up lying” throughout the campaign on various issues.The winner will serve a 10-year term starting in August replacing retiring conservative Justice Pat Roggensack.In a sign of how divisive the race is, Roggensack endorsed Kelly, while her daughter, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Ellen Brostrom, backed Protasiewicz. Brostrom said Kelly was “unfit” to serve because of his involvement in the fake GOP electors scheme.",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853347,Finland election: Why a labor shortage could be guiding voters,"Finland is suffering from a shortage of workers. This long-standing problem has flown under the radar, hidden by more prominent headlines, most notably the Nordic country's pivot towards NATO. But it could prove a key issue as Finns head to the polls for a general election on April 2 to decide who should steer the country next.Since pandemic restrictions eased, the labor shortage has become even worse. In Uusimaa — the most populous region of Finland that includes the capital Helsinki — the share of unfilled vacancies has increased from 25% in 2019 to almost 60% in 2022.Finland's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment recognizes 56 occupations as suffering from worker shortages. Health and social services account for the majority of the top 15 jobs lacking workers.In a televised national debate in March, Finnish party leaders from across the political spectrum openly admitted that the country is currently operating without a well-functioning healthcare system, partly because there aren't enough nurses.The problem extends to other low-wage occupations too, with restaurant workers and builders also on the government's labor shortage list.For Nico Flinkman, a chef at Helsinki-based seafood restaurant Fisken pa Disken, it is not so much a lack of applicants that Finland suffers from, but rather the ready availability of skilled workers.""You still have to train them up,"" said the Finnish-born chef, who himself acquired his culinary skills abroad in Lyon, France, before returning.""Wages aren't that high and hours can be pretty long, so we really need a higher basic pay,"" he told DW. Finland doesn't have a statutory minimum wage, with employers and trade unions making collective agreements on sector-specific pay.The small town of Kankaanpää, some 274 kilometers (170 miles) west of Helsinki, has attracted over 100 Ukrainian refugees to study and work in factories assembling electrical equipment.A lack of both Finnish- and English-language skills has hindered the integration of some Ukrainians. But the town's mayor is adamant that immigration offers a solution.""Our own population development is such that the labor force is simply not enough, even if we were to succeed in guiding our own students and unemployed people into working life better,"" Kankaanpää Mayor Mika Hatanpää told DW.There is a widely held consensus among Finland's major political parties that the country must open its doors to more foreign workers.But Finland's right-wing parties see ithings differently.""They say that if social security and unemployment benefits are too good, people won't have enough economic incentives to go to work,"" Merja Kauhanen, chief researcher at Finland's Labour Institute for Economic Research, told DW.Around 20,000 people move to Finland for work every year. But demographic changes have many fearing that won't be enough. Finland's population is on track to start declining by 2034. The country has recorded less than 50,000 births per year for the last four years in a row.""We are ageing. We don't get enough babies, we don't get enough immigration and people are getting older,"" Leena Pöntynen, director at lobbying group Technology Industries of Finland (TIF), told DW.Finland's technology industry accounts for more than half of Finland's exports, with a total 317,000 tech workers.""We still need another 130,000 new employees within the next 10 years,"" said Pöntynen.Innovative solutions are already afoot. American multinational firm Microsoft is offering a 90-day ""micro-degree"" intended to plug a shortage in technology experts and hopes the initiative may bring in some 100,000 professionals within five years. And Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark recently engaged in a Twitter spat with Finnish far-right leader Riikka Purra, after the politician claimed migrant workers were ""economically detrimental.""Despite topping global happiness charts, Pöntynen believes Finland doesn't advertise itself enough to foreign workers.The high quality of life, which is ""as simple as fresh air, or the safety of the country, which lets 5-year-olds out by themselves,"" must be taken advantage of if Finland is to increase its skilled foreign workforce, she says.Edited by: Kristie Pladson",2023/04/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853348,Ukraine updates: Russia takes UN Security Council presidency,"Russia is scheduled to take on the presidency of the UN Security Council on Saturday.A day earlier, the Kremlin said Russia plans to exercise all the rights afforded by the role.Meanwhile, the United States urged Russia to ""conduct itself professionally"" while holding the position. The US said that there was no way to prevent Russia from assuming the presidency.UN member states take on the rotating presidency of the Security Council in alphabetical order according to the English-language names of each country.The council's presidency will be held by Russia for the month of April, after which it will be replaced by Switzerland. Russia's presidency follows that of Mozambique.Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said that this represented a ""symbolic blow to the rules-based system of international relations.""""It is very telling that on the holiday of one terror state — Iran — another terror state — Russia — begins to preside over the UN Security Council,"" Yermak said, referring to the Islamic Republic Day observed in Iran.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called Russia's presidency a ""slap in the face to the international community."" He urged Security Council members to ""thwart any Russian attempts to abuse its presidency,"" calling Russia an ""outlaw.""Ukraine has accused Tehran of supplying Russia with arms.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning Russia's war in Ukraine on Saturday, April 1:The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Kim Yo Jong, has accused Ukraine of having nuclear ambitions.Kim Yo Jong based the claim on an online petition which calls for Ukraine to station nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory or alternatively to acquire its own nuclear weapons.In Ukraine, petitions need to garner 25,000 signatures within 90 days for a response from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The petition was filed on Friday and had received 640 signatures by Saturday afternoon.Kim said that the petition could be a political plot by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office.The petition follows Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement that Moscow plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.North Korea is seeking to expand its own nuclear stockpile and has engaged in a number of ballistic missile tests over the past year.Metropolitan Pavlo said police had searched his home over a stand-off between authorities and the  Monastery of the Caves in Kyiv.""They told me in two words that I am suspected of working for Russia,"" said in a video released by Russian state news agency Ria Novosti.Pavlo later said that he had been put under house arrest, Ukrainian news portal RBK-Ukraina reported.RBK-Ukraina said the cleric was suspected of ""inciting inter-religious discord"" and ""justifying the Russian Federation's military aggression.""Metropolitan Pavlo belongs to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which was traditionally under the Russia-based Moscow Patriarchate. It split from the Russian church following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Ukrainian authorities suspect the church of espionage and agitation for Moscow.The church is separate from the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which was established in 2018 and is the predominant denomination in the country.An intelligence update from the British Defense Ministry says that Moscow has made only ""marginal"" gains in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.The ministry said the tenure of Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, who took office in January, has been ""characterized by an effort to launch a general winter offensive with the aim of extending Russian control over the whole of the Donbas region.""""Eighty days on, it is increasingly apparent that this project has failed,"" the intelligence update said.The ministry said that Russian forces had sustained tens of thousands of casualties. It argued that Russia is ""largely squandering its temporary advantage in personnel gained from the autumn's 'partial mobilisation.'""In September, Moscow announced a ""partial"" mobilization of reservists, adding 300,000 troops to its forces.The British intelligence update said that there is ""a realistic possibility that Gerasimov is pushing the limits of how far Russia's political leadership will tolerate failure.""Ukraine's government has requested the delivery of 100 Rosomak multi-purpose armored vehicles from Poland, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said.""I bring an order placed yesterday by (Ukrainian) Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal for 100 Rosomaks that will be fabricated here,"" Morawiecki said.The vehicles are made in Poland under a Finnish license. The order will be jointly financed through EU funds received by Warsaw and US funds received by Kyiv, Morawiecki said.Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has vowed to increase munitions supplies to Russian forces in Ukraine.Shoigu was shown making the statement in a video of him visiting the headquarters of Russian troops in Ukraine published by the Defense Ministry.The minister said: ""The volume of supplies of the most demanded ammunition has been determined. Necessary measures are being taken to increase them.""Russia's Defense Ministry has been criticized by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, for allegedly failing to supply sufficient munitions to troops.The International Olympics Committee (IOC) has criticized a Ukrainian government decision not to allow Ukrainian athletes to participate in events including Belarusian and Russian players.Ukrainian government minister Oleh Nemchinov announced the decision on Friday. The IOC has allowed Russians and Belarusians to participate in qualifying events for the 2024 Paris Olympics as ""neutral"" athletes without flags or anthems..Ukrainian officials are set to make a decision on participation in the Paris Games at a later date.""If implemented, such a decision would only hurt the Ukrainian athlete community, and in no way impact the war that the world wants to stop, and that the IOC has so vehemently condemned,"" the committee said.""The IOC has always maintained that it is not up to governments to decide which athletes can participate in which international competitions,"" the committee added. ""Due to the fact that there are, unfortunately, far too many wars, armed conflicts and crises in this world, we have seen in almost all editions of the Games athletes compete with each other despite the fact that their nations are at war or in conflict.""sdi/sms (Reuters, dpa, AP, AFP)",2023/04/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853349,"Pop, Gasol, Hammon, Parker, Nowitzki, Wade heading to Hall","Tony Parker and Pau Gasol played for him. Becky Hammon coached alongside him. Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade waged battles against him.He is Gregg Popovich.And he, finally, is a Hall of Famer.The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame made it official Saturday, with three of the NBA’s all-time international greats — Nowitzki, Parker and Gasol — joining Wade, Hammon and Popovich as the headliners of the 2023 class that will be enshrined on Aug. 11 and 12 at ceremonies in Connecticut and Massachusetts.“This is basketball heaven,” Wade said on the ESPN telecast of the announcement in Houston.Also getting the Hall’s call: the 1976 U.S. Olympic women's basketball team; former Purdue coach Gene Keady, a seven-time Big Ten coach of the year; former Texas A&M women's coach Gary Blair, who took two teams to the Final Four; longtime coach at Division III Amherst and two-time national champion David Hixon; and Gene Bess — who won 1,300 games as a junior college coach at Three Rivers Community College in Poplar Bluff, Missouri.The late Jim Valvano, who as a coach who led N.C. State to the 1983 NCAA title, was selected as a contributor — also taking into account his work as a broadcaster and an outspoken advocate for cancer research and the V Foundation.Hall of Fame chairman Jerry Colangelo told the new members or their families about the happy news earlier this week. Most of them joined Colangelo and other Hall of Famers on Friday for a welcome dinner of sorts, then on Saturday took their first public bows as basketball royalty.“This class not only represents all levels of basketball — it represents truly, in every regard, what the game is all about and where it is,” Colangelo told The Associated Press. “I mean, think about the candidates. There’s the countries that are represented, Germany and Spain and France. It shows how far the game has come and where it is today. I think maybe it’s the most unique class, I’d say, of all time, and that covers a lot of territory. It stands by itself as in its uniqueness.”The four NBA players — Nowitzki, Parker, Gasol and Wade — combined for 95,092 points, 39 All-Star appearances and 10 NBA championships. Hammon was a six-time WNBA All-Star and is coach of the reigning WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces.And all Popovich has done is win five NBA titles, more games than anyone else in league history and an Olympic gold medal at the Tokyo Games that were played in 2021.“He’s amazing,” said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, who played for Popovich and coached under him with USA Basketball at the 2019 World Cup and then the Tokyo Olympics. “The Hall of Fame was just a formality. Everybody knew he would be there. It was just a matter of when.”The longstanding belief was that Popovich wanted certain people in the Hall before he would allow himself to be under consideration. Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili had to go in first, and Popovich also lobbied for Houston two-time champion coach Rudy Tomjanovich. Parker going in with Popovich seems fitting, and Popovich has long raved about Hammon’s ability.“In all honesty, I always felt the Hall of Fame is like for Red Holzman, Red Auerbach and Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. ... I’ve never felt like I really belonged, to be honest with you,” Popovich said. “I’m not trying to be ‘Mr. Humble’ or anything. I’m a Division III guy. I’m not a Hall of Fame guy.”It's the latest accolade for Gasol, Spain's longtime star whose two NBA championships came with the Los Angeles Lakers alongside his dear friend Kobe Bryant. Nowitzki, the German great who changed the game with his combination of big-man size and guard skills, spent the entirety of his 21-year career in Dallas and is sixth on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Parker won four rings with Popovich in San Antonio.“When Jerry called, I tried to stay all cool on the phone ... but this is super cool,” Nowitzki said. “And I called my family, my immediate family ... and my mom, right away, said, ‘I’m the mother of a Hall of Famer.' That's when it really set in.”Wade won three titles with Miami. At the arena where the Heat play, they've retired the numbers of five former players — Tim Hardaway, Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning, Chris Bosh and Wade. And now all five of them are linked by Hall of Fame membership as well.Like Parker, Nowitzki and Gasol — and Popovich, for that matter — Wade got in on his first ballot.“To me, it's a no-brainer that all of these guys are first-ballot guys,” Heat president Pat Riley said. “Look at the records. Look at the longevity that they’ve had in this league. Look what they’ve done for the league, and how much the league calls them back — because they’re ambassadors of this great league and they have a great voice and a great message. Dwyane being a first-ballot was a no-brainer.”The class will get its jackets and Hall of Fame rings on Aug. 11 in Uncasville, Connecticut, then the ceremony and their speeches will come on Aug. 12 in Springfield, Massachusetts.“It's incredible,” Popovich said on the telecast. “It's obviously an honor ... I sit here amongst people who I've always been in awe of myself. So to be in this situation is kind of an out-of-body experience to be honest with you. All I can do is thank all the people who have helped me to be in this position.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853360,Drug trafficking blamed as homicides soar in Costa Rica,"LIMON, Costa Rica (AP) — In this colorful Caribbean port, where cruise ship passengers are whisked to jungle adventures in Costa Rica’s interior, locals try to be home by dark and police patrol with high-caliber guns in the face of soaring drug violence.Costa Rica logged a record 657 homicides last year and Limon – with a homicide rate five times the national average -- was the epicenter.The bloodshed in a country better known for its laid-back, “it’s all good” outlook and its lack of a standing army has stirred a public outcry as the administration of President Rodrigo Chaves scrambles for answers.Where Costa Rica had previously been just a pass-through for northbound cocaine from Colombian and Mexican cartels, authorities say it is now a warehousing and transshipment point for drugs sent to Europe by homegrown Costa Rican gangs.In Limon, that shifting criminal dynamic has mixed with swelling ranks of young unemployed men who make up the majority of the casualties in fierce territorial battles.Martín Arias, the deputy security minister and head of Costa Rica’s Coast Guard, said Limon’s violence stems from disputes over both the control of cocaine shipped to Europe and the marijuana sold locally.In January, authorities dismantled a ring working to smuggle drugs through the container port. Cocaine has been secreted into walls of the steel containers and even packed among pineapple and yucca headed for Spain and Holland.Foreign drug traffickers used to pay Costa Rican fishermen to bring gasoline to their smuggling boats.“Later, the Mexican narcos said, ‘We’re not going to use money; we’re not going to leave the trail that money leaves in banks, in systems; we’re going to pay in cocaine,’” Arias said.At first, the fishermen and their associates didn’t have the contacts to sell their cocaine abroad, so they sold it locally as crack. But once they realized how much more the cocaine was worth in Europe, they began smuggling it out of the port, he said.Meanwhile, marijuana was arriving from Jamaica and Colombia, and gangs fought over the local market. Victims of that violence are mostly in marginalized neighborhoods, Arias said.Costa Rican authorities classified 421 of last year’s 657 homicides as “score settling.”Former Security Minister Gustavo Mata estimated that 80% of the killings in Costa Rica were related to the growth in drug trafficking.“We used to talk about Colombian cartels, Mexican cartels,” Mata said. But now investigators have found gangs led by Costa Ricans, he said.Mata, who served as security minister from 2015 to 2018, said that Costa Rica had become an “enormous warehouse” of drugs and an operations center for exports to Europe.The Limon port’s shipping business – both legal and illegal – has placed it at the center of violence.“In Limon, there are four strong criminal groups competing for the drug market,” said Randall Zúñiga, director of Costa Rica’s Judicial Investigation Department. These groups clash, and “generally the people who die are sellers or members of the criminal groups.”But the violence has not been confined to Limon or to those involved in the drug trade.The Feb. 28 shooting of 8-year-old Samuel Arroyo, killed by a stray bullet while he slept in the capital San Jose, stirred popular outrage. Costa Ricans with no connection to the boy’s family turned out for his funeral carrying white balloons.President Chaves said Samuel died in a manner that was “outrageous, inexplicable and unacceptable.” The president said the shooting apparently stemmed from a gang war. A 15-year-old was arrested in connection with the death.One month earlier, Ingrid Muñoz organized a demonstration outside federal courts in San Jose to demand action after her 19-year-old son Keylor Gambia was killed defending his girlfriend from an assault.“What we’re seeking is to create consciousness so that there is not impunity,” Muñoz said. “What we want is justice, so that the judges, as well as the prosecutors, understand the serious situation that not only the youth, but everyone in the country, is living.”Security Minister Jorge Torres, in comments to congress in January, faulted a justice system in which he said those sentenced on drug violations serve only a fraction of their prison sentences. “There are crimes for which you must serve the entire sentence,” Torres said.Torres said he would have a new security strategy ready by June, but meanwhile more resources for police were needed. “If we want to resolve this in the short term we need more police in the streets,” he said.Limon sits 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of San Jose. It is Costa Rica’s most important port, handling much of the country’s exports to the United States and Europe.In 2018, the government privatized its container port, giving the concession to a Dutch company.Antonio Wells, secretary general of the dockworkers union for Costa Rica’s Atlantic ports, said some 7,000 jobs were lost in the port privatization, which he blames for Limon's social problems.Last year, Limon was the canton with the second-highest murder rate with more than 62 homicides per 100,000 residents.“If there are no jobs, it sounds terrible to say, but for many the closest thing to a job is being a hit man,” Wells said.Costa Rica’s murder rate has increased in each of the last four years. Last year's rate was 12.6 per 100,000 residents, still only about one-third of Honduras, but the highest for Costa Rica since at least 1990.Costa Rica’s Association of Professionals in Economic Sciences in January found a strong correlation between low levels of development and high homicide rates in the most violent cantons like Limon.“This isn’t the Limon I grew up in,” a retiree who identified himself only as David said on a recent day as he chatted with others in the city’s central square. “After 9 o’clock at night you can’t walk and it’s really sad.""",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853361,Gabriel Jesus ends drought as Arsenal beats Leeds 4-1 in EPL,"LONDON (AP) — Gabriel Jesus ended a six-month scoring drought by netting twice as Premier League leader Arsenal beat Leeds 4-1 on Saturday to maintain some breathing space atop the standings.Jesus converted a first-half penalty for his first goal since Oct. 1 to give Arsenal the lead, and then made it 3-0 with a simple finish from close range in the 55th. The Brazilian striker had played 17 games for club and country without a goal, a stretch that was also interrupted by a lengthy spell on the sidelines after being injured at the World Cup.“I want to score every game,” Jesus said. “But sometimes it can’t happen. I am more happy with the three points than the goals.”Ben White added the second goal shortly after the halftime break and Granit Xhaka headed in a late fourth as Arsenal maintained an eight-point gap over defending champion Manchester City, which has a game in hand.Leeds pulled a goal back with a deflected shot by Rasmus Kristensen to make it 3-1 in the 76th, but the loss leaves the visitors just a point above the relegation zone.After City battered Liverpool 4-1 in the early game, Arsenal was under pressure to respond but nearly went behind inside 10 seconds for the second time in its last three home league games. Leeds almost replicated Bournemouth’s feat of scoring straight from the kickoff at the Emirates with a quick attack down the right flank, but Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale kept out Kristensen's shot that time.Bukayo Saka was on the bench for Arsenal for the first time in the league since December 2021 because of a minor illness, and the Gunners’ attack seemed to lack its normal fluidity for the opening 30 minutes — although Jesus wasted a great chance in the 11th when he headed over the bar from six yards out. Instead it was Ramsdale that had saves to make as he had to deny Crysencio Summerville and Jack Harrison in quick succession shortly after the half-hour mark.But Arsenal went ahead after Luke Ayling tripped Jesus in the area and the Brazilian converted the spot kick by sending Illan Meslier the wrong way and slotting his shot down the middle.It was all Arsenal in the second half, as White was on hand at the far post to steer in a low cross from Gabriel Martinelli in the 47th to double the lead.Jesus then played a neat interchange with Leandro Trossard, who broke into the area and squared the ball back for the striker to toe-poke into the net from six yards out.It was Jesus' first league start since November following surgery on a knee injury sustained at the World Cup.“So happy for him, and everybody who contributed to having him in the state that he is at the moment,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said. ""Because he put so much work (into) it. He brings that quality, that unpredictability to the squad.”While Kristensen gave the visitors some hope when his shot deflected off the back of Oleksandr Zinchenko to wrongfoot Ramsdale, Arsenal responded with a rare headed goal from Xhaka, as the Switzerland midfielder met a cross from Martin Odegaard to seal the win.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

Zaha had scored seven goals in his prior 10 games against Leicester. Ayew replaced him.Leicester has lost five of its last six games and Saturday's defeat drops Brendan Rodgers' team into the relegation zone.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

But Tavernier’s stunning solo effort and Solanke’s 79th-minute winner were enough to give the hosts all the points.Fulham was without suspended duo Willian and Aleksandar Mitrovic following their red cards in the FA Cup quarterfinal defeat at Manchester United. But the visitors were comfortably the better team in the first half and took just 16 minutes to open the scoring.Willian’s replacement Manor Solomon broke free down the left before cutting the ball back for Harrison Reed to tee up Pereira, who fired home his first league goal since November.Bournemouth boss Gary O’Neil summoned the fit-again Tavernier and Ryan Christie off the bench at halftime and his team was much improved in the second half.Tavernier, sidelined by injury since February, took just five minutes to make his mark with a brilliant equalizer.Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno looked to have got enough distance on his punch away from a corner only for Tavernier to pick up the loose ball before cutting in from the right and curling an unstoppable left-footed shot into the top corner from 20 yards (meters) out.Bournemouth took a deserved lead 11 minutes from time courtesy of a scruffy strike from Solanke, who has now scored four goals in five career appearances against Fulham.Defeat leaves Fulham four points off the European places.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853378,"IndyCar action picks up on, off track 1 month into season","FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — IndyCar champion Will Power has a new contract with Team Penske, and reigning Indianapolis 500 winner Marcus Ericsson wants an extended deal from Chip Ganassi.Colton Herta split with his race strategist — who happens to be his father — as Andretti Autosport moved Bryan Herta to second-year driver Kyle Kirkwood.Callum Ilott is frustrated by only a minimal offseason increase in speed from his small IndyCar team, which could jump-start talks between the young British racer and larger organizations.It’s been nearly a month since IndyCar's sloppy season-opener on the downtown streets of St. Petersburg, Florida, and with Sunday's race looming, the action on and off the track is already booming.The Texas Motor Speedway is the first oval race of the season, a warmup of sorts for next month's Indianapolis 500. It'll also be the season debut for oval specialists Ed Carpenter and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato.Team owner A.J. Foyt is also at his first race of the year after skipping the IndyCar opener as he had a pacemaker installed two days after St. Pete, where both his cars were involved in a race-ending crash in the third turn of the first lap.CONTRACT TALKSPower, who won his second IndyCar title last season, said at the season-opener that his future with Team Penske was secure and the two sides were hammering out the final details on an extension.By the time he got to Texas, the multi-year deal was done and the Australian will likely close his career with Roger Penske and longtime sponsor Verizon. Power's new deal is likely through 2025, when he will be 44 years old.“I’ve been at Team Penske a long time and feel bloody fortunate to be able to drive for Roger Penske for that long,"" Power said. ""The older you get, the more you realize how blessed you are to be in this situation.”Ericsson, who earned the fourth win of his IndyCar career with a late pass of Pato O'Ward in St. Petersburg, brings sponsorship to Chip Ganassi Racing and is in a contract year. Ganassi said before Ericsson's season-opening win he wants to retain the Swede.“It’s up to him,” said Ericsson, the points leader headed into Sunday's race. “He needs to give me an offer for ’24 onward. The ball is in his corner. I really enjoy it at Ganassi, and we’ve done a lot of great things together and would love to continue ... He knows very well what I want.”Ilott, meanwhile, finished an IndyCar-best fifth at St. Pete for Juncos Hollinger Racing, which has expanded to two cars this season and had a decent opening race. But he was hugely disappointed in the pace of his car and felt the Juncos organization just doesn't have the speed to compete for podiums and wins.But he was vague on the length of his contract with Juncos, and signed an extension last year to return for a second season.“I'm quick enough to be on the front end a lot of these weekends,” Ilott said. “It's pretty obvious that I'm quite interested (in bigger teams). People are interested in me as a driver, but I need to focus on the job that I've got here. I'm confident whether it's in one year, two years, three years, four years — if I'm wanted now, I'll always be wanted. I'm a good enough driver that I don't need to learn confidence.”HERTA'S SPLITAndretti Autosport made an internal personnel change after the season-opening in switching the strategists for Herta and Kirkwood. Both drivers said Saturday they did not request the change, nor were they given a reason for the swap.Herta's strategist has been his father, who is also his manager, since 2021. Although the two occasionally sniped at each other, Herta was adamant he did not request the change. He's now paired with Scott Harner, a former longtime Ganassi executive who spent half of last season as Kirkwood's strategist and moved to Andretti from A.J. Foyt Racing with Kirkwood.“I don't know why they changed it, but do I think a needed change would have changed the result of the race? No,” Herta said. “It was a team decision, that's all I'm going to say.”The four Andretti cars were fast in the season-opening race and capable of contending for the win, but all four drivers ended up crashed out.Kirkwood said he asked why the strategist change was being made but was not given an answer. There's some speculation that Andretti believes Kirkwood can have a breakout season and would benefit from Bryan Herta's steady leadership.Herta was the winning strategist on two Indianapolis 500 wins. Colton Herta, although he just turned 23 on Friday, is the most veteran Andretti driver on the roster in his fifth season. He's also the youngest driver on the team.“It's really good for me because (Bryan Herta) is a driver, right?” Kirkwood said. ""He knows exactly what a driver wants to hear and what he doesn't want to hear. To have him on the stand is a huge asset for me.“I don't what it is with the family deal, I don't know if they want to separate that, but they just said this was best for the team and they think it's going to be really good for me, and they feel Colton is ready for Scott.”ODDS AND ENDSFelix Rosenqvist of Arrow McLaren won the pole for the second consecutive year. He was followed by Scott Dixon, new McLaren teammate Alexander Rossi, defending race winner Josef Newgarden and Pato O'Ward, the third driver in the McLaren lineup. Sato qualified sixth for his season debut. The Japanese driver currently only has Texas and the Indy 500 guaranteed with Ganassi. ... IndyCar held a Saturday afternoon “high line practice” in which all 28 drivers were sent out on the track to attempt to create a second lane for passing on the top of the speedway. ... O'Ward bought three suites and sold out all 191 ticket packages he presented to fans for a two-day experience at the track. He also gave away 600 grandstands seats to anyone who purchased a single item from his merchandise store. O'Ward is from Monterrey, Mexico, but grew up in San Antonio and considers Texas Motor Speedway his home track.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

Kellione put the Pioneers back in front when she made two foul shots with 90 seconds remaining and Gabbi San Diego kissed a left-hand layup off the glass but Thornton scored inside and, after San Diego missed a layup attempt, Kellione made two free throws to give Transylvania a four-point lead with 13.5 seconds to go.Hannah Kaloi had 13 points, seven rebounds and two blocks for Christopher Newport and San Diego finished with 11 points, five assists and two steals.The Pioneers used an tie-breaking 13-0 run — including eight points by Thornton — in the third quarter to take their biggest lead of the game at 36-23 midway through the period.Kennedy Harris hit a 3-pointer with 7:05 left in the second quarter that made it 20-18 and Transylvania never again trailed.Christopher Newport won the men's D-III national championship when Trey Barber made a buzzer-beating layup to beat Mount Union 74-72 in the title game on March 18.___More AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853380,Tuchel's Bayern beats Dortmund 4-2 in 'Klassiker' to go top,"BERLIN (AP) — Thomas Müller scored twice and Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 4-2 in “der Klassiker” on Saturday to overtake the visitors at the top of the Bundesliga and give Thomas Tuchel a winning start as coach.Bayern capitalized on a major mistake by Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel on his return from injury to move two points above Dortmund with eight rounds of the league remaining.It was Tuchel’s first game in charge of the Bavarian powerhouse – and against his former club.“It was a good first step,” said Tuchel, whose predecessor, Julian Nagelsmann, was fired last week after Bayern’s 2-1 loss at Bayer Leverkusen.Kobel was adjudged to have scored an own-goal after letting through Dayot Upamecano’s hopeful forward ball, Müller added two more by the 23rd minute, and Kingsley Coman got the fourth in the 50th as Bayern overran the visitors.Emre Can's 72nd-minute penalty and Donyell Malen's last-minute goal provided some consolation for Dortmund.It was Dortmund’s first defeat in the Bundesliga in 2023, and it continued a long line of losses for the “black and yellows” in Munich.“After this game it's about drawing the right conclusions and processing it,” Dortmund coach Edin Terzić said. “We'll look at the table tomorrow and see that we're still just two points off the lead.”Tuchel opted for a back four, but there was little immediate sign of the former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain coach’s input after such a short time in Munich.Bayern grew in confidence as Dortmund struggled to recover from the shock of the opening goal.The visitors had made the better start but Kobel gifted Bayern the lead in the 13th minute. Upamecano sent a long hopeful punt forward and the unpressured Kobel mistimed his clearance, allowing the ball to roll past into the goal behind him.“Everyone saw it,” Dortmund captain Marco Reus said. “He won so many games for us already this season, produced so many great saves. This situation was bitter.”Kobel, just back after missing four games with a thigh problem, again looked bad when Müller beat him from close range at his near post in the 18th, and once again when he allowed the rebound from Leroy Sané’s shot land at Müller’s feet for the Bayern veteran’s second goal five minutes later.Dortmund defender Nico Schlotterbeck, who returned from Germany duty with a thigh problem, had to go off injured before the break. Mats Hummels came on against his former side in his place.Sané set up Coman for 4-0 in the 50th. Kobel got his hand to the ball but couldn’t keep it out. Coman had already missed two good chances before the break.It could have been worse for Dortmund – Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting had a spectacular overhead goal ruled out for offside, Serge Gnabry also had a goal disallowed, and Bayern went on to miss further opportunities before Dortmund's late response.UNION STILL FLYING HIGHStuttgart midfielder Genki Haraguchi scored an own-goal in his first return to Union Berlin as his former team won 3-0 and consolidated third place.Sheraldo Becker scored in the 51st minute to get Union off the mark, then Kevin Behrens struck from close range in the 67th, a minute before Haraguchi deflected Behrens’ cross into his own net.It lifted Union four points clear of fourth-place Freiburg, which still holds the last place for Champions League qualification despite a 1-1 draw with Hertha Berlin.Jessic Ngankam scored in the 77th for Hertha to salvage a morale-boosting point in its battle against relegation. Hertha moved a point above Schalke.Also, Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz and Sardar Azmoun scored for Bayer Leverkusen to ease to a 3-0 win at Schalke. Schalke stayed a point above last-place Stuttgart. The Gelsenkirchen-based club later said a fan died after a “medical emergency” toward the end of the game.Wolfsburg captain Maximilian Arnold scored an own-goal and missed a penalty but his team fought from two goals down to draw 2-2 at home with Augsburg. Germany midfielder Felix Nmecha scored the equalizer in injury time, set up by American midfielder Kevin Paredes.On Rouven Schröder’s first day as Leipzig sporting director, the team slumped to a 3-0 loss at home to Mainz to continue its downward turn. Leipzig has now lost both games since its 7-0 defeat at Manchester City in the Champions League.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853382,Ancelotti wants to ‘honor’ Madrid contract amid Brazil links,"MADRID (AP) — Carlo Ancelotti says he's flattered by the reported interest Brazil has in him becoming its next coach but says he remains committed to finishing his current deal with Real Madrid.The 63-year-old Ancelotti is under contract with the Spanish club through the end of next season.“I have a contract and I want to honor it,” the Madrid coach said Saturday, a day before Madrid plays Valladolid in the Spanish league.“I’m not doing it because there’s a written agreement, but because I like this club. Everything that can happen after the end of the contract is a matter of the future and everything’s possible in the future.”Brazil’s soccer confederation issued a statement in February denying that it had reached a deal with Ancelotti. But the rumors in the media have continued, and Brazil goalkeeper Ederson said last week that he believed there was a “big possibility” that Ancelotti could become their next manager.Brazil is currently under interim coach Ramon Menezes as it searches for a permanent successor to Tite, who stepped down after the World Cup. Menezes was in charge last week when Morocco stunned Brazil 2-1 in a friendly.Ancelotti did say, however, that it “pleased” him to be linked to the five-time world champions“I’m pleased that the Brazilian national team wants me, but I have to respect a contract that I want to honor,” he said. “I don’t know the president of the Brazilian national team, but I’d love to meet him and say hello.”Last season was a record-setting campaign for Ancelotti after leading Madrid to the Champions League and Spanish league titles. The Italian became the first coach to win four Champions League titles and the first coach to win Europe’s five top domestic leagues.Madrid is far behind Barcelona in the Spanish league this season, but it has reached the Champions League quarterfinals to remain in contention for a possible 15th European Cup.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853383,Wood stars in Lucknow's big win in IPL; Punjab beats Kolkata,"LUCKNOW, India (AP) — Mark Wood grabbed 5-14 with his express pace and Kyle Myers made a blistering 73 runs off 38 balls in Lucknow Super Giants’ big 50-run win over Delhi Capitals in their opening game of the Indian Premier League on Saturday.In the first double-header this season in the world's most lucrative cricket league, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh and Bhanuka Rajapaksa earlier led Punjab Kings to a seven-run victory over Kolkata Knight Riders on the DLS method in a rain-hit game.The two-month long tournament began on Friday with defending champion Gujarat Titans beating Chennai Super Kings by five wickets.Delhi struggled to reach 143-9 as Wood first jolted the top order with his triple strike and then claimed two more wickets in the last over to end a perfect night for the home team.Lucknow, which was asked to bat first, made an imposing 193-6 on the back of Myers' rapid knock. Nicholas Pooran provided a late flourish with a breezy 21-ball 36.Wood clocked 147 kph (91 mph) on both occasions when he clean bowled opening batter Prithvi Shaw (12) and Mitchell Marsh off his successive deliveries while Sarfaraz Khan fell to a bizarre lap shot against the Englishman’s fiery short-pitched ball and holed out at fine leg.Delhi skipper David Warner made 56 off 48 balls, but his team struggled to get the momentum against Wood and fast bowler Avesh Khan, who bagged 2-29.Myers dominated the first half of Lucknow’s innings by plundering seven sixes and two boundaries before he was undone by left-arm spinner Axar Patel’s turning delivery that came back into the batter and knocked back the stumps in the 12th over.Paceman Khaleel Ahmed was the pick of Delhi's bowlers with 2-30 as he claimed the wickets of Marcus Stoinis (12) and Pooran in his return spell.PUNJAB PINS DOWN KOLKATALeft-armer Arshdeep picked up 3-19 as Kolkata — in pursuit of a 192-run target — had reached 146-7 in 16 overs before heavy rain took the players off the field.Rajapaksa (50) of Sri Lanka had earlier hit a 30-ball half-century with captain Shikar Dhawan (40) and Sam Curran (26 not out) making solid contributions in Punjab’s strong total of 191-5.Arshdeep was effective with his short-pitched deliveries that saw him take two quick wickets before the left-armer returned and took the vital wicket of Impact Player Venkatesh Iyer (34) with another short ball just before rain arrived.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (22), who welcomed Sam Curran with a six and a four, was clean bowled by Nathan Ellis as Kolkata slipped to 3-29 inside the first five overs.Captain Nitesh Rana, leading Kolkata for the first time this season, made a rapid 24 with three fours and a six before he gifted his wicket when he slashed hard at unorthodox spinner Sikander Raza and was caught at point.Top-scorer Andre Russell (35) revived the run-chase with a 30-ball half century stand with Iyer before Curran had the hard-hitting West Indian caught at wide mid-wicket and Arshdeep got the vital wicket of Iyer.Earlier, Rajapaksa and Dhawan provided Punjab a perfect launching pad with a 86-run second wicket stand as the home team reached 100-2 by the halfway stage.Rajapaksa dominated the spin threat of Sunil Narine (1-40) while Tim Southee (2-54) and Shardul Thakur (0-43) were also expensive.Leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy (1-26) and Umesh Yadav (1-27) pulled back Punjab in the latter half with Chakravarthy had Dhawan clean bowled off a a delivery that skidded through the left-hander and Rajapaksa holed out at long-on just after completing his half century with five boundaries and two sixes.Curran then played a little cameo off 17 balls that featured two sixes and Shahrukh Khan (11 not out) hit two fours to propel Punjab’s total.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853385,Countdown to counteroffensive: When will mud season end in Ukraine?,"Sitting in his Virginia home, weather expert and US Air Force veteran David Helms has one question on his mind about far away Ukraine lately: ""When does mud season stop?""The weather there is just one more thing that troops in the trenches at the front lines have to battle. In an effort to ease the burden, retired meteorologist Helms analyzes weather that might affect the war and publishes his forecasts on social media under the hashtag ""#NAFOWeather,"" a likely reference to the North Atlantic Fellas Organization, an online anti-Russian propaganda movement.For the front in Ukraine, Helms has the following prediction: ""The loss of moisture from the soil really picks up by May 1st and beyond,"" he wrote in his analysis for DW.In southern Ukraine, the soil will be dry from around mid-April, then two weeks later in the Donetsk region, and from mid-May in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region further north, he explained.Should the prediction turn out to be correct, it could have significant strategic meaning. While Russian tanks are still stuck in the mud in Eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian army could begin a counteroffensive in the south toward the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol.Helms is one of many digital volunteers worldwide who are supporting Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion.""To me, it's just people interested in and supporting Ukraine, trying to do whatever they can to do exactly that,"" he said.He writes, for example, about when there will be ""optimal optical satellite intelligence opportunities."" When clear skies allow for the best photos from space, other activists then use donations to order satellite imagery from private vendors like Maxar, passing it along to Ukrainian commanders on the front lines.This spring, forecasts from Helms have special significance: Whoever determines the regionally varying end of Ukraine's mud season gets closer to answering the much-discussed question of when the country can launch a counteroffensive to liberate land occupied by Russian forces.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has referred to the planned counteroffensive in his daily video messages. As has his defense minister, who also recently expressed his gratitude for tanks sent by the UK and Germany, in addition to German Marder infantry fighting vehicles.In Ukraine, the mud season, known as ""rasputitsa,"" renders fields and unpaved roads impassable for around a month in the fall and spring, due to rain and melting snow respectively. Tanks, troop carriers and artillery pieces all become mired down in the soggy earth.""Between the amount of moisture and the volume in the top 20 centimeters of the soil, as the moisture increases, the soil strength decreases,"" Helms said, adding that it's a logarithmic relationship. ""It changes very quickly at certain points as moisture accrues. All winter we've been accruing moisture in terms of snow and the surface of the soil has been frozen largely, although, with climate change, at times the surface layer of the soil thawed out this winter.""The phenomenon has to do with the geography in many areas of Eastern Europe: flat land as far as the eye can see, and with a particular quality of soil. Ukraine's black earth is part of what makes the southern part of the country among the most fertile in the world.Former military meteorologist Helms also worked for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US, where he studied the hydrological consequences of climate change — that is, changes in the composition of soils like what is going on just now in Ukraine.""Mud season in the context of military vehicles depends not only on the strength of the soil, but also the kinds of vehicles that are anticipated for any offensive operation,"" Helms told DW. Put simply, the heft of tanks and armored personnel carriers, including how many people they carry, determines whether or not they are likely to get stuck in the Ukrainian mud.This article was originally written in German.",2023/04/01,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853386,Ukrainian court places Orthodox cleric under house arrest,"A court in Kyiv on Saturday put Metropolitan Pavlo, the abbot of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery, under house arrest for 60 days, Ukrainian news media reported.The Ukrainian government has led a crackdown on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church over its historic ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader, Patriarch Kirill, has supported Russian President Vladimir Putin in the invasion of Ukraine.Earlier on Saturday, the Security Service of Ukraine, known as SBU, notified Pavlo that he was suspected of two criminal offenses: inciting inter-religious enmity and justifying Russian aggression.""The law and the responsibility for violating it are the same for everyone and a cassock is no guarantee of pure intentions,"" SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk  said in a statement, accusing Russia of using religion ""to promote propaganda and divide Ukrainian society.""Earlier in the week, Pavlo had resisted the authorities' order to vacate the complex and cursed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, threatening him with damnation.SBU agents raided Pavlo's residence and prosecutors asked the court to put him under house arrest pending the investigation.During the court hearing in the Ukrainian capital, the cleric rejected the claim by the Security Service of Ukraine, that he condoned Russia's invasion. Pavlo described the accusations against him as politically driven.In the meantime, two protests took place near the monastery, one by Pavlo's supporters and one against him.The monks in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has been accused of having links to Russia. The dispute surrounding the property, also known as the Monastery of the Caves, is part of a wider religious conflict that has unfolded in parallel with the war.The Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery is the most famed Orthodox monastery in Ukraine. It is owned by the Ukrainian government, and the agency overseeing it notified the monks that it was terminating the lease and they had until Wednesday to leave.Metropolitan Pavlo told worshippers Wednesday that the monks would not leave pending the outcome of a lawsuit the UOC filed in a Kyiv court to stop the eviction. The government claims that the monks violated their lease by making to the historic site and other technical infractions. The monks rejected the claim as a pretext.The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has insisted that it's loyal to Ukraine and has denounced the Russian invasion fro the start. The church declared its independence from Moscow, but Ukrainian security agencies say some in the UOC have maintained close ties with Moscow.According to surveys, most Ukrainian believers belong to the rival Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which more than four years ago received recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.Bartholomew I is considered the first among equals among the leaders of the Eastern Orthodox churches. Patriarch Kirill and most other Orthodox patriarchs have refused to accept his decision authorizing the second Ukrainian church.dh/jcg (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/04/01,,

Activists used a vegetable-based carbon liquid to dye the water black, before police arrested them.""It is absurd that you are scandalized by gestures like these, while we are living through a drought emergency that has put agriculture, energy production... our own subsistence, in crisis,"" the activists wrote onn Twitter.Rome's mayor Roberto Gualtieri condemned the action saying it does not help the environment.To prevent the stone from absorbing the dye, authorities drained the water from the fountain..Meanwhile, authorities in the German state of Baden-Württemberg said on Saturday 63 people had been fined a total of €7200 ($7800) for disrupting traffic.Activists of the Letzte Generation (Last Generation) have held several demonstrations in Germany, including glueing themselves to roads or roping down bridges.The fine for each activist will depend on the extent of the disruption caused.It follows similar measures in the state of Bavaria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853388,Bayern Munich reclaim top spot as  Borussia Dortmund dig their own grave,"Borussia Dortmund have found many ways to lose in Munich in recent years, but it turned out they still had one up their sleeve. A jaw-dropping error from Gregor Kobel started a slide that BVB could not arrest. Or even slow, until it was too late.A 13th-minute air kick from the normally-reliable keeper allowed Dayot Upamecano's bouncing, overhit pass from the halfway line to bobble in to an empty net and give Bayern the lead.Kobel wasn't the only one in shock. Memories of eight consecutive league defeats at the Allianz Arena seemed to grip the visitors as Thomas Müller turned in Matthijs de Ligt's header five minutes later.
Another five minutes, another Müller goal and another Dortmund defeat was all but confirmed. Kobel again was culpable, pushing Leroy Sané's shot in to Müller's path, rather than around the post.Last time Dortmund arrived in Bavaria on top of the Bundesliga, they lost 5-0 under Lucien Favre, and that almost seemed a minimum at times in the first half. Thomas Tuchel's first game in charge of Bayern wasn't a dethroning, it was an execution.As it was, Edin Terzic's team made it to the break without making it worse. But not much longer. in the 50th minute, Bayern cut them open again with the most aesthetically pleasing of their goals. Kingsley Coman stroked home joyfully after Sane played the killer pass.Emre Can's penalty in the 72nd minute was all but meaningless while Donyell Malen also scuffed one home in the last minute. That it made the aggregate score in this fixture 37-8 over the last nine games is perhaps more indicative of the gap between the sides than Bayern's two point lead in the standings.",2023/04/01,,

The man denied it, and Rendon cussed at the fan and took a swipe at him with his left hand before walking away. Someone nearby caught the incident on video and posted it on social media.“This happens a lot unfortunately,” Angels manager Phil Nevin said. “A lot of times we just don’t see it. You’re going to hear things all the time. You hear a lot. Right now, I just don’t want to comment on the incident involving Anthony or anything that goes along with it.”When asked why he couldn’t comment, Nevin pointed to MLB's ongoing investigation. Nevin also did not think the situation would be a lingering distraction to his players.“For the moment maybe. But no I don’t think so,” Nevin said. “One thing I’ve said all along is we’ve got a great group in there. The one thing that I was most proud of last year and then continuing through the spring is the way this team has bonded and gelled together. And they’re all going to stand together now.""As Rendon jogged onto the field for pregame warm-ups, he was asked what the climate was between him and the fans.“Sorry,” Rendon said as he shrugged his shoulders and ran away to work out.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853391,Catcher Gary Sánchez gets minor league deal from Giants,"NEW YORK (AP) — Catcher Gary Sánchez agreed to a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants and will report to Triple-A Sacramento.San Francisco's major league catchers are Roberto Pérez and 2018 first-round pick Joey Bart.“We’ve been talking to and thinking about Gary for quite some time and done a lot of work on him dating back to the middle of the offseason, maybe even earlier,” San Francisco manager Gabe Kapler said Saturday. “He was available and healthy, and we thought it was a good opportunity for us to add some depth on a guy that we feel like has a chance to make a contribution at the major league level at some point.”Sánchez was a two-time All-Star with the New York Yankees. The 30-year-old hit .299 with 20 homers in 2016 and hit .278 with 33 homers and 90 RBIs in 2017.He struggled after 2017, especially in his final two seasons in New York. Sanchez hit .147 in 49 games in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and .204 with 23 homers and 54 RBIs in 2021. The Yankees traded him to Minnesota with Gio Urshela for Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Ben Rortvedt on March 13, 2022.Sánchez batted .205 with 16 homers and 61 RBIs in 128 games for Minnesota last year while making 80 starts at catcher. He led the AL with 16 passed balls in 2017 and 18 in 2018 but had just four last year, when he threw out 28% of basestealers (14 of 36).“In the offseason I watched a lot of video on Gary,” Kapler said. “I also talked to a lot of people, people with the Twins that have experience with him. Solid quality reports. A better framer last year than he had been in the past and I think we all know he’s got a really good arm and that might be valuable this season if you see stolen base attempts and success rates rise.”San Francisco also optioned outfielder Blake Wisely to Sacramento, selected the contract of outfielder Bryce Johnson and transferred right-hander Luke Jackson to the 60-day injured list while he recovers from Tommy John surgery.Johnson hit .310 with 13 runs in 16 spring training games and was 12 for 12 in steal attempts.Jackson signed an $11.5 million, two-year deal with the Giants in January after missing all of last season due to the surgery. In 2021 with Atlanta, Jackson was 2-2 with a 1.98 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 71 appearances.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853392,Israelis still protest legal overhaul despite suspension,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israelis protested on Saturday against a controversial plan to revamp the country’s legal system, despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s suspension of the changes earlier in the week.The protesters gathered in Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial hub on the Mediterranean, for the 13th weekly demonstration, raising Israeli flags and banners against what they said were plans to weaken the Supreme Court. Several smaller rallies took place in other towns and cities.The protests have been going on since Netanyahu’s government, the most right-wing in the country’s history, introduced the changes.But on Monday, Netanyahu delayed the overhaul plan that deeply divided the Israelis, saying he wanted “to avoid civil war” by making time to seek a compromise with political opponents. Protest organizers, however, vowed to keep up the pressure, calling for the plans to be scrapped.The proposal has plunged Israel into its worst domestic crisis in decades. Business leaders, top economists and former security chiefs have all come out against the plan, saying it is pushing the country toward an autocracy. Fighter pilots and military reservists have threatened not to report for duty, and the country’s currency, the shekel, has tumbled in value.The plan would give Netanyahu, who is on trial on corruption charges, and his allies the final say in appointing the nation’s judges. It would also give parliament, which is controlled by his allies, authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit the court’s ability to review laws.Netanyahu has argued that the overhaul is needed to rein in a liberal and overly interventionist court of unelected judges. But his opponents say the package would damage the country’s system of checks and balances by concentrating power in the hands of Netanyahu’s allies. They also say that he has a conflict of interest as a criminal defendant.",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853393,Staley defends players again; Iowa coach says no ill intent,"DALLAS (AP) — South Carolina coach Dawn Staley has taken issue with how her team's style is characterized, apparently taking aim at Iowa coach Lisa Bluder for suggesting rebounding against the Gamecocks was like “going to a bar fight.”A day after the Hawkeyes ended the undefeated defending national champion's bid for a repeat, Bluder said Saturday there was no ill intent in comments made three days before her team's 77-73 victory in the semifinals at the Final Four.“There was absolutely no ill intent,” Bluder said in the news conference setting up the Hawkeyes' meeting Sunday with LSU in the national championship game.“I know coaches will take things and spin it to try to motivate their team,” the Iowa coach said. “I’ve done that, I’m sure. So be it with that. I really meant it as a compliment, like you are going to have to fight harder than you’ve ever fought in your life to get a defensive rebound against this team because they are so good. That’s what my intent was.”Bluder was responding to a question about South Carolina's size and offensive rebounding in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, after the Final Four matchups were set.“I mean, they’re an amazing offensive rebounding team,” Bluder said. “Somebody kind of just described it to me as you’re going to a bar fight when you try to go rebound against them, they’re just so good.”After the loss to the Hawkeyes, Staley made a direct reference to “bar fighters” but said her concerns were prompted by what she said were derogatory remarks from unspecified national reporters about her team at an event the night before the semifinals.The two-time NCAA championship coach said she intended to address her concerns regardless of the outcome at the Final Four. Staley had been asked what was the truth about her team when others had suggested her players were bullies.“The truth about our team?” Staley said Friday. “That’s a good question. We’re not bar fighters. We’re not thugs. We’re not monkeys. We’re not street fighters.”Staley said comments relayed to her after the event Thursday night were hurtful to her players.“If you really knew them, if you really knew them, like you really want to know other players that represent this game, you would think differently,” Staley said Friday. “So don’t judge us by the color of our skin. Judge us by how we approach the game.”The Gamecocks were ranked No. 1 all season with a dominant frontcourt led by 6-foot-5 star Aliyah Boston. Their No. 2 rebounder and third-leading scorer was 6-7 center Kamilla Cardoso.“You may not like how we play the game, you may not like it, that’s the way we play,” Staley said. “That’s the way I coach. I’m not changing. We found success in it, and maybe some days like today, we end up on the losing side of the stick. But guess what? We live to see another day.”It's not the first time this season comments from an opposing coach bothered Staley.After the Gamecocks beat Connecticut in February, Huskies coach Geno Auriemma was referring to bruises on Lou Lopez Senechal when he said, “It’s just appalling what teams do to her now.”“It’s not basketball anymore. I don’t know what it is, but it’s not basketball,” Auriemma added.Staley responded on her radio show two days later, saying “We’ve been called so many things and I’m sick of it. I’m sick of it because I coach some of the best human beings the game has ever had.”Auriemma said he was criticizing the officials, not South Carolina's style of play.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853394,"Iowa, LSU both seeking first NCAA titles in women's final","DALLAS (AP) — Caitlin Clark has captured the attention of basketball fans with her historic performance in the NCAA Tournament.Iowa's sensational guard will try to finish off the unprecedented run she's led the Hawkeyes on with a championship when they face LSU on Sunday in the title game.“I think winning a national championship is how you put a final bow on it,” Clark said. “I think that’s the best way, but we’re going to give it everything we have for 40 more minutes. We know that’s all we have left of our season.”The dazzling guard, who grew up in Iowa, became the first women’s player to post back-to-back 40-point performances in the NCAA Tournament after her 41-point game lifted the Hawkeyes over previously unbeaten South Carolina in the Final Four.Now she'll try to etch her name next to some of the greatest ever to win a title — like Cheryl Miller, Sheryl Swoopes, Chamique Holdsclaw, Diana Taurasi, Candace Parker, Maya Moore, Breanna Stewart and A’ja Wilson,Another SEC team stands in the way: LSU and coach Kim Mulkey, who was impressed watching Clark on Friday night.“That’s my first time to see her play in person, and I didn’t get to watch the game because I had to deal with (the media),” Mulkey said. “When I did get out there, I couldn’t take my eyes off of her. Gosh, she’s special. She’s special.”While her team doesn't have any title experience, Mulkey has been in this position three times before when she was coaching Baylor. Each time she came away with the title.To keep that perfect record intact, LSU will have to find a way to slow down Clark.“Iowa is a great team and I’m going to give credit where it’s due. They have the best player, the player of the year, Caitlin Clark,” LSU guard Alexis Morris said. “She’s amazing. I respect her game.""It took Mulkey five years to get Baylor to the championship game. She did it in two with the flagship school in her home state after beating Virginia Tech in the semifinals.The Tigers made the Final Four in five straight seasons from 2004-08 led by women's basketball greats Seimone Augustus and Sylvia Fowles. LSU could never get to the title game until now. The men's team also had never made it before either.“It is so exciting -- I don’t even know how old LSU is,” Mulkey said. “I don’t even know when they started playing men’s or women’s basketball, but it has to be a long time ago. And to think all those great players that have played in the NBA and the WNBA, and they never played for a national championship. That’s mind-boggling to me.”BIG TEN HISTORYIowa is looking to become only the second Big Ten team to ever win the national championship, joining Purdue, which did it in 1999 under Carolyn Peck. The last women's team from the conference to play in the title game was Michigan State —and lost to Mulkey and Baylor in 2005.BIG TEN CONNECTIONAngel Reese and Kateri Poole are no strangers to Clark, having played against her when they were in the Big Ten. Reese transferred from Maryland, Poole from Ohio State.“Luckily, me and Kateri have played them before in the Big Ten, so I know what Caitlin brings to the table for sure,” Reese said. “Just making sure that third and fourth player, making sure they don’t go off and get their 20 points, that’s going to be the difference.”PONYTAIL PETEClark has been compared to LSU great Pete Maravich ever since she was in high school. It's a not far-fetched comparison, according to Iowa's guard.“I am familiar with his game. I’ve seen a lot of his highlights,” Clark said. “Obviously a tremendous compliment. I saw somebody called me like Ponytail Pete or something like that. I thought that was kind of funny. I think just a tremendous compliment. Like you said, I take a lot of pride in being able to do a lot of different things for my team, whether it’s scoring, but also I think the passing can get overlooked at times.”___More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World

(AP) — Tommy Novak scored a goal and added three assists to lead the Nashville Predators over the St. Louis Blues 6-1 on Saturday.Luke Evangelista had a goal and two assists; Cody Glass and Colton Sissons also scored; and Juuse Saros made 21 saves for the Predators, winners of two of three.Nashville kept its slim playoff hopes alive, now three points behind the Winnipeg Jets for the Western Conference’s second wild-card berth. The Predators have played one fewer game than Winnipeg.“Tonight was a big game for us. Winnipeg won last night, so this was a big one for us to be able to cut it back to three,” Predators coach John Hynes said.Calle Rosen scored and Thomas Greiss made 29 saves for the Blues. St. Louis had won four of five, but the loss places the Blues on the brink of mathematical elimination from the playoffs.Nashville came out fast, scoring twice on its first five shots in the opening period.“That wasn’t a great game, right from the get-go,” St. Louis coach Craig Berube said. “Second period we had some opportunities on the power play, did some good things, but other than that, it was not very good.”Novak struck first at 4:46 with a nifty backhand from the low slot that rattled off of the crossbar and into the net. Glass, celebrating his 24th birthday, followed at 7:20 when he redirected a Novak shot past Greiss with the Predators on a power play.“Getting that early lead was really big for us because we have been struggling to score goals (the) last little stretch here,” Novak said. ""So just to feel that puck going in, and getting one on the power play was also huge.”Sissons scored an unassisted shorthanded goal at 7:36 of the second, breaking down the right side before snapping off a wrist shot that beat Greiss on the far side. Evangelista’s goal at 13:27 sent the Predators into the second intermission up 4-0.Rosen spoiled Saros’ shutout bid at 8:36 of the third with a long-range wrist shot through traffic. Trenin scored an unassisted goal at 11:49 and Tomasino, playing his 100th career game, notched a power-play goal at 18:06.PK WOESThe Blues’ struggling penalty kill went 2-4 Saturday. In their previous three games, St. Louis successfully killed off just three of their opponents’ last 11 opportunities on the power play.“PKs gotta get back here for the next six or seven games or whatever we have left,” Blues forward Brayden Schenn said. “Just kill off some penalties. We’re giving up way too many goals right now.”St. Louis began Saturday ranked 28th in penalty kills at 73.8%. Coincidentally, the Predators had the league’s 28th-ranked power play at 17.2%.STASTNEY DEBUTPredators defenseman Spencer Stastney made his NHL debut. He was selected in the fifth round in 2018 draft and turned pro after playing four seasons at the University of Notre Dame.PREGAME TRIBUTEPrior to the game’s opening faceoff, the Predators held a moment of silence for the six victims of Monday’s shooting at Nashville’s Covenant School and for the nine service members who died when two Black Hawks crashed Wednesday at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.The Predators also had Covenant School patches sewn onto the left shoulders of their jerseys.WHAT’S NEXTPredators: Visit the Dallas Stars on Monday.Blues: Host the Boston Bruins on Sunday.___More AP: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

(AP) — South Carolina All-American Aliyah Boston is headed to the WNBA.The Gamecocks' 6-foot-5 forward made it official Saturday, a day after her team's bid for a second straight NCAA Tournament title and undefeated season was ended in a 77-73 loss to Iowa in the national semifinals.Boston long has been considered the No. 1 overall pick if she chose to go pro. She released a post on social media where she thanked her family, coaches, teammates and South Carolina fans.“I have decided to further pursue my dream by declaring for the 2023 WNBA draft,” she said.Boston, a senior who started for the past four seasons, could have taken an additional year due to COVID-19.Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley has long recommended Boston go pro, in large part because of the freedom she'd have around the basket due to the WNBA's rules that limit packing the paint.“She’s great. She’s ready. She’s ready to see single coverage,” Staley said after the Final Four loss. ""She’s ready to make the next step to the league.”Boston was a three-time first-team All-American pick by The Associated Press. She was a two-time Southeastern Conference player of the year and helped the Gamecocks go 131-9 in her four seasons — with just one of those losses at home.She started all 138 games she played at South Carolina, averaging 14.1 points and 10.8 rebounds. She had a program record 82 games with double figure points and rebounds.Boston was limited to eight points in the loss to Iowa after missing much of the first half with two early fouls.___More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853407,Biden and his 2024 campaign: Waiting for some big decisions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has all but announced he's running for reelection, but key questions about the 2024 campaign are unresolved: Who will manage it? Where will it be based? When will he finally make it official?Advisers have long said he planned to wait until after March, when the year's first fundraising period wraps up. That was an effort to help manage expectations because many donors who gave generously to Democratic causes during last fall's elections were looking for a break.But an announcement isn't imminent even now, aides insist, and probably won't come until at least after Biden returns from an expected trip to Ireland in mid-April.Working on his own timeline could counter Biden’s low approval ratings and questions about his age — the 80-year-old would turn 86 before the end of a second term. It also means Biden won’t be hurried by pressure from former President Donald Trump, who's already announced his 2024 campaign, or other top Republicans who may enter the race, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or former Vice President Mike Pence.“He’s earned the luxury of making the timetable,” said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist in Washington. “The longer he can keep this thing focused on his duties in the White House, and less about the campaign back-and-forth, the better off he’s going to be.”That said, Biden aides are mindful that Trump has been indicted for his role in the payment of hush money to a porn actor, and they say Biden will look to time his announcement to a point when he won't share the political spotlight with the man he beat in the 2020 election.Biden's inner political circle is ready to begin executing on the campaign's strategy from Day One and sees no drawbacks to the president taking his time. Biden faces no significant Democratic challenger for the nomination. The self-help guru Marianne Williamson is the sole contender at this point in the primary race.It will also be up to Biden to decide where next year's Democratic National Convention is held among the three finalist cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York. But with the logistical groundwork mostly laid, there is little pressure for that decision until the president is ready to make it, organizers say.Much of the reelection effort will be run from the White House, where Biden's most senior advisers are expected to remain. Still, the campaign manager and top staff will be responsible for raising vast sums of money, reaching millions of voters and making the case for Biden at Americans’ doors and online while he is still occupied with governing.One top Biden adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a reelection campaign that hasn't yet been announced, noted that Biden's 2020 bid was a $1.7 billion operation and that the effort this time would be larger. The adviser said a key will be finding “validators,” or non-Washington voices who can spread the campaign's message at a time when many people have lost faith in everything political.Aides and allies are discussing how to build the appropriate 2024 race infrastructure. The circumstances are different from 2020 for Biden, whose race then was conducted while the country was largely shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic.The political environment is different, too, as technological and cultural shifts have continued to change how people communicate. Biden's advisers are preparing a new model of campaigning fit for the moment to activate his base and identify and woo the persuadable center — essentially a customized communication strategy for each target voter.Aba Blankson, chief marketing and communications officer for the NAACP, said her organization is nonpartisan but found success mobilizing Black voters — an important part of Biden's base — before last November's elections using similarly targeted political messaging. That included text messages, radio ads and knocking on doors to promote “peer-to-peer” organizing in areas capable of swinging pivotal races.“I think his timing is what his timing is,"" Bankson said. ""But, for us, it is an every-year reality.”The choice of Biden's campaign headquarters has been narrowed to Philadelphia, the 2020 location, and Wilmington, Delaware, where his home is and where the president spends many weekends away from the White House. While Biden tends to prefer Delaware on all matters, some top Democrats worry that recruiting top campaign talent to Wilmington will be difficult.The Biden adviser downplayed the importance of choosing between the two immediately. And Biden waited until weeks after the start of his 2020 campaign to announce that he had settled on Philadelphia, making a commitment to an important battleground state.More challenging has been filling the job of campaign manager. Some potential candidates view it as a thankless task, with so much of the decision-making confined to the White House, though the adviser said whomever is ultimately chosen will be empowered with wide latitude to run 2024.Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s 2020 campaign manager, is now a deputy White House chief of staff and plans to remain in her job. Many potential candidates have expressed interest in the campaign manager position, but among those on the short list are Julie Chavez Rodriguez, director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and a deputy campaign manager of Biden’s 2020 campaign, and Sam Cornale, executive director of the Democratic National Committee.Quentin Fulks, campaign manager for Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock’s reelection victory last fall, has been mentioned.Biden led Democrats to a stronger than expected midterm performance in 2022 by urging voters to reject “extreme” adherents to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement. So bringing in an outsider who ran successful Democratic campaigns last fall is a possibility. But party leaders acknowledge that breaking into Biden’s famously tight inner circle has at times been challenging.An exception is O’Malley Dillon, who was a late 2020 entrant to Biden’s orbit after leading former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s failed presidential bid.Trump hasn’t named a campaign manager despite announcing his candidacy months ago. But others aren't waiting to staff up.Republican Nikki Haley, Trump's U.N. ambassador and a former South Carolina governor, picked Betsy Ankney, executive director of Haley's Stand for America political action committee, to manager her presidential campaign . The super PAC linked to DeSantis brought on former Trump aide Matt Wolking and strategist Jeff Roe, the architect of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign and Republican Glenn Youngkin winning campaign for Virginia governor in 2021.Even with the unanswered questions about his campaign structure, the outlines of Biden’s pitch to voters are forming.From the State of the Union address in February to speeches to donors, the president has begun making the case that Americans should let him “finish the job” he started. He's also tried framing the race as a choice between himself and “MAGA Republicans” who, he argues, will undermine the nation's core values.Biden has spent recent months traveling to promote what he sees as his administration's key policy accomplishments, including a bipartisan public works package, and plans more of the same going forward. That would let him use this year to test political messaging that can best resonate in 2024, aides said.“He's not going to win reelection or lose reelection based on what happens in his campaign,"" Bannon predicted. ""He's going to win it based on his performance as president and the performance of his opponent, whoever it is.”",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853408,Man City vs. Liverpool turns toxic again after 4-1 rout,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester City's 4-1 rout of Liverpool on Saturday was marred by more off-field trouble as one of English soccer's fiercest rivalries turned toxic again.Despite securing a statement win in the race for the Premier League title, the defending champions were left to condemn an apparent attack on their rivals' team bus and address “hateful” chants from its supporters.Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, was forced to defend his touchline antics, after accusations he showed a lack of respect by celebrating directly in front of Liverpool substitutes Kostas Tsimikas and Arthur Melo.“I was happy and I said how nice our goal was. That’s all,” the City manager said when asked about his actions. ""Do you think it’s a lack of respect? Ah OK, sorry. I’m so sorry.”As if those incidents weren't enough to sour the mood around the club's Etihad Stadium, Arsenal's 4-1 win against Leeds later in the day restored the league leaders' eight-point advantage at the top, having played one more game than City.City and Liverpool have been the dominant forces of English soccer in recent years and the battle for supremacy has turned ugly during that time.Fans of both clubs have been criticized for their actions, including an attack on City's team bus in 2018, while Guardiola had to avoid being hit by coins during a game at Anfield earlier this season.Liverpool complained of “vile chants” during that game and said its stadium had been vandalized with graffiti.On this occasion, it was Liverpool's bus that was targeted.“We understand an object was thrown towards the coach in a residential area,” City said in a statement. “Incidents of this kind are totally unacceptable, and we strongly condemn the actions of the individual(s) responsible.”The club said it was “disappointed” by the chants from some of its fans.“We regret any offense these chants may have caused and will continue to work with supporter groups and officials from both clubs to eradicate hateful chanting from this fixture,” City added.On the field, City produced one of its best performances of the season, which Guardiola described as “almost perfect” as his players made light of Erling Haaland's absence due to a groin injury.But Arsenal remains out in front with a rout of its own against Leeds.GREALISH STANDS OUTAt a cost of $139 million, Jack Grealish should be able to do everything. And in the space of a minute at Etihad Stadium against Liverpool, he showed his range of talents with two game-changing moments.With Liverpool leading 1-0 after Mohamed Salah's opener, Grealish chased down the striker and cut out the danger as he looked set to extend the visitors' lead.Almost immediately, Grealish then turned provider, setting up Julian Alavarez to even the score.Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan struck in the second half before Grealish rounded off the scoring with City's fourth.“When it’s going well, there’s nothing better,” Grealish said. “I feel back to my normal self, feel fit and back to confidence. Scoring and getting the assist, I’m buzzing.”LIVERPOOL SLUMPS AGAINLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp cut a dejected figure afterward — and for good reason.Liverpool is running out of games to salvage its season and a place in the Champions League.Brighton's 3-3 draw with Brentford saw both of those teams leapfrog the Merseyside club in the battle for European places.Liverpool is seven points behind fourth-place Tottenham with only one game in hand and five off fifth-place Newcastle having played a game more.Klopp said his team was fortunate not to be on the end of an even heavier loss after City dominated the second half.Assessing the game, Klopp said City ""could pretty much do what they wanted because the spaces were too big, and so we are rather lucky that they only scored one more.”ARSENAL POWERS ONArsenal issued the perfect response to City's win with a 4-1 victory of its own against Leeds.And it was former City striker Gabriel Jesus who set Mikel Arteta's team on course for this latest victory with two goals at Emirates Stadium.The Brazilian had not scored since October, although that dry spell did include a lengthy period out with injury.Ben White and Granit Xhaka also scored for Arsenal, with Rasmus Kristensen on the mark for relegation-fighting Leeds.Arsenal has won all seven of its league games since losing to City in February.POTTER UNDER PRESSUREIf Chelsea fans thought Graham Potter had turned a corner, it might be time to think again.A 2-0 loss at home to Aston Villa saw the Champions League quarterfinalists drop into the bottom half of the league in 11th place. It is also a result that is likely to place further scrutiny on Potter's position after this latest blow to his early reign at Stamford Bridge.There were boos from the home fans after the final whistle.“After a defeat there is always a disappointment. There is always a feeling we have not moved forward, that’s fair to say,” Potter said.He added: “I don’t like to blame anybody, I have to take responsibility.”RELEGATION FIGHTRoy Hodgson got off to a winning start after coming out of retirement in a bid to turn Crystal Palace's season around.And the manager left it late to secure a 2-1 win against Leicester and Palace’s first victory of 2023, with Jean-Philippe Mateta's decisive goal coming in the fourth minute of stoppage time.Bournemouth climbed out of the relegation zone with a comeback 2-1 win against Fulham. Second-half goals from Marcus Tavernier and Dominic Solanke turned the game around after Andreas Pereira put Fulham ahead in the 16th.And the points were shared between Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton in a 1-1 draw at the City Ground.Brennan Johnson's goal looked set to earn Forest a first win in seven until Daniel Podence equalized in the 83rd.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853409,Morris reunion with Mulkey has NCAA title game finale at LSU,"DALLAS (AP) — Alexis Morris will finish her college career playing in a national championship game for Kim Mulkey, the coach who five years ago kicked the standout guard off another team.For Morris, it has been quite a journey of growth and maturation from her freshman season at Baylor and through two other programs before a reunion with Mulkey at LSU that will end on the biggest stage.“Every player just has that coach that’s for them. Coach Mulkey, she’s my coach,” Morris said Saturday, a day before the Tigers play Iowa. “I asked God, if you ever gave the opportunity (to play for her again), I will never waste that. I will literally maximize it, maximize the opportunity, and that’s what you’re witnessing.”Morris had 27 points in the national semifinal game Friday night, when the Tigers beat top-seeded Virginia Tech 79-72 to advance to the school’s first national championship game in basketball — for women or men.Mulkey has known Morris since she was a seventh-grader at a private school in Beaumont, Texas. It was a difficult decision to dismiss her from Baylor's team in September 2018 after what was called an unspecified violation of team rules. The school didn't offer any details then and they haven never been detailed publicly by Mulkey or Morris, though the player does accept responsibility for what she called a “youthful mistake.”That came just weeks before the Bears opened their season that ended with Mulkey's third national championship.“Just a coach decision, one of those tough ones you have to make. But it wasn't like you didn't love her,” Mulkey said at this Final Four. “It was the right decision. Not just for my team at Baylor at the time, it was the right decision for that young lady.”After Morris transferred to Rutgers, NJ Advance Media obtained police records that showed she was arrested by Texas State University police for allegedly assaulting another woman inside a dormitory on the San Marcus campus. That was two days before Morris was dismissed by Baylor.Morris spent nearly two years at Rutgers, but played only seven games because of transfer rules and injuries before taking advantage of the NCAA waiver of transfer rules during the pandemic. She went to Texas A&M for a season before reaching out two years ago to Mulkey, who had left Baylor after 21 seasons to return home to Louisiana.“Just come on, I’m waiting for you,"" was the response Morris got from the coach.“She has owned her mistakes and is a better person because of it,"" Mulkey said. “Now she’s being rewarded.”Mulkey said Morris told her she needed discipline, tough love and direction.“I remember playing with coach Mulkey my freshman year and how she pushed me in the things that she had, the standards, the expectations that she had in place, like the organization, the structure, like being on time,” Morris said. “I was just so youthful and didn’t understand at the time. As you grow and you you go through life, you you find the things that you need, and not necessarily want.”Between Rutgers and Texas A&M, Morris spent a few months with a friend in Reno, Nevada, where she would go to a park every morning to stay in shape physically and mentally.“At one point, I didn’t know if I wanted to play basketball no more, but something in me, that was just the mental, the mental breaking down,"" she said. ""But physically, I was so used to being in a routine, like I couldn’t just wake up and not pick up a ball. This is what I’ve been doing my whole life.”It was on one of those days in Nevada that she said she sat in a car and had a conversation with God about what she would do if given the chance to reunite with Mulkey.“She’s been through everything. You admire what she does. She’s the comeback kid,” Tigers teammate Angel Reese said. “She came back from everything and she’s done everything they said she couldn’t do.”___AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853410,Chandler Smith earns first NASCAR Xfinity Series win,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Chandler Smith outran John Hunter Nemechek out of a restart with six laps to go Saturday at Richmond Raceway to win for the first time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series.Nemechek chose the inside lane on a restart with 12 laps left, relegating Smith to the outside. When another caution came for a crash at the back of the field, Smith had taken the lead and chose the outside for the sprint to the finish.Smith won in just his 10th career start in the series. Nemechek was second, followed by Josh Berry, Kaz Grala and Cole Custer.“It feels great,” Smith said. “Here we are at Richmond, my favorite race track, and we're sitting in victory lane. This is unbelievable.”Nemechek raced side-by-side with Smith for the first few laps after the final green flag, but figured he was the underdog by the finish.“We were a long-run speed car,” he said. ""(Smith) had the best car on the short run. It was going to be hard to hold him off.""Justin Allgaier, one of four drivers contending for the Dash 4 Cash $100,000 bonus, gambled by stopping under green for his last set of tires with about 40 laps to and was cruising through the field.But when another caution came with 28 to go, the rest of the leaders pitted, leaving him on older tires and basically defenseless. The other bonus contenders — Sammy Smith, Daniel Hemric and Sam Mayer — had more difficult days and Allgaier won despite finishing 13th.“It's weird to be finishing 13th and still standing here holding this check,"" Allgaier said. “It was like none of us wanted to win it.”Mayer finished 17th, Sammy Smith 19th and Hemric 24th.The race, delayed nearly an hour at the start after periodic morning rain, was run without practice or qualifying, started nearly an hour late under cloudy skies and finished in sunshine.ROUGH FINISHThe finish was harsh for Riley Herbst and Brandon Jones, who were both running in the top five and had been up front all day until they crashed with 20 laps to go. Jones wound up 21st, Herbst 23rd.MIXED RESULTSWhen the competition caution flag flew after 35 laps, Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Nemechek and Sammy Smith opted to stay on the track while everyone else got fresh tires. It backfired for Smith.Smith led one lap under caution, but was running seventh by the time the first green-flag lap was complete. Nemechek dropped back faster and was 32nd when the stage ended with Smith 33rd, a lap down.While Nemechek was seventh at the end of the 75-lap second stage and nearly won, Smith never found his way near the front and finished 19th.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853411,Mariners place LHP Robbie Ray on 15-day injured list,"SEATTLE (AP) — Robbie Ray was placed on the 15-day injured list Saturday by the Seattle Mariners because of a left flexor strain.After going through the entire 2022 season with none of Seattle’s starting pitchers missing a turn due to injury, it took two games for the Mariners’ rotation to be impacted.Ray had a rocky first start on Friday night in a 9-4 loss to Cleveland. Ray failed to make it through the fourth inning, issued five walks and struggled badly with his control.“In the second inning it felt a little tight, but it didn’t seem out of the ordinary,” Ray said. “It was a cold night, I just thought maybe it took me a while to get loose in that second inning. I didn’t really think that much about it, but after that my arm started to tighten up a good amount.”Seattle manager Scott Servais said Ray had an MRI on Saturday that showed a grade one strain. Ray won’t throw for two weeks and will be reevaluated. Servais said there didn’t appear to be any larger issues.“He’s going to be shut down for a couple weeks, then he’ll build up and hopefully be good to go after that,” Servais said.Ray, 31, has been incredibly durable for most of his career. Aside from the pandemic shortened 2020 season, Ray has made at least 28 starts five times since 2016, including the 2021 season with Toronto when he won the AL Cy Young Award.In his first season with Seattle last year, Ray made 32 starts and had a 3.71 ERA.Seattle recalled left-hander Gabe Speier from Triple-A Tacoma, but Servais said righty Chris Flexen will step into the starting rotation. Flexen threw four innings of relief on Friday night and last season made 22 starts for the Mariners before shifting to the bullpen.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853413,Kvitova upends Rybakina for women's Miami Open title,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Twelfth-seeded Petra Kvitova won the Miami Open in her 13th appearance, beating seventh-seeded Elena Rybakina with a marathon tiebreaker in a 7-6 (14), 6-2 victory Saturday.The 33-year-old Kvitova, 10 years older than her opponent, snapped Rybakina’s 13-match winning streak and halted her bid to win the Sunshine Double (Indian Wells and Miami Open).In winning with will, stalwart defense and one sensational forehand winner on the dead run that electrified the crowd in the second set, the lefty Kvitova captured her 30th WTA singles title and first one since 2018 in Madrid.After Rybakina hit a forehand long on match point, Kvitova raised her arms and put her hands to her head. She was broken just once in the match. It was her 41st career WTA Finals appearance but first final in Miami. She also will vault into the Top 10.“I take it as a positive I can still play with the best,’’ said Kvitova who earned a $1.26 million first prize. “I take pride, even at my age, I could win big tournaments.’’Kvitova, who is from the Czech Republic, disagreed with the announcement Wimbledon would accept Russian players this year. Rybakina, the reigning Wimbledon champion, is from Moscow but represents Kazakhstan.A past Wimbledon champion, the 6-foot Kvitova won the first-set epic tiebreaker 16-14 on her fifth set point. A suddenly shaky Rybakina hit a forehand long to end the 22-minute tiebreaker; she had been undefeated at 7-0 in tiebreakers in 2023.“The tiebreaker was going to decide the whole match,’’ Kvitova said. “The tiebreaker — oh, by God — was the longest in my career. I won the tiebreaker so emotionally I was on the better side. You could see the balls after the tiebreak. They were big fluffy balls.″Rybakina, who won at Indian Wells, admitted to fatigue after the tiebreaker from the travel. The women’s tour will shortly head to Europe for the claycourt season.“The second set I think overall it was not easy after the first set,’’ Rybakina said. “I think the second she was also more free to hit, to maybe risk a bit more. I think that in the second I just didn’t stay disciplined and was a bit rushing.’’The set lasted 66 minutes during which each player held serve until 4-4 then exchanged service breaks. Rybakina finished with 10 aces for the first set while setting the record for most aces in a WTA Tournament, smashing Madison Keys’ mark. Rybakina, who had 12 aces total for the match, finished the tournament with 69 for the tournament.Kvitova broke Rybakina in second game of the second set with a backhand winner on the service return to go up 2-0 and the streak was soon over for Rybakina.“Maybe if the first set had gone my way it would’ve been different,’’ Rybakina said. “Because I was physically tired and that’s why I didn’t have discipline.The men’s singles final is Sunday and pits Jannik Sinner, coming off his semifinal upset of defending Miami Open champion Carlos Alcaraz, against Daniil Medvedev.Medvedev has won 23 of 24 matches and beat Sinner in the Finals last month in Rotterdam. Sinner, the 10th seed from Italy, is 0-5 against Medvedev and coming off a physical, three-set, three-hour war with Alcaraz that ended late Friday night.In the men’s doubles final, Santiago Gonzalez and Edouard Roger-Vasselin beat Austin Krajicek and Nicolas Mahut 7-6 (4), 7-5.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853414,"On cusp of title, Iowa's Bluder cherishes state's 6-on-6 era","DALLAS (AP) — Iowa coach Lisa Bluder basked in knocking off undefeated defending national champion South Carolina for more than 12 hours before learning something else about the epic Final Four victory.Among those watching the 77-73 win that put the Hawkeyes in the national championship game against LSU on Sunday was Iowa basketball legend Molly Bolin.“Machine Gun Molly was here? Didn't even know that,” said Bluder, lighting up at the memory of one of the stars of high-scoring, six-on-six basketball from the 1970s in Iowa.The first Final Four for the Hawkeyes in 30 years is leading to some reminiscing, like the 61-year-old Bluder recalling watching Bolin, now 65, with the Iowa Cornets, a pioneering women's pro team.Or Bluder remembering assistant coach Jan Jensen once scoring 105 points in a six-on-six game, and averaging 66 points per game in high school.Of course, that prompted questions for high-scoring sensation Caitlin Clark, the first female to score at least 40 points in consecutive NCAA Tournament games after going for 41 against the Gamecocks on Friday to match her total from the Elite Eight win over Louisville.“We talk trash, come on now,” Clark said. “Yeah, Coach J, I ... tell her to go shoot at practice and stuff. She did the other day, and she shot this crazy weird hook shot thing that I’ve never seen in my life.”With all due respect, of course.“Yeah, Coach J, like one of the best players to ever play in our state as well,” Clark said. “She’s a legend. She’s way more popular than I even am. You should see this woman’s phone, it’s incredible.”But with limits to that respect, of course, from a two-time national scoring leader who is likely to break the NCAA Tournament record of 24 3-pointers she shares with Virginia Tech's Georgia Amoore after both finished the semifinals with that total. The Hokies lost to LSU 79-72.“She likes to think she can score better than me,” Clark said of Jensen, “but she can’t.”MULKEY'S MULTITASKING SONThe Tigers trailed Virginia Tech by nine points entering the fourth quarter before rallying to reach the championship game for the first time in program history.Tigers coach Kim Mulkey's son, Kramer Robertson, was playing his season opener at the same time with the Memphis Redbirds, Triple-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals.“He's like 0-for-3. I think he had two strikeouts. Well, obviously, he's distracted,” Mulkey said of Robertson, who played college baseball at LSU.“We're down 12, and hell, he strikes out again. He thinks we're pretty much done at that point. He's in the on-deck circle, and somehow, some way, he got word that we're up 10, and he hits a double.”Sure enough, the play-by-play verifies it. Robertson struck out, grounded out and struck out again before an eighth-inning double in Memphis' 9-1 win at Charlotte.“When I left y’all last night, he FaceTimed me, and he was doing some pretty good celebrating with a few adjectives in there,” Mulkey said. “And I said, ‘Shh, you’re right in front of the media.’”STARS ON STARSWith Clark in the title game, tickets on the secondary market are outpacing those for the last of Taylor Swift's three concerts Sunday at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys in Arlington, about 15 miles from downtown Dallas.Clark's first reaction?“Hey, I’m going to Taylor Swift in June, too. That’s pretty awesome,” Clark said.How about a trip on stage or backstage?“That would be cool,” Clark said. “Hopefully she likes women’s basketball. She should stay for the game tomorrow. How about that?”LSU star Angel Reese is on good terms with the rapper Lil Wayne now that she has set the New Orleans native straight over reaching out to Elite Eight opponent Miami before doing the same with the Tigers.“I told him, that wasn’t cool what he did. Because he from NOLA, so I was like, ‘That’s disrespect,’” Reese said. “We have each other’s number. He calls me whenever. I was the one that got the sound bite for the video that came out for the LSU page. So we cool.”MODEL CITIZENReese, who plans to do some modeling after the season, was asked how she didn't already have a deal for eyelashes under name, image and likeness rules.“Oh, it’s coming, trust,” said Reese, who has long hair to match her long eyelashes. “The lady I work with, it’s coming. Trust.”And that's just the beginning for Reese, who is listed as a sophomore but just finished her third college season after spending the first two at Maryland.“Hopefully I can sign into a shoe deal before I leave college,” Reese said. “That’s my big goal right now. Especially with NIL, I can make as much money in college, probably more than the WNBA. That’s going to be important going into the league emphasizing on my fashion. I love to dress up and love to put on clothes.”___AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World

The Brewers lost 4-0 to the Cubs on Thursday on opening day.Dansby Swanson collected three more hits for Chicago, and Ian Happ homered. Justin Steele struck out eight in six innings.The Cubs led 1-0 before the Brewers rallied in the eighth in cold, windy conditions at Wrigley Field.Brian Anderson led off with a single against Javier Assad (0-1). Pinch-hitter Garrett Mitchell then tried to sacrifice Anderson over before reaching on a walk. Jesse Winker, who was acquired in a December trade with Seattle, followed with a pinch-hit RBI single to center.With the bases loaded and two outs, Contreras blooped a two-run single into right against Michael Fulmer.Contreras was robbed of two possible hits by Swanson at shortstop before he delivered. Contreras and Swanson played together with the Braves in the previous three seasons.“We’ll take that there. That was probably the bigger spot for him,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.Cubs manager David Ross decided to bring back Assad for a second inning of work after a perfect seventh.“Bottom of the order, he’s looked very good,"" Ross said. ""He cruised through the seventh, he’s looked sharp all the way through the (World Baseball Classic), this spring, one of our better pitchers. Looked really good. I had no hesitation to send him back out.”Peter Strzelecki (1-0) pitched a perfect inning for the win.Chicago tried to rally against Williams in the ninth. Swanson led off with a line drive off the reliever’s right shoulder. Swanson, who signed a $177 million, seven-year deal in free agency, also had three hits on opening day.Happ followed with another single, but Williams got Cody Bellinger to bounce into a double play before Miles Mastrobuoni struck out swinging.Milwaukee rookie Joey Wiemer doubled down the right-field line in the second in his first major league at-bat.Woodruff allowed one run and three hits. He struck out eight and walked one.The veteran right-hander had concerns about pitching in the cold weather after he was diagnosed with Raynaud’s Syndrome last season. The condition causes the blood vessels in the extremities to narrow, restricting blood flow. It commonly affects the fingers.“I didn’t know how I was going to react today,"" Woodruff said. “That was one part I was a little nervous about, but it was good. I just have to take care of stuff in between innings just to make sure my hands are warm. That’s about it, but once you get out there and start competing and pitching you’re not worried about it.”BRRRRThe first-pitch temperature was 39 degrees, and there was a gusty wind from the northwest at 23 mph. A message on the videoboard recommended fans take a break during the game and utilize designated warming areas.TRAINER’S ROOMBrewers: INF Luis Urías was placed on the 10-day injured list because of a strained left hamstring, and Wiemer was promoted to the big league roster.

Honduras broke relations with Taipei a week ago.Under a blazing sun Saturday, Tsai and Guatemalan Foreign Minister Mario Búcaro, representing Giammattei -- who suffers from multiple sclerosis – climbed one of the Mayans’ most important pyramids: Temple II, also called Temple of the Masks.With incense, a Mayan invocation ceremony, a Mayan ball game and an exchange of gifts, Tsai and Giammattei talked as they enjoyed the central square of Tikal archaeological park.The day before, in a joint message, the leaders spoke of unity, solidarity and the values shared by Guatemala and Taiwan.Tsai thanked Guatemala’s government for its support, calling it an ally and partner. She has framed the trip as a chance to show Taiwan’s commitment to democratic values globally.On Sunday, Tsai is scheduled to visit a hospital in the western department of Chimaltenango that was built with the help of a Taiwanese donation.Before arriving in Guatemala, the Taiwanese president visited the United States. She will culminate her visit to Central America with a stop in Belize, before returning to the U.S.The trip also is aimed to solidifying ties in Latin America as China funnels money into the region and pressures its countries to break off relations with the self-governed democratic island.Between 2005 and 2020, the Chinese have invested more than $130 billion in Latin America, according to the United States Institute of Peace.

Barcelona won the first leg 1-0 in the capital.The goals ended scoring droughts for all three of Barcelona’s forwards. Lewandowski hadn’t scored in five games – three with Barcelona and two with Poland – since his goal against Manchester United in a 2-0 loss in the Europa League on Feb. 23.Ansu, who struck from outside the area, hadn’t scored since Jan. 19 in the Copa del Rey, while his last goal in the league was in October. Torres hadn’t found the net since scoring twice in Spain’s 7-0 win over Costa Rica in the World Cup in November.Lewandowski got his first goal after receiving a headed pass by Ronald Araújo in the area when he knocked down a long free kick by Jordi Alba. Lewandowski's second goal came after Gavi won possession and played the striker clear.“This is not over and we have to keep going,” Barcelona coach Xavi Hernández said. “It was a well-rounded night for us and for players who needed to boost their confidence.”Given the opponent and his team’s commanding league lead, Xavi allowed himself to experiment with his lineup. Little-used central defender Éric García started in a new position for him as the team’s holding midfielder, while regular starter Sergio Busquets stayed on the bench ahead of the “clasico.”Saturday’s game was the debut of Argentine Sebastián Beccacece as Elche’s fourth coach of the season.The hosts looked like a team that has only won twice in 27 rounds. Elche finished the game 58 points behind Barcelona — 13 to 71 — and, more importantly, 14 points from safety. It was without first-choice striker Lucas Boyé, who served a one-game suspension.“We are not stupid. We know that it is going to be very tough and that time is running out,” Elche defender Carlos Clerc said, adding that the team will still fight on for its fans.WINNING DEBUTJosé Luis Mendilibar had a winning debut as Sevilla’s new coach after it beat Cadiz 2-0. Lucas Ocampos and Youssef En-Nesyri scored in the second half.Mendilibar, 62, has coached several Spanish clubs, with his longest spells in charge of Eibar. He is Sevilla’s third coach of the season after Jorge Sampaoli and Julen Lopetegui both were let go.NEW CONTRACTAthletic Bilbao’s Oihan Sancet broke the news to the team’s fans that he had agreed to a long contract extension following its 0-0 draw with Getafe.Sancet was handed a microphone just moments after the final whistle to make the announcement to the San Mames Stadium.He agreed to a new deal that will tie the 22-year-old midfielder to the Basque club through 2032. Sancet leads the team with eight goals this season.“I am thrilled to stay here, and we thought there was no better way to tell my supporters,” Sancet said. “It is a long contract. I am motivated to return the confidence the club has placed in me.”Also, Cristhian Stuani converted an 88th-minute penalty to give Girona a 2-1 win over Espanyol, which is danger of falling into the relegation zone after four defeats in a row.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853418,"Tornado survivors recount flying debris, destroyed buildings","WYNNE, Ark. (AP) — With tornadoes hitting the Midwest and the South this weekend, some survivors said they emerged from their homes to find buildings ripped apart, vehicles tossed around like toys, shattered glass and felled trees.J.W. Spencer, 88, had never experienced a tornado before, but when he and his wife saw on TV that a tornado was nearing their town of Wynne, Arkansas, he opened a front window and rear door in his house to relieve air pressure. The couple scurried into the bathroom, where they got into the bathtub and covered themselves with quilts and blankets for protection.Fifteen minutes later, the storm unleashed its fury on the town nestled among the flat fields and fertile farmland of eastern Arkansas. Debris came whistling through their house.“We just rode it out,"" Spencer said on Saturday. ""We heard stuff falling, loud noises. And then it quit. It got quiet.”After it passed, the couple emerged to see devastation in the neighborhood.“We come through it real good, as far as the physical part,” Spencer said.Many large trees were down in the community of 8,000 residents who take pride in their schools, their churches, their mom-and-pop restaurants and other businesses. Numerous single-family homes were damaged, especially near the high school, which had its roof shredded and windows blown out.Near a theater in Belvidere, Illinois, where a tornado killed one man and injured 40 concertgoers, Ross Potter picked up glass shards Friday in front of his building. The last time the town was devastated to this extent from a tornado was in 1967.Ambulances whirred by after the theater was hit.“They took, I can’t even remember how many people,” Potter said. He was lucky — only a few of his building's windows were broken, mostly on the second floor. Across the street, most of the brick siding on a storefront was ripped away.Back in Wynne in northeastern Arkansas, Alan Purser stopped in his pickup truck to chat with Spencer. Purser described how he rode out the tornado with his cats in his home, which is being remodeled. He took a risk, sheltering in the sun room which is covered by glass, but it was one of the few rooms not being remodeled.“I just lay down with my cats, and lay a blanket over me, and let it rumble,” he said of the tornado that flipped over the camper van parked outside.From his front porch in Covington, Tennessee, Billy Meade Jr. said he watched a tornado pass through, before hail struck and the sky darkened.“You could see the swirl,” Meade said. “The rain was like a sheet. You couldn’t even hardly see past the rain, it was so dark. But you could see the swirl going past.”Less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away, a tornado struck the elementary school that Meade’s twin sons go to, as well as a middle school next door. On Saturday morning, an exposed gymnasium's bleachers were visible through a crushed brick wall. Much of the roof was ripped off.“The neighborhood I’m in looks fine — it’s like nothing even happened,” Meade said. “But as soon as you go around the corner, it’s like devastation. There’s power lines down everywhere … all kinds of stuff everywhere.”And as a tornado hit Little Rock, Arkansas, workers at a Tropical Smoothie Cafe cowered together in the bathroom.“It was really loud because the glass started breaking,” said Irulan Abrams, an employee who stood outside the building near a door with broken windows. A siren howled in the distance.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853419,Rose Zhang holds on to win Augusta Women's Am in playoff,"AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Rose Zhang has won enough to realize that rarely does something so meaningful ever come so easily. The Augusta National Women's Amateur, the final piece to her brilliant amateur career, meant the world to her.It turned out to be her toughest test.Staked to a five-shot lead, she was 4-over par through seven holes when the final round at the home of the Masters was delayed 3 1/2 hours by storms. She made a bad decision on the par-5 15th to go for the green and went in the water. And she had to watch Jenny Bae stand over a 20-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole with a chance to win.Zhang overcame it all. The only easy shot Saturday was her final stroke, tapping in for par from inches away on the second extra hole to beat Bae in a playoff no one saw coming.“I feel like when your swing is uncomfortable, it’s always very hard to play on a very difficult golf course, and Augusta National is no exception. Especially with it being such a big stage, every mistake is sort of magnified,"" Zhang said. ""So I think that just being able to kind of get back on track, that was my biggest feat today.”Zhang closed with a 4-over 76 and got help at the end.Bae, a senior at Georgia, pulled her approach on No. 10 in the second playoff hole, the ball stopping under a bush that restricted her swing. She punched out up to and across the elevated green into a bunker, and blasted out for her fourth shot.That left Zhang two putts from about 35 feet. The speed was great, and Zhang stood straight and held out her left arm to guide it in the cup. It narrowly missed — close enough — and she doubled over with a mixture of satisfaction and relief.It was a perfect pose for the best amateur in women's golf for the last three years.Take a bow, Rose.The 19-year-old sophomore was mobbed by her Stanford teammates, one of them giving her a red rose.Zhang now has the U.S. Women's Amateur, an NCAA title at Stanford and the Augusta National Women's Amateur, only in its fourth year but already regarded as among the prestigious because of where the final round is played.“It's been incredible,” Zhang said. “The beginning of this week has been pretty crazy already with different press interviews, a lot of expectations on me, and I had a lot of expectations on myself. To overcome everything, I’m just super grateful to be here.”Bae had no reason to think she had a chance, trailing the No. 1 amateur by six shots after a double bogey on No. 3. But she picked up three birdies along the way, the last one an approach to a foot on the 17th that finally caught the mistake-prone Zhang. They finished at 9-under 207.And then Bae's hopes effectively ended on one swing.“I felt confident. But I think I just tugged it a little bit, and it went past the green into the bushes in the back,” Bae said. “I tried, but Rose, she had a fantastic day. Hat's off to her.”Zhang was flawless for two rounds at Champions Retreat, where she set tournament scoring records two days in a row with an opening 66 and then a 65 to lead by five.Augusta National was a different story, and she never felt comfortable even with a slight tweak in her grip on the back nine that helped steady her.But it was her decision on No. 15 that nearly cost her. Zhang could see Bae in the group ahead make her par, so the lead remained two shots. She chose to go for the green, anyway, and slapped the side of her thigh as the ball was in the air. She knew she caught it thin. She the outcome before she saw the splash.“Didn't even come close to the green,” she said. “I was kind of mad at myself for opening that doorway so wide.""She also was clutch on that hole. After the drop, she pitched over the water to 18 feet and sent that some 6 feet by the hole. Miss it and the last of her five-shot lead would be gone.“That putt on 15 was necessary for my confidence,” Zhang said. “If I didn’t make that, that would have probably been the end of me.”She made par over the final five holes, two of the in a playoff, and wound up in Butler Cabin getting the trophy from Masters Chairman Fred Ridley, and speaking to the crowd and a few rows of members in their green jackets in the winner's ceremony on the 18th green.“I just knew that on this golf course a five-shot lead is not enough. A ten-shot lead is not enough,” Zhang said. “Every single hole mattered.”All 20 of them.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

Katie Hobbs has been ordered to appear in court Thursday in her efforts to halt pending executions.Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Frank Moskowitz said late Friday that Hobbs and Ryan Thornell, the state's prison director, must show up to explain why the court shouldn't issue an order against them on the grounds they are violating the constitutional rights of victims entitled to prompt justice.The afternoon court appearance is scheduled the same day convicted murderer Aaron Gunches had been set to die. The Arizona Supreme Court in recent days concluded state law didn't require Hobbs to proceed with the planned execution, even though it wasn't officially called off.An email requesting a response from the governor's office was not immediately answered.At the same time, Maricopa County Attorney Rachel H. Mitchell has asked the court to extend the execution warrant for Gunches by 25 days.Gunches had been set to die by lethal injection for the 2002 killing of his girlfriend's ex-husband Ted Price. He had pleaded guilty to a murder charge in the shooting death near Mesa, Arizona.Price’s sister, Karen Price, has pressed the court to order Hobbs to let the execution go ahead.Hobbs had previously appointed a retired federal magistrate judge to examine Arizona’s procurement of lethal injection drugs and other death penalty protocols.The corrections department said Monday its death penalty protocols “have been paused as we conduct our systemic review of the execution process.""Arizona has 110 prisoners on death row.

With the score 3-3 in the seventh, Alvarez and José Abreu hit consecutive two-out singles off Joe Kelly (0-1) and Tucker greeted José Ruiz with a go-ahead single. Alvarez and Abreu hit consecutive RBI singles in the eighth for a 6-3 lead.“We have been having a lot of two-out knocks,” Chas McCormick said. “We have a competitive lineup. Top of the order puts up some good at bats. It makes it easier for the guys in the bottom of the order because it tires out the pitcher. Our bottom of the order puts up good at bats, too, so it’s big.”Houston outhit the White Sox 11-10 as the Astros went 6 for 19 with runners in scoring position during a game that took 3 hours, 11 minutes. The White Sox were 2 for 9 RISP.Houston manager Dusty Baker credited some of the Astros’ hits to restrictions on the shift.“That was a prime example of where the shift has helped the offense,” Baker said. “Especially, like I said in spring training, it’s going to help the left-handed hitters. It helped Tucker. It helped Yordan twice. Thank God for that, that they changed the rules.”Tucker said he said thought the shirt limit had helped him.“We’ll see how it plays out the rest of the series and rest of the season,” Tucker said. “I probably got a hit off it today, and there’s probably one or two other ones, but it worked out for us.”Héctor Neris relieved Ryne Stanek (1-0) with two on in the eighth, and Neris struck out Elvis Andrus to end the inning.Andrus remained at 1,999 hits.Eloy Jiménez hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth, but Neris struck out Yoán Moncada for his first save this season.“I like the way we played,” Chicago manager Pedro Grifol said. “Obviously, the outcome is not what we want, but I like the way we played. If we play like that, we’re going to be alright. I like the way we pitched, it just comes down to, the ball bounced in their direction today really.”Tucker and McCormick hit back-to-back RBI singles in the first off Lucas Giolito, who allowed three runs — two earned— and five hits in five innings with six strikeouts.

Boston has six games remaining.The Bruins, which entered the NHL in 1924, also set a franchise record for most points in a season, moving past the 121 points produced by the 1970-71 team.“It’s a great accomplishment, but it’s hard when you’re right in the moment to embrace it, I guess maybe, enjoy it,” first-year Boston coach Jim Montgomery said. ""I think after the season is over, we’ll be able to sit back. It’s historical, what we’re doing. It’s a pleasure to coach these guys.”Especially when Pastrnak is on a heater.The veteran forward has 10 goals in his last eight games and 56 on the season, the fifth-highest single-season total in franchise history. His first goal of the game, a deflection from in front, gave him 100 points for the first time in his nine-year career.“I’ve said many times, I’d probably take 100 (points) over 50 goals,” Pastrnak said.This year, Pastrnak didn't have to choose.The Bruins won for the ninth time in 10 games even with captain Patrice Bergeron getting the day off by turning aside all six Pittsburgh power plays — including a 45-second two-man advantage in the second period — and responding every time the Penguins drew even.“We’ve been doing that all year, finding ways to win games,” said defenseman Charlie McAvoy, who scored his seventh goal of the season in the first period. ""I feel like our leadership and our overall team composure has been good for us. Never too high, never too low.”Bryan Rust scored twice for Pittsburgh, his first multigoal game since Feb. 1, 2022, against Washington. Jake Guentzel's 35th of the season with 7:30 left in regulation tied the game. Jarry stopped 31 shots but couldn't get a handle Pastrnak's one-timer from the slot in the final minutes.“We got better as the game went on,” Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. ""I think that we had our chances to get the lead and obviously special teams are a big part of today. But if the power play gets one, it’s the difference in the game. They’re a good team and that’s a fine line.”The Bruins wrapped up the franchise's fourth Presidents Trophy with a victory over Columbus on Thursday and aren't shying away from a shot at putting together the greatest regular season in NHL history.Still, with home ice throughout the playoffs assured, Montgomery gave Bergeron a chance to rest to deal what Montgomery called nagging injuries.No matter. The machine rolled on as Boston jumped on Pittsburgh's mistakes.The Bruins went 2 for 3 on the power play while the Penguins struggled to generate much of anything even when they had the man advantage. Boston's Jeremy Swayman finished with 21 saves to win his fifth straight start.“We’ve got to find a way to get over it,” Sullivan said. “It’s a tough way to lose tonight. A tough way to lose. And that stings when the games have so much meaning like they do this time of year.”Pittsburgh rallied from a one-goal deficit three times, the last on Guentzel's shot from the slot with 7:30 to play.Yet a chance to earn at least a point in the standings by pushing the game to overtime vanished when Pastrnak's second hat trick of the season moved him into a tie with Cam Neely for second on the franchise's all-time hat trick list behind only Phil Esposito's 26.“Great players in this league, they want to be out there in big moments,” Montgomery said of Pastrnak. “He wants to be out there, he wants to be the guy with the puck on his stick.”UP NEXTBruins: Visit St. Louis on Sunday.Penguins: Welcome cross-state rival Philadelphia on Sunday night.___More AP: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

I was able to get away with it today.”Bothered by shoulder issues that sidelined him most of last season, Flaherty (1-0) had only one clean inning but it was his final one. Facing the Blue Jays for the first time in his career, he fanned four and benefited from a second-inning double play started by third baseman Nolan Arenado on George Springer.“I probably shouldn’t have been rewarded today the way I was throwing,” Flaherty said.On a windy 46-degree day, Flaherty threw 49 of 95 pitches for strikes.“I’m actually proud of him,"" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. ""I think we took a big step in the right direction today as far as keeping his cool and figuring out how to make an adjustment rather than allowing it to snowball. That game could have got real ugly in a heartbeat and he didn’t allow it to.” Toronto had three hits after getting 16 singles among an opening day, club record 19 hits on Thursday.“It’s weird like you’re sitting around waiting, sitting around waiting and you kind of need someone to get the hit,"" Toronto manager John Schneider said. ""We just didn’t get it today. But I thought the approach was good.”Facing Andre Pallante, the third of five St. Louis pitchers, Kevin Kiermaier lined a single past the dive of second baseman Brendan Donovan with one out in the seventh. Kiermaier also beat out an infield single in the ninth, and Bo Bichette looped a single off Ryan Helsley in the ninth.A two-out throwing error by third baseman Matt Chapman led to the three unearned Cardinals runs in the third. Paul Goldschmidt, who is 6 for 9 against Kevin Gausman (0-1), gave the Cardinals runners at first and third on a bloop single with two outs. Then, Chapman bobbled Arenado’s grounder and threw wide of first base, allowing the first run to score.Nolan Gorman’s two-run single past the diving attempt of Chapman made it 3-0. Rookie Jordan Walker’s infield hit drove in the Cardinals’ final run in the eighth.Gausman, 1-5 against the Cardinals, scattered eight singles over six innings while allowing no earned runs.The Blue Jays drew 10 walks, including three in the eighth off Jordan Hicks, who topped 100 mph with 13 of 20 pitches.

Olson, who ended up with two of Atlanta's four long balls, wasn't so sure about the veracity of the anecdote.“Just so you all know: We called it in BP,” Acuña said through a wide smile. “Arcia was the one who said, ‘I think today we’re going to get our first back-to-back home runs.’”When that was relayed to Olson, who produced 34 homers and 103 RBIs for NL East champion Atlanta in 2022 and added a two-run shot in the seventh Saturday, he smirked and said: ""He might have made that up.""Either way, the two sluggers at the top of the lineup provided more than enough run support for Spencer Strider (1-0), who struck out nine batters in six scoreless innings, while consistently reaching 99 mph. Washington managed just three hits off Strider, who looked very much like the pitcher who was the runner-up to teammate Michael Harris II for NL Rookie of the Year honors last season, when he accumulated 202 strikeouts in just 131 2/3 innings.“From the second he started throwing,"" Olson said, ""you could tell that he had his good stuff. ... When he has his ‘A’ stuff, it’s tough sledding for the other side.”Josiah Gray (0-1), meanwhile, allowed five runs in five innings, also looking quite a bit like the guy he was in 2022, when he gave up a majors-worst 38 homers and issued an NL-worst 66 walks. The 25-year-old right-hander has been viewed as one of the building blocks for Washington since arriving from the Dodgers in the 2021 trade deadline deal that sent Max Scherzer and Trea Turner to L.A.“Just a matter of poor location there early in the game. I’ve just got to be better there,” Gray said. ""I probably got away with pitches in spring training I might not get away with now.”He began the day with a pair of strikes before Acuña lined a slider over the wall in left for his 27th career leadoff homer, extending his franchise record. Olson then launched a 92 mph fastball on a 2-0 count for a high-arcing drive to right.“Sometimes I get a little nervous before the game, and then I look at our lineup and then I feel a lot better,” Strider said. “No offense to anybody else, but we’ve got a lineup I don’t want to face.”SCUFFLING AND SHUFFLINGWashington, coming off three last-place finishes since its 2019 World Series title, has been outscored 14-3 through two games.

The Pirates reached the second-year lefty for seven hits and two runs. He finished with nine strikeouts and two walks.Lodolo retired seven of the last eight batters he faced. Ian Gibaut, Buck Farmer and Reiver Sanmartin combined to retire the final 12 Pirates batters in a game that took just 2 hours, 16 minutes.“Everybody who came in was able to shut them down and hold it right there,” Reds manager David Bell said. “That was big.”Lodolo's relatively easy fourth inning was the key, according to Bell.“If he doesn't have an easy fourth, he might not go out for the fifth,” he said.Rich Hill (0-1), who turned 43 in March, began his 19th season with his 12th major league team. He allowed three runs and three hits with seven strikeouts and two walks in five innings. Hill joined Pittsburgh as a free agent in January.After the Pirates took a 1-0 lead during Lodolo’s 35-pitch first inning, India hit Hill’s fourth pitch for his eighth career leadoff home run. The 2021 NL Rookie of Year is one shy of Reds Hall of Famer Barry Larkin and two short of matching the club record set by Kal Daniels.“I felt good even after 35 pitches,” Lodolo said. “I wasn't missing by much. I felt like I was in every at-bat.”“It wasn't the type of 35-pitch inning you normally see,” Bell said. “His stuff was good.”Newman, acquired in a November trade, followed later in the first with a two-run drive that caromed off the façade of the second deck in left field for a 3-1 lead.“After a tough opening-day loss, we needed that,” India said. “We needed to get going. It felt good.”FAMILIAR FACEHill was one of the last pitchers Bell faced as a player. Bell went 1 for 3 with a single for Milwaukee against the Cubs on Sept. 27, 2006.EXIT VELOCITYOneil Cruz loaded the bases for the Pirates in the first inning with a chopper that barely reached the grass in front of the plate and had an exit velocity of 47.8 mph.TRAINER’S ROOMPirates: Former Reds RHP Robert Stephenson (right elbow inflammation) threw 15 pitches in one inning on a rehab assignment with Triple-A Indianapolis in its season opener Thursday.Reds: 1B Joey Votto (left shoulder, biceps surgery last August) was scheduled to play first base in Game 1 and be the designated hitter in Game 2 of Triple-A Louisville’s season-opening doubleheader at Nashville caused by a rainout of Thursday’s scheduled opener.

The ball’s in (Fury’s) court. I would 100% be honored to compete for the WBC heavyweight championship of the world. I stand here and I say that proudly.""""That would be an honor. So wherever you are, if you’re listening. You know my management. You know my promoter. We’ve had (dialogue) before so let’s continue and hopefully we can get this on sooner than later.

There’s no better place to be than to have an advantage, but it’s going to take a great round in order to get it done.”Chris Kirk (69) and Sam Stevens (68) were 8 under.Kuchar was one of three notable names to crawl up the leaderboard Saturday. Three-time major champion Padraig Harrington, at age 51, parred his first 10 holes, then shot a back-nine 32 for a 68. He was 7 under.Former Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama was 6 under after a 68.Rodgers led by three coming into the third round. Rodgers and Conners each birdied the drivable 331-yard 17th hole when they chipped close with their second shots.That left Rodgers up by two, but he pushed his tee shot at 18 behind a tree and made bogey from a greenside bunker. Conners could have tied, but missed an 8-foot birdie putt.“I like a lot of the things I did today,” said Conners, who has not won since his Texas Open trophy from four years ago. “I made some birdies on the back nine today and have some good momentum from that.”Rodgers has a 54-hole lead for the fourth time on the tour. He has three second-place finishes.Kuchar was one shot back after driving the par-4 17th green and almost holing a 37-foot eagle putt. It was a stretch of three birdies in six holes, but on the 18 tee, Kuchar pulled his drive shot into a cactus bush. He lost a stroke with an unplayable lie and finished with the double bogey on the par 5.“I paid the price with a poor tee shot on the last,” Kuchar said. “This is tough golf course, one that it’s easy to go wayward, easy to make some big numbers.”Along with Harrington, Byeong Hun An (68), Harry Higgs (72), Lee Hodges (69), Augusto Nunez (69) and Sam Ryder (68) were five behind Rodgers.“It was a decent day,” Harrington said. “Maybe a low one tomorrow will get us in the hunt.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853442,"Zach Eflin shines, Rays offense roars in 12-2 rout of Tigers","ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Tampa Bay Rays are already getting a return on their investment in Zach Eflin.The 28-year-old right-hander is off to a nice start after signing the largest free-agent contract in Rays history, pitching five strong innings and getting lots of offensive support in a 12-2 rout of the Detroit Tigers on Saturday.Yandy Díaz and Wander Franco each had three hits and three RBIs for the Rays, who scored seven times in the third inning to ruin right-hander Spencer Turnbull's first major league outing for the Tigers since June 4, 2021.The Rays have made the playoffs each of the past four years and advanced to the World Series during the 2020 pandemic-shortened season. Offensive shortcomings contributed to coming up short in the postseason each of those appearances.Manager Kevin Cash and his players think this year's lineup has the potential to be better, even though most of the faces are the same.“I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I think we have the best lineup,” Díaz said through a translator.“It was a good day at the yard ... beautiful to watch,” Eflin said, noting the pitching, defense and bats were all superb.About the only thing that hasn't gone Tampa Bay's way in consecutive wins over Detroit to begin the season is Eflin drew a pitch-clock violation before his first delivery to Zach McKinstry in the second inning.The right-hander wound up striking out McKinstry wth two runners on to end the inning.Jose Siri and Josh Lowe each contributed two-run doubles in the third off Turnbull (0-1), who allowed seven runs and eight hits in 2 1/3 innings after missing the second half of 2021 and all of 2022 while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery.“I'm definitely pretty disappointed. Not exactly the way I was hoping the day would go,” Turnbull said. “Mostly it was disappointing because I didn't give us a chance to win.”Eflin (1-0) began last season in Philadelphia's rotation, but helped the Phillies reach the World Series as part of the bullpen after being sidelined more than two months with a right knee bruise. His $40 million, three-year deal with the Rays surpassed the $35 million, five-year contract the club gave Wilson Álvarez before its inaugural 1998 season.The right-hander, who turns 29 next week, allowed one run and three hits in a 74-pitch debut. He yielded a RBI single in the fourth to Miguel Cabrera, who moved ahead of Ichiro Suzuki for sole possession of 23rd place on the all-time hits list with 3,090.Kerry Carpenter, who doubled leading off the fourth, and Spencer Torkelson had Detroit's other hits off Eflin.Randy Arozarena got Tampa Bay's offense rolling with a RBI double in the first. Díaz had a run-scoring double in the third and two-run homer off Tyler Alexander in the fourth, when Tampa Bay built the lead to 10-1.Franco had a RBI single and two-run double, which made it 12-2 in the seventh.“Pretty explosive,” Cash said. “When you score 12, a lot of people have to be part of it.”TRAINER'S ROOMRays 2B Brandon Lowe left the game after fouling a pitch off his right big toe in the third inning. He said the injury is not serious.“No concern,” Lowe said. “Everything looks fine. A little sore ... but this early in the season it make sense to take precautions.”MIGGY TRIBUTEThe 38-year-old Cabrera has announced that this will be his final season. The Rays recognized him during a brief video scoreboard tribute between the first and second innings, concluding: “Thanks for the memories, Miggy.”With two outs and a runner on in the second, Cabrera hit a sharp bouncer that deflected off third baseman Taylor Walls' glove. The play intially was ruled an infield single, but later changed to an error on Walls.UP NEXTLefty Jeffrey Springs, who signed a $31 million, four-year contract after moving from the bullpen to a starting role in 2022, takes the mound for the Rays in Sunday's series finale.

(AP) — Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Angels only needed one time through the lineup to figure out Shintaro Fujinami.Taylor Ward homered and drove in four runs, and Los Angeles scored 11 times in the third inning to beat Oakland 13-1 on Saturday, spoiling Fujinami’s major league debut.Ohtani added two hits and two RBIs for Los Angeles. Gio Urshela, Jake Lamb and rookie catcher Logan O’Hoppe drove in two runs apiece to help the Angels avoid an 0-2 start for the second consecutive season.“I’m not worried about the offense,” Los Angeles manager Phil Nevin said. “You go back and look at the tape (from Thursday), we hit some balls hard and things could have gone different ways. Happy with the way they swung it today, and we pitched well and played really good defense.”Angels starter Patrick Sandoval (1-0) gave up a home run to Ramón Laureano, but that was it.Fujinami, who signed a one-year, free-agent deal with Oakland after spending the past 10 seasons with the Hanshin Tigers, was part of the same draft class in Japan as Ohtani in 2012. The right-hander breezed through the first two innings, then fell apart.After getting Ward to strike out swinging at a 93 mph slider to begin the game, Fujinami (0-1) whiffed slugger Mike Trout swinging on a 95 mph slider and got Ohtani to ground out weakly to first base.Following a 1-2-3 second, the Angels broke through in the third. O’Hoppe’s RBI double got it going. Ward had a run-scoring single before Ohtani banged an 0-1 pitch off the left-field wall for a long RBI single.Anthony Rendon added a sacrifice fly before Lamb’s two-run single made it 6-0 and ended Fujinami’s afternoon after 55 pitches.Ward’s homer was a three-run drive off reliever Adam Oller.“Definitely the start we needed,” Ward said. “Just bringing the fire like that, we need to do that every game. For me, I was just trying to really stay on (Fujinami’s) heater. In the situation I was in, with runners on, I figured he may go to an off-speed pitch early on, so I was ready for it.”Fujinami lasted 2 1/3 innings, allowing eight earned runs with three walks and four strikeouts.“The first inning the fastball was working very well. I thought the third inning I threw too many off-speed pitches. I should have thrown more fastballs,"" he said through interpreter Issei Kamada.Fujinami was quick to point out he’s not satisfied.“Just getting on a big league mound is not enough,” he said. “I’ll probably think about it when I get back home, but today’s today. Tomorrow’s a brand new day.”Sandoval allowed two hits in five innings. He struck out two and walked two. In nine career starts against Oakland, the left-hander is 3-3 with a 1.84 ERA.“I’m just trying to keep my foot on the gas and make pitches,” Sandoval said. “Made some pitches but also didn’t make some pitches.”Tucker Davidson pitched four scoreless innings for his first major league save.SHORT HOPSIt was the fourth time in the last 50 years the A’s allowed 11 or more runs in one inning. … Oakland shortstop Carlos Perez singled in the ninth in his first big league at-bat since 2018. “Congrats to Carlos for getting that hit after not being here for five years,” A’s manager Mark Kotsay said.TRAINER’S ROOMAngels: Brandon Drury was given a planned day off.

But then Justin Verlander went on the injured list hours before the club's opening-day win. That made way for Megill, who had been preparing to start for Triple-A Syracuse, to step in Saturday against the Marlins.Megill struck out seven over five innings, and along with a go-ahead double by Pete Alonso, helped the Mets beat Miami 6-2.Verlander’s injury, a low-grade teres major strain that the Mets believe is minor, sidelined the three-time AL Cy Young Award winner before his first appearance with the team. He signed an $86.7 million, two-year contract in December after winning the 2022 World Series with Houston.Megill (1-0) was also the Mets' opening-day starter last year while subbing for injured ace Jacob deGrom. He allowed six hits, two runs and two walks Saturday.“A little erratic in the first two innings,” Megill said. “But I settled down in three, four, five. Pretty solid day.”The game was tied 2-all when Jeff McNeil led off the fifth with a double against Andrew Nardi (0-1). On the play, third baseman Jean Segura and shortstop Joey Wendle collided in left field trying to secure the ball. Alonso’s ensuing double made it 3-2.Alonso then scored on a single by Mark Canha to double New York’s lead.Canha was 3 for 4, including a homer off reliever Braxton Garrett in the seventh that made it 5-2.“He just works at it,” Mets manager Buck Showalter said. “This guy's never satisfied. We have a lot of guys like that. That's why it's such a fun club to manage, because they're chasing perfection.”The Mets jumped ahead 1-0 in the second on a sacrifice fly by Omar Narvaez that scored Canha, who doubled leading off the inning.Miami catcher Nick Fortes hit a two-run homer in the bottom half off Megill to make it 2-1. It was the 14th home run of Fortes’ career and Miami’s fourth homer in three games this series.Narvaez, batting ninth, tied it 2-all with an RBI single in the fourth that drove in Canha, who drew the fifth walk from Marlins starter Edward Cabrera.Cabrera walked six in all, a career high. The 24-year-old right-hander struck out two and allowed two hits.Miami threatened in the eighth on Segura's first hit with the Marlins and Fortes' two-out single. But reliever Adam Ottavino struck out Wendle to end the inning. Miami was hitless with runners in scoring position.Starling Marte, pinch-hitting in the ninth, drove in another run off Garrett with a ground-rule double.DYNAMIC DEFENSEWith the Mets up 4-2 in the fifth, shortstop Francisco Lindor robbed Bryan De La Cruz when he grabbed a grounder and fired the ball across the infield to first to strand two Miami runners and end the inning.“It seems like he’s taken his defensive game to another level,” Showalter said. “Moving his feet really well.”HOT STARTLuis Arraez, the AL batting champion last season with Minnesota, had four hits and is 7 for 12 in three games with Miami.WATCH PARTYThe Final Four matchup between Florida Atlantic University and San Diego State was well underway by the end of Saturday's game, and the Marlins allowed fans to watch it on a jumbo screen inside the ballpark. Students at FAU and Miami, which was set to face UConn in the second NCAA men's semifinal, got into the Marlins game for free.

Then, Garver sparked what became a six-run seventh with another three-run shot, this time off Seranthony Dominguez.The Rangers followed their 11-7 victory in the season opener by tying three other teams with 27 runs in two games, second-most since 1900. The 1951 White Sox scored 30.“It’s good to see these bats come alive here these last two days,” Texas manager Bruce Bochy said. “You see games like this, it just gets contagious. That’s what happened today with the offense.”Semien got things going early, leading off the bottom of the first with a homer off Phillies starter Zack Wheeler (0-1), but Garver became the star of the game.It marked Garver’s first action at catcher in a regular-season game since May 8, 2022. Garver was limited to just 15 games at catcher in 2022 due to a forearm injury.“It feels good to hit two hard balls and have a little bit of resemblance of what I used to do,” Garver said.Garver said jokingly that “today” was the best he’s felt swinging the bat since his 2022 season ended on July 11 with right forearm flexor tendon repair surgery.“You’re constantly tweaking with your swing, trying to figure out something that feels good for the day,” he said. “It’s the nature of the beast, just trying to feel good. Then it’s all about competing.”The Phillies cut a 4-0 deficit to 4-3 with a two-run double by Nick Castellanos in the fourth and an RBI groundout by Kyle Scwarber in the fifth.But the Rangers pulled away and the Phillies had just one baserunner get into scoring position the final four innings.Texas right-hander Nathan Eovaldi (1-0) earned the win, allowing three runs on six hits with two walks and six strikeouts over five innings in his debut with the team.Wheeler allowed five runs (four earned) on seven hits with one walk and seven strikeouts over 4 1/3 innings.ROSTER MOVEPhiladelphia outfielder Cristian Pache reported to the club on Saturday, taking the roster spot of Dalton Guthrie.

The Fenway Park crowd was screaming.Two pitches later, the Boston Red Sox were celebrating at home plate and walking off with their first win of the season, 9-8 over the Orioles on Saturday behind Adam Duvall's second two-run homer.“When it hit, I wasn't sure if it was a homer of not,” said Duvall after the ball hit just above the Green Monster and caromed off a tabletop back onto the field. “I saw them stop going for it and I saw the lights start to flicker. I was hoping it was going to stand as a homer.”Duvall had four hits and five RBIs.“I turned my back and started to go the clubhouse and I hear the fans screaming,” winning pitcher Kenley Jansen (1-0) said.Duvall lined his shot against Félix Bautista (0-1).“Mac’s done a really great job in the outfield for us for a few years now,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. “Mistakes happen. Unfortunately, it was a just tough time. ... I feel bad for him. Nobody feels worse in there in than Mac.”Baltimore stole five bases and became the first team to steal 10 in its first two games since at least 1901. Jorge Mateo swiped two, and Cedric Mullins, McKenna and Austin Hays one each.Mullins hit a three-run homer, Ryan Mountcastle had a two-run shot and the Orioles tagged Chris Sale for seven runs over three innings in his first Fenway start since 2021.“Obviously, it sucks, but you move forward,” McKenna said.Hays went 5 for 5 with a solo shot for the Orioles, who won Thursday's opener 10-9 after taking a six-run lead.Baltimore went ahead 7-1 on Mullins' homer before Boston rallied behind Duvall, who fell a single shy of the cycle. Rafael Devers had three hits and Alex Verdugo a two-homer homer for the Red Sox, who cut it to 8-7 in the seventh on Duvall's RBI double.Making his first start in Fenway since a loss in Game 5 of the 2021 AL Championship Series, Sale gave up three homers. He did have six strikeouts, getting Ramón Urías three of his five times.“I left them completely out to dry tonight,” Sale said. “About as embarrassed as I’ve even been on a baseball field. ... I was out there throwing batting practice.”Baltimore’s Andy Rutschman went 1 for 5 with a single in his first at-bat after going 5 for 5 and reaching base six times in the opener.With a very light rain falling and the sun peeking through the clouds, Sale took his warmups in Boston’s bullpen.About 30 minutes later, he found himself in a 3-0 hole after giving up homers to Mountcastle — a shot into the Monster seats on a slider down the middle— and Hays’ drive to center on a 95.7 mph fastball.Sale made just two starts last year. The left-hander broke the pinkie on his pitching hand when he hit by a line drive from the Yankees’ Aaron Hicks, and Sale's season ended when he broke his right wrist in a bike accident.THAT’S WHAT IT TAKESThe Red Sox finally got Rutschman out when third baseman Devers made a charging barehand grab on a slow roller, with first baseman Triston Casas making a scoop on a close play with two runners on.TAKE TWOMcKenna made a diving catch on Kiké Hernández’s liner after Mountcastle’s diving snag on a grounder of the previous batter, Reese McGuire.TRAINER’S ROOMOrioles: Mateo injured his right hand on a headfirst slide but stayed in the game.Red Sox: RHP Garrett Whitlock (recovering from hip surgery in September) pitched four innings for Triple-A Worcester in a rehab start on Friday.

(AP) — Taiyanna Jackson had 17 points and career-high tying 21 rebounds — her fourth consecutive double-double and 23rd of the season — Zakiyah Franklin added 19 points and Kansas beat Columbia 66-59 Saturday to win the WNIT championship.Chandler Prater added nine points, 11 rebounds and four steals for Kansas (25-11) and Wyvette Mayberry scored 12 points. The Jayhawks finished with their most wins since the 1997-98 team that also won 25 games and set a program record for home wins in a season with 19.This season Kansas made its first appearance in the AP Top 25 in nearly a decade after the Jayhawks — who won 21 games last season and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2013 — set a program record with 10 consecutive wins to open the season.Columbia (28-6) struggled offensively against the length and athleticism of the Kansas defense. The Lions, who went into the game ranked No. 13 nationally in scoring offense (78.8 per game) and No. 12 in rebound margin (plus-8.5), were held to fewer than 60 points for just the third time this season and outrebounded (49-41) for just the fourth time.Franklin scored eight straight Kansas points in a 12-5 spurt that gave the Jayhawks a 29-25 lead — the largest by either team to that point — with a minute to go in the first half. After Kitty Henderson hit a 3 for the Lions, Chandler Prater's jumper made it 31-28 at intermission. Henderson hit a 3-pointer, Abbey Hsu made a jumper and Jaida Patrick added another 3 in the first 68 seconds of the third quarter to put Columbia ahead by five before a 15-0 spurt gave Kansas the lead for good.Columbia missed 10 consecutive field goals and made just one of its next 15 from the field after Patrick's 3 and Kansas never trailed over the final 18 minutes.Hsu led the Lions with 19 points and Kaitlyn Davis scored 13. Hsu finished the season with 606 points, two shy of the program record set by Camille Zimmerman in 2016-17.Jackson had three blocks to extend her single-season Kansas record to 109.Columbia is the first team in Ivy League history to advance to the WNIT's championship game. Last year, the Lions were the first team in conference history to make it to the Great Eight, where they fell to Seton Hall, 78-75.Columbia’s 28 wins this season are a new program record, three more than the previous record set last year when the Lions went 25-7.___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853469,"At least 21 dead after tornadoes rake US Midwest, South","WYNNE, Ark. (AP) — Storms that dropped possibly dozens of tornadoes killed at least 21 people in small towns and big cities across the South and Midwest, tearing a path through the Arkansas capital, collapsing the roof of a packed concert venue in Illinois, and stunning people throughout the region Saturday with the damage's scope.Confirmed or suspected tornadoes in at least eight states destroyed homes and businesses, splintered trees and laid waste to neighborhoods across a broad swath of the country. The dead included seven in one Tennessee county, four in the small town of Wynne, Arkansas, three in Sullivan, Indiana, and four in Illinois.Other deaths from the storms that hit Friday night into Saturday were reported in Alabama and Mississippi, along with one near Little Rock, Arkansas, where city officials said more than 2,600 buildings were in a tornado's path.Residents of Wynne, a community of about 8,000 people 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Memphis, Tennessee, woke Saturday to find the high school's roof shredded and its windows blown out. Huge trees lay on the ground, their stumps reduced to nubs. Broken walls, windows and roofs pocked homes and businesses.Debris and memories of regular life lay scattered inside the shells of homes and on lawns: clothing, insulation, roofing paper, toys, splintered furniture, a pickup truck with its windows shattered.Ashley Macmillan said she, her husband and their children huddled with their dogs in a small bathroom as a tornado passed, “praying and saying goodbye to each other, because we thought we were dead.” A falling tree seriously damaged their home, but no one in the family was hurt.“We could feel the house shaking, we could hear loud noises, dishes rattling. And then it just got calm,” she said.Recovery was already underway, with workers using chainsaws and bulldozers to clear the area. Utility crews worked to restore power.At least seven people died in Tennessee's McNairy County, east of Memphis along the Mississippi border, said David Leckner, the mayor of Adamsville.“The majority of the damage has been done to homes and residential areas,” Leckner said, adding that although it appeared all people were accounted for, crews were going door to door to be sure.Gov. Bill Lee drove to the county Saturday to survey the damage, noting that the storm came days after six people were killed in a school shooting in Nashville.“But it looks like your community has done what Tennessean communities do, and that is rally and respond,” he said.Jeffrey Day said he called his daughter after seeing on the news that their community of Adamsville was being hit. Huddled in a closet with her two-year-old son as the storm passed over, she answered the phone screaming.“She kept asking me, ‘What do I do, daddy?’"" Day said. ""I didn’t know what to say.”In Belvidere, Illinois, part of the roof of the Apollo Theatre collapsed as about 260 people were attending a heavy metal concert. Some of them pulled a 50-year-old man from the rubble, but he was dead when emergency workers arrived. Officials said 40 other people were hurt, including two with life-threatening injuries.“They dragged someone out from the rubble, and I sat with him and I held his hand and I was (telling him), ‘It’s going to be OK.’ I didn’t really know much else what to do,"" concertgoer Gabrielle Lewellyn told WTVO-TV.On Saturday, crews were cleaning up around the Apollo, with forklifts pulling away loose bricks. Business owners picked up shards of glass and covered shattered windows.In Crawford County, Illinois, three people were killed and eight others injured after a tornado hit around New Hebron, Bill Burke, the county board chair, said.Sheriff Bill Rutan said 60 to 100 families were displaced.“We’ve had emergency crews digging people out of their basements because the house is collapsed on top of them, but luckily they had that safe space to go to,” Rutan said at a news conference.Illinois state Rep. Adam Niemerg called the tornado “catastrophic.”That tornado was not far from where three people were killed in Indiana's Sullivan County, about 95 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Indianapolis.Sullivan Mayor Clint Lamb said at a news conference that an area south of the county seat of about 4,000 “is essentially unrecognizable right now"" and that several people were rescued from rubble overnight. There were reports of as many as 12 people injured, he said, and search-and-rescue teams combed damaged areas.“I’m really, really shocked there isn’t more as far as human issues,” he said, adding that recovery “is going to be a very long process.”In the Little Rock area, at least one person was killed and more than 50 were hurt, some critically.The National Weather Service said that tornado was a high-end EF3 twister with wind speeds up to 165 mph (265 kph) and a path as long as 25 miles (40 kilometers).Masoud Shahed-Ghaznavi was lunching at home when it roared through his neighborhood, causing him to hide in the laundry room as sheetrock fell on his head and windows shattered. When he emerged, the house was mostly rubble.“I see everything around me is sky,"" Shahed-Ghaznavi recalled. He barely slept Friday night.“When I closed my eyes, I couldn’t sleep, imagined I was here,” he said Saturday outside his home.Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to help local responders.Another suspected tornado killed a woman in northern Alabama’s Madison County, county official Mac McCutcheon said. And in northern Mississippi's Pontotoc County, officials confirmed one death and four injuries.Tornadoes also caused damage in eastern Iowa and broke windows northeast of Peoria, Illinois.The storms struck just hours after President Joe Biden visited Rolling Fork, Mississippi, where tornadoes last week destroyed parts of town.It could take days to determine the exact number of tornadoes, said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the Storm Prediction Center. There were also hundreds of reports of large hail and damaging winds, he said.“That’s a quite active day,"" he said. “But that’s not unprecedented.”More than 530,000 homes and businesses in the affected area lacked power at midday Saturday, over 200,000 of them in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.The sprawling storm system also brought wildfires to the southern Plains, with nearly 100 new ones reported Friday in Oklahoma, according to the state forest service.At least 32 people were injured in the fires, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. There were reports of more than 40 homes destroyed around the state.The storms also caused blizzard conditions in the Upper Midwest.A threat of tornadoes and hail remained for the Northeast including in parts of Pennsylvania and New York.",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853470,Doval escapes in the 9th as Giants hold off Yankees 7-5,"NEW YORK (AP) — Camilo Doval retired Giancarlo Stanton on a game-ending, double-play grounder with the bases loaded and the San Francisco Giants hung on for a 7-5 victory over the New York Yankees on Saturday.Doval gave up Aaron Judge’s RBI single in the ninth, the slugger’s third hit, but earned his first save when Stanton hit a ground ball to shortstop Brandon Crawford, who started a double play that withstood a video review. Second baseman Thairo Estrada made a low throw to first baseman LaMonte Wade Jr., who scooped the ball.“Live and it looked before they paused, he kept it long enough,” Crawford said of Estrada. “LaMonte was definitely on the bag. I wasn’t too worried.""There were four pitch clock violations, the most of any game in the first three days of the new rule. Two were by Doval in the ninth inning, and the Giants’ Taylor Rogers and the Yankees’ Albert Abreu had one each.“We didn’t see any of that sort of thing in spring training,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. ""We saw a good mastery of it. This is a different environment and it’s understandable that things sped up a little bit, but no pitcher’s going to survive giving away balls like that. It doesn’t matter how good you are.”New York’s Anthony Volpe got his first two big league hits and became the first Yankees player to steal a base in each of his first two games since Fritz Maisel in 1913. No major leaguer had accomplished the feat since Billy Hamilton in 2013.But the 21-year-old shortstop also had Estrada’s RBI single carom off his glove as the Giants scored twice in the sixth inning for a 5-3 lead.New York built a 2-0 lead helped by pitcher Alex Cobb’s throwing error and Stanton’s first home run, a 112 mph drive to the opposite field down the right-field line. But the Yankees went 3 for 11 with runners in scoring position and stranded eight runs as the Giants rallied.Joc Pederson hit a solo homer and Crawford hit a two-run drive in a three-run fourth against Clarke Schmidt, the first home run for the Giants on a 3-0 pitch since Buster Posey in the 2021 NL Division Series.Crawford went 3 for 5 with a double and scored twice to go along with a stolen base. It was the second time in his career he a three-hit game with a double, homer, two runs scored and a steal.“It was a good day. I guess my best game of the year so far,” Crawford said with a laugh.Anthony Rizzo’s RBI double off Jakub Junis (1-0) tied it 3-3 in the fifth, and the Giants scored two runs in the sixth without hitting a ball out of the infield.Wade Jr. hit a go-ahead RBI single when his soft hit went to the third base side of the mound, and David Villar scored the go-ahead run when Michael King (0-1) and catcher Jose Trevino converged and could not make a throw. King was making his return from a broken elbow last July 22.After King struck out Michael Conforto, Estrada hit a liner to Volpe, who charged in and had the ball go off the heel of his glove. Volpe was unable to get the force at second as Crawford scored to put the Giants up 5-3.“It was a tough one,” Volpe said. “Probably keep me up at night thinking about that. I definitely feel like I should have had it. It was on me.”Josh Donaldson homered in the eighth off Rogers, three innings after the crowd booed Donaldson for taking a called third strike that stranded two runners.Mike Yastrzemski added an RBI double and Crawford hit a run-scoring single in a two-run ninth off Clay Holmes.STARTERS Schmidt allowed three runs and four hits in 3 1/3 innings. Schmidt threw a cutter that he added in the offseason 27 times, including three straight to Pederson for a strikeout in the first.Cobb gave up two runs and four hits in 3 2/3 innings.TRAINER’S ROOM Giants: C Joey Bart (back tightness) was a late scratch.

He played 14 minutes and took 18 shifts, and started by centering a line with wingers Reese Johnson and Austin Wagner.Toews set up Andreas Athanasiou's third period tip in and managed a shot himself. But the Blackhawks leader admitted his first game back — against the speedy Devils — was challenging.“Definitely finding my way a little bit,” Toews. ""I think the first period was rough. That's a fast team, fast game.“But I think the second, third period, I started to feel a bit more comfortable.”Toews made a statement through the team on Feb. 19 saying he would be stepping away because of the effects of chronic immune response syndrome and “long COVID.”After training on his own, Toews returned to the ice with teammates in a practice session on Tuesday. In a meeting with reporters after the skate, he hinted his stellar NHL career could be winding down after 15 years and stopped short of saying he planned to play in any of last-place Chicago remaining games.Toews’ eight-year, $84 million contract is set to expire at the end of the season.“It was good to have him back,” coach Luke Richardson said. “I though he was a big presence on the bench, very vocal, and made a nice play.”Toews, the Blackhawks’ first-round draft pick (third overall) in 2006, joined the team in 2007 and was a pillar of Stanley Cup championship clubs in 2010, 2013 and 2015.At the peak of his career, he was one of the NHL’s top two-way centers, winning the Selke Trophy as the league’s top defensive forward in 2013.In 1,060 regular-season games, Toews has 371 goals and 509 assists. In 139 playoff games, he’s posted 45 goals and 74 assists, and he won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP in 2010.Toews missed the entire 2020-21 season with chronic immune response syndrome, which caused debilitating inflammation and fatigue. He appeared in 71 games in 2021-22.Toews started this season with renewed energy before slowing and eventually shutting himself down. He has 14 goals and 15 assists in 47 games.___More AP: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853472,Butler's buzzer-beater sends San Diego State to title game,"HOUSTON (AP) — San Diego State's vaunted defense staggered well into the second half as free-flowing Florida Atlantic breezed to a 14-point lead.The Aztecs found their teeth again to get back into the game. Then Lamont Butler delivered at the very end.Butler hit a buzzer-beating jumper for the ages, sending San Diego State to its first national championship game with a 72-71 win over fellow mid-major Florida Atlantic in the Final Four on Saturday night.“I didn’t really know how big it was,” Butler said after his calm reaction to one of the greatest shots in NCAA Tournament history. “We’re going to the national championship. That’s not things many people do.”A diabolical defense had pushed San Diego State (32-6) all the way to the final stop for the NCAA tourney. The Aztecs bumped and harassed opponents all season to create the first all-mid-major national semifinal since VCU and Butler in 2011.The swaggy Owls (35-4) seemed to have solved San Diego State's vaunted defense, using constant movement and ball reversals to create mismatches they could exploit.San Diego State found its defensive mojo midway through the second half, clamping down on the Owls while whittling their lead down to one on Jaedon LeDee's short jumper with 36 seconds left.When FAU's Johnell Davis missed a contested layup, San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher opted to not call timeout, joking that he didn't have any plays left.All he had to do was get the ball to Butler.The clock ticking down, Butler dribbled to the baseline, found that cut off and circled back. He stepped back to create a little room and hit a jumper that sent the Aztecs racing out onto the floor and had San Diego Padres fans going wild at Petco Park.Butler's winning buzzer-beater was the first for the Final Four since Jalen Suggs for Gonzaga against UCLA in 2021 and No. 5 overall. But it's the only one when the winning team was trailing at the time of the shot.Next up for the Mountain West's first Final Four team is a chance to win the conference's first national title Monday night against UConn, which advanced with a 72-59 win against Miami.“We’ve always been knocked down,” said San Diego State's Matt Bradley, who had 21 points after struggling in the previous three games. “But the biggest thing we always do is get back up and keep fighting.”San Diego State had been building toward this since coach Brian Dutcher took over for his longtime mentor Steve Fisher. Dutcher followed the mold Fisher had created, adding an extra dose of nasty to the defense.The Aztecs lost an opportunity when they were in position for a No. 1 seed in the 2020 NCAA Tournament, only to have it wiped out by the pandemic.San Diego State followed a pair of NCAA Tournament first-round flameouts with a solid 2023 season, winning 27 games to earn a No. 5 seed in the East Region in this year's bracket.Once the NCAA Tournament started, the Aztecs ramped up their defense even more, holding their first four opponents to an average of 57 points per game and 17% shooting from the 3-point arc.FAU found an answer through quick ball movement, with the occasional dump into the post to keep the Aztecs honest.The result: The Owls led 40-33 at halftime after hitting 5 of 11 from 3-point range against a defense that held its previous two NCAA Tournament opponents to 5-of-44 shooting from the arc.FAU kept making shots, stretching the lead to 14 midway through the second half.Then, with Fisher watching in the stands, the Aztecs got gritty.Contesting nearly every shot and pass while pulling down a string of offensive rebounds, including six in 59 seconds, San Diego State rallied to tie it at 65-all.“They went on a run, getting extra possessions,” said FAU's Nick Boyd, who hit three early 3s and finished with 12 points. “That was really the turning point of the game.”FAU kept San Diego State at bay most of the second half thanks to Alijah Martin, who seemed to have an answer for every Aztecs move by scoring 19 of his 26 points in the second half.He hit a reverse layup with 45 seconds left to put FAU up 71-68, but wasn't enough to prevent the Owls' improbable run from coming to an end.“These guys have created memories and a legacy that will last a lifetime,” FAU coach Dusty May.So did the Aztecs — with one more chance to add to it.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853473,"Presidents of Taiwan, Guatemala visit Mayan pyramid","GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and the Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei toured the archaeological site of Tikal on Saturday during a trip by Tsai that aims to shore up the self-governing island’s ties with its remaining allies in Central America.The Taiwanese leader will visit Guatemala and Belize, the island’s only two remaining allies in Central America, where Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama and Costa Rica have all switched their support to China. Honduras broke relations with Taipei a week ago.Under a blazing sun Saturday, Tsai and Guatemalan Foreign Minister Mario Búcaro, representing Giammattei -- who suffers from multiple sclerosis – climbed one of the Mayans’ most important pyramids: Temple II, also called Temple of the Masks.With incense, a Mayan invocation ceremony, a Mayan ball game and an exchange of gifts, Tsai and Giammattei talked as they enjoyed the central square of Tikal archaeological park.The day before, in a joint message, the leaders spoke of unity, solidarity and the values shared by Guatemala and Taiwan.Tsai thanked Guatemala’s government for its support, calling it an ally and partner. She has framed the trip as a chance to show Taiwan’s commitment to democratic values globally.On Sunday, Tsai is scheduled to visit a hospital in the western department of Chimaltenango that was built with the help of a Taiwanese donation.Before arriving in Guatemala, the Taiwanese president visited the United States. She will culminate her visit to Central America with a stop in Belize, before returning to the U.S.The trip also is aimed to solidifying ties in Latin America as China funnels money into the region and pressures its countries to break off relations with the self-governed democratic island.Between 2005 and 2020, the Chinese have invested more than $130 billion in Latin America, according to the United States Institute of Peace. Trade between China and the region has also shot up, and is expected to reach more than $700 billion by 2035.Taiwan now has no more than 13 official diplomatic partners.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853474,Israeli police fatally shoot man at Jerusalem's holiest site,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli police shot and killed a man who they alleged tried to snatch an officer’s gun at an entrance to a Jerusalem holy site early Saturday, raising fears of further violence during a time of heightened tensions at the flashpoint compound.Later Saturday, the Israeli military said a Palestinian driver rammed his vehicle into a group of Israelis in the occupied West Bank. Israeli medics said three people were wounded, two seriously, and the alleged attacker was shot dead.In Jerusalem's police shooting, Palestinian worshippers at the entrance to the site on Saturday morning had a different account, saying that police shot the man at least 10 times after he tried to prevent them from harassing a woman who was on her way to the holy compound, home to Al-Aqsa Mosque in the heart of Jerusalem’s Old City — the third holiest shrine in Islam. The compound, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, is also the most sacred site in Judaism.The police said the slain man was 26-year-old Mohammed Alasibi from Hura, a Bedouin Arab village in southern Israel. The village council called for a thorough investigation of his killing and a general strike Saturday in protest.Hours after the incident, the muddy stone alleyway leading to Al-Aqsa Mosque was still stained with blood. Alasibi's family said he was a physician who had recently passed his exams and earned his M.D. in Romania. He returned to his hometown a month ago, his cousin said, and was caring for his sick father as he worked to get certified in Israel.“He is a polite, kind man from a family of doctors who was going to Al-Aqsa for spiritual reasons,” his cousin Fahad Alasibi said. “If you want us to believe that he tried to attack police, then show us the security footage.”A police spokesperson pushed back on Palestinian accounts, insisting there was no woman walking to the compound at midnight because the complex was closed to visitors under an agreement with an Islamic trust called the Waqf controlled by Jordan.Nonetheless, a few dozen people have been trying to sleep at the mosque overnight during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, prompting Israeli police to intervene and try to evict the worshippers.The police spokesperson said Alasibi first aroused suspicion walking toward the shuttered compound. After being stopped for questioning, the spokesperson said Alasibi jumped on one of the officers and grabbed his gun, managing to fire two bullets toward policemen as the officer struggled to restrain him. Police described the incident as an attempted terrorist attack and said they shot and killed him in self-defense. No officers were injured. The spokesperson said there was no camera on the inner wall of the compound that could have captured the incident.Palestinian worshippers at the compound Saturday disagreed. Noureddine, a 17-year-old who lived in the neighborhood and declined to give his last name for fear of reprisals, said he saw Alasibi confront police who had stopped a female worshipper on her way to Al-Aqsa Mosque. Alasibi’s relationship to the woman was not clear. He said some kind of disagreement broke out between Alasibi and the officers before he heard a dozen shots ring out.“Nothing could justify that many shots,” he said, pointing to chaotic footage he filmed that showed Palestinian vendors and worshippers screaming at the sound of bullets being fired in rapid succession. “They were fired at close range.”His cousin Fahad said Alasibi was worried about making the trip from Israel's Negev desert to Al-Aqsa because his ailing father relied on him. “But he went because praying there during Ramadan means a lot to him,"" he said.The city's contested compound has been a focus for clashes in the past, particularly in times of turmoil in Israel and the West Bank. This year, as violence surges in the occupied territory under the most right-wing government in Israeli history, fears of an escalation in Jerusalem have mounted with the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Israeli police have boosted their forces as tens of thousands of Muslim worshippers flock to Al-Aqsa Mosque for prayers.On Friday, more than 200,000 Palestinians gathered at the compound for noon prayers, which passed peacefully.Noureddine said police forced Palestinian vendors and worshippers out of the area after the incident, beating him and others with batons. Israeli police briefly closed the site before reopening it for dawn prayers.Confrontations at the hilltop compound have triggered wider violence in the region in the past. Clashes at the site in May 2021 helped fuel the outbreak of a bloody 11-day war between Israel and Gaza Strip's Hamas rulers.This year's convergence of Ramadan with the Jewish holiday of Passover could increase the possibility of friction as the Old City hosts a massive influx of pilgrims.For the past year, Israeli-Palestinian fighting has surged in the occupied West Bank. At least 86 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli or settler gunfire this year, according to an Associated Press tally. Palestinian attacks against Israelis have killed 15 people in the same period. Israel says most of those killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting police incursions and people not involved in the confrontations have also been killed.",2023/04/02,111,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853475,Trump indictment ends decades of perceived invincibility,"NEW YORK (AP) — When Donald Trump steps before a judge this coming week to be arraigned in a New York courtroom, it will not only mark the first time a former U.S. president has faced criminal charges. It will also be a reckoning for a man long nicknamed “Teflon Don,” who until now has managed to skirt serious legal jeopardy despite 40 years of legal scrutiny.Trump, who is the early front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is expected to turn himself in Tuesday. He faces charges including at least one felony offense related to hush money payments to women during his 2016 campaign. Like any other person facing trial, he will be booked, fingerprinted and photographed before being given the chance to enter a plea.The spectacle that is sure to unfold will mark an unprecedented moment in American history that will demonstrate once again how dramatically Trump — who already held the distinction of being the first president to be impeached twice — has upended democratic norms. But on a personal level, the indictment pierces the cloak of invincibility that seemed to follow Trump through his decades in business and in politics, as he faced allegations of fraud, collusion and sexual misconduct.“Boy, after all this time it’s a bit of a shock,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio said of the indictment. “You know I always thought of him as the Gingerbread Man, shouting, ‘You can’t catch me!’ as he ran away.”“Given his track record,” he said, “I had trouble imagining he would ever be held accountable.”“These are not things that Donald Trump ever thought in his entire life, nor I, for that matter, that he would ever be confronted with,” Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime fixer and a key witness in the case who served jail time for the payments, told CNN.Of course, some of the celebration by Trump's detractors may be premature. Trump could seek to have a judge quickly dismiss the case. Even if it moves forward, there's no guarantee of conviction. Intensifying investigations in Atlanta and Washington are seen as potentially more serious legal threats.Still, Trump and his team were caught by surprise when word of the New York indictment broke Thursday evening, following news reports that the grand jury hearing the case was set for a weekslong hiatus. As the deliberations dragged on, some in Trump's orbit had become convinced that the case had stalled and that charges might never be brought. That included Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina, who said Friday morning he had hoped the “rule of law would prevail.”Trump, he said on the “Today"" show, was “initially was shocked” by news of the charges, but quickly pivoted to his usual pushback playbook.“After he got over that,"" he said, Trump ""put a notch on his belt and he decided we have to fight now. And he got into a typical Donald Trump posture where he’s ready to be combative on something that he believes is an injustice. ... I think he’s now in the posture that he’s ready to fight this.”In the meantime, Trump and his team have tried to use the news to his advantage, hoping to energize his loyal base by painting the investigation as part of a larger plot to derail his candidacy.Already, the charges have been a boon to his struggling fundraising. The campaign announced Friday evening that it had raised over $4 million in the 24 hours after the indictment became public, far smashing its previous record after the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.More than 25% of donations, according to the campaign, came from first-time donors. The average contribution: $34.His campaign also continued to blast out supportive statements from dozens of top Republicans who have rallied behind Trump, including several of his declared and likely challengers, underscoring his continued hold on the party.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, in a speech Saturday to conservatives meeting in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, accused the Democratic prosecutor in New York, Alvin Bragg, of weaponizing the law “for political purposes” in bringing a case against “a former president.” DeSantis said the district attorney had indicted “a former president on misdemeanor offenses” that he was “straining to try to convert into felonies.”Trump has been in contact by phone with key congressional allies, including members of House leadership and top committees, according to people familiar with the conversations, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the response.Trump ally Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., who formally endorsed the former president Friday, said Trump “doesn’t back down"" and was going to ""fight back,"" telling a local radio show it was ""yet another chapter where Donald Trump is going to come back on top in the end.""The media maelstrom has catapulted Trump back into the spotlight he craves, at least temporarily limiting attention being paid to his rivals, including DeSantis, who is widely expected to challenge Trump for the nomination, and has been holding events across the county to promote his book.Trump aides have been discussing other ideas to maximize the situation, including the possibility of holding a press event either before or after the arraignment. Trump is expected to travel from Florida to New York on Monday and stay overnight at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan before heading to the courthouse early Tuesday. He will return to Florida after the arraignment.Trump has long denied that he had a sexual encounter with the porn actor known as Stormy Daniels and has blasted Bragg for pursuing the years-old case.Trump is also facing continued investigations in Georgia, over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and in Washington, where a special counsel is probing the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as well as Trump's handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and potential obstruction of the investigation.But Sam Nunberg, a longtime former aide who broke with Trump years ago, said that while he no longer supports Trump, he believes the Manhattan case is “a waste of time,"" given the allegations, which remain under seal. And he said he was skeptical it would ultimately matter.“It doesn’t surprise me,"" he said of the indictment. “What would surprise me is if he actually ended up behind bars in prison and I don’t see that happening.”D’Antonio said that sentiment — and a continued belief that Trump will somehow prevail and dodge the charges — continues among the many people who have reached out to him in the last 24 hours, despite the charges.“They're like, he's going to get away with it,"" he said. ""Somehow, he’s going to get it thrown out.”___This story has been corrected to reflect that Trump Tower is in midtown Manhattan, not lower Manhattan.",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853476,Taliban close women-run Afghan station for playing music,"JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AP) — A women-run radio station in Afghanistan’s northeast has been shut down for playing music during the holy month of Ramadan, a Taliban official said Saturday.Sadai Banowan, which means women’s voice in Dari, is Afghanistan’s only women-run station and started 10 years ago. It has eight staff, six of them female.Moezuddin Ahmadi, the director for Information and Culture in Badakhshan province, said the station violated the “laws and regulations of the Islamic Emirate” several times by broadcasting songs and music during Ramadan and was shuttered because of the breach.“If this radio station accepts the policy of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and gives a guarantee that it will not repeat such a thing again, we will allow it to operate again,” said Ahmadi.Station head Najia Sorosh denied there was any violation, saying there was no need for the closure and called it a conspiracy. The Taliban ""told us that you have broadcast music. We have not broadcast any kind of music,” she said.Sorosh said at 11:40 a.m. on Thursday representatives from the Ministry of Information and Culture and the Vice and Virtue Directorate arrived at the station and shut it down. She said station staff have contacted Vice and Virtue but officials there said they do not have any additional information about the closing.Many journalists lost their jobs after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. Media outlets closed over lack of funds or because staff left the country, according to the Afghan Independent Journalists Association.The Taliban have barred women from most forms of employment and education beyond the sixth grade, including university. There is no official ban on music. During their previous rule in the late 1990s, the Taliban barred most television, radio and newspapers in the country.",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853477,Pop icon Leslie Cheung's legacy endures 20 years after death,"HONG KONG (AP) — Fans of late Canto-pop icon Leslie Cheung, one of the first singers to come out as gay in Hong Kong, flocked to the city this week to commemorate their idol’s death 20 years ago — revisiting his legacy of pioneering work made during a socially conservative time.Cheung, who was 46 when he died, was a superstar known for his singing, dancing and acting during the heyday of Hong Kong's entertainment industry in the 1980s and ’90s. His supporters, who span across Asia, fondly remembered his norm-breaking works and called him “ahead of time.""The 20th anniversary of Cheung's death on Saturday drew crowds of both local fans and supporters from mainland China to visit exhibitions about him in Hong Kong. Even the government included concerts and film screenings about him in the city's first pop culture festival, which is slated to officially kick off in three weeks.Outside of the official exhibits, a steady stream of fans visited the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where Cheung had killed himself. The narrow strip of pavement next to the hotel was completely covered by a sea of flowers, cards, origami and posters.The local reminiscences of Cheung prove the late celebrity remains a popular icon across generations of Hong Kongers and reflects the desire for reviving the city's cultural influence, said Anthony Fung, professor of the school of journalism and communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.“After so many years, we hardly find any new icons, new superstars who could reach that level of importance,” he said.Cheung, who was affectionately known as Gor Gor — “big brother” in Cantonese — produced many hits that even non-Cantonese speaking music lovers in other parts of Asia could sing along to. Those include “Monica,” “Sleepless Nights Restless Heart” and “Chase.” He also starred in classic films including John Woo’s “A Better Tomorrow,” Wong Kar-wai’s “Happy Together,” Stanley Kwan's “Rouge” and Chen Kaige’s “Farewell My Concubine.”But behind all of his success, Cheung suffered from depression. He jumped to his death from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in central Hong Kong on April 1 in 2003, sending shockwaves across the city. His death came as his hometown was battling the SARS epidemic, which ultimately killed hundreds and crippled the local economy.“We really miss him. His songs and films take us back to the wonderful time of Hong Kong which is not the same as nowadays. We’ll miss it,” said Justin Cho, a fan from the city who came with his friend to lay flowers at the hotel in honor of the actor.Hong Kong fan Connie Leung, a retiree now in her 60s, recalled her disbelief when she first heard about the news of his death from a former colleague. “I said ‘don’t make such a joke on April Fools’ Day',” she said.She said Cheung's songs never became outdated and his fashion tastes, including his iconic long hair, were modern — even by today's standards.Chris Choi, Cheung's concert choreographer in the 2000s, said the late superstar broke through many gender boundaries by introducing “unisex” ideas, some of which were risky at the time. Among his stage costumes, for example, were seashell culottes and red high heels.“It told people art has no boundaries,” he said.Cheung also broke through the city's cultural status quo by boldly revealing his gay relationship in a conservative local society at that time— a decision that could have ruined his career but has earned him a lot of respect from the gay community, Fung said. The breakthrough was about the plurality of culture that he celebrated, he said.“He actually crossed through the boundary, make a noise and influence on the culture of Hong Kong,” Fung said.Cheung's work not only inspired older generations of fans but also those who were just toddlers when he died.University student Justin Jiang said he was only 3 years old when Cheung died, but he later became a fan in high school after learning more about Cheung's personality and charisma from his legacy of works. This week, the 22-year-old, who lives in neighboring Guangzhou, visited Hong Kong with a friend to pay tribute to his idol.He praised Cheung's boldness in expressing his views and breaking through a society strongly influenced by gender stereotypes years ago.“Gor Gor is very courageous and this is worth learning for us,"" he said.",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853478,"Small areas reopen near Fukushima nuclear plant, few return","TOKYO (AP) — Evacuation orders were lifted in small sections of a Japanese town just southwest of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant on Saturday, in time for the area’s popular cherry blossom season, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida joined a ceremony to mark the reopening.The area of about 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) where entry restrictions were lifted is part of Tomioka town, most of which had already been reopened since an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered triple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Former residents and visitors celebrated the latest reopening as they strolled along a street known as “the cherry blossoms tunnel.”Koichi Ono, 75, was back to the neighborhood where he grew up and lived all his life until he was forced to evacuate. “After 12 years, I can finally return to my life here,"" he told NHK television. “The disaster hit when I was just starting my retirement life, so I'm starting all over again.”Ono, who learned indigo and vegetable dying while evacuating, wants to open a workshop to serve as a meeting place for people. “I hope more people come and visit.”At the ceremony, Kishida pledged to keep working to reopen all no-go zones.“The lifting of the evacuation is by no means a final goal, but the start of the recovery,” Kishida said.The 2011 disaster caused massive amounts of radiation to leak from the plant, and more than 160,000 residents had to evacuate from across Fukushima, including about 30,000 who are still unable to return home.Tomioka is one of 12 nearby towns fully or partially designated as no-go zones. The two sections in Tomioka that reopened for the first time in 12 years represent one-fifth of the worst-hit no-go zone and were selected by the government along with several other locations in the region for intensive decontamination.But jobs, daily necessities and infrastructure remain insufficient, making it difficult for younger people to return, and families with small children worry about possible radiation effects.""The living environment and many other things still need to be sorted out,” Tomioka Mayor Ikuo Yamamoto told reporters.In the newly reopened Yonomori and Osuge districts of Tomioka, just over 50 of about 2,500 registered residents have reportedly returned or expressed intention to go back to live. Only about 10% of the town’s pre-disaster population of 16,000 have returned since large areas of Tomioka reopened in 2017.Town surveys show a majority of former residents say they have decided not to return because they have already found jobs and educations and built relationships elsewhere.The evacuation order was lifted in several sections of another hard-hit town, Namie, northwest of the plant, on Friday. The reopened area accounts for only about 20% of the town.“I have mixed feelings because there are many residents who still cannot return or have no idea when they can return,"" said Namie Mayor Eiko Yoshida at an evacuation-lifting ceremony on Friday.",2023/04/02,,World

FAU was ahead 71-70, making Butler’s game-winning buzzer-beater the first in Final Four history in which the winning team was trailing before the shot.Which means FAU will be remembered alongside UCLA and North Carolina as victims of some of the most crushing last-second losses this tournament has seen. But this one might go down as the most heartbreaking of all.“The hardest part is there's no next ... the sadness is just that we don't get to do it again tomorrow,” FAU coach Dusty May said.But May believes this team will be remembered for much more than Saturday's devastating exit.“These guys have created memories and a legacy for a lifetime,” he said. “People will be talking about this group for the next 50 to 100 years.”FAU's Jalen Gaffney recalled the shot just minutes after it fell to send his team home.“He ended up shooting a tough 2, which we like so we’ll live with the result. … It’s just basketball, (expletive) happens sometimes. He made a good shot and we’ve got to live with it.”For so long, it didn’t look like it would go that way.Gaffney made a 3-pointer to put the Owls ahead 26-24 with 7:25 left in the first half. FAU didn’t trail again until the buzzer.The Owls were up by 9 with 11 minutes to go after testing San Diego State's vaunted defense like no one had in this tournament before the Aztecs started chipping away at the lead.The Aztecs got within 2 for the first time with about 10 minutes to go and tied it with 4 1/2 minutes left.Giancarlo Rosado put the Owls back on top with a fadeaway jumper seconds later, but they didn't make another field goal until Martin's layup made it 71-68 with 45 seconds left.Jaedon LeDee hit a jumper to cut FAU's lead to 1 with 36 seconds left.Johnell Davis missed a layup with nine seconds left that would have padded the lead.Nathan Mensah grabbed a rebound before Butler's jumper swished through the net at the buzzer to end this Cinderella's dream season.But Boyd insisted this won't be the last time these Owls get a chance to shine in the madness of March.“You're going to hear from FAU again,"" he said. “You're going to see us in the same position, and it's going to be a different outcome, I promise you.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World

He became the first Yankees player to steal a base in each of his first two games since Fritz Maisel in 1913. No major leaguer had accomplished the feat since Billy Hamilton in 2013.“Everything with the clock now happens pretty fast,” Volpe said. “I was trying to focus on if there was any opportunity to steal a base and take it.”In the sixth, Estrada hit a liner to Volpe, who charged in and had the ball go off the heel of his glove. Volpe was unable to get the force at second as Brandon Crawford scored to put the Giants up 5-3.“It was a tough one,” Volpe said. “Probably keep me up at night thinking about that. I definitely feel like I should have had it. It was on me.”Volpe grew up a Yankees fan in Manhattan before his family moved to New Jersey when he was in the fourth grade. He attended Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey, and was selected by the Yankees with the 30th overall pick in the 2019 amateur draft.He earned the shortstop job during spring training after just 22 games of Triple-A experience. He reacted for the second straight game to the Bleacher Creatures chanting his name during the Roll Call. Volpe turned toward the right field seats, raised his glove hand in tribute and with his right hand lifted the interlocking “NY” crest of his jersey to his lips.“A whirlwind but the best type of whirlwind,” Volpe said. “It’s been amazing.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 39 saves.“Good team win all around,” Tuch said.Morgan Frost scored twice for Philadelphia, and Travis Konecny also had a goal in his return to the lineup after a 16-game absence due to an upper-body injury. Felix Sandstrom had 23 saves.The loss officially eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs. They entered with the seventh-fewest points in the NHL.The Sabres turned the contest with four goals in under four minutes over the first and second periods.“It was fun to watch,” Buffalo coach Don Granato said.Okposo finished a 2-on-1 with a shot over Sandstrom’s glove side to tie the score at 1-all with 9.3 seconds left in the first period.The Sabres then erupted for three goals in 2:21 early in the second.Tuch got his first of the contest 1:25 into the period with a wrist shot from the slot over Sandstrom’s right shoulder after a drop pass from Mittelstadt to give Buffalo the lead. Greenway made it 3-1 when he scored on a rebound 75 seconds later. and Skinner capped the frantic scoring sequence by following his own miss to put the Sabres up 4-1 at 3:46.“We got a little loose,” said Flyers assistant coach Brad Shaw, who directed the team. “That short window, in retrospect, we pretty much gave the game away.”Tuch notched his second of the contest with 3:58 to play in the middle period with a wrister over Sandstrom’s blocker to make it 5-1.Frost got his second of the night 22 seconds later as he beat two defenders before shooting past Luukkonen.Konecny got his 28th to pull the Flyers within two at 5:11 of the third, but Tuch finished his hat trick with 3:27 remaining when he deked past Sandstrom from close range and got his 35th of the season.“I probably should’ve buried one before that,” Tuch said. “That felt really good.”Frost got Philadelphia on the board with 3:25 left in the first.NOTES: Buffalo leading scorer Tage Thompson (upper body) missed his third consecutive game. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853510,"Butler has 35, Miami gets needed win over Dallas, 129-122","MIAMI (AP) — Miami was desperate. So was Dallas.Jimmy Butler and the Heat had just enough to help their playoff position — while dealing the Mavericks a big blow.Butler had 35 points and 12 assists, Cody Zeller added 20 points and the Heat held off the Mavericks 129-122 on Saturday night to snap a three-game losing streak.Max Strus and Kevin Love each scored 18 and Tyler Herro added 15 for the Heat. Miami won despite allowing Dallas to shoot a season-best 61%.“I wouldn't necessarily have drawn it up this way,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.Luka Doncic was brilliant again for Dallas, finishing with 42 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Tim Hardaway Jr. had 31 points and Kyrie Irving added 23 points and eight assists for the Mavericks.“A win is a win,” Butler said. “I don't like the fact that they shot 61%. But I do like the fact that we finally won a game.”The Mavs had been 7-0 this season when shooting at least 54%, and fell to 30-2 all-time, including playoffs, in games where they shot at least 60%.“Our defense was nonexistent,” Dallas coach Jason Kidd said. “Couldn't get stops.”Both clubs went to the conference finals last season; the Heat are trying to get out of the play-in round, and the Mavericks are trying to just have a shot at the playoffs.The win moves Miami (41-37) closer to securing no worse than the No. 7 seed and most advantageous spot in the Eastern Conference play-in tournament. The Heat are now 2 1/2 games ahead of both No. 8 Atlanta (38-39) and No. 9 Toronto (also 38-39).Miami moved within 1 1/2 games of No. 6 Brooklyn (42-35). Even if the Heat win out and finish with 45 wins, the Nets — who hold the head-to-head tiebreaker — would only need to go 3-2 in their final five games to ensure they would finish ahead of Miami.Meanwhile, it’s a big blow to Dallas (37-41).The Mavs fell a full game back of No. 10 Oklahoma City (38-40) in the race for the last Western Conference play-in spot, and worse, the Thunder own the head-to-head tiebreaker. Dallas is now two games back of No. 9 Minnesota (39-39) and just a half-game ahead of No. 12 Utah (36-41).“Just got to play hard, play with desperation and anything can happen,” Hardaway said. “Anything can happen.”Miami changed its starting lineup, partly out of necessity. Center Bam Adebayo didn’t play because of a right hip contusion, so Zeller — starting a game for the first time since May 15, 2021, for Charlotte — took his spot and Strus took the forward starting spot that had been held by Love since he joined the Heat in February.The moves paid immediate dividends. Strus was 3 for 3, all 3-pointers, in his first shift. Love was 3 for 3 from the field and 6 for 6 from the line for 13 points in his first 8 minutes off the bench, and Zeller had 12 points by halftime.“K-Love is always, always has been about winning,” Butler said. “As long as we win, he's not going to complain.”It all helped add up to the third highest-scoring first half in Heat history: Miami led 76-64 at the break, stretched the lead to 18 in the second half — then had to hang on in the final moments anyway.TIP-INSMavericks: Dallas' string of three consecutive winning regular seasons will end. The best the Mavs can finish is 41-41. ... The Mavs fell to 5-16 in games where they allow more than 100 points. ... Dallas had one offensive rebound.Heat: Butler’s 16 first-quarter points were his second-most in any quarter this season. He had 17 in the third quarter against Milwaukee on Feb. 4. … Miami will finish with a record of at least .500 for the fourth consecutive year and the 24th time in its 35 seasons.WHAT’S LEFTDallas plays its final road game of the regular season at Atlanta on Sunday, then finishes with home games against Sacramento, Chicago and San Antonio.Miami starts a trip to Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington on Tuesday, before finishing at home April 9 against Orlando.UP NEXTMavericks: Visit Atlanta on Sunday.Heat: Visit Detroit on Tuesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

We’ll have to keep grinding.”Michael Hutchinson stopped 42 shots for Columbus, which was shut out for the fifth time this season and has lost four straight. The Blue Jackets are tied with Chicago for the worst record in the NHL.Florida dominated from the start, using a power-play score from Reinhart, his team-leading 15th of the season, and a goal from Verhaeghe for a 2-0 lead after the first 20 minutes.Verhaeghe took charge of the second period, making it 3-0 after 18 seconds and completing a natural hat trick, the third of his career, just over six minutes later.“It was a solid effort start to finish,” Verhaeghe said. “Everyone played well, all four lines played well. (Lyon) was great back there. It was awesome. It was a good team effort. We want to keep it going the next few games.”Cousins made it 5-0 at 8:34 of the third before Verhaeghe added his team-leading 40th.Staal made it 7-0 with 5:44 left.“We had some moments early but they scored easy, as far as some of their goals, and they got to kind of rolling there, and then we were chasing,” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said. “It wasn’t a good recipe.”FOUR SCOREVerhaeghe is the third player in Panthers history to have a four game, joining Pavel Bure (twice) and Mark Parrish.MILESTONE MANTkachuk's 64th assist of the season is the most by an active player in their first season with a franchise, surpassing Sidney Crosby and Artemi Panarin, both with 63.MINUS MANBlue Jackets defenseman Andrew Peeke was a minus-6 for the game, a franchise record.SICK AND INJUREDFlorida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky missed his third consecutive game dealing with a non-COVID illness.

(AP) — Andrei Vasilevskiy made 38 saves, Nikita Kucherov and Steven Stamkos scored 1:48 apart midway through the second period, and the Tampa Bay Lightning earned their sixth straight playoff berth with a 5-0 win over the New York Islanders on Saturday night.Tampa Bay will play Toronto in the first round of the postseason. The Maple Leafs hold a four-point advantage, with two games at-hand, over Tampa Bay for home-ice advantage.“Obviously it gives us peace of mind,” Vasilevskiy said of making the playoffs. “It gives us some more confidence moving forward.”The Lightning, who have appeared in the Stanley Cup Final each of the past three years and won back to back in 2020 and 2021, have reached the playoffs in nine of coach Jon Cooper’s 10 full-seasons with the team.“You have no chance to win the Stanley Cup unless you make the playoffs,” Cooper said.Mikhail Sergachev, Tanner Jeannot and Brayden Point also scored for the Lightning.Sergachev left in the third after hurting his right leg. Cooper had no update on Sergachev’s status postgame.Vasilevskiy has two shutouts in his last three game and four overall this season. He has allowed one goal during Tampa Bay's three-game winning streak.“I think what you're seeing is we're helping him out more,” Cooper said. “He's super human, but he's still human. You can't give some of the chances we've given up on rushes and things like that. When you start cutting those out, Vasy usually takes care of the rest.”The Islanders hold a two-point lead over Florida for the top wild card in the Eastern Conference.“The second (period) was garbage,” Islanders captain Anders Lee said. “It's missed assignments. Little things that we haven't been doing lately, and then they take advantage of them.”New York goalie Ilya Sorokin was pulled with 8:15 left in the second after allowing four goals on 21 shots. He is 0-4 against the Lightning.Point's power-play goal in the third period was his 48th this season, and joined Stamkos (36 in 2011-12) as the only Tampa Bay players to have 30 goals at home during a single season.Jeannot’s goal came in the left wing’s 18th game with Tampa Bay after being acquired from Nashville.Kucherov had a breakaway goal 9:57 into the second before Stamkos made it 4-0 and ended Sorokin’s night at 11:45.Stamkos tied Islanders Hall of Famer Denis Potvin for the 75th on the career point list with 1,052. The center has 514 goals, which is one away from tying Pierre Turgeon for 40th place.Sergachev had a first-period goal, while Jeannot scored early in the second.Darren Raddysh and Point both had two assists. It was Raddysh's first NHL points, coming in his 16th career game.INJURED ISLANDERSIslanders general manager Lou Lamoriello said C Mathew Barzal, who hasn’t played since leaving a game at Boston on Feb. 18 with a lower-body injury, is ready to resume staking.“Him skating is extremely positive, and then we just go from there,” Lamoriello said. “How long it takes, I couldn’t tell you.”RW Oliver Wahlstrom, injured on Dec. 27, is out for the rest of the season due to a lower-body injury.

New Jersey’s leading scorer, 21-year-old Jack Hughes, added two assists.Andreas Athanasiou had a goal and assist for last-place Chicago in its eighth straight loss. Tyler Johnson scored for the third straight game and rookie Lukas Reichel deflected in a goal.Longtime Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews returned from two-month medical leave of absence.The 34-yeare-old Toews took the opening faceoff for Chicago as he appeared in a game for the first time since Jan. 28 at Edmonton. He set up Athanasiou’s goal in the third period.“Definitely finding my way a little bit,” Toews said. “I think the first period was rough. That’s a fast team, a fast game.”Toews made a statement through the team Feb. 19 saying he would be stepping away because of the effects of Chronic Immune Response Syndrome and “long COVID.”Toews was back on the ice with teammates in a practice session on Tuesday, but didn’t commit to returning this season and hinted at retirement. His eight-year, $84 million contract is set to expire at the end of the season.The Blackhawks stayed close into the second period. Then the speedy Devils picked up the pace late in the second to take the lead and pull away.New Jersey has started slow and finished with flash before, coach Lindy Ruff said.“We've had a lot of games when the first period hasn't been our quickest, we haven't played our quickest,” Ruff said. ""We gained a lot of momentum in that second period and carried it into the third.“It's one area that I'd like our team to improve in, is its mentality in the first 10 minutes of a game.”Meier agrees.“Obviously not happy the way we started the game, I started the game,” Meier said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853554,No more room for vroom? Paris votes on banishing e-scooters,"PARIS (AP) — The wheels may be about to come off Paris' ubiquitous for-hire electric scooters.Zipping around the City of Light on one of them, wind in the hair, or romantically but naughtily e-scooting à deux on one machine when the gendarmes aren't looking could soon be over if Parisians vote Sunday to do away with the 15,000 opinion-dividing micro-vehicles.The question City Hall is asking in a citywide mini-referendum is: “For or against self-service scooters in Paris?""The answer could doom a leading market for the swift two-wheelers that have expanded locomotion choices in the French capital and other urban centers and towns around the world.Scattered around Paris, easy to locate and hire with a downloadable app and relatively cheap, the scooters are a hit with tourists who love their speed and the help-yourself freedom they offer. In the five years since their introduction, following in the wake of shared cars and shared bicycles, for-hire scooters have also built a following among Parisians who don't want or can't afford their own but like the option to escape the Metro and other public transport.But amid complaints that e-scooters are an eyesore and a traffic menace, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and some of her deputies want to banish the “free floating” flotilla — so called because scooters are picked up and dropped off at their renters' whim — on safety, public nuisance and cost-benefit grounds before the capital hosts the Olympic Games next year.Paris' deputy mayor for transport, David Belliard, says the scooters have been involved in hundreds of accidents. He also says they are more environmentally damaging than walking or riding a bike or bus, and too speedy and anarchic in a crowded, compact and historic city where space is at a premium.They create “a feeling of overall insecurity in the public space, notably for the most vulnerable people, I’m thinking of seniors or people with disabilities,” he said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press. “There are a few benefits but what I see today is that the costs are greater.”Paris' contracts with the three rental companies — Dott, Lime and TIER — expire at the end of August. Whether for-hire e-scooters survive in Paris beyond that will depend on Sunday's poll that's open to all of the city's registered voters, including those from other European Union countries.“Whatever the result, we will respect it,"" Belliard pledged. Hidalgo has promised likewise and said that she, too, hopes Parisians will vote against the scooters.Scooter critics say the machines are particularly dangerous in the hands of tourists who don't know how to navigate Paris' frenetic, honk-honk, get-out-of-my-way traffic and the many users who flout the rules and risk fines by riding two to a scooter and by mounting sidewalks, sometimes barreling through pedestrians.“I regularly, in fact pretty much all the time, see tourists riding them in pairs, people who often are oblivious to what they are doing, who aren’t in control of the scooter,” says Raphael Sicat, an IT manager who commutes on an electric monocycle to his Paris office. He says he often sees crashes involving for-hire scooters on his 40-kilometer (25-mile) round trip.Swiss tourist Ler Detelj loves the adrenaline rush.“It's fast and it's easy and it's cool,"" she said as she and two friends took scooters for a whirl from the foot of the Eiffel Tower.The three scooter operators say they transported nearly 2 million people in the city last year and that 71% of Parisian users are under 35. They've used social media influencers, some of them paid, and messages on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok in a get-out-the-vote drive targeting that age group. They are also offering a free round-trip ride Sunday on their scooters or electric bikes to users who enter the words “Je vote"" — I vote in French — into their apps.Garance Lefèvre, a director of public policy for one of the operators, Lime, says women and LGBTQ+ people value the scooters as a safe mode of late-night travel and that the two-wheelers have generally become ingrained in Parisian habits. The city has “really raised the standards for the entire industry,"" she said, and operators have created “durable and responsible jobs.""“Paris has been the pioneer in terms of welcoming shared micro-mobility,"" she says. “Paris would really be an outlier if it decided to put an end to the service.”___Masha Macpherson in Paris contributed.",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853556,UConn puts Final Four beatdown on Miami 72-59,"HOUSTON (AP) — Nobody was guarding UConn’s best player. So Adama Sanogo spun the ball to get his fingers just right, set his feet behind the 3-point line and splashed in the shot. Then, less than a minute later, he did it again.It was as much basketball clinic as highlight video — and all of it perfectly fitting for the Huskies, who are methodically steamrolling through a March Madness bracket that has been a free-for-all everywhere else.UConn doled out another drama-free beatdown Saturday, getting 21 points and 10 rebounds from Sanogo to dispatch Miami 72-59 and move one win from the school’s fifth national title.“There's a lot of teams that want to play Monday,” Sanogo said. “It means a lot to us.”Jordan Hawkins overcame his stomach bug and scored 13 for the Huskies, who came into this most unexpected Final Four as the only team with any experience on college basketball’s final weekend and with the best seeding of the four teams in Houston — at No. 4.Against fifth-seeded Miami, they were the best team on the court from beginning to end. Starting with three straight 3s — one jumper from Hawkins and two of those set shots from Sanogo — UConn took a quick 9-0 lead and never trailed.“This is something that I worked on all summer, especially shooting,” Sanogo said.On Monday in the title game, the Huskies will face San Diego State, which became the first team to hit a buzzer-beater while trailing in a Final Four game for a 72-71 victory over Florida Atlantic. UConn was an early 7 1/2-point favorite, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.“They’re one of the best teams in the country,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said of the Aztecs. ""And I think it’s fitting that both of us kind of earned our way into this title game.”But while the early game was an all-timer, the nightcap was simply more of the same from the Huskies (30-8).The 13-point win was UConn's closest since the brackets came out. The Huskies are the sixth team since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 to reach the title game with five straight double-digit victories. It's an impressive list of behemoths with a knack for closing: Four of the first five went on to win the championship.Some thought Miami (29-8), with the nation's fifth-ranked offense and four players who have scored 20 points at least three times this season, might be the team to slow this Huskies juggernaut. Not to be.Isaiah Wong led the ’Canes with 15 points on 4-for-10 shooting. Harassed constantly by Sanogo, 7-foot-2 Donovan Clingan and the rest of Connecticut's long-armed, rangy perimeter players, Miami, which came in with the nation's fifth-best offense, shot 25% in the first half and 33.3% for the game.""Obviously what we tried to do not only didn’t work, I couldn’t even recognize it,"" Miami coach Jim Larranaga said. “Offensively we were out of sync, but defensively we were too.”Not that UConn was all boring. The Huskies enjoyed their own sort of buzzer-beater in the form of a 3 from Alex Karaban that sent the Huskies jogging into the locker room with a 13-point lead at halftime.They built it to 20 before the first TV timeout of the second half. By then, Jim Nantz, calling his last Final Four, could start saving his voice for Monday.Miami did get it under double digits a few times, but this never got interesting.Not helping: Hurricanes guard Nijel Pack missed about five minutes after managers had trouble locating a substitute for a busted shoe. Pack finished with eight points, and Jordan Miller, who hit all 20 shots he took from the floor and the line in Miami’s Elite Eight win, went 4 for 10 for 11 points. Only one Miami player made more than half his shots.“I’m a defensive guy first and foremost,"" Hurley said. “I just love the way we guarded them. They’re one of the best offenses in the country, and we really disrupted them.”UConn had five blocks, including two from Sanogo, and 19 assists, led by eight from Tristen Newton — both signs of the sort of all-around effort the Huskies have been putting in since the start of February, when they began the bounce back from a six-loss-in-eight-games stretch that halted their momentum.That cold stretch is a big reason they were seeded only fourth for March. Now, it’s April and the number UConn is thinking about is “5” — as in, a fifth title that will come if it can keep this up for one more game.“Maybe it was a little bit delusional,"" Huskies guard Andre Jackson Jr. said, ""but we always knew we were the best team in our mind.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853558,March Madness: San Diego State to meet UConn in title game,"HOUSTON (AP) — Lamont Butler hit the biggest shot in San Diego State history, putting the Aztecs in the national championship game for the first time.The next step, in Monday's title game, will be a difficult one.UConn has been the dominant team all through the bracket, delivering one beatdown after another while showing no weaknesses — even on a short turnaround.The Huskies snatched the euphoria right out of Gonzaga last week in the Elite Eight, ruining the Zags' vibes after their last-second win over UCLA two days earlier. Baylor did the same thing to Gonzaga in the 2021 national title game, bullying the Zags two days after Jalen Suggs' miracle shot.“We don't stop,” UConn guard Jordan Hawkins said after scoring 13 points against Miami on Saturday night. “We keep putting our foot on their neck. We have a really tough team.”The Huskies got to the title game by breaking their opponents' will.UConn won its first four NCAA Tournament games by at least 15 points and wrecked Miami’s first Final Four appearance by dominating the Hurricanes at both ends in a 72-59 win.The Aztecs have done it with defense.San Diego State shut down four straight NCAA Tournament opponents and leaned on its D in the second half to overcome a 14-point deficit to ruin Florida Atlantic’s first Final Four. Butler provided the heroics, hitting a buzzer-beater in the 72-71 win that had all of San Diego celebrating.The first buzzer-beating game-winner by a trailing team in Final Four history now puts the Aztecs within a win of the Mountain West Conference's first national title.“I don’t consider ourselves a mid-major,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “I think we’re a high-major program.”UConn (30-8) will be vying for its fifth national title since 1999, but first since Dan Hurley was hired to bring back the program after its fall from grace.UConn won its fourth title under Kevin Ollie in 2014, but spiraled downward in the wake of recruiting violations and Ollie's ugly departure.When Hurley took over in 2018, UConn was 170th on the KenPom analytics rankings and low on the national relevance scale.The knock on Hurley’s Huskies then turned to UConn's meager Marches; two first-round NCAA Tournament burnouts, including to No. 12 seed New Mexico State last year.UConn had an uneven 2022-23 season, climbing to No. 2 in the AP Top 25, tumbling back toward irrelevance with six losses in eight games.The Huskies turned into the best team in the maddest of Marches that culminated in the most unexpected Final Four, putting them in position to tie Duke and Indiana for fourth on the all-time championships list.""The group has shown their quality so many times in terms of the level that we could play at,” Hurley said. “And I think we experienced everything in that month of January, it’s a battle-tested team.”For San Diego State (32-6), Monday's title game will be the culmination of the program building Steve Fisher started and Dutcher pushed forward.Fisher had built San Diego State into a mid-major power, leading them to six straight NCAA Tournaments. When he retired in 2017, the reins were handed to Dutcher, his assistant back to Michigan’s national championship with the Fab Five in 1989.Dutcher kept many of the same principles Fisher had, adding an extra dash of defensive devilry.San Diego State appeared ready to break through in 2020, on its way to a likely No. 1 seed before the pandemic wiped out the NCAA Tournament.The Aztecs suffered first-round NCAA Tournament flameouts the next two seasons before becoming defensive dominators this year.San Diego State was fourth in the KenPom.com defensive efficiency ratings while winning 27 games during the regular season. The Aztecs took it to new lows in the NCAA Tournament, holding their first four opponents to 57 points per game and 17% shooting from the 3-point arc.Upstart FAU appeared to have solved San Diego State’s defense in the first half of Saturday night’s first semifinal, stretching its lead to 14 midway through the second half.The Aztecs got back to being dirty (in a good way) to get back in it and Butler finished if off with one of the most memorable shots in NCAA Tournament history.“We’re going to the national championship,” Butler said. “That’s not things many people do.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853559,"Thompson, Kershaw spark Dodgers to 10-1 win over D-backs","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Trayce Thompson not only took out his frustrations on a left-hander, he helped one as well with a career night to spark the Los Angeles Dodgers to an easy victory.Thompson hit three home runs, including a grand slam in his first at-bat of the season, and had a career-high eight RBIs as the Dodgers rolled to a 10-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He's the first player to drive in eight or more runs in a season debut since the RBI became an official statistic in 1920.The offensive outburst came in support of lefty Clayton Kershaw, who got the best of an old personal rival as Los Angeles beat Arizona for the 16th time in the last 22 meetings. Kershaw earned the victory opposite Arizona’s Madison Bumgarner, with the left-handers facing each other for the 12th time.After struggling to hit left-handed pitching as a platoon player last season, with the right-handed hitting Thompson batting .174 with a .621 OPS against lefties, his first-inning grand slam off Bumgarner felt like an exclamation point.Was it satisfying since the struggles were a topic of conversation in the spring?“Not necessarily because I know I can do it,” said Thompson, the brother of Golden State star Klay Thomoson and son of former NBA player Mychal Thompson. “It’s just a good way to start the year. It’s still early. You still have to wake up tomorrow and go out and help this team win a game but I know I can do it.”Kershaw (1-0) gave up one run on four hits with no walks and nine strikeouts in an efficient 76 pitches over his first start of 2023. Bumgarner (0-1) gave up five runs on four hits with four walks and two strikeouts in four innings (85 pitches). Each pitchers’ team has won six times in the all-time meetings.“I have a lot of respect for Bum,” Kershaw said. “We’ve done it a lot now and we’re still trying to do it. I think there is a level of respect on both sides that it’s fun to compete against (each other) and we’ll probably do it again here in a few days (at Arizona).”Thompson’s grand slam came in a five-run first inning for the Dodgers before he added a three-run shot in the fifth inning.“I couldn’t be happier for Trayce; it was really cool,” Kershaw said. “That’s a good month right there. He can sit on that for a while. But he’s the best, man, so I’m happy for him and it’s a great way to get going for the season.”Christian Walker hit a home run for the Diamondbacks, the fifth of his career against Kershaw.The Dodgers wasted little time jumping on Bumgarner. Mookie Betts opened the bottom of the first with a double, Freddie Freeman singled and Max Muncy was hit by a slow curveball to load the bases. Chris Taylor’s sacrifice fly gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead with a Miguel Vargas walk loading the bases again before Thompson’s slam.“My mechanics were fine, it was just one of those days you have during the year and mine just happened to be the first one,” Bumgarner said. “It wasn’t like I went out there and threw the ball really well, but I was just one pitch away in the first of it being a completely different game. After that, it wasn’t bad.”Walker’s home run in the second inning pulled the Diamondbacks to 5-1 and gave him nine hits in his first 29 career at-bats against Kershaw.Bumgarner gave way to right-hander Kevin Ginkel in the fifth inning before Thompson cashed in a double from Martinez and another walk to Vargas with his second-career multi-homer game for an 8-1 lead.J.D. Martinez’s first home run in a Dodgers’ uniform came in the seventh inning, while Thompson’s third of the night came in the eighth. All three of Thompson's home runs went to left-center field and traveled 409, 418 and 440 feet, in that order.“It’s just one night but I felt really good tonight and I felt like I was seeing the ball well,” said Thompson, who received a curtain call from Dodgers fans after his third home run. “That last week of spring training, I felt pretty good. We worked on some stuff and it started to click.”Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Thompson will start in the outfield again Sunday with Betts getting his first start of the season at second base.“I developed a new three-homer rule,” Roberts said. “It you hit three homers, you’ll play the next day.”UP NEXTRight-hander Noah Syndergaard will make his Dodgers debut after signing a one-year, $13 million deal with the club and will pitch opposite Diamondbacks right-hander Zach Davies.___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853560,"Bogaerts homers, Carpenter, Wacha help Padres beat Rockies","SAN DIEGO (AP) — Buoyed in part by San Diego State's thrilling win in the Final Four, the San Diego Padres gave a glimpse of how good their superstar-laden lineup can be.Xander Bogaerts hit a two-run homer and Matt Carpenter added a two-run double to back fellow newcomer Michael Wacha and lead the Padres to their first victory this season, 8-4 against the Colorado Rockies on Saturday.Petco Park was already in a festive mood after the crowd erupted in cheers while watching San Diego State beat Florida Atlantic 72-71 in the Final Four, with Lamont Butler's buzzer-beater coming just a few minutes before first pitch. Rockies manager Bud Black, who pitched for SDSU, punched his left fist in the air and high-fived one of his coaches.“What an incredible shot. Boy, you could feel it all around the stadium,” Padres manager Bob Melvin said. “It gave us a little momentum going in.”The Padres lost consecutive games to the Rockies before playing up to the high expectations they have after making a run to the NL Championship Series last season and then signing Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year deal. Bogaerts joined a lineup that already included Manny Machado and Juan Soto, with Fernando Tatis Jr. set to be activated on April 20 after finishing an 80-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug.Bogaerts hit a no-doubter into the second deck in left field off José Ureña with two outs in the first inning for the Padres' first homer of the season, with Soto aboard on a grounder that forced Machado.Machado originally was called safe but the Rockies challenged and the call was overturned.“It felt good, man,” Bogaerts said. “Turned on an inside pitch, down and in. It was a good swing, especially one that off the bat you know right away it's gone.”Bogaerts said it was “a mini-example” of how good the Padres can be.“I know for sure we're still capable of more and obviously we still have some coming help on the way. It's an offense that we'll put up against anyone. We feel pretty confident about our chances,” he said.Bogaerts batted cleanup as he did on opening night. He hit leadoff on Friday.“He can really hit,"" Melvin said. “And he likes to hit in different spots in the lineup, too. I know we've fluctuated a little bit early on and you like to have some stability with our guys, but we're trying to find it a little bit what the lineup's going to be with left and right, and it'll probably be a little bit more stable when Tati comes back.”Said Bogaerts: ""I like it, actually. I do, and Bob has been very open with me. He's been very straight forward and asking me a lot of days ahead if I like this type of stuff. That's been helpful.""Carpenter, who signed as a free agent in December, gave the Padres a 4-0 lead with his double into right field with one out in the third.Machado gave the Padres some breathing room with an RBI single in the sixth after the Rockies had pulled within one, and Soto had a two-run single in the eighth — his first hit of the season.Wacha (1-0), who signed as a free agent in February, allowed four runs and six hits in six innings.Ureña (0-1) lasted just 2 1/3 innings, permitting four runs and five hits.The Rockies scored three runs in the fifth to pull to 5-4. Charlie Blackmon hit an RBI double and C.J. Cron, who launched two home runs in a 7-2 win on opening night, added a two-run shot deep into the second deck.REPPIN' THE TECSBlack and Rockies infielder Alan Trejo, who also played at SDSU, wore white Kawhi Leonard No. 15 jerseys during batting practice. Melvin also wore a white Leonard jersey during BP. Padres broadcaster Tony Gwynn Jr. wore a white No. 24 Gwynn jersey, the number his father wore while playing basketball for the Aztecs, where he also played baseball before starting his 20-year Hall of Fame career with the Padres. Ralph Sampson, who played in the 1981 Final Four with Virginia and is a friend of Padres owner Peter Seidler, watched the basketball game from near the Padres dugout during BP.TRAINER'S ROOMPadres: Melvin said Matt Williams' colon cancer surgery on Friday went well and the third base coach “feels great.” Melvin said Williams hopes to return as quickly as possible. Mike Shildt is filling in for Williams at third.UP NEXTRockies LHP Austin Gomber is scheduled to start Sunday's series finale against RHP Seth Lugo, who makes his Padres debut.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853561,"Bad start, big hole lead to end of Miami's Final Four run","HOUSTON (AP) — It didn't take long for Wooga Poplar to notice something was wrong offensively for Miami in the program's first Final Four game.“Right off, the start of the game,” the guard said.Miami earned its way to the Final Four in part by having one of the nation's best offenses, capable of scoring off the dribble or hitting from outside while boasting multiple options for hitting big shots. But that unit never got going in time to extend the Hurricanes' terrific postseason run to the final Monday night of the season.The Hurricanes couldn't finish drives, missed jumpers and clanged 3-pointers off the rim in a frustrating first half that put them in a double-digit deficit against Connecticut. And they spent the rest of the night desperately trying to climb out of that hole, all the way to the finish in a 72-59 loss in Saturday night's national semifinals.“Quite honestly, we were never in sync offensively,” Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said. “We struggled.”The Hurricanes arrived at their first Final Four ranked fifth in KenPom for adjusted offensive efficiency by averaging 119.6 points per 100 possessions, and they boasted an offense with four different players who had scored 20 points at least three times this season.Instead, Miami had a brutal start that set the tone for the rest of the game — and what was left of the season for the Atlantic Coast Conference's regular-season co-champion.The Hurricanes (29-8) made just 9 of 36 shots (25%) in the opening 20 minutes, which kept them from building any momentum or putting much pressure on UConn. That included forward Norchad Omier having a scoreless first half despite playing nearly 16 minutes.Poplar sensed too much 1-on-1 play instead of driving and kicking out for jumpers, or moving the ball to create seams between defenders. Nijel Pack felt it too, the lack of flow and connected rhythm that had helped the Hurricanes score 85 points in their second-round NCAA win against Indiana, 89 against defensive-minded 1-seed Houston and 88 against Texas in the Elite Eight.It was obvious enough that Larrañaga said the halftime message was simple: Share. The. Ball.“It's kind of crazy, we’ve got so much talent on this team and so much ability from each person,” said Pack, sitting at his locker with a towel draped over his head. ""Sometimes you think you’ve got an advantage on the matchup and you try to do things and sometimes it just doesn’t work for you in that way.“It’s never somebody trying to be selfish, but sometimes you just can’t get the shot you thought you could get.”Miami missed 11 of 12 shots to start the game and didn't have a field goal pop the net for the first seven-plus minutes considering its first basket came on a goaltending call. Then, after one flurry, the Hurricanes somehow saw it get worse with a 1-for-13 stretch.“We got some clean looks, we just didn't make them,” said Poplar, who went scoreless on 0-for-7 shooting after hitting double figures in six of his last eight games. “The majority of the shots were harder.”Alex Karaban’s 3-pointer at the horn pushed UConn to a 37-24 lead at halftime, setting the stage for the Hurricanes to spend the rest of the night in catch-up mode.The Hurricanes pushed the ball in transition and off turnovers to build some momentum after halftime. But they never got closer than eight points, briefly, after halftime and never seriously threatened to derail what has been a dominant five-game run for the Huskies in the NCAAs.By the end of the night, Miami had shot just 32% while having just Isaiah Wong (15 points) and Jordan Miller (11) hit double figures as the Hurricanes' run ran out of steam.It ended up as the Hurricanes' lowest scoring output of the season, and a bumpy finish to a memorable March run.“It happens,” Poplar said, forcing a smile as he sat in his locker. “I'm mad that it happened at this time.”___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World

Alexandar Georgiev stopped 26 shots.“We’ve been a resilient group,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “You’re not going to win every game, but I do feel like your response after a loss is huge. When you come up to a big game, sometimes you’ve going to succeed, sometimes you’re going to fail and for different reasons.""The main thing we like to rely on with our group is that we’re going to be there to compete and work hard and try to do the right things. I felt like our guys checked all those boxes tonight.”Colorado pulled into a tie with Dallas for second place in the Central Division, one point behind first-place Minnesota.Tyler Seguin and Joe Pavelski scored for the Stars, and Jason Robertson had two assists. Jake Oettinger finished with 27 saves.“Considering the circumstances, we came out ready to play,” Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. “We knew what was at stake. We played well. It was a close game that could have gone either way. They found a way to capitalize. The errors we made — turning a puck over, taking a too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty — that’s a team that makes you pay for that.”MacKinnon scored the first goal of the night, with 11:06 remaining in the first period, and his power-play goal with 12 seconds remaining in the second period pushed his team’s advantage back to two. Colorado has scored at least one power-play goal in 13 of its past 14 games.MacKinnon now has 34 goals, increasing his team-leading point total to 97. It was the star center’s 32nd multi-point game of the season, giving him the most of any Avalanche player since Joe Sakic in 2000-01.“It gets tougher and tougher to produce when the checking game and the commitment level of every team you’re playing goes up,” Bednar said. “Some guys will dry up offensively. Well, Nate’s the exact opposite. The tougher it gets, the more he finds ways to be a big difference-maker.”Wyatt Johnston appeared to trim the Avalanche lead to 3-2 with 10:51 remaining in the third period, but his goal was overturned for goaltender interference after a challenge from Bednar.“You’d like to see it count,” Pavelski said. “We still had more than enough time when that happened. We got a little jolt of energy there and got going again. It would have been fun to be in that situation down by a goal.”Rantanen’s goal, an empty-netter, was his 49th of the season, the third-most of all NHL players.“We talked about the start and bouncing on them right away and putting their defense under pressure and just making them work,” Rantanen said. “It’s not easy if you come in at two or three in the morning to play the next day. We’ve been there.”NOTES: Colorado recalled C Ben Meyers from its AHL affiliate. Meyers has one goal in 33 games with the Avalanche this season. ... Colorado D Jack Johnson appeared in his 1,100th career game, becoming the 14th U.S.-born defenseman in NHL history to reach that mark. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853587,"Civale goes 7, Guardians hit 2 HRs to beat Mariners 2-0","SEATTLE (AP) — Aaron Civale pitched seven smooth innings, and Josh Naylor and Andrés Giménez homered as the Cleveland Guardians beat the Seattle Mariners 2-0 on Saturday night.Civale allowed only two hits and a walk with three strikeouts. The seven-inning stint matched his longest outing of last season.“He pitched his heart out. I thought he pitched a great game. When Aaron’s going good, that’s what it is,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. “He pitched to contact. I think he had 10 groundball outs.”Julio Rodríguez had both hits off Civale, and Tommy La Stella doubled for the Mariners.“He was rolling out there,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “Tough night offensively. I really do have to give credit to Civale. He was on top of his game, and that was as good as we’ve ever seen him.”It was the third career start for Civale in Seattle, and his first win. In his previous two he was 0-2 with a 6.23 ERA and had given up four homers.Emmanuel Clase worked the ninth for his first save, completing a crisp game that took just 2 hours, 4 minutes — the fastest in the majors over the first three days under baseball's new speed-up rules.“I like moving fast, working fast, and their guy was, too,” Mariners starter Logan Gilbert said. “We were just going back and forth. I was just trying to stay in a groove, and especially when it’s cold like this, just work fast and make them put it in play.”Civale thought his pitches were working well, but he also credited the Guardians’ defensive play.“It’s unbelievable when your whole team is involved,” Civale said. “It’s what happens when you’re working fast, in the zone and on the same page as your catcher. Everyone’s into the game.”On a chilly night, pitching dominated. Gilbert nearly matched Civale, striking out seven in six innings and allowing four hits.Gilbert’s only costly mistake came in the fourth, when Naylor hit Cleveland’s first homer of the season.Diego Castillo relieved in the seventh and promptly gave up a one-out homer to Giménez, the All-Star second baseman who signed a $106.5 million, seven-year contract on opening day.Seattle’s best offensive chance came in the eighth, when La Stella hit a one-out double against James Karinchak. J.P. Crawford walked with two outs before Karinchak struck out Rodríguez.“We didn’t put up too many runs today, but it was enough,” said Guardians catcher Cam Gallagher. “All the pitchers today did a heck of a job.”PITCH CLOCKKarinchak, charged with the Guardians' first pitch-clock violation in Thursday’s opener, was again assessed an automatic ball for taking too long against pinch-hitter Cal Raleigh in the eighth. The Seattle crowd loudly counted down with the clock before each of Karinchak’s pitches.TRAINER'S ROOMSeattle starter Robbie Ray was placed on the 15-day injured list because of a left flexor strain, a day after Ray failed to make it through the fourth inning of a 9-4 loss to Cleveland, struggling badly with his control. Ray won’t throw for two weeks and will be re-evaluated.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853589,Blinken: Russia must immediately free 2 detained Americans,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart, in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war, to immediately release a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained last week as well as another imprisoned American, Paul Whelan, the State Department said Sunday.In the call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Blinken conveyed “grave concern” over the Kremlin's detention of journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage allegations, according to a State Department summary of the call. Blinken called for his immediate release.Blinken also sought the immediate release of Whelan, whom the statement said was wrongfully detained. U.S. officials said they were considering a similar determination for Gershkovich that could be made at any time. Should that happen, his case would be largely transferred to the office of the U.S. Special Presidential for Hostage Affairs.Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive, has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the U.S. government have said are baseless. He is serving a 16-year sentence.Blinken and Lavrov also discussed “the importance of creating an environment that permits diplomatic missions to carry out their work,” according to the State Department.The FSB, Russia's top security agency and successor to the KGB, said Gershkovich was collecting information on an enterprise of the military-industrial complex. Russian authorities detained him last week, the first time a U.S. correspondent has been held on spying accusations since the Cold War.In its summary of the call, Russia’s foreign ministry said Lavrov “drew Blinken’s attention to the need to respect the decisions of the Russian authorities"" about Gershkovich, whom Moscow claims, without evidence, “was caught red-handed.”The Journal has adamantly denied the allegations and demanded his release. U.S. officials have also called on Russia to let him go, with President Joe Biden telling reporters on Friday that his message to the country was “Let him go.”The Kremlin said Lavrov also told Blinken it was unacceptable for U.S. officials and Western news media to continue “whipping up excitement” and politicizing the journalist’s detention. ""His further fate will be determined by the court.”The State Department described the detention of Gershkovich as unacceptable.Emma Tucker, the newspaper's editor-in-chief, said it was “gratifying” and “reassuring” to learn of Blinken’s call because it shows the U.S. government is taking the case “right up to the top.” The Journal has been unable to get messages to the reporter or learn any official information about him, she told CBS' “Face the Nation.”U.S. consular officials have requested a visit with Gershkovich but no announcement of such access has been made. Officials said they were hopeful consular access could be arranged in the coming week but could not speak to when that might happen.Tucker said the newspaper is hopeful a lawyer might be able to meet with Gershkovich this coming week, and in the meantime has been “pressing constantly for reassurance that he’s not being mistreated in any way.”Rep. Mike Turner, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, noted that the government has advised U.S. citizens to leave Russia. “This is not unexpected, in that Russia is acting as an illegal state at this point. There are no laws or rules or no international norms that they are following,” Turner, R-Ohio, told CNN's “State of the Union.”In alleging that U.S. officials and news media are hyping Gershkovich's detention, Russian officials are reprising a theme they used in the apprehensions of basketball star Brittney Griner and other U.S. citizens. The Kremlin has said it prefers to resolve such cases quietly and has emphasized the need to follow Russia’s judicial process. Often, that means the chance of progress in U.S. efforts to free its detained citizens isn’t likely until formal charges are filed, a trial is held, a conviction is obtained, and sentencing and appeals are completed.More than 30 news organizations and press freedom advocates have written the Russian ambassador in the United States to express concern Russia is sending the message that reporting inside the country is criminalized.On Saturday night, Griner, who was detained for 10 months by Russian authorities before being released in a prisoner swap for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, issued a statement with her wife, Cherelle, calling for the release of the 31-year-old Gershkovich.“Every American who is taken is ours to fight for and every American returned is a win for us all,” the couple said in a statement posted on Instagram.Interactions between the top U.S. and Russian diplomats have been rare since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, though they did have a brief conversation last month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 conference of foreign ministers in India. It was the highest-level in-person talks between the two countries since the war.That interaction was their first contact since last summer, when Blinken talked to Lavrov by phone about a U.S. proposal for Russia to release Whelan and Griner. Though Whelan was not included in the one-for-one swap that resulted in the release of Griner, U.S. officials said they remain committed to bringing him home.___Associated Press writer Hope Yen contributed to this report.",2023/04/03,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853591,Golden Knights beat Wild 4-1 in battle of division leaders,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Vegas Golden Knights are chasing the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, and Laurent Brossoit is trying to become their starting goalie in the playoffs.Both took steps forward Saturday night, with Brossoit overcoming an early goal to make 31 saves as the Knights beat the Minnesota Wild 4-1 in a battle of division leaders to open a home-and-home series.The teams meet again Monday night in Minnesota.Chandler Stephenson had a goal and an assist for the Knights, and Ben Hutton, Zach Whitecloud and Brett Howden scored the other three goals. Jack Eichel had two assists. Matt Boldy scored for Minnesota goal.“I thought it was one of our more complete games,” Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. “They get the first goal and we kept playing. That’s what I liked most about it.”The Knights, who already have clinched a playoff spot, took a step toward winning the Pacific Division with 101 points. It's the second time in the six-year history of the franchise the Knights have eclipsed 100 points, and they are the first Western Conference team to hit that mark this season.Their lead in the Pacific Division is more tenuous, and victories Saturday by Edmonton (99 points) and Los Angeles (98) kept the heat on the Knights.Minnesota would have locked up a spot with a victory, but the Wild remain at 97 points. They are still in first place in Central Division, but Dallas and Colorado are each just a point back.The Wild's six-game point streak ended with the loss. Their 36 points since Feb. 17 led the NHL.“We had plenty of opportunities to score in this hockey game, but having said that, we didn’t like our energy,"" Minnesota coach Dean Evason said.Brossoit (3-0-3) hopes to lock down the starting goalie spot with just six games remaining in the regular season. He is one of five goalies to record multiple victories for the Knights because of injuries and only recently returned himself from a lower-body injury that cost him 13 games. He spent most of the season in the American Hockey League, but is a nine-year NHL veteran.“Obviously, I want to be the guy,” Brossoit said, “and just kind of look to keep performing like this and just keep building and building.”Brossoit beat former Knight Marc-Andre Fleury, who had 35 stops for the Wild. Fleury had gone 8-0-1 over his previous nine starts with an average of 2.19 goals allowed.Minnesota struck first on Boldy's goal five minutes into the game, but Hutton answered nearly five minutes later. Whitecloud and Howden scored in the second period for Vegas, and Stephenson added an empty-net goal with 1:14 left.“I think we stuck with our game,” Eichel said. “They come out and they get that goal early, but we responded well. ... Those two points, it's a big win.”NOTES: Minnesota forward Mason Shaw suffered a non-contact lower-body injury less than five minutes into the game and didn't return. He did not put weight on his right leg as he was helped off the ice. ... Knights forward Nic Roy took a puck to the face from teammate Alex Pietrangelo's blast from the point in the second period and briefly went to the locker room. He returned to the game. ... Eichel (one goal, seven assists) and Ivan Barbashev (one goal, four assists) each extended their point streak to five games for the Knights. ...

(AP) — Noah Gregor had three goals, Kyle Criscuolo and Danil Guschin scored their first NHL goals and the San Jose Sharks routed the Arizona Coyotes 7-2 on Saturday night.Criscuolo and Gushchin were recalled from the minors Saturday and helped the Sharks to their third straight victory after a nine-game losing streak that left them at the bottom of the NHL standings. Chicago and Columbus have since moved into a tie for the worst record.It was the first career hat trick for Gregor, who has 24 career goals in 172 NHL games.“I don't know, sometimes you get hot and things go in for you, so I think that's what happened tonight,” Gregor said.Jacob Peterson and Logan Couture also scored for San Jose — with Peterson’s goal his first of the season. Erik Karlsson had four assists, giving him 73 for the season. He added to his franchise season record for defensemen with his 95th point. Nico Sturm assisted on Gregor's first two goals.Kaapo Kahkonen stopped 29 shots for San Jose.Criscuolo and Gushchin arrived at their first career goals by different routes. Crisculo is a 30-year-old who broke into the NHL in 2017 with Buffalo but had spent all but 15 games in the minors until Saturday. Gushchin, a 21-year-old from Russia, scored on his first career shot.“It felt really good to watch these guys enjoy it,” Sharks coach David Quinn said. “And no matter how old you are, it’s a pretty special moment for someone for what to watch someone score their first NHL goal, so that was pretty cool.”J.J. Moser and Milos Kelemen scored for Arizona, which has lost seven in a row and its last three at home (0-5-2). Kelemen’s goal was the first of his career.Ivan Prosvetov had 24 saves and took his first loss of the season in four starts.“We didn't have much,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said. “No emotion, no life, no spirit. Nothing.”San Jose scored three times in the first period.Gregor scored for the Sharks just 90 seconds into the game, beating Ivan Prosvetov from the slot. Nico Sturm assisted for San Jose.Peterson’s goal came on the power play after Laurent Dauphin was called for holding. Logan Couture and Erik Karlsson assisted, with Karlsson picking up his 70th assist and his 92nd point, the latter already a record for San Jose defensemen.Criscuolo made it 3-0 when he came in alone on Prosvetov after Arizona’s Nick Schmaltz turned the puck over at the blue line.Arizona took advantage of its power play chance in the first period, when J.J. Moser scored his seventh goal of the season. Matias Maccelli and Victor Soderstrom had the assists for the Coyotes.Just eight seconds into the second period, Arizona’s Christian Fischer went to the penalty box for tripping and Gushchin scored at 1:41.ICE CHIPSSan Jose won all three meetings between the teams this season. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853593,Kings move to cusp of playoff berth with 3-1 win over Kraken,"SEATTLE (AP) — Despite a string of injuries and absences, the Los Angeles Kings are on the cusp of wrapping up another trip to the postseason.Pheonix Copley made 25 saves, Sean Durzi, Carl Grundstrom and Kevin Fiala scored, and the Kings created separation in the Pacific Division standings with a 3-1 win over the Seattle Kraken on Saturday night.Durzi scored at 11:45 of the second period thanks to a deflection that left an open goal, and Grundstrom stole the puck from Brandon Tanev and beat Martin Jones glove side with 14:38 remaining to give Los Angeles a 2-0 lead.Fiala added an empty net goal with 45 seconds left, his 23rd of the season.“I didn’t think there was a lot of ice for either team. Both teams played a very tight, I don’t want to say conservative, but smart game. There wasn't space to make plays and if you had a chance to get it to the net, you’d better take advantage of it,” Los Angeles coach Todd McLellan said. “Fortunately for us, we got the lead and there was only going to be one or two tonight.”The victory by Los Angeles likely ended Seattle’s hopes of catching the Kings in the standings. Los Angeles moved eight points ahead of the Kraken with six games remaining while Seattle has a game in hand. The Kraken's path to the playoffs is likely one of the two wild cards in the Western Conference.“It’s a real disappointing loss, but in saying that this group knows what it takes,” Seattle coach Dave Hakstol said. “There’s there’s enough guys that have been in here. They know what it takes.”Copley faced a limited number of dangerous chances with most of Seattle’s shots coming from well away from goal. But when he needed to make a big save, Copley was solid. He stuffed Eeli Tolvanen on a breakaway in the opening moments of the third period and later mater a sprawling glove save on Jordan Eberle during a delayed penalty against the Kings.“We were working really hard in our (defensive) zone for the full 60 and I think that’s how we’re gonna have to win games here coming down the stretch,” Copley said. “They're gonna be tight games. They're gonna be hard fought battles. So I think that’s just kind of how we wanted to play defensively.”Seattle ended up capitalizing on the penalty and ended Copley’s shutout hopes as Oliver Bjorkstrand scored on a rebound with 11:35 left, his 18th goal of the season. Copley came up with a key stop on Daniel Sprong with about 5 minutes left and withstood Seattle’s charge in the closing moments with an extra attacker leading to Fiala's clinching goal.Fiala was one of those injury concerns for the Kings. He had missed seven of the previous nine games for Los Angeles due to injury, including Thursday's loss to Edmonton.“He had a huge game for us tonight and it doesn’t affect him. He’s still making plays and still controlling the puck,” said Los Angeles' Alex Iafallo, who picked up his 200th career point assisting on Durzi's goal.Seattle goaltender Martin Jones made 16 saves, but it was a completely different outcome than the last time the division foes met back in late November in Los Angeles when the Kraken escaped with a wild 9-8 victory.NOTES: Los Angeles D Mikey Anderson was scratched after leaving Thursday’s game against Edmonton with an undisclosed injury after his first shift. ... Tanev skated in his 400th career game. ... Only two of Seattle’s seven remaining games come against a team currently in playoff position, both against Vegas.

There were lots of great plays by the guys around me, looking for me. I am proud and very fortunate to have done it,” said Draisaitl, who scored his third goal short-handed to become just the 12th player in NHL history to have three seasons with 50 goals and 50 assists.“I was probably being a little too selfish in the third, I was shooting it from everywhere. I think that is all right. Usually, I tend to overpass it so for once in my life it is OK. There were some great plays. I didn’t think it was going to happen on the kill, but I will take it.”Jack Campbell stopped 36 shots for his 10th career shutout — first since last April 26 against Detroit.“I thought that Soup (Campbell) made some really big saves, especially early in the first,” McDavid said. “I thought we were a little bit sloppy at the beginning of the game, but he was solid and gave us a chance to get our feet under us.“I am really, really happy for him. Obviously it has been an up-and-down year for him and he has battled so hard, so to be rewarded, the boys love that.”The Oilers, who beat Los Angeles 2-0 on Thursday night, got their second straight shutout after not having one for the first 75 games of the season.John Gibson was pulled in the third period after giving up five goals on 36 shots for Anaheim, which has lost seven straight and nine of 10 (1-8-1). Lukas Dostal came on and finished with eight saves.“Edmonton has a top-notch explosive team,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “I thought we had a really good first period, maybe one of our best periods of the year. But I think the discrepancy is finish on the two teams, they’re loaded with guys that can finish and we’re challenged with it.“I think the differential of shots was four, they had 36 we had 32, we just couldn’t get anything past their goaltender tonight.”Ryan Strome had Campbell cleanly beat 3 1/2 minutes in, but hit the post. With eight minutes left Frank Vatrano had a couple of opportunities in tight, but was stoned by the Oilers' goalie.Hyman deflected Mattias Ekholm's long shot off Gibson and in with 2:04 left in the first to get the Oilers on the scoreboard. It was his 34th of the season.Draisaitl got a pass from Evander Kane, skated in and lifted a backhander into the top right corner to double Edmonton's lead at 2:03 of the second.Nurse fired a shot from the slot through Gibson's five-hole and in for his 11th at 5:05 to make it 3-0.After McDavid's point shot hit Hyman, standing on the left doorstep, the puck landed on the right side and Draisaitl quickly knocked it in for a power-play goal with 8:16 left in the middle period.McDavid got his league-leading 62nd to make it 5-0 at 4:25 of the third, and Draisaitl completed his second hat trick of the season and seventh of his career with about five minutes remaining.Draisaitl reached the 50-goal mark for the third time in his career.“This one is very exciting to me because it was at home and the other two were on the road,” Draisaitl said. “It was great to do it in front of our home fans.”SPECIAL TEAMMATESDraisaitl also combined with McDavid to be the first teammates to hit 50 goals in the same season since Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr did it for Pittsburgh in 1995-1996.UP NEXTDucks: At Calgary on Sunday night to finish a three-game trip.Oilers: At Los Angeles on Tuesday night to open a four-game trip.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World

He barely slept. Yet there was no way he wasn't going to be ready for Connecticut's game against Miami in the Final Four.“I absolutely knew I was going to play,” Hawkins said after the Huskies' 72-59 win over Miami in Saturday night's national semifinals. “I didn't care how I was feeling. Put me on a stretcher, it didn't matter.”It wasn't quite that dramatic, fortunately. But the 6-foot-5 sophomore bounced back from missing Friday's practice, first by hitting a 3-pointer on the game's opening possession and then by scoring 10 of his 13 points after halftime as the Huskies rolled into Monday night's title game.“Final Four gameday, I wasn’t feeling the best,” he said in the locker room. “But you just have that mentality that you’ve got to go out and win a game for a national championship.”Hawkins, the team's No. 2 scorer at 16.3 points per game, hit three 3s in the game and played 25 minutes.“Could’ve played better,” he said. “Always could play better.”Hawkins said he isn't sure if he picked up a stomach bug or had a bout with food poisoning after eating a steak and calamari meal on Thursday night. While his teammates came to NRG Stadium to go through the open public practice Friday, Hawkins was miserable at the hotel trying to recover as quickly as possible.“I've been here nine months now and I have yet to see him miss a practice,” big man Donovan Clingan said. ""So for him to miss practice the day before a Final Four game, I knew something was wrong. I know he’s such a dog and cares so much about winning. I had no worries that he was going to be here today.”Hawkins said it helped to get his legs moving in pregame shootaround, and he felt better the longer he stayed on the court.That's why he was already looking ahead to the title game against San Diego State.“No reason to be concerned on Monday,” he said.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853617,Montenegro voters choose president amid political turmoil,"PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Voters in Montenegro cast ballots Sunday in a runoff presidential election that is a contest between a long-serving pro-Western incumbent and a newcomer promising changes in the small NATO member nation located on Europe’s Balkan peninsula.Observers think President Milo Djukanovic, who is credited with leading Montenegro to independence from Serbia in 2006 and later into NATO, could be defeated by Jakov Milatovic, a former economy minister. Milatovic has the backing of the country's governing parties, which advocate closer ties with Serbia.The runoff vote was scheduled after none of the contenders won a majority in the first round of voting two weeks ago. Some 540,000 people were eligible to vote. Montenegro has a population of 620,000 and borders Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo and the Adriatic Sea.The outcome of Sunday's election is likely to reflect on an early parliamentary election set for June 11. That vote was scheduled because of a months-long government deadlock that stalled Montenegro's pending European Union membership and alarmed the West as war rages in Ukraine.Djukanovic said he was confident of a victory, which he said would mark “the beginning of Montenegro's return to the path of European development.” Since 2012, the EU and Montenegro have been negotiating the terms the country needs to meet to join the bloc.“I believe a new era is starting in which Montenegro will continue to advance efficiently and in a stable manner toward its European goal,” Djukanovic told reporters. “I also believe that we will confirm this intention at the parliamentary election.”Milatovic expressed just as much optimism, saying he was “absolutely convinced that I will become the new president of the country, that today the citizens of Montenegro will send the current president to the political past.”He said he would make Montenegro's progress on the EU path his priority.""I believe we are entering a new era for Montenegro, an era for a better, more just, more wealthy, as well as more democratic Montenegro, a European Montenegro of all and for all its citizens,” Milatovic said.Djukanovic, 61, first became prime minister at age 29 and has remained in power for 32 years — longer than his Democratic Party of Socialists, which was ousted from governing in a 2020 parliamentary election.Djukanovic hopes his reelection to another five-year term would pave the way for the party to return to power in June.Djukanovic has been a key Western ally in countering Russian influence and keeping the Balkans stable. He has insisted that the struggle is not over despite Montenegro's NATO membership because of Serbia's alleged expansionist policies and Russia's influence.Milatovic, 36, was educated in Britain and the United States. He has appealed to voters disillusioned with established politicians like Djukanovic. Milatovic has insisted he wants Montenegro to join the EU, although some of the parties that backed his candidacy are pro-Russian.If Milatovic wins, his Europe Now movement could find itself in a position to dominate the next government after June's parliamentary election.Europe Now emerged after the first government that resulted from the 2020 parliamentary election collapsed. As the economy minister in that government, Milatovic gained popularity by increasing salaries but critics say this was done at the cost of the already depleted health system and not as an outcome of reform.",2023/04/03,,World

The most common poisonous snake bite is the Taiwanese habu, followed by the Taiwan green bamboo pit viper, and the hundred-pace pit viper.Beginning in April, Taiwan's climate has gradually become warmer and more humid, with snakes of all varieties becoming more active. This has led to an increase in the number of snake bites as the public is encouraged to be more vigilant when engaging in outdoor activities.According to the CDC, the annual supply of anti-venom averages 2,500 doses, which are provided at 190 medical facilities around the country, with ample supply and distribution to cover the number of cases encountered each year.Chart illustrates what to do in case of a poisonous snake bite. (CDC image)Should one accidentally be bitten by a snake, the CDC says the first step should be immediately trying to identify the snake by taking a photo of it. There is no need to catch the snake and take it to the hospital. Identifying the snake can lead to quick application of appropriate anti-venom.The CDC reminds the public about the five actions they should do after being bit, such as remain calm, applying pressure or a compression bandage above the wound, identifying the snake, observing the wound, and seeking medical treatment as quickly as possible.As for what not to do, the CDC warns the public not to cut the wound or suck venom with one's mouth, do not apply ice, do not drink alcohol, and do not avoid seeking medical treatment.For more information, please visit the CDC website or call the toll-free hotline 1922 (0800-001922).",2023/04/02,628,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853648,The US leads the world in weather catastrophes. Here's why,"The United States is Earth's punching bag for nasty weather.Blame geography for the U.S. getting hit by stronger, costlier, more varied and frequent extreme weather than anywhere on the planet, several experts said. Two oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky Mountains, jutting peninsulas like Florida, clashing storm fronts and the jet stream combine to naturally brew the nastiest of weather.That’s only part of it. Nature dealt the United States a bad hand, but people have made it much worse by what, where and how we build, several experts told The Associated Press.Then add climate change, and “buckle up. More extreme events are expected,” said Rick Spinrad, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Tornadoes. Hurricanes. Flash floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Blizzards. Ice storms. Nor’easters. Lake-effect snow. Heat waves. Severe thunderstorms. Hail. Lightning. Atmospheric rivers. Derechos. Dust storms. Monsoons. Bomb cyclones. And the dreaded polar vortex.It starts with “where we are on the globe,” North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello said. “It’s truly a little bit ... unlucky.”China may have more people, and a large land area like the United States, but “they don't have the same kind of clash of air masses as much as you do in the U.S. that is producing a lot of the severe weather,” said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina.The U.S. is by far the king of tornadoes and other severe storms.“It really starts with kind of two things. Number one is the Gulf of Mexico. And number two is elevated terrain to the west,” said Victor Gensini, a Northern Illinois University meteorology professor.Look at Friday's deadly weather, and watch out for the next week to see it in action: Dry air from the West goes up over the Rockies and crashes into warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and it’s all brought together along a stormy jet stream.In the West, it's a drumbeat of atmospheric rivers. In the Atlantic, it's nor'easters in the winter, hurricanes in the summer and sometimes a weird combination of both, like Superstorm Sandy.“It is a reality that regardless of where you are in the country, where you call home, you’ve likely experienced a high-impact weather event firsthand,” Spinrad said.Killer tornadoes in December 2021 that struck Kentucky illustrated the uniqueness of the United States.They hit areas with large immigrant populations. People who fled Central and South America, Bosnia and Africa were all victims. A huge problem was that tornadoes really didn't happen in those people's former homes, so they didn't know what to watch for or what to do, or even know they had to be concerned about tornadoes, said Joseph Trujillo Falcon, a NOAA social scientist who investigated the aftermath.With colder air up in the Arctic and warmer air in the tropics, the area between them — the mid-latitudes, where the United States is — gets the most interesting weather because of how the air acts in clashing temperatures, and that north-south temperature gradient drives the jet stream, said Northern Illinois meteorology professor Walker Ashley.Then add mountain ranges that go north-south, jutting into the winds flowing from west to east, and underneath it all the toasty Gulf of Mexico.The Gulf injects hot, moist air underneath the often cooler, dry air lifted by the mountains, “and that doesn't happen really anywhere else in the world,” Gensini said.If the United States as a whole has it bad, the South has it the worst, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society.“We drew the short straw (in the South) that we literally can experience every single type of extreme weather event,” Shepherd said. “Including blizzards. Including wildfires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes. Every single type. ... There's no other place in the United States that can say that.”Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana also stick out in the water so are more prone to being hit by hurricanes, said Shepherd and Dello.The South has more manufactured housing that is vulnerable to all sorts of weather hazards, and storms are more likely to happen there at night, Ashley said. Night storms are deadly because people can't see them and are less likely to take cover, and they miss warnings in their sleep.The extreme weather triggered by America’s unique geography creates hazards. But it takes humans to turn those hazards into disasters, Ashley and Gensini said.Just look where cities pop up in America and the rest of the world: near water that floods, except maybe Denver, said South Carolina's Cutter. More people are moving to areas, such as the South, where there are more hazards.“One of the ways in which you can make your communities more resilient is to not develop them in the most hazard-prone way or in the most hazard-prone portion of the community,” Cutter said. “The insistence on building up barrier islands and development on barrier islands, particularly on the East Coast and the Gulf Coast, knowing that that sand is going to move and having hurricanes hit with some frequency ... seems like a colossal waste of money.”Construction standards tend to be at the bare minimum and less likely to survive the storms, Ashley said.“Our infrastructure is crumbling and nowhere near being climate-resilient at all,” Shepherd said.Poverty makes it hard to prepare for and bounce back from disasters, especially in the South, Shepherd said. That vulnerability is an even bigger issue in other places in the world.“Safety can be bought,"" Ashley said. “Those that are well-to-do and who have resources can buy safety and will be the most resilient when disaster strikes. ... Unfortunately that isn't all of us.”“It’s sad that we have to live these crushing losses,” said Kim Cobb, a Brown University professor of environment and society. “We’re worsening our hand by not understanding the landscape of vulnerability given the geographic hand we’ve been dealt.”___Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment.Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853649,Bulgaria holds 5th parliamentary election in 2 years,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgaria held its fifth general election in two years Sunday, which political leaders hoped would end government instability and provide a path to overcoming economic woes fueled by the war in Ukraine.Turnout was expected to be low due to voter apathy and disillusionment with politicians, who have been repeatedly unable to cobble together a viable governing coalition.The latest opinion polls suggested the chances for an immediate end to the political stalemate were low, with up to seven groups potentially reaching the 4% threshold to enter a fragmented parliament. According to the polls, populist and pro-Russia parties were likely to increase their representation.Most pollsters see three-time Prime Minister Boyko Borissov’s center-right GERB party running neck-and-neck at around 26% with its main rival, Kiril Petkov’s liberal We Continue the Change party, which recently formed a coalition with the right-wing Democratic Bulgaria.After casting his ballot, Borissov said wisdom from politicians was the only way out of the crisis. He said Bulgaria must have a stable government “if we don’t want to commit suicide as a nation.”“It will be a catastrophe for the country, if a ruling majority could not be formed,” Borissov said, adding that he was ready to compromise.Asked about a future coalition with Borissov’s GERB party, the co-leader of Democratic Bulgaria, Hristo Ivanov, said that governing with partner parties requires a high level of trust and understanding. He added that he did not think a coalition with GERB met those conditions.“We will be, rather, looking for a formula that is based on some kind of unity around specific priorities,” Ivanov said.The We Continue the Change party has said it would also reject a coalition deal with GERB if Borissov remained at its helm. We Continue the Change, which regards Borissov as a divisive figure and has accused him of promoting corrupt policies, proposed forming a minority government with the support of GERB, which rejected the idea.Still, party leaders were trying to soften their aggressive rhetoric to find an alternative to the consecutive caretaker governments appointed by President Rumen Radev in the last few years that have quietly shifted the country’s orientation toward Russia.Traditionally, many Bulgarians share pro-Russia sentiments, which provides fertile soil for aggressive Kremlin propaganda in the poorest European Union member country.Polls indicate the ultra-nationalist Vazrazhdane party, a fierce supporter of the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine, could increase its parliamentary presence from 10% to 13% of seats.",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853650,War-crimes warrant for Putin could complicate Ukraine peace,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An international arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin raises the prospect of the man whose country invaded Ukraine facing justice, but it complicates efforts to end that war in peace talks.Both justice and peace appear to be only remote possibilities today, and the conflicting relationship between the two is a quandary at the heart of a March 17 decision by the International Criminal Court to seek the Russian leader's arrest.Judges in The Hague found “reasonable grounds to believe” that Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights were responsible for war crimes, specifically the unlawful deportation and unlawful transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia.As unlikely as Putin sitting in a Hague courtroom seems now, other leaders have faced justice in international courts.Former Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, a driving force behind the Balkan wars of the 1990s, went on trial for war crimes, including genocide, at a United Nations tribunal in The Hague after he lost power. He died in his cell in 2006 before a verdict could be reached.Serbia, which wants European Union membership but has maintained close ties to Russia, is one of the countries that has criticized the ICC's action. The warrants “will have bad political consequences” and create “a great reluctance to talk about peace (and) about truce” in Ukraine, populist Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said.Others see consequences for Putin, and for anyone judged guilty of war crimes, as the primary desired outcome of international action.“There will be no escape for the perpetrator and his henchmen,"" European Union leader Ursula von der Leyen said Friday in a speech to mark the one-year anniversary of the liberation of Bucha, the Ukraine town that saw some of the worst atrocities in the war. “War criminals will be held accountable for their deeds.”Hungary did not join the other 26 EU members in signing a resolution in support of the ICC warrant for Putin. The government's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, said Hungarian authorities would not arrest Putin if he were to enter the country..He called the warrants “not the most fortunate because they lead toward escalation and not toward peace.”Putin appears to have a strong grip on power, and some analysts suspect the the warrant hanging over him could provide an incentive to prolong the fighting.“The arrest warrant for Putin might undermine efforts to reach a peace deal in Ukraine,” Daniel Krcmaric, an associate professor of political science at Northwestern University, said in emailed comments to The Associated Press.One potential way of easing the way to peace talks could be for the United Nations Security Council to call on the International Criminal Court to suspend the Ukraine investigation for a year, which is allowed under Article 16 of the Rome Statute treaty that created the court.But that appears unlikely, said Krcmaric, whose book “The Justice Dilemma,” deals with the tension between seeking justice and pursuing a negotiated end to conflicts.“The Western democracies would have to worry about public opinion costs if they made the morally questionable decision to trade justice for peace in such an explicit fashion,” he said, adding that Ukraine also is unlikely to support such a move.Russia immediately rejected the warrants. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow doesn’t recognize the ICC and considers its decisions “legally void.” And Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, which is chaired by Putin, suggested the ICC headquarters on the Netherlands' coastline could become a target for a Russian missile strike.Alexander Baunov, an analyst with the Carnegie Endowment, observed in a commentary that the arrest warrant for Putin amounted to “an invitation to the Russian elite to abandon Putin” that could erode his support.While welcoming the warrants for Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights, rights groups also urged the international community not to forget the pursuit of justice in other conflicts.“The ICC warrant for Putin reflects an evolving and multifaceted justice effort that is needed elsewhere in the world,” Human Rights Watch associate international justice director Balkees Jarrah said in a statement. “Similar justice initiatives are needed elsewhere to ensure that the rights of victims globally — whether in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Myanmar, or Palestine — are respected.”___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/04/02,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853651,Finns vote in tight election; young leader seeks reelection,"HELSINKI (AP) — A general election in Finland was expected to result in a close finish by three political parties Sunday, with Prime Minister Sanna Marin’s Social Democrats fighting to secure a second term running the government.Over 2,400 candidates from 22 parties were vying for the 200 seats in the Nordic country's parliament, the Eduskunta. Some 40% of eligible voters cast their ballots in advance.Marin, who at age 37 is one of Europe’s youngest leaders, has received praise for her Cabinet’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and for her prominent role, along with President Sauli Niinistö, in advocating for Finland’s successful application to join NATO. Her vocal support of Ukraine in the last year has increased her international visibility.“Of course we hope that the Social Democrats will win this election ... It’s so important because we want to stay an open society. We also want to work together internationally. We want to build a better green sustainable future where people have the same opportunities in life,"" Marin told the Associated Press while campaigning Saturday in central Helsinki.Marin remains popular at home but her party’s views on the Finnish economy, which emerged as the main campaign theme, were being challenged by two main opponents: the center-right National Coalition Party led by Petteri Orpo and the right-wing populist The Finns party, which is led by Riikka Purra.“The most important thing in the next government is to fix our economy, push economic growth, balance public economy. And the second very important issue is to build up NATO-Finland,"" Orpo told the AP during a campaign event in Espoo, just outside the capital, on Saturday.Riikka Purra stressed that the The Finns would focus on shaping Finland's migration, climate, criminal and energy policies if the populist party become a partner in the next government.“And we also want to tighten up our attitude towards the European Union,” Purra said during a campaign event in the municipality of Kirkkonummi, her home district located some 45 kilometers (28 miles) west of Helsinki.Recent polls indicated each of the three parties could take about 20% of the vote. If that happens, no party would be in position to form a government alone; whichever one wins the most votes is expected to begin talks in the next few days on forming a governing coalition.After voting at Helsinki City Hall, university professor Mariana Seppänen said she thinks Marin’s positive reputation abroad exceeds the prime minister’s domestic popularity.“I think usually the party that has been in charge and has the prime minister ... loses the election, and the criticism has been very harsh,” Seppänen said. “But I think she (Marin) has a lot of support anyway.”While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted Finland to seek NATO membership in May 2022, neither the historic decision to abandon the nation’s non-alignment policy nor the war have emerged as major campaign issues. Finland shares a long land border with Russia.Apart from Finland's economy, other issues the parties debated during the election campaign were the government’s increasing debt, climate change, education, immigration and social benefits.”I know Sanna Marin is very popular, and she has done great, and most Finns also think that she has done an amazing job with the coronavirus (pandemic),” another voter, Evelina Mäkelä, said in Helsinki.“But maybe we have to look at the new crisis that we have; some of us still believe that she does a very good job. Other people want something new, apparently,” Mäkelä said.Finland, which is expected to join NATO in the coming weeks, is a European Union member with a population of 5.5 million.Polls close at 1700 GMT (12 p.m. Eastern). Initial results are expected by midnight.___Kostya Manenkov and David Keyton in Helsinki contributed to this report.",2023/04/02,,World

Latest polls have suggested a tight race between center-right prime minister Boyko Borisov's GERB party and ex-prime minister Kiril Petkov's liberal We Continue the Change (PP).Both parties are polling at 26% of the votes.This time, Petkov's PP, a centrist party, has formed an alliance with a small right-wing party called Democratic Bulgaria.Polls opened at 7:00 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Sunday and are expected to close at 8:00 pm. The official result of the elections is expected to be announced within four days.Similar to previous elections, corruption and soaring inflation have taken center stage in Sunday's ballot.Three years ago, massive anti-corruption protests broke out in Bulgaria but instead of bringing a positive change, the demonstrations have led to a series of elections.Ending his leadership of 10 years, Borisov lost power in 2021 after allegations of graft. Since then, the country's political parties have failed to form stable coalitions which led to political turmoil and interim governments.Bulgaria is a member of the EU and NATO alliance but shares deep historical and cultural ties with Russia which impacted Bulgaria's political landscape.Towards the end of 2022, the Bulgarian parliament approved the first military aid package for Ukraine but President Rumen Radev announced that Bulgaria would not send arms to Kyiv without an interim Cabinet in power.Pro-Russian Radev, has appointed interim cabinets between inconclusive elections and has criticized Petkov and his allies as ""warmongers.""mf/sms (dpa, AFP, AP)",2023/04/02,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853668,Paris decides on future of city's e-scooters in vote,"Voters in the city of Paris were called to take part in a consultation on Sunday to decide whether to ban the use of rentable electric scooters in the French capital.Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced the vote in January, which she described as a ""public consultation"" rather than a referendum, to settle the issue of the divisive means of transport ahead of the 2024 Olympics hosted by the city.The pro-cycling mayor from the Socialist Party has come out in favor of the ban, calling the e-scooters a ""source of tension and worry,"" but she has promised to respect the result of the vote.Some 1.6 million people are eligible to vote, including non-French EU residents of the city, but turnout will likely be low.This is expected to help the ban camp, but the other side is trying to encourage young people to get out and vote.The three companies that operators of e-scooters in the city — Lime, Dott and Tier — have said they transported nearly 2 million people last year, of which 71% were under 35.They are offering free round-trips on Sunday to those users who say they are voting. The companies have also paid social media influencers to back their cause.E-scooters are also popular among the French capital's many tourists, but they are not able to vote and are, in fact, a large part of why some people want a ban.Critics say that tourists often do not know how to deal with the city's frenetic traffic or disrespect the rules, riding on sidewalks and traveling two to a scooter.""I regularly, in fact pretty much all the time, see tourists riding them in pairs, people who often are oblivious to what they are doing, who aren't in control of the scooter,"" Parisian Raphael Sicat told the Associated Press, adding that he often sees the for-hire scooters involved in crashes.There is also a debate over whether the scooters are environmentally friendly.Transport Minister Clement Beaune, who would support a continuation of e-scooters in Paris with more rules, said e-scooters have replaced up to one in five journeys that would otherwise have been made with emissions-producing vehicles.But critics point to the fact that the batteries have a life expectancy of around just three years and most journeys e-scooters replace would be made on foot or public transport.ab/sms (AP, AFP)",2023/04/02,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853680,Taiwan uses drones to fight lychee pests,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Both lychee and longan fruit trees flower in April, which also corresponds with the spawning period for a major fruit tree pest, the lychee stink bug.Changhua County took extra precautions this year, using drones to release parastitic wasps (Anastatus fulloi), which are a natural nemesis of lychee stink bugs, according to LTN. Boxes of these wasps were transported by drone to hard to reach areas to engage in natural biological control.Changhua County’s Department of Agriculture said lychee trees are blooming well this year, even better than previous years. This is beneficial to local bees who are busy collecting honey and engaging in pollination at the same time.For the sake of the bees, as well as their work in pollination, agricultural officials are encouraging farmers to stop using chemical agents during this important lychee flowering period, instead, making use of biological control methods like parasitic wasps.Adult lychee stink bugs begin to appear in large numbers in May, and can damage fruit from July to August. During spawning, parasitic wasps prey on lychee stink bug eggs, with female wasps laying their eggs in the eggs of the lychee stink bugs.This prevents lychee stink bugs from hatching, and it also helps give rise to more parasitic wasps, which emerge from lychee stink bug eggs 20 days later, further helping control the lychee stink bug population.Farmers seek biological control methods for lychee stink bugs. (Changhua County Government photo)The first wave of parasitic wasp release was completed on March 29, followed by a second and third release timed to take place at intervals of 10 to 14 days. A total of 1.44 million parasitic wasps will be released to protect local fruit trees.Starting in May, drones will begin to spray eco-friendly pesticides such as saponins, which prevent lychee stink bugs from building nests. From past experience, this two-pronged strategy of parasitic wasps and natural pesticides has been quite effective.",2023/04/02,423,Environment
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853681,Mozambique works to contain cholera outbreak after cyclone,"QUELIMANE, Mozambique (AP) — Weeks after massive Cyclone Freddy hit Mozambique for a second time, the still-flooded country is facing a spiraling cholera outbreak that threatens to add to the devastation.There were over 19,000 confirmed cases of cholera across eight of Mozambique’s provinces as of March 27, according to U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a figure which had almost doubled in a week.Freddy was likely the longest-lived cyclone ever, lasting over five weeks and hitting Mozambique twice. The tropical storm killed 165 people in Mozambique, 17 in Madagascar and 676 in Malawi. More than 530 people are still missing in Malawi two weeks later so that country's death toll could well exceed 1,200.Freddy made its second landfall in Mozambique's Zambezia province, where scores of villages remain flooded and water supplies are still contaminated.At a hospital in Quelimane, Zambezia’s provincial capital, National Institute of Health director general Eduardo Sam Gudo Jr reported there were 600 new confirmed cases a day in Quelimane district alone, but said that the real number may be as high as 1,000.At least 31 died of cholera in Zambezia and over 3,200 were hospitalized between March 15 and 29, according to data from the Ministry of Health.Cases are highest in the neighborhood of Icidua on the city outskirts, where most residents live in bamboo or adobe mud huts and fetch water in buckets from communal wells. Flooding brought by the cyclone has exposed many of these wells to water contaminated with sewage overflow and other sources of bacteria. Cholera spreads through feces, often when it gets into drinking water.But until water pipelines ruptured in the floods are repaired, these wells are the only source of water for those in Icidua and communities like it. For now, temporary solutions offer the only hope of stemming the outbreak.Volunteers go from house to house distributing bottles of Certeza, a local chlorine-based water purifier. Each bottle should last a family for a week, but supplies are running low as local production struggles to keep pace with demand. There are also not enough people to distribute the Certeza, even if greater supplies could be procured, Gudo said.In the meantime, health workers are struggling to treat the infected with many clinics and hospitals badly damaged. “The cyclone destroyed the infrastructure here,” said José da Costa Silva, the clinical director of the Icidua health center. “We are working in parts of the hospital that were not destroyed. Some colleagues are working outside in the open because there’s not enough space available for everyone.”Eighty health centers in total were affected by Freddy’s two landfalls in Mozambique, according to INGD, the country’s disaster management agency.Although cyclones do occur in southern Africa from December to May, human-caused climate change has made tropical cyclones wetter, more intense and more frequent. The now-dissipated natural La Nina event also worsened cyclone activity in the region. While Cyclone Freddy itself hasn’t yet been attributed to climate change, researchers say it has all the right hallmarks of a warming-fueled weather event.Formed in early February off Australia, the cyclone with exceptional longevity made an unprecedented crossing of more than 8000 kilometers (5,000 miles) from east to west across the Indian Ocean.It followed a looping path rarely recorded by meteorologists, hitting Madagascar and Mozambique for the first time at the end of February, and then again in March before barrelling into Malawi.Restoring normal water supplies in Mozambique will take time, as many damaged pipelines run through areas that are still inaccessible two weeks after the cyclone’s last impact.“A cholera outbreak in a flooded flatland with a very high water table is ‘mission impossible’ to address,” Myrta Kaulard, the UN resident coordinator in Mozambique, told Associated Press. “Sanitation is a huge problem and the flooding has affected key infrastructure, such as the water pipelines and the electricity supply … Repairing that infrastructure in flooded areas is another ‘mission impossible.’”Meanwhile, rural areas around Quelimane are facing other threats. Many villages and fields are still underwater, and the humidity has bred swarms of mosquitoes carrying malaria. In a makeshift displacement camp on the bank of a flooded rice paddy near the village of Nicoadala, 20 out of 290 residents are sick with malaria, according to Hilário Milisto Irawe, a local chief.There were 444 reported cases of malaria in Quelimane district on 24 March alone, but the number is likely much higher as many, such as those in the camp outside Nicoadala, lack access to health facilities.Compounding the public health crisis, the material livelihoods of hundreds of thousands are at risk as Freddy hit just before the main harvest. It also carried seawater inland, threatening the long term fertility of the soil in an area where malnutrition is already chronic.“All our farms are flooded. Our rice farms are destroyed. All we can do is start over again, but we don’t know how we will do that,” said Irawe.",2023/04/02,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4853683,Verstappen wins in wild finish to F1 Australian Grand Prix,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Red Bull’s Max Verstappen claimed his first Australian Grand Prix on Sunday in remarkable circumstances after a chaotic F1 race filled with drama from the green light to the checkered flag.Although Red Bull’s first triumph in Melbourne since 2011 was expected, the carnage that unfolded in the latter stages of the race at Albert Park made it an extremely hard-fought win.Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, who drove superbly in his Mercedes, finished second, while Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso took third spot on the podium.Only 12 of the 20 starters finished the race, with Australian Oscar Piastri making the most of the disorder to finish eighth and claim his first championship points for McLaren.Verstappen was pleased to clinch victory but queried the decision by stewards to issue a red flag after a crash on lap 55 of the 58-lap race instead of deploying a safety car.He held a comfortable lead at that stage but then had to fight to hold the front position from Hamilton when the race was restarted.“Of course we are happy to win the race, but I think the race itself towards the end was a bit of a mess with all the calls,” Verstappen said. “It left a lot of drivers confused as to why we needed a second red flag. Today was quite messy.”Hamilton was delighted with the improvement Mercedes showed in Melbourne, which included a competitive qualifying performance on Saturday.“It was very unexpected,” he said. “Getting a second and third in qualifying yesterday blew us all away and provided a huge boost of energy throughout the team.”On the restart on lap 55, Verstappen was able to hold off Hamilton to the first turn as bedlam unfolded behind his Red Bull, resulting in a reshuffle of the finishing order.Alonso, who had challenged Hamilton for second position throughout much of the race, was hit by Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz on the first corner of the restart.Sainz, whose Ferrari showed good speed throughout the race, was issued with a five-second penalty that relegated him to 12th.The Ferrari driver was upset with the decision and Alonso later said he believed the penalty issued to his rival was too harsh.In a separate incident, Williams driver Logan Sargeant drove into the back of Nyck de Vries and the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly also exited the race after crashing into each other.Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc crashed on the opening lap, while the Mercedes of one-time leader George Russell caught fire on Lap 18.After claiming his maiden pole position in Australia on Saturday, Verstappen was out sprinted to the first turn by Russell in a lively opening.By the third turn Hamilton had also passed the Dutchman, raising the prospect an improved Mercedes team might be able to pull off a stunning upset.But those hopes diminished when Williams’ Alexander Albon lost control on Lap 7 and crashed into the wall, which resulted in the first red flag.Russell had already headed to the pits when race stewards decided the debris left on the track from the accident was a safety issue that could only be resolved by stopping the race.This left the English driver in seventh spot, though he was forced out of the race altogether shortly after the resumption.“When it is not your day, it is not your day,” Russell wrote on social media.The race resumed with Verstappen stalking Hamilton at the front of the field and the two-time world champion used his Red Bull’s superior speed to take the lead on Lap 12.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/04/02,,World
