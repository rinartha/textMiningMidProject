https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831708,Ukraine updates: Kyiv decries civilian deaths in Russian missile blitz,"Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy has denounced Russia's military for launching the largest wave of missiles and exploding drones on his territory in almost a month.In his evening video message, Zelenskky said the massive pre-dawn airstrikesearlier on Thursday were ""another attempt by the terrorist state to wage war against civilization.""Ukraine said at least nine civilians were killed during the onslaught, which included missiles fired at Kyiv, and power was knocked out in several areas of the country.Those killed were villagers in the western Lviv region, closer to the frontline in the central Dnieper region, and the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials said.The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russian forces took control of a year ago, was left depending on backup generators for several hours.Ukraine's military said the country's air defenses had shot down many drones and missiles during the pre-dawn wave of attacks on Thursday.Kyiv said Russia had also fired six Kinzhal hypersonic cruise missiles, which it had no way to stop.Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its 12-month-long invasion. The Russian Defense Ministry said it had carried out a ""massive retaliatory strike"" as payback for a cross-border raid last week.The Russian ministry claimed to have destroyed Ukrainian drone bases, disrupted railways and damaged facilities that make and repair arms.Moscow also confirmed it had used Kinzhal — Russian for dagger — missiles in Thursday's attack.The White House said the missile barrage was ""devastating"" to see and Washington would continue to provide Ukraine with air defense capabilities.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Friday, March 10:Britain's Defense Ministry said the latest Russian air attacks had included at least 80 long-range missiles, which targeted critical Ukrainian infrastructure.It said the blitz was likely one of the largest since December and the first major wave of long-range strikes since February 16.The Ministry posited that the interval between the waves of strikes was likely due to the need to stockpile newly produced weapons before it has the resources to launch a big enough strike to ""credibly overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.""Ukraine's military said it warded off 102 Russian attacks on the eastern mining town of Bakhmut over the past 24 hours.Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia's Wagner private army which has led the fighting in the town, said Wednesday his forces controlled all of the city east of a river through it.It is not possible to independently verify the battlefield reports.Bakhmut has been the focus of months of fierce combat and both sides have sustained heavy losses in the battle for the town.Moscow says Bakhmut's capture will help its forces secure the surrounding Donbas region, a major war aim.NATO has warned that Bakhmut could fall to Russia ""in the coming days"" but said it would ""not necessarily reflect any turning point in the war.""Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said Ukrainian defenders had foiled Russian attempts to completely surround Bakhmut from the west.The frontline to the south had held for several days, but the Russians had made some headway in villages to the north.An aide to Zelenskyy told Italy's La Stampa newspaper that Ukraine has decided to fight on in the ruined city because the battle there is
pinning down Russia's best units.""We have two objectives: to reduce their capable personnel as much as possible, and to fix them in a few key wearisome battles, to disrupt their offensive and concentrate our resources elsewhere, for the spring counter-offensive,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak. ""So, today Bakhmut is completely effective, even exceeding its key tasks.""In its latest update, the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russia's Wagner forces maybe be conducting a temporary tactical pause in eastern Bakhmut to ""wait for Russian reinforcements and replenish themselves.""ISW said the private Russian army has been ""conducting highly attritional frontal assaults on eastern Bakhmut for nine months and are likely not prepared to conduct a crossing of the Bakhmutka River to the Bakhmut city center at this time.""It added that the offensive had ""likely consumed a significant amount of Wagner personnel and resources"" over the past nine months.The think tank said it was unclear if Wagner fighters will retain their ""operational preponderance"" going forward.""The arrival of an increased number of conventional Russian forces to the area may suggest that Russian forces intend to offset the possible culmination of Wagner's offensive operations in Bakhmut with new conventional troops,"" the ISW update added.In its morning update Friday, the Ukrainian general staff reported a large number of attacks along the front and said ""the enemy is
not halting its attacks on Bakhmut.""Pope Francis on Friday spoke of his readiness to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin in an attempt to help achieve peace in Ukraine.Asked by the Italian Swiss television channel RSI what he would say to Putin, Francis said: ""I would speak to him clearly as I speak in public. He is a cultured man.""""On the second day of the war, I was at the Russian Embassy to the Holy See to say that I was willing to go to Moscow on condition that Putin would give me a window to negotiate,"" the pope added. ""[Russian Foreign Minister Sergey] Lavrov wrote to me saying 'Thank you but it's not the time.' Putin knows I'm available.""Francis added that the conflict was fuelled by ""imperial interests, not just of the Russian empire, but of empires from elsewhere.""He said it was the work of empires ""to put other nations in second place.""His full interview will air Sunday but extracts were published Friday by Italian newspapers.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Friday said Russia and the United States remained in contact over the New START nuclear arms treaty, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.His comments come despite Moscow having suspended its participation in the deal.Ryabkov said he had no expectations for significant progress from contact between Moscow and Washington.The 2010 agreement limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads each side can deploy.President Vladimir Putin announced last month that Moscow was suspending it, accusing the United States of trying to inflict a ""strategic defeat"" on Russia in Ukraine.mm/sms (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/10,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831710,Georgian parliament drops 'foreign agents' bill,"The Georgian parliament dropped on Friday a bill that brands organizations receiving funding from abroad as ""foreign agents"" after the ruling party abandoned it following mass protests in the capital.The controversial bill failed to garner enough votes in its second reading in parliament. On Thursday, responding to protests, the ruling Georgian Dream party announced it was withdrawing support for the bill.The proposed bill, similar to laws in Russia, would have classified non-governmental organizations and media outlets as ""foreign agents"" if they received 20% or more of their funding from abroad.The proposal was officially to target the disclosure of money flows from abroad, but protesters feared it would be used to harass government critics and clamp down on the opposition.Out of the 36 legislators who voted on the bill, only one voted in favor.Outside parliament, hundreds of anti-government protesters rallied. Opposition parties had vowed in a joint briefing on Thursday to continue protesting until the bill was dropped and all arrested protesters were released.Protests ignited on Tuesday after the initial reading of the bill in parliament. Protesters clashed with police, with some 77 arrests made on Tuesday and Wednesday.Protesters were on the streets again on Thursday night, even after the ruling party said it would withdraw the bill.The bill has garnered much criticism due to its similarity to a 2012 Russian law that also brands organizations receiving foreign funding as ""foreign agents."" The notorious Russian law has been used to crack down on dissent, particularly since Russia invaded Ukraine last year.Many Georgians pushing for the country to join the EU and NATO also feared the proposed legislation would complicate their already long route to joining the blocs.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell had called the draft legislation a ""very bad development,"" adding that it could hurt Georgia's ties with the bloc.Last year, the EU refrained from granting Georgia candidate status alongside Moldova and Ukraine. It said political and judicial reforms were needed first.rmt/sms (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831711,Going local: Why microadventures are all the rage,"Microwhat? Microwaves? Nope, not quite. Microadventures — a term coined in 2014 by British author and explorer Alastair Humphreys — are currently all the rage. They're all about rediscovering and appreciating our immediate surroundings. Some of us may be lucky enough to live nearby lush forests, tranquil lakes, gushing rivers, rolling hills, dramatic mountains or the mighty ocean. Whatever the case may be, the point of a microadventure is to explore the gorgeous nature on our doorsteps, get out of our comfort zones and experience something new. In his book about microadventures, Humphreys writes that ""you do not need to fly to the other side of the planet to find wilderness and beauty."" Microadventures, he says, are adventures ""close to home: Cheap, simple, short"" offering the ""essence of big adventures, the challenge, the fun, the escapism, the learning experiences and the excitement.""The coronavirus pandemic produced a veritable microadventure boom in 2020. With pandemic-related travel restrictions in place across much of the world, many Europeans spent their holidays at home. And with the doom and gloom of constantly updated coronavirus infection figures and hospitalization rates in the media, many people welcomed an escape into the outdoors. Google Trends show that searches for the German term ""Mikroabenteuer"" spiked in the summer of 2022 — Austrians, the Swiss and Germans were busily planning getaways in the great outdoors, albeit close to home.Bianca Gade, a Brazilian native based in Germany's southern state of Saarland, was one of them. She is fortunate enough to live nearby the Hunsrück mountain range, which is perfect for nature lovers. Gade is an outdoor enthusiast who runs a blog with travel trips and first-hand accounts of her latest microadventures which she says are designed to ""inspire others that sometimes you don't need to embark on long-distance travels to escape your daily routine and have some fun."" To her, microadventures are energizing experiences that entail one or several overnight stays, ideally in a tent.Sometimes she plans hikes that more or less follow a railway line, setting up her tent in local forests to get a night's rest. This way, she has a destination staked out but also knows she can always catch a train home when she's had enough. Other times, she will set off without a fixed route, which she finds even more exciting. ""Those spontaneous, eventful jaunts feels like real adventures to me,"" she says.Like Gade, Berlin-based journalist René Wilbrandt also enjoys microadventures. Usually, Wilbrandt and a friend will set off for 24 hour excursions. He recently embarked on a winter microadventure in rural Brandenburg, south of the German capital. ""We hiked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) on the first day, then spent the night by a lake, and walked another 5 kilometers (3 miles) the following day,"" he recalls. Keen to travel light, they had only brought food, sleeping mats, sleeping bags and Bivouac sacks, which keep out the water and wind.Depending on the kind of microadventure you're considering and the season, a bit of preparation may be advisable, especially when you plan on spending a night in the great outdoors. In Germany, as in most other European countries, it is not legal to camp anywhere you like. But in practice, people who set up a tent at dusk, pack up and go around dawn without leaving any trace or trash behind them are sometimes tolerated, Gade says. Notably, Sweden is one of the few European countries where the freedom to roam allows anyone to walk and camp wherever they want.In recent years, more and more trekking camps have sprung up around Germany and Europe. Often situated deep inside forests or along rivers, these camps provide space to pitch tents, offer basic toilet facilities and sometimes allow campfires, making them ideal for anyone on a microadventure. Trekking camps tend to be closed during the colder months and may require pre-booking during spring and summer, with stays often limited to one night.So the next time you crave a change of scenery and yearn for some off-grid fun and find yourself scanning the internet for flights, reconsider. A microadventure close to home may be just what you need. And a positive side-effect: Traveling this way is generally inexpensive and environmentally friendly.",2023/03/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831712,Can Europe's fashion industry go green if sales keep rising?,"When sustainability expert Lars Mortensen tried to work out how European lifestyles were damaging the environment, he found three big problems lawmakers were trying to tackle: The homes in which we live, the food on our plates and the cars and planes we use to get around.But it was the fourth — the clothes we wear — that had escaped their attention for decades.Textiles have not been regulated in detail, said Mortensen from the European Environment Agency. ""Most textiles are produced outside Europe, which means the majority of the impacts happen outside Europe.""The European Union is now pushing to clean up the fashion industry — and the standards it sets could force retailers to fix dirty supply chains in other parts of the world.By 2030, it wants all clothes sold on its market to be durable, repairable and recyclable. Labels will have to be clearer. More clothes will have to be made from recycled fibers. ""Fast fashion is out of fashion,"" the European Commission said in the strategy it announced last year.But with greenhouse gas emissions rising, and ship after ship of unwanted clothes landing in ports across Africa and Asia, experts fear the industry is actually moving in the opposite direction.To stop the planet heating 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7°F) — the level world leaders said they would work to achieve — the apparel sector would have to emit 45% less by 2030, according to a report from the environmental nonprofit World Resources Institute. Instead, it is set to emit about 55% more.The global clothing industry pumps out 2% of the gases heating the planet each year. Most of these comes from production. It also uses fossil fuels to make synthetic fibers and scarce land and water to grow plants like cotton.Many of the biggest retailers, like H&M and Zara, have based their business model around mass-producing cheap clothes and bringing out new styles on a weekly basis. Newer entrants like Shein have ramped that up with new styles coming out every single day.Some companies, under pressure from customers and investors, have brought out collections they market as sustainable and set targets to clean up their business. Fast fashion giant H&M, for instance, plans to cut emissions 56% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2040. Inditex, the owner of Spanish retailer Zara, aims to get there in the same year.But cutting environmental damage while sales rise is a tall order. After being worn — and sometimes without even that — most clothes end up in landfills or incinerators. Data from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity pushing to cut waste, suggests only 13% of the material used to produce clothing is recycled in some form. Less than 1% is used made into new clothing.Consumption is ""the elephant in the room,"" said Eliot Metzger, head of sustainable business at the World Resources Institute. ""Not a lot of companies are ready to acknowledge that they can't just keep selling more stuff to more people forever.""The average European consumes 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of textiles each year, including non-clothing items like curtains and industrial fabrics, and sends about a quarter of it abroad, mostly to Africa and Asia, according to a report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) in February. Clothes are collected voluntarily, often by charity shops, then resold.In the last two decades, Europe's exports of used textiles have tripled to nearly 1.7 million tons. But their fate is ""highly uncertain"", the EEA found. ""We simply don't know what happens,"" said Mortensen, who co-authored the report.In Africa, where Europe sends 46% of its used textiles, there is a market for cheap, second-hand clothing. But a large and unknown fraction ends up in landfills, or litters streets and rivers. In Ghana, which is one of the biggest recipients, one study estimated 40% ends up as waste. Traders in the capital Accra say some of the clothes are made too poorly to be worn again.In Asia, where Europe sends 41% of its unwanted textiles, exports are more likely to be sorted and processed. The big recipient countries, like Pakistan and United Arab Emirates, act as shipping hubs to the rest of the world.The fabrics are often downcycled. This can mean making waste clothes into industrial rags or building insulation. Clothes that don't get treated are often burned, sometimes in industry, or sent to landfill.With little sign of production slowing, the amount of clothing shipped abroad is set to rise — and efforts to tackle waste could increase it further.Today, only about one-third of the EU's textile waste is collected for reuse and recycling. From 2025, however, member states will have to collect all of it. Retailers will be partly responsible for funding the system.But without a big push to boost the continent's recycling capacity, Europe will not be able to process all the clothes it collects. Nor will the countries to which it exports, said Mortensen. ""Incineration is the most obvious destiny for textiles,"" he said.There are some efforts to fix this. The EU plans to restrict shipments to countries that are not part of the OECD, a group of mostly rich countries, if they can't handle it sustainably. It wants to force companies who export waste to check that the facilities receiving the clothes handle it in an environmentally sound way.The strategy also tries to address the underlying issue with the fashion industry: too many clothes that are not made to last. The EU wants to make it easier to repair clothes, design them for a longer life and fight greenwashing with better labeling. Campaigners have criticized fashion brands for highlighting small efforts to cut their environmental footprint while profiting from unsustainable practices.If a business model is based on overproduction, ""having one line of t-shirts made from organic cotton doesn't really do the trick,"" said Theresa Mörsen from campaign group Zero Waste Europe. ""The most sustainable thing is not to buy anything.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831713,Turkey's blockade 'makes NATO weaker',"The press conference of Sweden's chief negotiator in the NATO process, Oscar Stenström, was called at short notice. Staffers rushed to hastily put two tables together at NATO headquarters in Brussels. A bunch of mostly Swedish media gathered around to get a sense of whether progress had been made after the resumption of talks between Sweden, Finland and Turkey on Thursday.""We see that Turkey has recognized that both Sweden and Finland have taken concrete steps"" to address Ankara's concerns, Stenström said, describing that as ""a good sign"" and emphasizing that talks will continue.In Brussels, and even more so in the Swedish capital Stockholm, however, frustration is growing with Turkey's blockade of Sweden's and Finland's membership of the NATO defence alliance.If the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continues with that, ""it hurts NATO unity, and then we have a real problem,"" Anna Wieslander, director for Northern Europe at the Atlantic Council think tank told DW from Stockholm.It is one thing when negotiations are a matter of hours or days, she said, ""but when it goes on like this, it undermines the security of the whole alliance and makes it look weaker.""Sweden and Finland simultaneously handed in their official letters of application to join NATO on May 17, 2022.Erdogan's government has been resisting calls by the United States and other allies to ratify the Nordic states' membership for months now. Turkey's reluctance to drop objections, which some see as motivated by Erdogan's desire to rally his voters ahead of a tough reelection bid, has turned the promise of a fast-track membership for Sweden and Finland into empty talk. Both countries are left in limbo without a timeline.The resumption of talks is ""in itself an important thing after a long period without any talks,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told DW ahead of Thursday's meeting, adding that he is confident Sweden and Finland will eventually become NATO allies.Government officials in Stockholm, however, indicate there was not much more Sweden could offer to convince Turkey.Finland, which has less bilateral issues with Turkey, appears to be caught in between Turkey and Sweden. Its negotiators seem conspicuously silent these days.""Under normal circumstances, both Finland and Sweden are countries with whom Turkey has traditionally had good relations,"" said former Turkish diplomat Alper Coskun, who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.However, he pointed to issues that Turkey has been having with Sweden, in particular issues that Turkey was raising with Sweden before the country officially lodged its NATO bid.Ankara is concerned with what it sees as Sweden's longtime support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) — an organization that has attacked non-military targets and killed civilians in Turkey. The US and the European Union have designated it as a terrorist organization.Sweden has rejected such accusations. But in a trilateral memorandum signed last July, the country committed ""to prevent activities of the PKK and all other terrorist organizations, as well as activities by individuals in affiliated and inspired groups or networks.""Since then, the government in Stockholm has introduced changes to its intelligence services and to some provisions of its constitution. In addition, a new anti-terrorism law will be brought to a vote in the Swedish parliament. Supporting or financing a terrorist organization will then be punished by up to four years in prison.All that, however, does not seem to satisfy Turkey. When it comes to terrorism, the Turkish government feels misunderstood by its partners and allies. And that has a big influence on how Ankara acts within NATO, former diplomat Coskun explained.""Rightly or wrongly, the mindset in Turkey is that the country is up against an existential threat from terrorism, and particularly the PKK,"" he said, adding that Turkey has been raising this issue with countries across Europe. ""Sweden is on that list of countries where Turkey believes its threat perceptions are not — or have not been — paid due attention to,"" Coskun said.For some Western diplomats, however, Ankara has become an enigmatic and unreliable partner, and its president is often perceived as an obstructionist. In 2009, he tried to block the appointment of a new NATO chief from Denmark, arguing that the country was too tolerant of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and too supportive of Kurdish rebels.A few years later, Erdogan delayed for months a NATO defense plan for Poland and the Baltic states, demanding the alliance agree to designating Syrian Kurdish fighters as terrorists.Erdogan's objections to Sweden's and Finland's membership have now renewed questions about whether the alliance might be better off without Turkey.Critics say Erdogan's regime undermines NATO's standards for democratic governance, while his at times cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin undermined NATO's interests.""NATO does not have an exclusion paragraph, and that's very deliberate,"" Wieslander from the Atlantic Council said. Such a clause was ""on the table when the North Atlantic Treaty was prepared, but it was withdrawn because some European allies didn't want it,"" she explained. Wieslander said she does not consider it a realistic option to exclude Turkey anyway — particularly at a time when a war is raging in Europe. ""It is better to have them in the alliance,"" she said.Turkey, with the second-largest army in NATO, an advanced industry and a crucial geographic position at the intersection of Europe and Asia, is clearly a factor to be reckoned with. But ""it is important that the US and other bigger allies do everything they can to push Turkey,"" Wieslander said.She pointed to the fact that Sweden's and Finland's membership was crucial to NATO's security in terms of defense and deterrence regarding the new Russian threat, and when it comes to the new long-term strategic competition with China. ""This is really a time for everyone to speak up and say: 'Turkey cannot go on like this',"" Wieslander said.According to Coskun, ""if rational decision-making prevails in Ankara and if Sweden can move the needle a little bit,"" Turkey will eventually give up its resistance to Sweden and Finland's NATO membership.But he did not expect any decision before Turkey's upcoming general elections, which are scheduled in mid-May.""It would be in Turkey's interests not to create a negative legacy, either with Finland or Sweden or with the alliance overall, given the perceptions that this is triggering,"" Coskun said.But Turkey is a complicated country, he added, and ""the crystal ball gets very, very fuzzy when you look into it.""Edited by: K.

On Friday (March 10), UDN reported that China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) acknowledged that a man had been rescued by the Coast Guard and was taken immediately to a hospital.

A legislator representing Kinmen, Jessica Chen (陳玉珍), made a video press release on Friday afternoon addressing the missing soldier. She said the soldier was suffering from psychological problems and that it was a simple case of desertion and that he should not be considered a communist.The TAO office has not yet confirmed the identity of the person who was rescued. However, Jessica Chen indicated that the soldier was wearing a life jacket and totally exhausted when he was discovered by a Chinese Coast Guard patrol boat not far from the tiny island of Sandan, about halfway between Erdan and the coast of Fujian.As a representative of Kinmen, Chen said she is prepared to coordinate with the Chinese side to resolve the issue. She also called on the central government to pay more attention to the condition of frontline soldiers and do more to ensure their morale and psychological health.UDN also reported that the county executive of Kinmen, Chen Fu-hai (陳福海), has made efforts to resolve the issue. He reportedly asked the Kinmen Red Cross to make inquiries with their counterpart in Fujian to inquire about the medical condition and location of the young soldier.",2023/03/10,2904,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831831,German football chief: 'We will scrutinize FIFA',"German Football Association (DFB) President Bernd Neuendorf was all smiles as he greeted the journalists who turned out to a media event this week at the newly opened DFB Academy in Frankfurt. Twelve months after being elected to the post, the 61-year-old took stock of what was a difficult first year at the helm.In his opening statement to reporters, Neuendorf stressed that he and his team were not focused on quick fixes but long-term solutions, as the DFB faces major economic challenges.""When the (men's) national team is successful, things are well with the DFB,"" said the organization's treasurer, Stephan Grunwald, who sat beside Neuendorf in the Academy classroom where the media had gathered.Following the failure of the men's national team to advance from the group stage not just in Qatar last year, but also at the previous World Cup in Russia in 2018, it's Grunwald's job to get the DFB back on track financially.""It's comparable to a club being relegated from the Champions League to the second division,"" Grunwald said, explaining that the national team's revenue was highly dependent on its success on the pitch. He said his department expected the DFB to make losses of €19.5 million ($20.7 million) for the current fiscal year.""Things can't go on like this for the next 10 years, because if they do, the association will no longer exist,"" Grunwald warned.He also noted that a lack of success on the pitch made contract negotiations with sponsors much more difficult.For his part, Neuendorf assured reporters that the DFB was already implementing changes aimed at resolving the situation.""I am optimistic that we will manage to eliminate this structural deficit,"" the DFB president said.Apart from the financial difficulties, tensions also emerged between the DFB and football's world governing body FIFA during the Qatar World Cup, particularly surrounding a FIFA threat of sanctions that stopped national team captain Manuel Neuer from wearing a ""one-love"" armband, as had been intended. Neuendorf has also not always seen eye-to-eye with Infantino on human rights issues.Speaking exclusively to DW after the media event, Neuendorf described the DFB's relationship with FIFA as ""professionally critical."" At the same time, though, he said his association reserved the right to turn the spotlight on the world body, as and when necessary.""As the largest association in the world, we believe we have the right to take a close look at what is happening at FIFA. And we also dig deeper if we don't get satisfactory answers about certain processes.""While Neuendorf noted that the DFB and FIFA had much common ground, including the development of football worldwide, he also explained that ""to me, there is often a lack of transparency in how decisions are made.""On Wednesday, representatives from the global body's 211 member associations are to gather for the 73rd FIFA Congress in the Rwandan capital, Kigali. A key point on the agenda will be the reelection of Gianni Infantino as FIFA president. Victory is assured, as there is no opposing candidate.Still, there will be a vote. Neuendorf said that whether Infantino gets the DFB's will depend on the information FIFA provides on the changes Infantino pledged in Qatar. These include more workers' protection safeguards, which as yet have not been revealed, despite requests from the DFB.""I remember his [Infantino's] press conference in Doha and the promises he made there,"" Neuendorf said. ""I have to admit that I don't really have the feeling that this is being worked on at the moment.""The DFB president says he is committed to pushing for change at FIFA. But the DFB will find itself in a better position to do that if Neuendorf wins election to the FIFA Council in a vote to be held in April. If he does win a seat on the Council, the DFB president has pledged to ""keep highlighting the sore points.""Neuendorf is hoping other European associations will support his candidacy and has been actively working the phones in recent weeks. He has had regular conversations with his Norwegian counterpart, Lise Klaveness, in particular.""The will for change is palpable,"" Neuendorf said. ""Now it's just a matter of finding allies.""This article was adapted from German.",2023/03/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831832,Erdogan calls early Turkish elections for May,"Turkey will hold early presidential and parliamentary elections on May 14, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan formally announced on Friday, three months after the devastating earthquakes that killed more than 47,000 people.""May this decision benefit our country and our people,"" Erdogan said in televised remarks from the presidential palace in Ankara.The country had been expected to go to the polls on June 18, but Erdogan cited the Muslim Hajj pilgrimage, school holidays and university entrance exams coinciding in mid-June as among the main reasons for moving the vote forward a month.There had also been speculation that the vote would have to be postponed as the February 6 quakes have left millions of people homeless across southern Turkey.The next election is widely seen as the most consequential vote of Turkey's post-Ottoman history, giving voters a stark choice between keeping Erdogan's Islamic-rooted party in power until 2028 or handing the reins back to an alliance led by the country's main secular party.Erdogan has been a popular leader since he was first elected as prime minister in 2003 and president in 2014, but he has faced stiff criticism for his increasingly autocratic leadership.His crackdown on dissent was ramped up following a failed coup in July 2016, leading to around 150,000 civil servants being fired and more than 50,000 people arrested.The Turkish economy has been in crisis for two years, partly as a result of Erdogan's interference in monetary policy, which spurred inflation to a 24-year high of more than 85% in October.In recent days, the Turkish lira has fallen to a record low of nearly 19 to the US dollar, as the aftermath of last month's powerful earthquakes took its economic toll.Erdogan's government has also been censured for its response to the quakes and lack of preparedness in a country that sits on several seismic fault lines.Experts say that lax enforcement of building codes is a major reason why the disaster was so deadly.Erdogan has conceded shortfalls in the early stages of the response to the quakes but said that rescue efforts were hampered by winter weather and the destruction.He has promised to rebuild tens of thousands of homes within the year.The president said he would ban music at election campaign events as a mark of respect. He ordered candidates from his AK Party to contribute to the emergency fund for earthquake recovery work.""Our agenda during the election [campaign] will focus on efforts to heal the wounds of earthquake victims and to compensate for economic and social harm,"" he said.Few details were initially available as to how the votes will be held in the quake-hit southeastern region. But the government said that people will be able to vote wherever they are living at the time of the election.On Monday, the six-party main opposition alliance named Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP), as its candidate to challenge Erodgan for the presidency.The bloc has vowed to reverse many of Erdogan's policies on the economy, civil rights and foreign affairs.They have also promised to abolish the presidential system which they say amounted to ""one-man rule"" since it was introduced in 2018.The alliance is made up of a disparate array of parties, including nationalists, Islamists and conservatives.A pro-Kurdish party has, so far, been excluded from the bloc because of some of the other opposition leaders' more nationalist views.Polls suggest that both the presidential and parliamentary votes will be tight, with the opposition bloc running slightly ahead of the governing alliance.The election date will become official when the country's supreme election authority YSK approves Erdogan's decision, which is expected after a presidential decree is published in the Official Gazette on Saturday.If no candidate for the presidency secures more than 50% of the vote, a runoff will be held on May 28.mm/fb (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/10,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831834,EU agrees to curb energy use by 11.7% by 2030,"Negotiators from European Union member-states and the European Parliament struck on Friday a deal to reduce final energy consumption across the bloc by 11.7% by 2030.The agreement comes as the bloc strives to curb reliance on Russian energy and fight climate change.""Saving energy is a key step to saving the planet,"" EU Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said in a statement.""In recent months, Europeans have shown that they are ready and able to face this challenge, and our industry has proven that it can optimize its energy use and production processes,"" he added.The Green Deal will be referred to the European Parliament and member states for a final vote. This is usually a formality, with bills often getting approved without changes.Friday's deal comes as an amendment to an earlier 9% target, initially proposed in 2021. It is all part of the EU's plans to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.However, when Russia invaded Ukraine, the need for European countries to curb their reliance on fossil fuels, for which Russia was the biggest supplier, became more urgent.""This will mean real change for the benefit of the climate and disadvantage of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" the Reuters news agency quoted Niels Fuglsang, Parliament's lead negotiator, as saying.The deal comes as a compromise between the European Parliament, which was pushing for the far higher goal of 14%, and some EU countries who were keen on sticking to the original 9%.It means that EU member-states must save an average of 1.49% of final energy consumption per year between 2024 and 2030.The deal stipulates that the target would be legally binding. While bloc members have the freedom to set their own non-binding national goal, if they do not achieve the 11.7% goal, the European Commission will intervene to set a course.rmt/sms (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831835,India is ignoring its deadly snakebite crisis,"Last October, Himar Jatt was busy with his daily routine of grazing his camels in the dense mangroves of Bachau, a small district in the Gujarat state in India, when he suddenly felt a pain in his left foot.This was not the first time that the 37-year-old had been bitten by a snake, it was his third encounter in two years. This time, however, the pain was excruciating and his foot started to turn pale.When his foot began turning black he realized that he had been bitten by a venomous snake. He called his younger brother, who took him to a temple where a local priest started treating him by using a piece of cloth. For two hours he rubbed the wet cloth on his foot and recited mantras, but to no efffect.As he reached home, he lost his consciousness and blood started oozing out from his mouth. The next morning his brother took him to hospital in Rajkot, three hours away from his home. He didn't anticipate that he would end up staying there for 10 days. He was injected with dozens of anti-venom doses before surgery.""I was counting my last days in the hospital and the pain was so intense that I was just shouting. I have never felt anything like this in my life"" he told DW.The snake poison spread throughout his body and left him paralyzed for almost two months.Jatt's neighbor Baruah Bhil, a farmer, was also bitten by a snake in a similar incident last year. He was dead by the following day.He had visited to a quack doctor for treatment and returned home without taking any medication. His sudden death left the whole village stunned and gave rise to a deep sense of repulsion against treatments from local priests, Himar told DW.According to a 2020 study, an average of nearly 58,000 Indian citizens die each year due to snakebites. But experts say that actual numbers are likely higher because of unreported cases.Doctors and public health experts cite several reasons for the snakebite crisis, including holy reverence for the animal, lack of access to immediate first aid facilities, reliance on ""spiritual healers"" and a large share of the rural population living close to agricultural fields.There are over 300 snake species in India, of which 62 are identified as venomous and semi-venomous. But the most dangerous ones include the common krait, the Russell's viper and the Indian cobra, which kill many people each year.For the last fifteen years, Dayal Majumdar, who is one of the country's leading experts on snakebite treatment, has been visiting the small villages in the Radha Nagar area of West Bengal where numerous people have died from snakebites.During his visits to the villages, he witnessed an acute shortage of antivenom and a scarcity of healthcare facilities, which he believes is the main factor in the high number of casualties.""In India, snakebites don't receive a lot of attention because it is considered a poor man's disease, affecting farmers and people in rural areas,"" he told DW.Majumdar says addressing this deadly crisis is not an easy task and believes urgent government intervention is much needed. He campaigns in villages across West Bengal state and urges people to seek immediate treatment in the nearest medical center if bitten. During his tours, he discourages people from traditional treatment by faith healers or local priests.""The deaths related to snakebite cases are highly under-reported across the state and they don't get reported properly by government or hospitals which makes it difficult for doctors like me to tackle this crisis,"" he told DWThe World Health Organization (WHO) designated poisoning by snakebite a neglected tropical disease in 2017. In 2022, the agency launched a global initiative to halve the number of snakebite deaths and disabilities by 2030. However, in India, it is still not categorized as a notifiable disease, which plays down its severity and keeps it out of official government reports.Some experts say there is a lack of awareness among the public about how to seek immediate help. Avinash Visvanathan, general secretary of the Friends of Snake Society, an Indian non-profit organization working for the conservation of snakes in India, runs awareness programs across the country to educate people on how to deal with snakebites.Visvanathan believes snakebites are a serious health issue that has been neglected in India. He is advocating to make it a notifiable disease.""The first thing we need to do is to make snakebites a notifiable disease as it will help us understand the extent of the snake crisis in India. It will also help in shifting the government's focus toward it. That would lead to urgently-needed intervention.""  Visvanathan said.Following his experience being bitten by a venomous snake, Himar Jatt and fellow villagers are now fighting to get a local medical center equipped with antivenom medicines. For them, this would mean access to immediate, professional treatment, and the end of the snakebite scourge on their village.Edited by: Alex Berry",2023/03/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831836,"India, Australia agree to strengthen bilateral relations","India and Australia have made ""significant and ambitious"" efforts for better economic and security cooperation, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on his visit to New Delhi on Friday, claiming India to be a ""top-tier security partner.""""We are partners and building that partnership even stronger each and every day,'' he told reporters.The statement came ahead of his meeting with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Albanese said Australia and India have decided to speed up the finalization of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).""This transformational deal will realize the full potential of the bilateral economic relationship, creating new employment opportunities and raising living standards for the people of both Australia and India,"" he said.The CECA was stuck in negotiations for more than 10 years before talks were restarted in 2011. However, after reaching an impasse in 2016, the discussions on the deal were suspended.In 2021, the CECA talks were again resumed, but a deal is yet to be formalized.Last year, a smaller free trade deal — the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) — was signed between the two nations. It was India's first agreement with a developed country in a decade.New Delhi said ECTA has the potential to double the current bilateral trade between Australia and India, which was around $27.5 billion  (€24.2 billion) in 2021, and is estimated to reach up to $50 billion within five years, according to figures published by Reuters news agency. It was also Cranberra's ninth-largest trading partner in 2022.Albanese also said earlier this week that India, along with Indonesia, will rise up to become the world's third and the fourth largest economies in the future, which Australia sees as an ""incredible opportunity.""India and Australia are members of the Quad group along with Japan and the United States. The alliance aims to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.Albanese said in order to ensure Australia's defense assets are top of the line, they have to build capabilities and ""to build relationships.""He stated that he had been building such relationships with India in response to media queries on Australia-China relations, after describing New Delhi as a "" top-tier security partner.""Albanese said Australia has also strengthened its ties with China.In a tweet on Thursday, Albanese said that New Delhi and Canberra ""are working together to ensure the Indo-Pacific is open, inclusive, and prosperous.""aa/sms (Reuters, AP)",2023/03/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831837,Russia's hypersonic missiles ― what you need to know,"Ukraine came under some of the heaviest bombardment on Thursday, March 9, when Russia attacked targets across the entire country. Ukrainian defense forces said that Russia had used hypersonic missiles in the attacks.Officials in Ukraine said at least nine civilians were killed in missile strikes on the capital Kyiv and other places, including the eastern city of Kharkiv and villages in the western Lviv region.Moscow has used hypersonic missiles before — in the early weeks of the war back in 2022. They are considered a special kind of missile. Here's why.""Invincible."" That's what Russian President Vladimir Putin called hypersonic missiles in 2018 when he unveiled his country's arsenal of the missiles.It was perhaps a lofty description, designed for propaganda purposes, but there was some element of truth. Hypersonic missiles differ from conventional ballistic weapons in ways that make them harder to catch by missile defense systems. It comes down to speed and altitude.Hypersonic missiles fly five to ten times as fast as the speed of sound. That's known as Mach 5 to Mach 10.There is no fixed speed of sound because it depends on variables, namely the medium and the temperature of the medium through which an object or soundwave moves.But as a comparison, the Concorde commercial airplane flew at about twice the speed of sound. Concorde was a supersonic aircraft that had a maximum cruising speed of 2,180 km (1,354 miles) per hour, or Mach 2.04. So hypersonic takes those speeds at least three notches higher.The hypersonic missiles that Russia used in the attacks on Ukraine are known as ""Kinzhals,"" or daggers. They are 8 meters long.Some experts say this type of missile flies as fast as 6,000 kilometers per hour, which would be around Mach 5. Others say it flies at Mach 9 or even Mach 10.Either way, it's fast. So fast, in fact, that ""the air pressure in front of the weapon forms a plasma cloud as it moves, absorbing radio waves,"" the weapons experts at US website Military.com explain.That makes ""Kinzhal"" and other hypersonic weapons very hard to catch on radar systems, an effect compunded by their low altitude.Hypersonic missiles fly at a much lower altitude than conventional ballistic missiles.They follow what is known as a low atmospheric-ballistic trajectory. That means that by the time a radar-based missile defense system clocks them, they are already so close to their target that in many cases it is too late to intercept them.On top of that, hypersonic missiles can change direction midflight.The hypersonic missiles used by Russia in Ukraine are launched from aircrafts.Other hypersonic weapons can be deployed from ships and submarines. And they are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.The Kinzhal type can hit a target up to 2,000 kilometers away. Other hypersonic missiles have a reach of about 1,000 kilometers.If hypersonic missiles were stationed in the Russian territory of Kaliningrad, that would put several European capitals within their reach. Kaliningrad is separate from the Russian mainland and borders Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. The German capital Berlin is less than 600 kilometers away.But some analysts say that despite the advantages that hypersonic missiles have over conventional ballistic weapons, Russia won't use them indiscriminately. US Air Force General Glen D. VanHerck told a US Senate Armed Services subcommittee in May 2022 that Russia was having ""challenges with some of their hypersonic missiles as far as accuracy"" was concerned in Ukraine.Edited by: Zulfikar AbbanyEditor's note: This article was originally published on March 22, 2022.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831839,Fukushima's first responders recall the disaster 12 years on,"The March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant — caused by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami — forced thousands to flee the leaking radiation. But a handful of people ran in the opposite direction.A skeleton staff of the plant volunteered to remain on site as the crisis worsened. Reactor temperatures were spiking uncontrollably, and a series of hydrogen explosions ripped the reactor buildings apart. At the same time, dozens more specialist engineers and emergency workers were rushed to the site.It was the second-worst nuclear accident in world history.The media quickly dubbed this small group the ""Fukushima 50,"" even though as many as 580 emergency personnel rotated through the site in the first chaotic days of the disaster. But the name stuck, and even became the title of a 2020 movie about the emergency.Sunday marks the 12th anniversary of the disaster. Two of the first responders agreed to speak to DW, giving a rare insight into what happened over those difficult days.Osamu Kinoshita, head of the special disasters response team of the Tokyo Fire Department, was at its headquarters in the Otemachi district when the earthquake struck shortly before 3 p.m. on March 11. He saw the first images of the destruction as they were broadcast on television.Kinoshita and his team were initially sent to respond to fires and collapsed buildings in Tokyo. Fears for his own son ran through his mind as he worked. Kazuya Kinoshita was a university student at the time in the town of Rikuzentakata, one of the worst affected in the disaster zone, but communication lines were down.""When I saw the waves destroying the city, I assumed there was no way he would have been able to survive,"" Kinoshita told DW. By chance, his son had been taking a driving lesson further inland at the time of the quake, and was not swept up in the tsunami. But it took three days for that information to reach his parents.By that time, Kinoshita was preparing to head to the Fukushima plant.""On the night of March 17, the prime minister [Naoto Kan] made a formal request to the governor of Tokyo for assistance, and the order was issued to the fire brigade,"" he said. ""The request was specifically for crews to go to the reactors and make sure that sufficient water was getting into the pools holding the spent nuclear fuel.""""Everyone was given the choice of whether to go or not, but all 300 people in the team said they would go,"" he said.The 32-vehicle convoy left Tokyo at around 2 a.m. and drove for seven hours, negotiating damaged bridges and roads blocked by landslides.Once at the site, the fire crews ran hoses 800 meters (2,625 feet) out to the ocean and started spraying seawater onto the reactors to keep them cool. Ladders from firefighting trucks were hoisted over the damaged reactor buildings, and in the first 20-minute operation, some 60 tons of water were sprayed on the reactor shrouds. Over the following eight days, a further 4,000 tons of water were pumped onto the structures.The firefighter standing at the top of the ladder had to be replaced every five minutes, as radiation levels were dangerously high and the entire complex was being hit by aftershocks.""We realized the risks were pretty severe, but we were all there to get this job done,"" he said. ""I remember when we were first setting up the equipment and we were directly between the second and third reactors, and I wondered to myself which way I should run if there was another big aftershock. Those concerns were always in the back of our minds.""Kinoshita and his team were replaced by fresh fire crews, and all underwent full medical checks as soon as they returned to Tokyo. None of the team has ever had a medical issue because of being at Fukushima, he said.""For us, what we did was not heroic; it was work and we put our very best efforts into the situation and we were able to make a difference. I was grateful that we were able to manage the radiation exposure and I'm even more grateful that none of my team has reported any ill-effects.""Kiyoshi Okamura was based at the Sendai office of civil engineering firm Hazama Ando Corporations, and had spent a great deal of time at the Fukushima plant in the year before the disaster. He was the obvious choice to join the post-disaster crews.""Immediately after the earthquake, there was a power blackout and we had no information at all about what was happening, so I did not find out about the scale of the problem until the next day,"" he said. ""Even then, I assumed that the safeguards that were in place at the plant would ensure its security. It was only later that we realized the seriousness of the situation.""Two days after the earthquake, he got a call from a colleague saying he was urgently needed.""It had to be me,"" he said. ""There was really no choice about going or not going. But I was fortunate, as I was based away from my family at that time and the phones were still out, so I just didn't tell them that I was going.""""I never told them afterwards either,"" he added. ""Even today, they do not know that I was there. My wife is very trusting.""Okamura got to the plant on March 15 and was tasked with identifying the areas of the plant that need to be cleared of debris as a matter of urgency.""The radiation levels were very high in many places, and we had to be conscious of that at all times,"" he said. ""We had to carefully monitor how long anyone could work in exposed areas, and the absolute maximum was one hour. We all carried Geiger counters and dose meters, and when they told us we had reached our limits, we had to leave.""Okamura spent time in the central control room at the plant, a building that was shielded in case of an accident. He worked alongside power company officials, receiving the latest reports on the condition of the reactors and relaying that information to the government in Tokyo.""We were right next to them and could hear everything that was happening,"" he said. ""It was clear that the situation was very serious but, oddly, I do not think I felt fear. We were too busy concentrating on what we had to do, and just trying our hardest to get the situation under control again.""Due to the high radiation levels, Okamura and the first Hazama team to reach the plant were ordered to leave after three days. He has since advised on the ongoing recovery work at the site.""There have been no effects on my health, thankfully, and the company provides us with annual check-ups,"" he said. ""And I have not heard of any colleagues who have had problems, either. More than 10 years have passed now, so I do not think I have much to worry about.""Would he go again if a similar crisis occurred? ""Of course,"" the 68-year-old replied.Edited by: Alex Berry",2023/03/10,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831861,How Germany plans to phase-out oil and gas heating,"The Green Party's Robert Habeck, Germany's Economy and Climate Protection Minister, wants to ban almost all new oil and gas heating systems in Germany from 2024, both for climate protection reasons and because the price for oil and gas has risen sharply after Russia's attack on Ukraine just over a year ago.This week in Berlin, Habeck said that Germany must speed up its switch to renewable energy, making up for time lost under the previous government. Otherwise, he said, neither the climate targets, enshrined in law but which Germany is unlikely to meet nor the transformation of the economy necessary to ensure future prosperity could be achieved.Heat pumps are to replace the old gas and oil heating systems, the energy for which is to come from renewable sources such as wind turbines or solar plants.When the current three-way coalition of center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Greens, and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) came to power in 2021, they agreed to ban new oil and gas systems from 2025 and permit only new ones that generate at least 65% of their heat from renewable energies. This will require alternative systems such as heat pumps or local district heating.But Habeck's ministry now sees a need for swifter action: Over 80% of the demand for heat is currently still met by burning fossil fuels. ""Every year, we burn more than 40% of the natural gas Germany imports to heat our buildings and supply them with hot water. Of the approximately 41 million households in Germany, nearly one in two heats with natural gas.""Since around half of Germany's households are still dependent on gas and oil, switching to alternatives is costly and simply not affordable for many. A heat pump costs between €11,000 ($11.700) and €25,000 for a single-family house. That's a big investment, even if the government subsidizes up to 40% of the cost.That leaves two major problems for Habeck: Firstly, how to curb the costs for homeowners and tenants with a subsidy program that will potentially cost the state billions – he has yet to say exactly how large this program will be. Secondly, there is a lack of skilled workers, both for the mass installation of new heat pumps and, for example, in the solar industry, which says it is currently lacking around 200,000 jobs.Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) threw his weight behind Habeck this week when he said, ""From 2024, we will install 500,000 new heat pumps every year.""But once again, there are signs of an open conflict between the Greens and the FDP, whose parliamentary group leader in the Bundestag, Christian Dürr, promptly said, ""I think blanket bans are wrong; instead, we should remain open-minded and ensure that classic heating systems can also be operated in a climate-neutral manner in the future.""It seems clear that there are budget arguments going on behind the scenes: On Friday, Finance Minister Christian Lindner (FDP) postponed the federal cabinet's meeting to agree on the key figures for next year's budget, which had been scheduled for next Wednesday. His state secretary Florian Toncar explained: ""The spending wishes of many departments are still clearly too high or there is a lack of savings elsewhere to be able to set new priorities.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831862,"Macron, Sunak agree plan to reduce English Channel migration","Britain and France announced a new deal Friday to help clamp down on migrants and refugees crossing the English Channel in small boats.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed the $575 million (€540 million) plan after a summit in Paris designed to reset relations after years of bickering over Brexit.As part of the three-year deal, Britain will help fund a migrant detention center in France, the deployment of hundreds of extra French officers to conduct patrols of the coast and the upgrade of surveillance technology.France will also contribute significantly more funding, although no details were provided.""We don't need to manage this [small boats] problem, we need to break it,"" Sunak said at a joint news conference with Macron.""Today, we have taken cooperation to an unprecedented level... to put an end to this disgusting trade in human life.""Britain's conservative government is under intense pressure to do more to stop people from making the journey from the French to the UK coast in dinghies and small boats.Over the past few years, the use of small vessels has become more popular for migrants than stowing away on trucks or trains using the Channel Tunnel or crossing by ferry.The English Channel is just 21 miles (around 33 kilometers) wide at its narrowest point but is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.The sea conditions often make the crossing perilous and at least four people have died in recent years.More than 45,000 migrants and refugees arrived in Britain by boat in 2022, up from 28,000 in 2021, according to UK statistics.Despite the increase, two previous deals to beef up enforcement measures, particularly on the northern French coast, have had limited success.One of Sunak's predecessors, Boris Johnson, announced plans last year to deport migrants to Rwanda, but the measure was shelved over legal issues amid accusations of cruelty toward those seeking refuge.This week, Sunak's government presented new legislation that will instead  ban migrants arriving by small boats from seeking asylum.If passed by Parliament, new arrivals will be detained and sent to a third country deemed safe, although the plan won't apply to unaccompanied minors.The proposed law has been criticized by rights groups as well as the United Nations children's and human rights agencies.France and the UK are also keen to dismantle organized crime groups that migrants often pay thousands of euros for a place on one of the boats.Under the new plan, the two countries will send officers from Britain's National Crime Agency and its French counterpart to countries along the routes favored by people traffickers.Friday's meeting was the first summit of Europe's two main military nations in five years.Ties between the two countries have often been rocky since Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016.""It was not a summit like others. It was a summit of new ambitions,"" Macron said at the news conference.Sunak acknowledged that the ""relationship between our two countries has had its challenges in recent years,"" but that the talks marked a ""new beginning, an entente renewed.""UK-French relations hit rock bottom under Johnson's leadership amid post-Brexit wrangling over fishing rights and other issues.His successor, Liz Truss, ruffled feathers in Paris last year when she said the ""jury is out"" on whether Macron was a friend or a foe.When Truss was ousted after just 45 days in office, Sunak's calm and steady hand helped to bolster ties both with France and the EU.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also brought Britain closer to its European neighbors in support of Kyiv, and, on Friday, France and Britain said that they would jointly train Ukrainian marines.""We want Ukraine to win this war. We are absolutely united on this,"" said Sunak, adding that it should be Kyiv that chooses when any peace talks start.Sunak's trip also comes two weeks before King Charles III travels to France and Germany for his first state visits since becoming monarch, in further British efforts to build bridges with European neighbors.mm/fb (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/10,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831864,Saki Kumagai: Women's football fading in Japan,"When Saki Kumagai struck the winning penalty for Japan in their World Cup final against the United States in 2011, she was unaware of just how pivotal a moment in her life it would be.Days after lifting the World Cup trophy in front of over 47,000 fans at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt, Kumagai moved to the German city from her native country after signing her first fully professional contract with FFC (now Eintracht) Frankfurt.In the 12 years since she moved to Europe, the national team captain has become the most successful Japanese player of her era, male or female, lifting five Champions League titles and winning seven league titles with Lyon.Internationally, the defensive midfielder followed up the World Cup win by helping Japan earn a silver medal at the 2012 Olympics before the team fell short of winning back-to-back World Cup titles against a prolific USA.But, despite all her personal achievements, Kumagai is aware of the responsibility of being successful with the national team to ensure young girls in Japan have access to the same opportunities she carved out for herself.""After we won the World Cup, a lot of girls started playing football,"" she explained to DW. ""A lot of girls teams had better conditions and also a lot of people came to watch games in the Japanese league.""""Now the sport is less popular again and that's not good. Our national team hasn't won a lot recently and the Japanese people are less interested in the sport again.""""I want to be able to give Japanese girls a chance to have the same dream I had, that they might think they want to become like Saki or other players, and that it is possible.""In pursuit of her passion for football, and with a limited number of women's teams in Japan, Kumagai moved than 500 miles (800 kilometers) away from her home city of Sapporo, to Sendai, in order to attend Tokiwagi Gakuen High School at the age of 15.Japanese girls from across the country attend Tokiwagi Gakuen with the aim of becoming professional football players and making it to the national team.The high school has a deep connection with the United States, sending an U19 team to Minnesota every year since the early 2000s for the Target USA Cup, the largest youth football tournament in North America.Kumagai had hoped that Japan's 2011 World Cup triumph would lead to more schools like Tokiwagi Gakuen, clubs and facilities becoming accessible throughout the country.But, the 32-year-old believes the nature of the country and its culture means only constant and sustained success for the national team can ensure persistent investment and respect for women's football within Japan.Following the World Cup win, companies fought to make sponsorship deals with the domestic Nadeshiko League and attendances soared. But in the intervening years not even silver at the 2012 Olympics or a run to the 2015 World Cup final could sustain a high level of interest or investment at grassroots level.""I know it's our responsibility as national players to win or at the very least we have to get good results,"" she said.""The World Cup is the dream stage for female footballers but it's important for the Japanese women's football team that we go far in competitions.""""It's important to produce good performances, to try to lift the trophy but especially not just go out in the group stage. I want to show the young girls in Japan that we can play good football and that we win on the world stage.""Despite the battle to earn veneration at home, Kumagai forged an exceptional club career in Europe.Across eight seasons from 2013 with the serial French champions Lyon, she formed a core part of the side that dominated women's football for more than half a decade, playing alongside Ada Hegerberg, the inaugural winner of the women’s Ballon d’Or as the world’s best player, and former German captain Dzsenifer Marozsán.Lyon won four trebles in the space of five years between 2016-2020, in a run that included five successive Champions League titles, and was lauded as one of the greatest teams in world football.However, as investment in women's football across Europe began to help other teams close the gap to Lyon, Kumagai sought a challenge elsewhere and she joined Bayern Munich in 2021.""In the last year with Lyon I saw they changed a little bit,"" she explained. ""Lyon used to win 7-0 or 8-0, not every game but often enough, and even in the Champions League.""Recently, other clubs improved, the gap lessened, and it was why I wanted to play with another team and try to beat Lyon.""I played against Bayern in Champions League quarterfinal (in August 2020), and I liked how they played their football, with so many young players. After I spoke with coach Jens Scheuer, he said he needed me and that was important for me, that's why I chose Bayern.""As fairytale rematches against former club's go, Kumagai's could not have gone much better when Bayern came up against Lyon in 2021-22 Champions League group stage.A rare goal, coming through a powerful header from a corner, earned the Bavarians a 1-0 victory and, for the midfielder, it felt like a chance to show Lyon she was still a good player.But, while playing against Lyon last season was personal, the focus this season is solely on helping her team succeed. This month brings a Champions League quarterfinal against Arsenal and. couched between those two legs, a clash against title rivals VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga, who Bayern trail by just two points.""Our destiny is in our control,"" Kumagai said. ""Every game against Wolfsburg is big and there is always huge motivation and I'm excited for these games.""I never feel pressure but from now on every game is big. We have to focus on preparing for these games, on staying fit and being ready to fight.""Edited by: Matt Pearson",2023/03/10,,

The two leaders were expected to reaffirm their commitment to continuing to support Ukraine, as well as to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation on imposing sanctions on ""third party actors"" who are violating sanctions on Russia.Speaking in the Oval Office at the start of the meeting, both Biden and von der Leyen underlined the strength of their partnership, and the unified support for Ukraine and efforts to hold Russia accountable for its invasion.""We are not only partners, the European Union and the United States are good friends,"" von der Leyen said, highlighting US support for Europe in finding alternate energy supplies so EU members could reduce their dependence on Russian supplies.She welcomed planned US investments in new and clean technologies, and said there were ""plenty of topics"" to discuss since Europe was also planning similar investments.Tensions had been swirling in Europe over the Biden administration's landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a government spending spree championing US manufacturing in climate-friendly technologies.Europe had been pushing for months for the US to consider a scheme whereby European materials would receive the same incentives as those made in the US, Canada or Mexico.Earlier this year, the European Commission presented its Green Deal Industrial Plan in response to the US measure, with increased levels of state aid to help Europe compete as a manufacturing hub for clean tech products.Although comparatively few details were outlined in Friday's announcement, the two sides appear to be planning to coordinate their discounts.zc, dh/msh (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/03/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831897,Did state media drive a teen to suicide in Poland?,"On March 3, Magdalena Filiks posted an obituary on social media, stating that ""on February 17, my son Mikolaj Filiks passed away; he would have turned 16 on March 8."" Filiks is a delegate with the liberal-conservative opposition Civic Platform (PO) in Poland's parliament, the Sejm.The post sent shockwaves throughout Poland. Astute observers of Poland's political scene instantly knew that Polish state media could be complicit in the teen's death.His case had widely been considered closed: In September 2020, a civil servant in the West Pomeranian province was arrested in the city of Szczecin.Authorities accused the civil servant of having sexually abused a 13-year-old boy. The man was also accused of having plied a 16-year-old teenage girl with drugs. In December 2021, the man was sentenced to four years and ten months in jail. The trial was conducted behind closed doors to protect privacy of the underage victims. At the time, all sides respected this confidentiality agreement.Magdalena Filiks helped co-found the civic organization the Committee for the Defence of Democracy, after the Law and Justice (PiS) party, headed by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, took power in 2015.The 45-year-old economist has sided with prosecuted judges, joined protests against restricted access to abortions and led eye-catching billboard campaigns. She has been a PO delegate since 2019.Polish media appears to be in a frenzy in the run-up to this autumn's parliamentary elections. In December 2022, government-controlled Radio Szczecin began covering the abuse case again in order to damage the liberal PO, which leads in the West Pomeranian province.Radio Szczecin head Tomasz Duklanowski covered the case as if it were breaking news, although a court had sentenced the perpetrator in 2022. The pro-government journalist described it as a ""child abuse scandal in the office of a marshal"" — a position roughly equivalent to state president — and said there had been attempts to hush up the case. The journalist was alluding to the fact the convicted abuser and the marshal are both members of Magdalena Filik's PO party.Other government-friendly media outlets joined the smear campaign. The news outlet TVP Info, weekly Gazeta Polska, and regional newspaper Glos Szczecinski, owned by Polish oil company PKN Orlen, piled on. Right-wing politicians and publishers backed the campaign, and Filiks and her family were subjected to online abuse.Ever since its 2015 electoral victory, Poland's PiS party has viewed establishing total control over erstwhile public media outlets as a key task. It also views gaining control of the judiciary as essential.Media reports did not spare details that could be used to identify the adolescent victim. Radio Szczecin chief correspondent Duklanowski wrote there was talk that the ""children of a well-known parliamentarian"" were victims of the abuse case. Rzeczpospolita newspaper reported that pictures of Magdalena Filiks had been shared online. Exposed and humiliated, Magdalena Filiks' son took his own life.The reports triggered fierce criticism, with Poland's National Broadcasting Council saying ethical principles had been violated. The head of the state commission against child abuse, Blazej Kmiecik, criticized Duklanowski for his actions, saying that if a media report made it possible to ""find out the personal details of abused children within [a mere] 15 seconds,"" the journalist's work was ""wrong, unethical, and disgraceful.""""They wanted to defame me, and make a mother suffer. Instead, they caused the death of a child,"" Olgierd Geblowicz, marshal of the West Pomeranian province, told Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper. He said the PO politician had been the actual target of the right-wing media campaign.The boy's suicide sparked a wave of outrage and solidarity with his mother. ""We will hold the PiS accountable for every misdeed, every injustice and every tragedy. I promise that,"" opposition leader Donald Tusk wrote on Twitter. On the day of the teenager's funeral, Tusk added Mikolaj had been hounded to death by the media.""When will the head of Radio Szczecin be recalled?"" Catholic journalist Tomasz Terlikowski recently asked. ""I'm not asking if he will stay, because the answer to that is clear from a moral standpoint. I'm asking how long they will wait [before removing him].""Writing in Gazeta Wyborcza, Bartosz Wielinski similarly warned that ""words can kill."" Adding that people who act this way, in his view, ""are not journalists, but members of the propaganda apparatus.""Poland's independent journalists' association Towarzystwo Dziennikarskie also criticized Duklanowski, saying that ""above all, journalists should show concern for the people they write about. Anyone who does not respect this principle should be expelled from the profession.""Despite numerous calls for Duklanowski's resignation, Radio Szczecin has so far not commented on the case or taken action against the journalist. As is customary after suicides, the prosecutor's office has now launched proceedings following Mikolaj Filiks' death.Mikolaj was buried on March 7, one day before his 16th birthday. His mother asked media to refrain from covering the funeral. When doing so online, she placed the word ""media"" in quotation marks.This article was translated from German.",2023/03/10,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831910,Taiwan foreign ministry open to expanded relations with Micronesia,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan has always strived to establish good relations and conduct exchanges with like-minded nations through diplomacy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday (March 10), in response to Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) President David Panuelo ‘s letter imploring lawmakers to switch recognition from China to Taiwan.

            In the 13-page letter, Panuelo detailed the impact of China's political warfare and gray zone activities in FSM, as well as the egregious behavior of Chinese diplomats in the country. The letter also claims that FSM would receive US$50 million (NT$1.5 billion), an additional US$15 million annually, healthcare, scholarships, and training programs from Taiwan “if and when” it switches diplomatic recognition from Beijing to Taipei.

            Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) confirmed on Friday that though there were some discrepancies in the letter, he had ""indeed contacted and exchanged views"" with Panuelo.

            In the future, Taiwan is willing to use its model of diplomacy to aid in FSM’s development, and benefit the well-being of its people. MOFA said it welcomes the expansion of bilateral relations between FSM and Taiwan.











            Contrary to China's false promises and grandiose but impractical ""One Belt, One Road"" projects, Taiwan has always adhered to the spirit of practical diplomacy, mutual assistance, and “Taiwan can help"" to help improve people's livelihoods to create a win-win situation, MOFA said.

            Taiwan and like-minded countries share core values such as democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, the foreign ministry said. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan will continue to work with partners around the world to unite and strengthen democratic resilience, jointly combat the expansion and coercion of authoritarianism, and maintain a rules-based international order, as well as promote freedom, openness, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, it added.

            FSM and China established diplomatic ties on Sept. 11, 1989.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan has always strived to establish good relations and conduct exchanges with like-minded nations through diplomacy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday (March 10), in response to Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) President David Panuelo ‘s letter imploring lawmakers to switch recognition from China to Taiwan.In the 13-page letter, Panuelo detailed the impact of China's political warfare and gray zone activities in FSM, as well as the egregious behavior of Chinese diplomats in the country. The letter also claims that FSM would receive US$50 million (NT$1.5 billion), an additional US$15 million annually, healthcare, scholarships, and training programs from Taiwan “if and when” it switches diplomatic recognition from Beijing to Taipei.Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) confirmed on Friday that though there were some discrepancies in the letter, he had ""indeed contacted and exchanged views"" with Panuelo.In the future, Taiwan is willing to use its model of diplomacy to aid in FSM’s development, and benefit the well-being of its people. MOFA said it welcomes the expansion of bilateral relations between FSM and Taiwan.Contrary to China's false promises and grandiose but impractical ""One Belt, One Road"" projects, Taiwan has always adhered to the spirit of practical diplomacy, mutual assistance, and “Taiwan can help"" to help improve people's livelihoods to create a win-win situation, MOFA said.Taiwan and like-minded countries share core values such as democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, the foreign ministry said. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan will continue to work with partners around the world to unite and strengthen democratic resilience, jointly combat the expansion and coercion of authoritarianism, and maintain a rules-based international order, as well as promote freedom, openness, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, it added.FSM and China established diplomatic ties on Sept. 11, 1989.",2023/03/11,843,Politics

Some have production facilities in China.The Dutch government has never granted ASML a licence to sell its most advanced machines to customers in China, following pressure from Washington, which is seeking to hobble China's ability to make its own advanced computer chips and to slow down its military advances.ASML's lithography systems can cost up to 160 million euros ($170 million) each and are used to create the circuitry of computer chips.The Dutch government on Wednesday announced new restrictionson exports impacting ASML's second-best range of chip-printing tools, which could lead to Chinese retaliation.SINGAPORE HEADQUARTERS?Among the companies on the mission is Neways, which helps ASML develop electrical control units, power controls and wiring systems for lithography systems, according to the company's website.A spokesperson for Neways declined comment.ASML supplier NTS Group, which is a provider of precision mechanics tools, is another company that will join the business trip, Brainport said.The other companies on the trip are Bestronics, AAE BV, BKB Precision, HQ Group, KMWE Group, Sempro, Sioux Technologies and VDL ETG, according to one of the documents and Brainport.""VDL Groep has different branches in Asia ... We have no intention at all of leaving China,"" the company said in a statement.Other companies could not be reached for comment on Friday.Singapore is being considered as a potential location for regional headquarters, the note said.ASML declined comment.One person familiar with the organisation of the trip said one of the companies was in advanced talks with partners in Vietnam to build a factory.A second company was also likely to invest there, the person said declining to name the firms and to be named because the information was confidential.A second person involved in the organisation of the trip said that Malaysia was also a likely choice for new investment because some of the companies already have facilities there.",2023/03/11,807,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831971,BBC's Gary Lineker pulled off air for slamming asylum policy,"Former England soccer captain and BBC presenter Gary Lineker has been taken off the air temporrarily, the public broadcaster said on Friday, after his criticism of the United Kingdom's new migration policy sparked a row with his employer.""The BBC has decided that he will step back from presenting Match of the Day until we've got an agreed and clear position on his use of social media,"" the broadcaster said in a statement.Lineker took to Twitter on Tuesday to criticize the British government's new policy to refuse asylum to migrants who arrive in small boats and deport them to their home country or so-called safe third countries.Lineker shared a video of Interior Minister Suella Braverman talking about the law and added: ""Good heavens, this is beyond awful"".In a response to another user, he went on to describe the measure as ""an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people"" and compared its wording to Nazi-era Germany.The policy has also been condemned by opposition parties, charities and the United Nations' refugee agency for its impact on genuine refugees.Lineker had been known as politically engaged ever since his playing days, but he has probably become more outspoken on social media in recent years. He has courted criticism from some observers in the UK — who argue he should not show political bias as a BBC sports presenter — on several similar occasions in the past. 

""We have never said that Gary should be an opinion-free zone, or that he can't have a view on issues that matter to him, but we have said that he should keep well away from taking sides on party political issues or political controversies,"" the BBC said in its statement.Lineker, who has hosted Match of the Day for more than 20 years, will be off-air when the show is scheduled to be broadcast on Saturday.The show, on air since 1964, is a roundup of extended highlights from the weekend Premier League fixtures, usually including studio analysis led by Lineker.After several of the show's regular studio presenters including Ian Wright, Alan Shearer, Jermaine Jenas and Micah Richards said they would not appear on the show without Lineker, the BBC said Saturday's edition of Match of the Day would instead ""focus on match action without studio presentation or punditry.""Soon after, all six of the show's scheduled match commentators went on to say that they would sit out of Saturday's broadcast as well. They recommended that the BBC instead use World Feed commentary, rather than their own play-by-play callers.Braverman appeared on the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, released on Friday, and was asked about the week's events and Lineker's comments.Braverman, whose husband is Jewish, said Lineker crossed a line when saying her language on this issue was ""not dissimilar to that used in 1930s Germany.""""My husband's family feels very keenly the impact of the Holocaust, actually. To throw out those kind of flippant analogies diminishes the unspeakable tragedy that many people went through,"" Braverman said, arguing: ""And I don't think anything that is happening in the UK today can come close to what happened in the Holocaust. So, I find it a lazy and unhelpful comparison to make.""This followed the issue being raised several times in the House of Commons this week, typically by Conservative MPs.Scotland's outgoing First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, meanwhile, called the BBC's decision ""indefensible.""And the opposition Labour Party issued a statement calling the decision ""cowardly"" and ""an assault on free speech in the face of political pressure,"" concluding: ""BBC should rethink.""The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, meanwhile, said: ""Individual cases are a matter for the BBC.""Lineker is considered the BBC's highest-paid presenter with an annual salary of up to £1.35 million ($1.62 million) for hosting Match of the Day and other football coverageThe former Barcelona and Tottenham player was a household name before he took over the reins of the country's premier football show soon after his retirement. He's now been a staple on British screens on Saturday nights for decades.Lineker has hosted refugees at his home and has vocally criticized the government's treatment of asylum seekers in the past.He has also branched out into other interests in recent years, including as owner of the Goalhanger network of podcasts.zc/msh (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/03/11,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832013,"Li Qiang, Xi confidant, takes reins as China's premier","Four years before Li Qiang gained notoriety as the force behind the two-month COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai, the man who became China's new premier on Saturday worked quietly behind the scenes to drive a bold revamp of the megacity's sclerotic stock market.Li's back-channelling - sources said he bypassed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which lost some of its power under the new set-up - demonstrated what became a reputation for pragmatism as well as close ties with President Xi Jinping.In late 2018, Xi himself announced Shanghai's new tech-focused STAR Market as well as the pilot of a registration-based IPO system, reforms meant to entice China's hottest young firms to list locally rather than overseas.""The CSRC was very unhappy,"" said a veteran banker close to regulators and Shanghai officials, declining to be named given the sensitivity of the matter.""Li's relationship with Xi played a role here,"" enabling him to present the scheme directly to the central government, without going through the CSRC, the person added.The CSRC did not respond to a request for comment.Previously the Communist Party chief in Shanghai, Li was confirmed as premier during the National People's Congress, charged with managing the world's second largest economy. He replaced the retiring Li Keqiang, widely perceived to have been sidelined as Xi tightened his grip on management of the economy.Leadership watchers say Li Qiang's closeness to Xi is both a strength and a vulnerability: while he has Xi's trust, he is beholden to his long-time patron.Trey McArver, co-founder of consultancy Trivium China, said Li is likely to be much more powerful than his predecessor.Xi expended significant political capital to get him into the role, given Li's lack of central government experience and the Shanghai lockdown, McArver said.""Officials know that Li Qiang is Xi Jinping's guy,"" he said.""He clearly thinks that Li Qiang is a very competent person and he has put him in this position because he trusts him and he expects a lot of him.""Li, 63, did not respond to questions sent to China's State Council Information Office.PRACTICAL PRAGMATISTA career bureaucrat, Li was revealed as the pick for China's number two role in October when Xi unveiled a leadership line-up stacked with loyalists.At that time, Li had been known for overseeing the harrowing COVID lockdown earlier last year of Shanghai's 25 million people, which shut the city's economy and left psychological scars among its residents. That made him a target of anger but did nothing to derail his promotion.Li was also instrumental in pushing for China's unexpectedly sudden end to its zero-COVID policy late last year, Reuters reported this month.People who have interacted with Li say they found him practical-minded, an effective bureaucratic operator and supportive of the private sector - a stance that would be expected in someone whose career put him in charge of some of China's most economically dynamic regions.As Communist Party chief between 2002 to 2004 in his home city of Wenzhou, a hotbed of entrepreneurialism, Li came across as open-minded and willing to listen, said Zhou Dewen, who represented small and midsize enterprises in the city.""He took a liberal approach of granting private companies default access to enter the market, except when explicitly banned by law, rather then the traditional approach of keeping private companies out by default,"" said Zhou.Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council and a former U.S. official, said Li sought to level the playing field for foreign businesses, pointing to the speed with which U.S. carmaker Tesla was able to get its Shanghai factory there operational in 2019.""Clearly nothing got in the way once a decision was made. There was a clarity of a kind in his decision making, an authority, and that really helps,"" said Allen, describing Li as comfortable in his own skin.Still, several observers caution against putting too much weight on Li's experience in a business hub such as Shanghai, since Xi has steadily tightened Communist Party control and taken the economy in a more statist direction.""Now Li is a national leader, working under a market-sceptic boss, and he has to balance growth with a range of social, technological, and geopolitical goals,"" said Neil Thomas, senior analyst at Eurasia.NO WALLFLOWEREven by the opaque standards of Chinese politics, there is little public information about Li's background or personal life.Born in Ruian county in what is now Wenzhou, the 17-year-old Li went to work in 1976 at an irrigation station in his hometown, a desirable job in what turned out to be the final year of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.Li entered Zhejiang Agricultural University in 1978, the year that campuses were reopened in China and competition for places was fierce. He received master's degrees from the central party school in Beijing and Hong Kong Polytechnic University.It was in Zhejiang, home to some of China's biggest private companies - where Xi was provincial party secretary and Li was his chief of staff between 2004 and 2007 - that the two men would have built their personal bond.American author Robert Lawrence Kuhn, who met Li and Xi together in 2005 and 2006, said the two shared an easy rapport.""Unlike most other staffers of top leaders, Li was no wallflower,"" Kuhn told Reuters.""In the presence of Xi, he felt comfortable and confident enough to put himself forward to engage me, which tells me he is not worried his boss might think he is trying to steal his limelight,"" Kuhn said.However, leadership watchers said there are limits to what Li will be able to do.""Li can make some repairs here and there, but he won't tear down the wall and build something new,"" said Chen Daoyin, former associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, and now a commentator based in Chile.(Reporting by Yew Lun Tian, Laurie and Chen Joe Cash; Additional reporting by the Shanghai newsroom and Julie Zhu in Hong Kong; Editing by Tony Munroe and Lincoln Feast)",2023/03/11,662,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832127,Call for vaccine equity so COVID 'mistakes' are not repeated,"A group of world leaders and activists have called for urgent action to vaccinate low and middle-income countries to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic.The letter from The People's Vaccine NGO alliance calls for large-scale investments to develop scientific innovation and manufacturing capacity in the global south. This will ensure that vaccines and treatments can be quickly developed and rolled out in all regions, also in future pandemics, they say.This follows an unprecedented bid during the COVID pandemic, spearheaded by India, to waive the patents for COVID vaccines and enable cheaper production in the global south. To the surprise of many observers, the US signalled a willingness, but European countries and in no small part Germany torpedoed the idea.The former world leaders, Nobel laureates, scientists, economists, humanitarians, faith leaders, business leaders, trade unionists, and celebrities are urging world leaders to unite behind a People's vaccine based on equity and solidarity.They argue that the COVID-19 vaccines should be accessible to everyone, everywhere and free from patents and profiteering.The letter criticizes the massive inequality witnessed during the response to the global pandemic.The pandemic has so far claimed 7 million lives worldwide although the true toll is believed to be higher.""Decisions made now will determine how the world prepares for and responds to future global crises,"" the letter reads. ""World leaders must reflect on mistakes made in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic so that they are never repeated.""With the end of the pandemic in sight, ""the world is at a critical juncture,"" they wrote.""We must recapture the spirit of solidarity to end the suffering and create a better future. That starts now with ending callous pharmaceutical monopolies on COVID-19 vaccines, so Africa and the world can tackle this crisis and the next,"" former Malawian President Joyce Banda, one of several senior African politicians to sign the letter, said.The letter was published on the second anniversary of the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic.The letter further condemns world leaders' approach as being ""immoral, entirely self-defeating and also an ethical, economic and epidemiological failure.”The alliance warns that leaving billions of people unvaccinated increases the risk of more dangerous variants of COVID-19 emergine.According to Ban Ki-Moon, signatory and former Secretary General of the United Nations, ""rich country leaders are protecting pharmaceutical monopolies on COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics over the health of billions of people.""The leaders criticize the European Union, the United Kingdom,Germany, and Switzerlandfor continuing ""to block the lifting of intellectual property rules which would enable the redistribution and scale-up of Covid-19 vaccine, test and treatment manufacturing in the global south.”The letter insists that ""these are the people's vaccines, the people's tests and the people's treatments.”Failure to meet global vaccination targets ha been blamed on ""self-defeating nationalism, pharmaceutical monopolies and inequality,” according to the leaders.South Africa and India proposed an intellectual property waiverduring the World Trade Organization (WTO) in October 2020 and are being supported by more than 100 countries including the U.S.Despite the rallying call to waive intellectual property rights of the vaccines, strong European opposition led by the UK and Germany has prevented the WTO from reaching a consensus.According to Winnie Byanyima, Executive Durector of UNAIDS, ""the heartbreaking tragedy of our era is that the remarkable innovations of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments have been withheld from so many... Please support developing countries to vaccinate everyone everywhere. A people's vaccine.""Other signatories to the open letter include Tanzanian President H.E. Samia Suluhu Hassan, Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Charlize Theron, and Paul Polman, the former CEO of Uniliver, among others.dnm/msh (AFP)",2023/03/11,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832128,China's Xi assigns top job after securing 3rd term,"Chinese President Xi Jinping, on Saturday, appointed his close aide Li Qiang as China's new premier with the parliament's approval, hours after the head honcho secured his third five-year term at the helm the world's second largest economy.The announcement came during the ongoing annual meeting of China's rubber-stamp parliament.This is first of the several upcoming announcements as Xi installs a slate of loyalists in key positions, marking the biggest government reshuffle in a decade.Li — the former Communist Party chief of Shanghai — will replace Li Keqiang who is retiring during the National People's Congress session after two full terms of service.Xi nominated Li and then delegates voted. In all, 2,936 votes were case in favor, with just three against and eight abstentions, according to totals projected on a screen inside the Great Hall of the People.The incoming premier is a close ally of Xi, serving as his chief of staff for three years when the latter was the provincial party secretary of eastern China's Zhejiang province. While he has been expected to come into this role, Li's ascension seemed in doubt a few months ago after his handling of the Shanghai lockdown which left residents without adequate access to food and medicines.The 63-year-old is widely considered business friendly and pragmatic. He will face the important task of reviving China's economy after three years of strict COVID-19 curbs. China's economy grew just 3% in 2022, and expects to grow around 5% in 2023 — its lowest goal in nearly three decades.According to Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, Li's main challenge will be beating this target without triggering serious inflation or piling on more debt.Li is also coming into power at a time when geopolitical relations with the west are worsening over Taiwan, spy balloons and China's alleged support of Russia in its invasion in Ukraine.The new premier's debut will be watched closely on Monday during the traditional question-and-answer session with the media once the parlimentary session ends.The role of premier is the highest administrative position in China's government with responsibilities including organizing and administering the Chinese civil bureaucracy.Xi, meanwhile, is both China's president — the formal head of state but not the true seat of power in China — and simultaneously the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

Initial theories suggested he may have been swept away by the waves, but later, reports focused on the possibility of desertion it.Friday (March 10) evening, allegations emerged that he had been pulled out of the water by the Chinese coast guard and taken to the nearby city of Xiamen, where he was recuperating from the ordeal. There were allegations that he had been planning to swim to China to escape debts and relationship problems.The government’s focus should be on having Chen repatriated so he could explain what had really happened, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Wang Ting-yu said Saturday.If he was a deserter, he should face the full consequences of his actions, but if there were other circumstances, his reputation should be restored, Wang said. The legislator called on the military to speed up its investigation into the case, UDN reported. Defense officials said Friday they had not received any confirmation that Chen was in China.The case could have a significant impact on military morale, so there should be a quick and thorough investigation, followed by an announcement of the result, according to Wang.",2023/03/11,3131,Politics

However, Taiwan edged ahead in the seventh and a big three-run homer in the eighth provided a route to victory in what was eventually a comfortable win.Taiwan needed to bounce back after a bruising 12-5 defeat to Panama on the opening day of the tourney and did so in style. They are now in second place in the five-team Pool A standings.The atmosphere in Taichung right now is incredible. #WorldBaseballClassic pic.twitter.com/kzb8GQkQ6MItaly manager Mike Piazza gave full credit to Taiwanese fans for helping their team over the line. “They were obviously feeling the energy from the fans, and we gave up those home runs,” he was quoted as saying in an MLB account of the match.It was a wall of noise, singing and dancing throughout the game, Piazza added. “I was very surprised with the cheerleaders and the noise throughout their offensive at-bats … when you're in the stadium, it's a whole different experience.""Taiwan got off to a good start in the game when Lin Tzu-wei (林子偉) hit a homer in the bottom of the first. Italy managed two runs in the second, but a single in the third made it 2-2.Taiwan took the lead again but was once again pegged back when Italy went on a four-run streak and made it 7-5. Going into the defining seventh inning, it was all square, when Fan Kuo-chen (范國宸) singled on a soft ground ball for Chen Chieh-hsien (陳傑憲) to restore the lead at 8-7.By the bottom of the ninth, Italy was cooked, and Taiwan celebrated its first win 11-7.Taiwan’s next game is Saturday (March 11) against the Netherlands.Absolute SCENES in Taichung!!! #WorldBaseballClassic pic.twitter.com/YM45P9J2m1",2023/03/11,380,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832174,"Silicon Valley Bank is largest failure since 2008 crisis, billions stranded","Startup-focused lender SVB Financial Group SIVB.O became the largest bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis on Friday, in a sudden collapse that roiled global markets, left billions of dollars belonging to companies and investors stranded.California banking regulators closed the bank, which did business as Silicon Valley Bank, on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver for later disposition of its assets.Based in Santa Clara, the lender was ranked as the 16th biggest in the U.S. at the end of last year, with about $209 billion in assets. Specifics of the tech-focused bank's abrupt collapse were a jumble, but the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes in the last year, which had crimped financial conditions in the start-up space in which it was a notable player, seemed front and center.As it tried to raise capital to offset fleeing deposits, the bank lost $1.8 billion on Treasury bonds whose values were torpedoed by the Fed rate hikes.Silicon Valley Bank's failure is the largest since Washington Mutual went bust in 2008, a hallmark event that triggered a financial crisis that hobbled the economy for years. The 2008 crash prompted tougher rules in the United States and beyond.Since then, regulators have imposed more stringent capital requirements for U.S. banks aimed at ensuring individual bank collapses won't harm the wider financial system and economy.The main office and all branches of Silicon Valley Bank will reopen on March 13 and all insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, the FDIC said.But 89% of the bank's $175 billion in deposits were uninsured as the end of 2022, according to the FDIC, and their fate remains to be determined.The FDIC is racing to find another bank over the weekend that is willing to merge with Silicon Valley Bank, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the details are confidential. While the FDIC hopes to put together such a merger by Monday to safeguard unsecured deposits, no deal is certain, the sources added.An FDIC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BUYERS SOUGHTSeparately, SVB Financial, the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, is working with investment bank Centerview Partners and law firm Sullivan & Cromwell to find buyers for its other assets, which include investment bank SVB Securities, wealth manager Boston Private and equity research firm MoffettNathanson, the sources said. These assets could attract competitors and private equity firms, the sources added.It's unclear if any buyer will step up to buy these assets without SVB Financial having filed for bankruptcy first. Credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings said on Friday it expected SVB Financial to enter bankruptcy because of its liabilities.SVB did not respond to calls for comment.Companies such as video game maker Roblox Corp RBLX.N and streaming device maker Roku Inc ROKU.O said they had hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits at the bank. Roku said its deposits with SVB were largely uninsured, sending its shares down 10% in extended trading.Technology workers whose paychecks relied on the bank were also worried about getting their wages on Friday. An SVB branch in San Francisco showed a note taped to the door telling clients to call a toll-free telephone number.SVB Financial CEO Greg Becker sent a video message to employees on Friday acknowledging the ""incredibly difficult"" 48 hours leading up to the collapse of the bank.The problems at SVB underscore how a campaign by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to fight inflation by ending the era of cheap money is exposing vulnerabilities in the market. The worries walloped the banking sector.U.S. banks have lost over $100 billion in stock market value over the past two days, with European banks losing around another $50 billion in value, according to a Reuters calculation.U.S. lenders First Republic Bank FRC.N and Western Alliance WAL.N said on Friday their liquidity and deposits remained strong, aiming to calm investors as their shares fell. Others such as Germany's CommerzbankCBKG.DE issued unusual statements to reassure investors.MORE PAINSome analysts forecast more pain for the sector as the episode spread concern about hidden risks in the banking sector and its vulnerability to the rising cost of money.""There could be a bloodbath next week as...short sellers are out there and they are going to attack every single bank, especially the smaller ones,"" said Christopher Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met banking regulators on Friday and expressed ""full confidence"" in their abilities to respond to the situation, Treasury said.The White House said on Friday it had faith and confidence in U.S. financial regulators, when asked about the failure of SVB.The genesis of SVB's collapse lies in a rising interest rate environment. As higher interest rates caused the market for initial public offerings to shut down for many startups and made private fundraising more costly, some SVB clients started pulling money out.To fund the redemptions, SVB sold a $21 billion bond portfolio consisting mostly of U.S. Treasuries on Wednesday, and said it would sell $2.25 billion in common equity and preferred convertible stock to fill its funding hole.By Friday, the collapsing stock price had made its capital raise untenable and sources said the bank tried to look at other options, including a sale, until regulators stepped in and shut the bank down.The last FDIC-insured institution to close was Almena State Bank in Kansas, on Oct. 23, 2020.",2023/03/11,968,World

The initial suspicion that the man might have had a female accomplice was not confirmed.Several people were taken hostage around 4:30 p.m. local time (1530 UTC) at the store in the center of the city in the southwest German state of Baden Württemberg.Police said they arrived at the scene within a couple of minutes because units happened to be nearby.Police were in contact with the hostage taker prior to entering the building.""At 9:10 p.m. a specialist unit forced entry into the pharmacy and arrested the suspected hostage-taker,"" police and public prosecutors said in a joint statement.Eyewitnesses said a loud bang could be heard as they entered.Police later said all of the hostages were unharmed after the operation.Police and proseuctors believe the man had held 11 people as hostages.Local media reports suggested the hostage taker had demanded a ransom of several million euros.For strategic purposes, the police had refused to provide any information about possible ransom demands. 
Police and prosecutors said the suspect's potential motives or reasons were not yet clear.Police said that the situation did not pose a danger to the public, but had asked people to avoid the area and follow the instructions of emergency services.Police cordoned off an ""ample"" area around the pharmacy where the hostage situation was ongoing.A school was opened up for residents who were unable to reach their homes in cordoned-off areas, police said, while events that were scheduled at nearby venues were canceled.Karslruhe is a city of roughly 300,000 people in southwestern Germany.

Failure to comply with the request could result in six months in jail and a fine of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (€12,000 or $12,740) if convicted.During the sentencing, Magistrate Peter Law said that the case was the first of its kind under the new law and the sentencing has to send a clear message to society that the law does not condone any violation.Meanwhile Chow vowed to ""fight falsehood with truth"" in a defiant courtroom speech.""Sentence us for our insubordination if you must, but when the exercise of power is based on lies, to be insubordinate is the only way to be human,"" she said. ""We know as a matter of fact that we are no 'foreign agent,' and nothing has emerged during this year-long ordeal that proves otherwise.""Prosecutors did not name which country the alliance was allegedly working for. Moreover, substantial chunks of the evidence was redacted or withheld, even from the judge.Two other Hong Kong Alliance members had pleaded guilty and were sentenced to three months in jail in 2021 and 2022.mk/ar (AFP, AP)",2023/03/11,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832379,China enters a new era as power centralizes around Xi,"Chinese President Xi Jingping is cementing his power. After unanimously getting himself elected for an unprecedented third term on Friday, he has now installed another close confident in a key post; Li Qiang was elected by the National People's Congress (NPC) this Saturday as China's new premier.Li, best known as the enforcer of last year's coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai, is believed to have earned Xi's trust by sticking to the strict zero-COVID strategy despite months-long protests in China's biggest city.This was the latest personnel reshuffle endorsed by the NPC, China's ceremonial parliament, this week. Zhao Leji, Wang Huning and Han Zheng, who were all members of the Politburo Standing Committee, were elected on Friday as the new parliament chair, chairman of the top political advisory body and vice president respectively.China policy analyst Alfred Wu told DW that Xi's reelection, along with the election of Xi's close allies, means the party will move even further away from the Western governance models.""Xi will be someone who is at the top of a pyramid system, and China's governance model under him will be much more socialist,"" said Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. ""It's something against Deng Xiaoping's policy, whose policy was letting people get rich first and learn all the best practices from the West. Now, the ideology is anti-West and socialist.""Sam Crane, an expert on Chinese politics at Williams College in the United States, notes that Xi might want loyal allies around him to ""have the flexibility and speed to respond to uncertainties.""China, the world's second largest economy, is facing a drastic economic downturn while its relationship with the United States appears to be in a nosedive.However, the downside of ""loyalty versus expertise,"" Crane said, is that the Chinese leadership may lose critical perspectives at the top.Patricia Thornton, an associate professor of Chinese politics at Oxford University, also warns that loyalty at the highest levels of power could be dangerous for the CCP.She points to the example of newly elected premier Li Qiang. He reversed his own better instincts, she says, to implement a ""shambolic"" COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai ""at great cost to the residents.""""This suggests that Li is unlikely to challenge Xi's authority moving forward and the danger is that without alternative views ... a one-man decision-making process could end up producing disastrous outcomes.""As for China's institutional reforms, proposals submitted to the NPC show that China plans to establish a National Financial Regulatory Commission to oversee insurance and banking assets that are worth $57.7 trillion (€54.14 trillion).Additionally, China's Science and Technology Ministry is facing a restructure to speed up China's push to become technologically self-reliant.China is also expected to establish a new National Data Bureau, which will concentrate data management into one supervisory organ. The bureau could potentially set and enforce rules for data collection and sharing while determining whether multinational companies can utilize data generated from their operations in China.These reforms touch on issues that are all top priorities for the CCP, says Dexter Roberts, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Indo-Pacific Security Initiative.""The creation of the Financial Regulatory Commission points to the party continuing to be very worried about excessive leverage in the economy and the high level of debt throughout the economy,"" he said.""The National Data Bureau reflects the Party's concern about data security. There is a very strong motivation to have a much stronger body that can regulate and manage the vast amount of information in the Chinese economy,"" he added.However, Roberts thinks the CCP is overlooking the dangers of increasing regulation of the private sector amid low economic growth.Following three years of strict zero-Covid strategies and a real estate slump, the Chinese economy has experienced serious damages and recovery is projected to be difficult this year.""There is a real contradiction at the heart of that and there is hubris among the top leaders, particularly Xi Jinping, that thinks he can have it both ways,"" he told DW. ""The senior leaders haven't recognized that they can't have it both ways.""Internationally, tensions between China and the United States continue to rise, as a series of recent diplomatic spats derailed efforts to get bilateral relations back on track.This week, Xi Jinping criticized the US for trying to suppress and contain China, while Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang warned that if the US continues down the wrong path, conflict or confrontation may be the inevitable outcome.Roberts from the Atlantic Council said Xi believes the US and China are locked in an ""inevitable conflict.""""He thinks ultimately the US or China is going to win, and that will be quite bad news for the relationship,"" he said. ""Both sides are pushing the relationship into an increasingly ugly standoff, and I don't think Xi consolidating power is good for US-China relations.""Edited by: Kate Hairsine",2023/03/11,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832380,"Indonesia: Merapi volcano erupts, raising alarm","Indonesia's Merapi volcano erupted on Saturday, ejecting hot clouds and lava flows up to seven kilometers, the country's disaster management agency said.Located in the special Yogyakarta region, the volcano is among Indonesia's most active.The agency warned residents in the nearby community to halt any activities in the danger zone. It added that no immediate casualties were reported.The zone's parameters range between three to seven kilometers' (4.5 mile) radius from the crater. The agency posted a video on Twitter showing the eruption.Residents were not immediately evacuated, an official at the local monitoring post said in the agency's statement. He added that it would recommend residents evacuate if the volcanic coverage exceeds a seven-kilometer distance.The volcanic ash affected at least eight villages near the volcano, another officer at a Merapi observation post said in the statement.Standing at 2,968 meters (9,700 feet), the Merapi mountain is some 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the city of Yogyakarta, the centuries-old seat of royal dynasties.The 10 kilometers (6 miles) surrounding the volcano are home to some 250,000 people.The volcano's last major eruption was in 2010, when over 300 people were killed and tens of thousands more were displaced.It showed renewed activity in late 2020. Since then, its alert status has remained at the second-highest level.Home to nearly 130 active volcanoes, Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""ring of fire,"" where continental plates meet, sparking high volcanic and seismic activity.rmt/ar (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/11,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832411,Ukraine updates: Wagner captures most of Bakhmut's east,"Russian forces have made progress in the front-line town of Bakhmut, a key target of Moscow's monthslong campaign in eastern Ukraine that has resulted in staggering casualties, the British Defense Ministry said in an assessment on Saturday.In its regular intelligence update, the ministry said units from the Kremlin-backed paramilitary Wagner Group have captured most of eastern Bakhmut, with a river flowing through the city center now marking the front line.However, the report added, it will be ""highly challenging"" for Wagner forces to push ahead, as Ukraine has destroyed key bridges over the river. Ukrainian sniper fire from fortified buildings further west has made the thin strip of open ground in the center ""a killing zone,"" it said.At the same time, Ukrainian troops and supply lines in the mining city remain vulnerable to ""continued Russian attempts to outflank the defenders from the north and south,"" the ministry said.Meanwhile, Wagner's chief has said in a clip posted Saturday that his forces are close to the center of the front line in Bakhmut.In a video posted on messaging app Telegram, Yevgeny Prigozhin is seen standing on the rooftop of a high-rise building in what is said to be Bakhmut.""This is the building of the town administration, this is the center of the town,"" Prigozhin said in the video, pointing toward a building in the distance. ""It is one kilometer and two hundred metres away.""He also announced that he was seeking to run in next year's presidential election — though not in Russia, as had been temporarily speculated, but ""in Ukraine.""Wagner has been spearheading offensives against cities in eastern Ukraine, in what has become the longest and bloodiest fight of Russia's yearlong assault. Both sides have suffered heavy losses around Bakhmut.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Saturday, March 11:Three civilians were killed in Russian shelling of Kherson in southern Ukraine, and one more died in the eastern Donetsk region, regional officials said.Kherson's regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said three people, including an elderly woman, were also wounded during the artillery shelling of the city.""Today the Russian occupiers have hit Kherson again. On a Mykolayivsky road near a shop debris from a shell killed three people,"" Prokudin told Ukrainian TV, adding that a car, several buses and a commercial property were damaged.Pavlo Kyrylenko, Donetsk's regional governor, said one person was killed and at least three civilians were injured in the city of Kostyantynivka following several rounds of Russian shelling during the day.Iran has reached a deal to buy advanced Su-35 fighter planes from Russia, Iranian state media said, expanding a relationship that has seen Iranian-built drones used in Russia's war on Ukraine.""The Sukhoi-35 fighter planes are technically acceptable to Iran and Iran has finalised a contract for their purchase,"" broadcaster IRIB quoted Iran's mission to the United Nations as saying in New York.The report did not carry any Russian confirmation of the deal, and its details were not disclosed. The mission said Iran had also inquired about buying military aircraft from several other unnamed countries, IRIB reported.Pope Francis is ready to travel to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, but only on the condition that he can then also travel to Moscow.""I will go to both places or neither,"" the head of the Catholic Church told the newspaper La Nacion from his native Argentina.The Pope had already considered a trip to both countries last summer. At that time, too, he said he wanted to visit both Kyiv and Moscow.According to Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, 61 extremists and politically motivated criminals have left Germany for the war zone in Ukraine, though they did not necessarily take part in combat operations. Around half of them are said to be in Ukraine now.The authorities did not say which war party the extremists had joined, with reference to secrecy, as the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung reports.According to the Federal Police, 31 people came from the right-wing spectrum, 24 are assigned to the area of ""foreign ideology/extremism"". In addition, there were some representatives of religious and other ideologies, as well as the left spectrum.Britain has called on Olympic sponsors, including Coca-Cola and Samsung, to support a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at next year's summer games in Paris.London hopes that pressure from sponsors will sway the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with more than a year to go until the Paris 2024 games.""We know sport and politics in Russia and Belarus are heavily intertwined, and we are determined that the regimes in Russia and Belarus must not be allowed to use sport for their propaganda purposes,"" the government said in a letter to the heads of the IOC's 13 official global partners.The IOC in January outlined a roadmap to reinstate Russians and Belarussians, excluded from world sport since the invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, under a neutral flag provided they did not actively support the conflict.Governments of more than 30 countries have asked the IOC for ""clarification"" over how Russian and Belarusian athletes would be able to compete.dh/fb (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/11,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832436,Schalke: A light at the end of the tunnel,"So much of the folklore surrounding FC Schalke 04 is based on the memory of the region's coal-mining history.From the players' tunnel which resembles a mineshaft, to the traditional pre-match ""Steigerlied"" pit song to the omnipresent miners' greetings of ""Glück auf!"", club and fans alike keep alive the memory of the treasures their fathers and grandfathers dug from the earth in this region.But perhaps nothing which emerged from the deep pits of the Ruhr Valley in years gone by would have felt as valuable as the single point that Schalke won in Saturday's Revierderby.Not only was it just reward for twice coming from behind against local rivals Borussia Dortmund, the 2-2 draw also saw the Royal Blues extend their unbeaten run to seven games and give the financially stricken club a further boost in one of the tightest relegation battles the Bundesliga has seen in years.""We saw in the first half that Dortmund were better than us in many areas and their half-time lead was deserved,"" admitted Schalke coach Thomas Reis. ""But my team never let their heads go down.""First, Marius Bülter tapped home Michael Frey's low cross from close range in response to Nico Schlotterbeck's opener, before Kenan Karaman headed home his first Schalke goal to cancel out Raphael Guerreiro's fine strike.Both goals in front of a packed Nordkurve terrace prompted explosions of ecstasy, rekindling hope that Schalke could avoid a second relegation in two years which had seemed inevitable after ending the first half of the season rock bottom of the Bundesliga with just nine points and a goal difference of minus 27.Reis only took over from former head coach Frank Kramer in October, but he immediately set about fixing the basics: not conceding goals.It didn't work immediately as Schalke began 2023 with further heavy defeats to Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig, but four consecutive goalless draws against Cologne, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Wolfsburg and Union Berlin steadied the ship thanks to a newly solidified defense built around veteran Japanese defender Maya Yoshida and German loan signing Moritz Jenz.Born in Berlin to a Nigerian father and German mother, Jenz has had a nomadic career thus far, moving from Tennis Borussia Berlin to Fulham to Swiss side Lausanne to French outfit Lorient. After a loan spell in Scotland with Celtic, Jenz joined Schalke on loan in January – and he's still only 23.With a defensive foundation in place, Reis' thoughts turned to attack, where a focus on quick wing play and crosses has become apparent.""We want to present in the box,"" explained Reis when asked by DW to elaborate on his offensive strategy. ""That's why we brought on Kenan [Karaman]. It was a great header, especially because [Bülter's] cross wasn't struck that hard so he had to generate his own power.""Just like against Dortmund, both of Schalke's goals against Stuttgart two weeks ago also came from pinpoint crosses, the first from Frey onto Dominick Drexler's head, and the second from Rodrigo Zalazar which Bülter expertly flicked home with a neat back-heel.""If he'd tried that three weeks' earlier, he'd probably have broken his ankle,"" joked Reis on Saturday, suggesting that a degree of fortune and is also playing a role in Schalke's new offensive form, which has now seen them score twice in three consecutive games.""Away at Bochum, too, we had a little bit of luck going ahead through an own goal,” he said. ""I'm just glad that we're scoring any goals at all. It's hard to explain but sometimes things just start to work.""With three more games against fellow relegation strugglers Augsburg, Hoffenheim and Hertha Berlin to come in the next four, things are starting to work just in time for Schalke.And with a tough run-in including Bayern Munich, Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig looming in May, now is the time to get points on the board.Saturday's derby day point against Borussia Dortmund may have been unexpected, but it was deserved and potentially worth its weight in gold.There is a light at the end of that tunnel in Gelsenkirchen.Edited by Michael Da Silva",2023/03/11,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832437,BBC mutiny escalates as stars rally behind Gary Lineker,"The BBC was under pressure Saturday to reinstate its highest-paid presenter Gary Lineker, who was suspended for criticizing the country's new migration policy.The decision by Britain's main public broadcaster caused a mutiny among many of Lineker's colleagues who refused to appear on TV and radio sports programs, forcing the shows to be canceled this weekend.The BBC has been accused of political bias and suppressing free speech, while supporters of the move say the broadcaster must protect its policy of impartiality.Lineker, a former England national team soccer captain, was asked Friday to ""step back"" from hosting Match of the Day — a show he has hosted for 20 years — after likening the government's rhetoric over English Channel migrants to Nazi-era Germany.Lineker was responding to a video in which Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Suella Braverman unveiled plans to stop migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats.The government proposes to ban migrants from applying for asylum and sending them to ""safe"" third countries.""This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s,"" the presenter wrote on Twitter.The BBC said the 62-year-old's comments were a breach of its impartiality guidelines.The move prompted pundits and former England strikers Ian Wright and Alan Shearer to immediately tweet that they would not take part either, followed by the program's commentators.The BBC then said it would air this week's edition of the Premier League highlights show, on Saturday night, without a presenter and pundits.The show, which has been on British screens for 60 years, will be cut down to just 20 minutes instead of the usual 60. It opened without any introduction or opening credits and theme music, simply launching into match highlights with stadium noise and no commentary.The Professional Footballers' Association said some players also wanted to boycott the show, and, as a result, players would not be asked to conduct post-match interviews.The crisis escalated Saturday when several other presenters refused to host three other soccer shows on radio and TV, forcing their cancellation and leaving viewers with no previews or final scores of games played in England's top-flight soccer league.The row has sparked a debate over the BBC's policy of neutrality and pitched the right-wing UK government against one of the country's most high-profile sports presenters.The BBC has a long history of objective news reporting without taking political sides. But the advent of social media has made its rules on impartiality hard to police.Several journalists have been reprimanded for sharing controversial opinions after director-general Tim Davie warned staff about their use of social media when he took on the role at the end of 2020.But Lineker is a freelancer, not a permanent member of staff, and is not responsible for news or political content. So many have questioned whether he needs to adhere to the same strict rules on impartiality.Meanwhile, the opposition Labour Party and media commentators have accused the broadcaster of silencing the former footballer in response to pressure from the Conservative government.""The BBC is not acting impartially by caving in to Tory MPs who are complaining about Gary Lineker,"" Labour leader Keir Starmer told reporters at a conference in Wales on Saturday.Scotland's First Minister Nicolas Sturgeon said the BBC decision was ""indefensible.""""It is undermining free speech in the face of political pressure — and it does always seem to be right-wing pressure it caves to,"" she said.Greg Dyke, who was director general of the BBC between 2000-2004, told BBC radio earlier on Saturday that the move was a mistake.""The real problem today is that the BBC has undermined its own credibility by doing this,"" as it could create the impression that the ""BBC has bowed to government pressure.""By Saturday evening, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak refused to be drawn into the row.""I hope that the current situation between Gary Lineker and the BBC can be resolved in a timely manner, but it is rightly a matter for them, not the government,"" he said.The 100-year-old BBC is often accused of both left and right-wing bias and some Conservative lawmakers want to scrap the 159-pound ($192, €180) annual license fee on households that funds the lion's share of its services.Before and since the 2016 Brexit referendum, both ""Leave"" and ""Remain"" supporters have claimed the corporation's coverage was biased against them.mm/fb (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/11,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832438,"Dutch farmers, climate activists hold protests in The Hague","More than 10,000 Dutch farmers protested in The Hague on Saturday against the government's plans to limit nitrogen emissions.The protests took place ahead of the March 15 provincial elections, which will indirectly select members of the national parliament's upper house and could have an effect on proposals for reducing nitrate pollution.Police said they stopped an unknown number of tractors that were headed for the farmers' demonstration. The city banned all but two ""symbolic"" tractors from participating, citing safety concerns.The protesters carried banners reading ""No farmers, no food,"" and, ""There is no nitrogen 'problem'"" during the peaceful demonstration organized by the Farmers' Defence Force group.Many also waved upside-down Dutch flags, which have become synonymous with farmers' protests, and balloons with the logo of the far-right Forum for Democracy (FVD) party.Relatively large numbers of livestock and heavy use of fertilizers have led to levels of nitrogen oxides in the soil and water in the Netherlands and Belgium that are higher than European Union regulations allow.The government wants to cut emissions of pollutants, predominantly nitrates, by 50% nationwide by 2030. Ministers call the proposal an ""unavoidable transition"" that aims to improve air, land and water quality, and have warned that it will mean ""that not all farmers can continue their business.""Meanwhile, climate activists held a simultaneous demonstration a few kilometers away.Thousands of environmentalists blocked a major thoroughfare in an unauthorized protest against tax rules they say encourage the use of fossil fuels. Police used water cannon to disperse a group of about 100 of the activists, including many who were blocking a highway.Environmentalists, led by the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion, scaled a wall next to the road they had blocked to hang a banner reading, ""Stop fossil subsidies.""Protesters are demanding an end to fuel tax exemptions for oil refineries and coal plants, introduced to avoid double taxation, as well as exemptions for the aviation and shipping industries that were agreed at the EU level.The twin demonstrations prompted authorities to place army trucks near some crossroads to block the streets if tractors or other protest vehicles tried to drive into the city center.dh/fb (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/11,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832494,Taiwan salutes slugger Yu Chang for WBC heroics,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Yu Chang (張育成) has provided the spark that Taiwan has needed to make it through a very difficult Pool A qualifier in this year’s World Baseball Classic.Taiwan was on the ropes against Italy 5-7 in late innings when a Yu Chang homer tied the ballgame and sparked a comeback victory. Less than 24 hours later, his 4-run grand slam put the game out of reach against a talented Dutch squad.The Dutch are a powerhouse in international baseball due to overseas territories in the Carribean: Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. These islands have provided a bounty of ball players, with nearly half of the Dutch roster coming from the MLB, including bonafide stars like Xander Bogaerts, Didi Gregorius, and relief pitcher Kanley Jansen.While such talent led the Dutch squad to the quarterfinals last year, Taiwan has never advanced past group play, mostly due to a dearth of pitching and hitting talent. Taiwan's roster is mostly homegrown with only a sprinkling of players in overseas leagues.

All rise for the Minister of Defense. (CNA photo)Yu Chang’s time in the spotlight could not have come at a better moment as he spent much of 2022 shuttling between four  teams after being groomed by the Cleveland Guardians, who stuck with him for his defense even though he only hit .200 from the plate in 2019-2022.What kept him on the Guardians' roster, and earned him a journeyman role in the MLB, were his utility infielder skills. His solid play at first base has indeed helped anchor the Taiwan team when they take the field.The Boston Red Sox jettisoned him at the conclusion of the 2022 season by “non-tendering” his contract. This year, however, they have invited him back to spring training, though he's playing without the guarantee of a position on the Red Sox Opening Day (March 30) roster.In fact, Yu Chang was so concerned about his MLB career that he initially rebuked an offer to join the Taiwan WBC roster. Netizens derided his initial hesitancy, denigrating him as no better than a lowly private (二兵) on the team, though after his recent offensive outpouring, they saluted his new rank as defense minister.As Taiwan takes on Cuba at noon today, many are hoping Yu Chang will continue to lead his team out of Pool A and potentially extend his deployment to the next round of competition in Japan. For now, the MLB can wait as his country needs his service.",2023/03/12,1326,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832504,French Senate votes to raise retirement age amid protests,"France's Senate voted on Saturday night to approve President Emmanuel Macron's controversial plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.Senators passed the reforms by 195 votes to 112 while major protests continued in cities like Paris, Nice, Lyon and Toulouse.""After hundreds of hours of discussions, the Senate adopted the pension reform plan,"" Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne wrote on Twitter. ""It is a key step to make a reform happen that will guarantee the future of our pension system.""A committee will now work on a final draft of the bill, which will then be submitted to the Senate again as well as the National Assembly for a final vote.Macron's political alliance does not have an absolute majority in the National Assembly, France's lower house, but he is banking on support from the conservative Republicains.However, if the government cannot secure a majority, Borne could push through the legislation without a vote under Article 49/3 of the French constitution, a highly controversial tool that is rarely used.On Saturday, people protested once again and workers went on strike in some cities.The CGT union said around 1 million people took to the streets on Saturday but the Interior Ministry estimated a turnout 369,000 people — lower than previous protests.In Paris, uncollected garbage began to accumulate in some neighborhoods, and airlines were forced to cancel around 20% of flights scheduled at French airports.""This is the final stretch,"" Marylise Leon, deputy leader of the CFDT union, told the broadcaster Franceinfo on Saturday. ""The endgame is now.""Some trade union representatives even brought up the idea of a referendum on Macron's plan to raise the retirement age.""If he is so sure, all the president has to do is ask the people,"" said Philippe Martinez of the hard-left CGT union.Macron has tried in both his terms as president to reform France's pension system. Most economically comparable western European countries have a retirement age of 65, or more in some cases, with many like Germany also planning to increase this in the coming years.zc/msh (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/03/12,,

A radiative cooling effect will make temperature differential significant between daytime and nighttime.Cooler temperatures will also result in intermittent rain with more clouds forming in the northern and eastern areas. Waves on the north coast of Keelung and the eastern half of Taiwan could pose a danger, increasing in height and attention should be paid to safety when going to the beach.From next Wednesday to Saturday (March 15-18), weather differential will be noticeably colder in the morning and evening when compared to daytime temperatures, which will rise in various places day by day. By next Sunday (March 19), the eastern half of Taiwan will experience sporadic, intermittent rain, though other areas will be mostly cloudy or sunny.",2023/03/12,956,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832553,US-sanctioned general to become public face of China's growing military,"HONG KONG, March 12 (Reuters) - General Li Shangfu, named on Sunday as China's new defence minister, is a veteran of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) modernisation effort - a drive that led the United States to sanction him over the acquisition of weapons from Russia.
Although his new post within the Chinese system is viewed as largely diplomatic and ceremonial, Li's appointment is being closely watched given his background, regional diplomats say.
His tenure starts as Washington pushes to restore military dialogue and communications that soured as Beijing reacted angrily to the August visit to Taiwan by then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Li's history as a technocrat - he is an aerospace engineer who worked in China's satellite programme - will help him play a key part in meeting the interim targets of President Xi Jinping's goals for the PLA, experts say.
""The operational and technological background of the next Chinese defence minister is especially pertinent given that the PLA aims to become a world-class military by 2049,"" said James Char, a security scholar at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.
In 2016, Li was named deputy commander of the PLA's then-new Strategic Support Force - an elite body tasked with accelerating the development of China's space and cyber warfare capabilities.
He was then appointed head of the Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC), China's governing defence body, headed by President Xi Jinping.
RUSSIAN PURCHASES
As director, he was named in sanctions imposed by the U.S. State Department in September, 2018 over the purchase of 10 Su-35 combat aircraft in 2017 and equipment related to the S-400 surface-to-air missile system from Russia's main arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.
Some security scholars note the sanctions - while not a deal-breaker for future meetings - add a potential complication, and could provide China's military leadership with leverage.
When asked last week about Li's impending rise, Pentagon spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Marty Meiners said that the U.S. military could not comment on media reports about China's leadership changes, but that they had been clear in wanting to maintain communications with the PLA.
""Open lines of communication can help us manage risk, avoid miscalculation, and responsibly manage competition,"" Meiners said.
Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, said China was likely to use the dynamic for diplomatic gain - either by presenting the sanctions as immaterial if they are overlooked, or by suggesting it's Washington, not Beijing, that doesn't want to engage.
""Engagement has always been a priority for the U.S., and China sees it as a concession,"" Mastro said.
Li's term at the Central Military Commission has highlighted his ties to Xi, who has strengthened his grip across the military.
Some scholars believe Li has close ties to Zhang Youxia, a close military ally of Xi, whom Li replaced as head of the department.
Zhang was promoted to first vice-chairman of the CMC during the Communist Party's Congress in October, with Li following him onto the commission's governing seven-person group.
As defence minister, Li is also likely to be closely involved with military relations in Asia, attending events such as meetings of Asian defence leaders and the informal Shangri-La Dialogue on security in Singapore.
""I think he has been elevated to this position because he's delivered for Xi Jinping in key areas of modernisation,"" said Singapore-based security analyst Alexander Neill, an adjunct fellow with Hawaii's Pacific Forum think-tank.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832601,Regulators urged to find Silicon Valley Bank buyer as industry frets about fallout,"NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Some financial industry executives and investors were growing increasingly concerned on Saturday that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank could have a domino effect on other U.S. regional banks if regulators did not find a buyer over the weekend to protect uninsured deposits.
Startup-focused lender SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) became the largest bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis on Friday, roiling markets and leaving billions of dollars belonging to companies and investors stranded.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which was appointed receiver, was trying to find another bank over the weekend that was willing to merge with Silicon Valley Bank, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Reuters was unable to determine whether a deal was forthcoming.
Some industry executives said such a deal would be sizeable for any bank and would likely require regulators to give special guarantees and make other allowances for any buyer.
With $209 billion in assets, the Santa Clara, California based lender was the 16th largest U.S. bank, making the list of potential buyers who could pull off a deal over a weekend relatively short, they said on condition of anonymity because the situation is in flux.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and the FDIC were weighing the creation of a fund that would allow regulators to backstop more deposits at banks that run into trouble, Bloomberg reported.
Regulators discussed the new special vehicle in conversations with banking executives and hoped such a measure would reassure depositors and help contain any panic, the report said.
However, it was not clear if regulators would have political support to throw a lifeline to the bank, which catered to Silicon Valley startups and investors.
The Fed and FDIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The White House said on Saturday that President Joe Biden had spoken with California Governor Gavin Newsom about the bank and efforts to address the situation.
""Everyone is working with FDIC to stabilize the situation as quickly as possible,"" Newsom said on Saturday.
SPOTLIGHT ON OTHER BANKS
Some analysts and prominent investors warned that without a resolution by Monday, other banks could come under pressure if people worried about their deposits.
""The good news is it is unlikely an SVB-style bankruptcy will extend to the large banks,"" risk and financial advisory firm Kroll said in a research note.
However, small community banks could face issues and the risk is ""much higher if uninsured depositors of SVB aren't made whole and have to take a haircut on their deposits,"" Kroll added.
Silicon Valley Bank had an unusually high level of deposits that were not covered by the FDIC's guarantees, which are capped at $250,000.
Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said in a tweet on Saturday that failure to protect all depositors could lead to the withdrawal of uninsured deposits from other institutions as well.
""These withdrawals will drain liquidity from community, regional and other banks and begin the destruction of these important institutions,"" Ackman warned.
Kyle Bass, founder and chief investment officer of Hayman Capital Management, told Reuters that the Fed needed to ""arrange a marriage"" for SVB by Sunday evening, before markets opened in Asia.
""And they've got to assure depositors that they will be paid in full because of this merger, and restore stability in the banking system,"" he added.
Regional and smaller bank shares were hit hard on Friday. The S&P 500 regional banks index (.SPLRCBNKS) dropped 4.3%, bringing its loss for the week to 18%, its worst week since 2009.
Signature Bank (SBNY.O) dropped about 23%, while San Francisco-based First Republic Bank (FRC.N) fell 15%. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL.N) tumbled 21% and PacWest Bancorp (PACW.O) dropped 38% after those stocks were halted several times due to volatility. Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) slumped more than 11%.
Signature Bank, First Republic Bank, PacWest Bank and Charles Schwab did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Western Alliance Bank declined to comment.
Some banks could look to pre-emptively raise capital to fortify their balance sheets or try to strike deals of their own, industry executives said.
When IndyMac and Washington Mutual collapsed in 2008, the FDIC found other firms to take on the assets and keep deposits intact. If no buyer is found for SVB, uninsured depositors will probably be left with a portion of whatever funds the FDIC can raise selling off the bank's assets.
Some experts, however, see the fallout from the latest collapse as limited.
""We do not see this as the start of a broader threat to the safety and soundness of the banking system,"" TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said on Friday.

He is credited with producing key icons in an early generation of artists such as BoA, Girls' Generation and TVXQ.Hints of a power struggle emerged when Lee's 43-year-old nephew Lee Sung-soo called the founder the ""Emperor of SM Empire"" in a YouTube video and criticized him for demanding unfavorable revenue sharing deals and undermining SM's governance.Lee's nephew went on to reveal that future plans for the company did not include the veteran.Lee Sung-soo, in turn, said he was hurt my his nephew's words. Soon after, he sold his 15% shares of the company to HYBE, making it the largest shareholder of SM.Share prices of the company more than doubled in a month.SM's management, arguing that HYBE's hostile takeover would create a K-pop monopoly and damage the industry's potential, brought in Kakao in an effort to take back control.The cash-rich tech conglomerate has since been seeking to buy a controlling share of SM Entertainment to block HYBE.mk/ar (Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/12,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832612,China: Xi's government doles out key cabinet positions,"China's new government led by President Xi Jinping — the most powerful Chinese politician since Mao Zedong — appointed old and new faces as key cabinet ministers on Sunday during the annual session of the rubber-stamp parliament.The ministers were nominated by newly-named premier, Li Qiang, and approved by the National People's Congress. Their appointments mark the largest reshuffling of the Chinese government in a decade.This comes days after Xi secured an unprecedented third five-year term as president, bringing him a step closer to spending the rest of his years in power.On Saturday, he appointed his former aide and close ally Li Qiang as the country's premier in a move which could end the historic struggle of power between the two heads of the country.Xi and Li opted for continuity in the core policymaking roles of central bank head and finance minister.Yi Gang, 65, was approved by the National People's Congress to remain governor of the People's Bank of China and Liu Kun, 66, to stay on as finance minister.The move came as a surprise, as the US-educated central bank chief Yi was expected to retire after being left off the ruling Communist Party's Central Committee during the party's once-in-five-years congress in October.Reuters earlier reported that Zhu Hexin, chairman of state-run financial conglomerate CITIC Group Corp, was likely to succeed Yi as head of the central bank.In other economy-related appointments, Wang Wentao will continue as commerce minister while Zheng Shanjie, governor and deputy party secretary of Zhejiang province, will take over as head of the National Development and Reform Commission, the powerful state planner.Premier Li nominated Jin Zhuanglong and Wang Zhigang to stay on as the minister of industry and information technology and minister of science and technology, respectively.The continuity underlines the importance of their roles, as China competes with the West on the technology front.Xi has previously ramped up calls for central and local government to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains at a time when US export controls have choked supplies of key equipment to some Chinese tech firms and sectors.Ding Xuexiang, 60, who also sits in the ruling Communist Party's powerful Politburo Standing Committee, has been appointed has the first ranking vice premier. He has been Xi's chief of staff for 17 year, first in Shanghai and for the past 10 years in Beijing.He Lifeng, 68, replaced Liu He as the next economic tsar. A longtime ally of Xi, Liu was in charge of the National Development and Reform Commission .Zhang Guoqing, 58, spent 20 years working in defense corporations before turning to politics and holding top positions in the provincial-level cities of Chongqing and Tianjin, as well as in Liaoning province.Liu Guozhong, 60, was the Communist Party chief of Shaanxi province, where Xi has ancestral roots.Li nominated Qin Gang as the minister of foreign affairs, another important position in the face of growing geopolitical tensions with the West over Taiwan, the South China Sea, spy balloons and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Other nominations include:Xi's decisions bode well for stability.China's economy is currently struggling to recover from the three years of COVID-induced lockdowns which impacted growth and manufacturing in the country, as in the rest of the world.The economy grew just 3% in 2022, and expects to grow around 5% in 2023 — its lowest goal in nearly three decades.According to Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, beating this growth forecast without triggering serious inflation or piling on more debt will be one of the key challenges for this government.mk/ar (Reuters, AP, AFP)",2023/03/12,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832665,Taiwan loses to Cuba in World Baseball Classic qualifier,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan battled back from an early deficit to preserve the slim possibility of advancing to the next round of the World Baseball Classic (WBC) but was ultimately defeated on Sunday (March 12).An early 6-0 lead made Cuban hitters too comfortable at the plate, while Cuba's starting pitcher, Elian Leyva, a recent signee of CPBL Rakuten Monkeys, was effective in keeping Taiwan's batters off balance. Taiwan’s pitcher Chen Shih-Peng (陳仕朋) struggled.Taiwan's manager Lin Yueh-ping (林岳平) called for a foreign substance check, asking the umpire to inspect if Leyva was using any grip-enhancing substances concealed in his glove, forearm area, and hat. Leyva was later replaced by Miguel Romero due to hand cramps.By the bottom of the fifth inning, eight of Taiwan's players had struck out. Only the catcher, Kungkuan Giljegiljaw (吉力吉撈·鞏冠) would pose any type of threat to Cuba, singling twice in the game before being pulled from the field.Panic set in for Taiwan at the top of the sixth inning as (林立) Lin Li, one of Taiwan's top hitters, was benched to make way for substitutes. The substitutions did not work, and by the seventh inning, Cuban pitchers had put away 10 straight Taiwan batters. Cuba’s Yoan Moncada, who plays for the Chicago White Sox, singled, just a triple shy of hitting for the cycle.Alfredo Despaigne, the greatest slugger in Cuban history, had the opportunity to deliver an “early termination victory” for Cuba with two runners on base. According to WBC rules, a 10-run lead in the seventh inning or later can end the game.Succumbing to early elimination would dramatically affect Taiwan’s chances of advancing beyond Pool A through a series of tie-breakers should all 5 teams in Pool A finish with a 2-2 record. The distinct possibility of a completely even 2-2 record for all teams could manifest itself should Italy topple the Netherlands in the final Pool A match on Sunday 7 p.m. (March 12).English-language announcers deemed Pool A the “Group of Chaos” due to parity among the teams. The nickname is also a nod to Taiwan bullpen reliever Chen Yu-hsun (陳禹勳) who fans refer to as the “Agent of Chaos.” He earned this nickname through unpredictable antics such as taunts directed at opposing CPBL fans.Taiwan faces an uphill battle to advance to the next round of WBC competition. (CNA photo)Chen pitched through the end of the eighth inning and prevented an embarrassing preemptive end to the game.Yu Chang (張育成) had another chance to redeem himself after going 0 for 3 at the plate. He broke Taiwan’s scoring drought, scoring Taiwan's first run of the game. Chang's hit tied him with Taiwanese baseball legend Chen Yung-Chi (陳鏞基), with both achieving eight RBIs in the WBC.It's unknown at this point if Chinese Taipei will advance to the Quarter-Final, but what an incredible few days it's been for them and their fans at Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium ⚾️ pic.twitter.com/eIElWiGSceThe final score of 7-1 was recorded, as the message “Thank you, heroes” flashed on the scoreboard. The Taiwan team bowed to the audience.Yu Chang sobbed as he embraced his teammates. He initially declined a request to join the team, only to change his mind and soon win over the hearts of fans.",2023/03/12,2292,Sports & Entertainment
