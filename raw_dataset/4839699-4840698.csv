https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839702,"Crusaders beat Blues in Super Rugby; Chiefs, ACT also win","AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Winger Leicester Fainga’anuku scored three tries for the Christchurch-based Crusaders who held on to beat the Auckland-based Blues 34-28 Saturday in a repeat of last year’s final in Super Rugby Pacific.The Blues came close to winning the fourth-round match with late tries but lock James Tucker and backrower Hoskins Sotutu both lost the ball when they were over the Crusaders line.The Crusaders’ set piece edge and tenacity in defense in the last 15 minutes made the difference. Down to 14 men at a crucial stage, they fought bravely to defend their own line.“I think in the first half we might have had the better of that half and then the Blues threw everything at us and we were lucky to get away with it really,” Crusaders captain Scott Barrett said.Fainga’anuku scored twice before halftime to put the Crusaders back in front and they went to the break leading 24-21. The second try was part of the pivotal moment in the game.Blues replacement prop Jordan Lay was sin-binned and with no other replacements the teams had to go to uncontested scrums and the Blues were reduced to 13 men. With the Blues two men down, Fainga’anuku strolled almost unopposed immediately before halftime and scored again in the fifth minute of the second half as the Crusaders took their biggest lead at 31-20.A try to Stephen Perofeta narrowed the gap but the Crusaders held on with the help of a penalty from Richie Mo’unga.The Hamilton, New Zealand-based Chiefs stretched their unbeaten start to the season to four matches with a 44-25 win over the Melbourne Rebels.The Chiefs enjoyed their best period of the match when they ran in tries to Rameka Poihipi, Emoni Narawa and Shaun Stevenson to lead 27-8 after 38 minutes. The Rebels kept the match alive with a try to Stacey Ili just before halftime.Stevenson added his second try and Tyrone Thompson added another as the Chiefs stretched their lead again to 39-15. But the Rebels came back again and scored through Nick Joost to narrow the lead to 39-20.Etene Nanai-Seturo’s try in the 52nd minute put the Chiefs ahead 44-20 but David Feliuai scored in the 73rd minute to erase the Chiefs three-try, bonus point advantage.The ACT Brumbies joined the Chiefs with four wins in four matches after beating Moana Pasifika 62-36 despite trailing 14-3 after 10 minutes. The 98-point, five-lead change match saw Pasifika take the lead on 53 minutes when Samiuela Moli drove over the line from their own rolling maul.But the Brumbies came back with four later tries to post the victory.Longtime Brumbies player Christian Leali’ifano slotted 11 points from the kicking tee.It marked Leali’ifano’s return to Canberra for the first time as a Moana Pasifika player. Leali’ifano played 150 matches with the Brumbies, while he also beat leukemia and made an emotional return to the side in 2017.He later signed with Japanese rugby and more recently shifted to the Pasifika side.Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham said before the match it was an odd feeling trying to shut down the 35-year-old Leali’ifano.“It’s good to see him back in Canberra, he’s special to this team, special to his community.” Larkham said. “It’s just a great moment for our community to have someone like that back.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839703,"Serbia, Kosovo agree on how to implement EU plan, envoy says","OHRID, North Macedonia (AP) — The leaders of Serbia and Kosovo have tentatively agreed on how to implement a European Union-sponsored plan to normalize their relations after decades of tensions between the two Balkan wartime foes, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Saturday after chairing talks between them.Speaking at a news conference after nearly 12 hours of talks in the North Macedonian lakeside resort of Ohrid, Borrell told reporters that Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti "" have reached an agreement on how to do it.”They agreed last month to the wording of an 11-point EU plan to normalize relations following the neighbors’ 1998-1999 war and Kosovo’s declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008.“Objective today was to agree on how to implement the agreement accepted in the last high-level meeting,” Borrell said. ""This means practical steps on what has to be done, when, by who and how.”Both countries hope to join the European Union one day, and they have been told they must first mend their relations. Solving the dispute between Serbia and Kosovo has become more important as war rages in Ukraine and fears mount that Russia could try to stir instability in the volatile Balkans, where it holds historic influence.Borrell said that despite the fact that “a more ambitious text” was proposed at the beginning of Saturday's negotiations than the one the parties have accepted, “it will become an integral part of their respective European Union path.”“Parties could not reach an agreement on this more detailed proposal,” Borrell said. “Kosovo lacked flexibility on the substance (of the agreement), while Serbia previously stated principle not to sign although they are ready to implement.”“It is clear that both parties will gain a significant benefit from this agreement, because the dialogue is not only because Kosovo and Serbia … It is about the stability, the security and the prosperity of the whole region,” Borrell said.The EU plan calls for the two countries to maintain good neighborly relations and recognize each other’s official documents and national symbols. If implemented, it would prevent Belgrade from blocking Kosovo’s attempts to seek membership in the United Nations and other international organizations.The agreement, drafted by France and Germany and supported by the U.S., doesn’t explicitly call for mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia.Although tentatively agreeing on the EU plan reached last month, Serbia's populist President Vucic seemed to backtrack on some of its points after pressure from far-right groups, which consider Kosovo the cradle of the Serbian state and Orthodox religion.Vucic said Thursday that he “won't sign anything” at the Ohrid meeting and earlier pledged never to recognize Kosovo or allow its U.N. membership. He repeated Saturday that he has not signed the implementation document although Kurti insisted on it.“Today wasn't any kind of a D day, but it was a good day,” Vucic said. “In the months ahead, we are facing serious and difficult tasks.”On the other hand, Kurti complained that Vucic did not sign the implementation deal on Saturday.“Now it is up to the EU to make it internationally binding,” Kurti said.Kosovo is a majority ethnic Albanian former Serbian province. The 1998-1999 war erupted when separatist ethnic Albanians rebelled against Serbia’s rule, and Belgrade responded with a brutal crackdown. About 13,000 people died, mostly ethnic Albanians. In 1999 a NATO military intervention forced Serbia to pull out of the territory. Kosovo declared independence in 2008.Tensions have simmered ever since. Kosovo's independence is recognized by many Western countries. But it is opposed by Belgrade with the backing of Russia and China. EU-brokered talks have made little headway in recent years.Serbia has maintained close ties to its traditional Slavic ally Russia despite the war in Ukraine, partly because of Moscow’s opposition to Kosovo’s independence and possible veto on its U.N. membership at the Security Council.___Associated Press writers Dusan Stojanovic contributed from Belgrade, Serbia, Llazar Semini from Tirana, Albania, and Konstantin Testorides from Skopje, North Macedonia.",2023/3/19,,World

(AP) — A California military base was put in lockdown after a vehicle went through the facility's main gate without stopping, a military spokesperson said.Naval Base Coronado spokesperson Kevin Dixon told KNSD-TV that the driver was taken into custody by base guards after the “gate runner” drove without stopping Friday night through the entrance of Naval Air Station North Island, part of Naval Base Coronado.Several patrol cars surrounded the entrance near 3rd Street and Alameda Boulevard in Coronado around 10:30 p.m., KNSD-TV reported.Multiple gates at the air station near San Diego were closed while security personnel checked the facility, Dixon said.A post on the Facebook page of Naval Base Coronado early Saturday said, “The main gate at Naval Air Station North Island is currently closed due to a security incident. Please stay away from the main gate while security conducts its investigation.”The Coronado Police Department was investigating along with military police, KNSD-TV reported.Naval Air Station North Island is one of eight U.S. military installations that make up Naval Base Coronado.In February 2022, a motorist was found with bomb-making materials at the same gate on the base.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839705,"Swiss skier Odermatt wins GS, sets World Cup points record","SOLDEU, Andorra (AP) — Marco Odermatt underlined his dominance in men's ski racing Saturday by breaking the 23-year-old male record for most World Cup points in a single season.The Swiss standout won his last race of the season, the giant slalom at the World Cup Finals, by a massive 2.11 seconds over second-place Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway.The victory lifted Odermatt's tally to 2,042 points and past the previous mark of 2,000 set by Austrian great Hermann Maier in the 1999-2000 season.“Sorry, Hermann,” Odermatt quipped in a post-race interview with Austrian TV, adding the record meant “a lot” to him.“The past days I always said: no no, not so important, just numbers,” Odermatt said. “But like I felt today with the pressure again, I knew it was more important than I said. I’m very happy that it worked.”Last week, Maier wrote on his website he hoped that Odermatt would overtake him.“In my eyes Marco hasn't even reached his zenith and can still improve, especially in downhill,” Maier said.Theoretically, Odermatt had a chance to add even more points in Sunday’s season-ending slalom, but he sits it out as he has never raced in that event on World Cup level.The overall record, between men and women, is held by Slovenian standout Tina Maze, who accrued 2,414 points when she won the women’s overall title in 2013.Odermatt, who is the Olympic champion, matched another best mark with his 13th win of the season. No male skier has ever won more races in one campaign, and only Maier, Ingemar Stenmark and Marcel Hirscher achieved the feat in the past.The overall record here is held by Mikaela Shiffrin, who won 17 times on her way to the 2018-19 women’s overall title.Odermatt had already successfully defended his overall title and secured the super-G and GS discipline globes.“I was looking forward to finals without pressure, but today I felt this pressure again,” he said. “Today it wasn’t easy, I was nervous again because of those damn 2,000 points. Now with another victory, more than two seconds ahead, I don’t know what to say.”On Saturday, the Swiss standout posted the second-fastest time in his final run as he built on his clear lead from the first run, when he was 1.09 seconds faster than Alexis Pinturault. The French skier then dropped to eighth.Kristoffersen ranked only eighth after the opening leg before climbing to second position. Marco Schwarz of Austria finished 2.29 behind in third.___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World

He said at the time, he and his developers were lucky to find a middle ground between some of the major companies in the photo collage app market, and the new entrants with little experience.“We were in between,” Fan joked, “we weren’t too professional, and our app didn't crash.” He said the simple and casual appearance of the app also allowed it to flourish in non-English speaking markets, without needing to be translated.Fan added that releasing updates for the app every week made him realize that he had found an app that people wanted. He said that for an app developer, being too busy with updates to ask what to do next means you have already found the answer to that question.Fan attributes part of his company’s success to having an international and gender-diverse team. He also said that many of Taipei’s “little details” such as safety and convenience of transport made it easy to recruit people from overseas, saying that about one third of the Taipei team have moved from other countries to work here.“The environment in Taiwan is supportive for building creative things,” Fan said, adding that this is underappreciated internationally.He said when people think of Taiwan, most think of companies like TSMC who work in the background engineering hardware, but that a benefit of working in Taiwan is that his company has “been able to find people who could work for TSMC but are excited to work in a creative environment.”",2023/3/18,1173,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839743,"Pakistani police storm home of former PM Khan, arrest 61","LAHORE, Islamabad (AP) — Pakistani police stormed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's residence in the eastern city of Lahore on Saturday and arrested 61 people amid tear gas and clashes between Khan's supporters and police, officials said.Senior police officer Suhail Sukhera, who led the operation in an upscale Lahore neighborhood, said police acted to remove a barricade erected by members of Khan’s Tehreek-e-Insaf party and his defiant supporters. He said they blocked the lanes around Khan's residence with concrete blocks, felled trees, tents and a parked truck.Khan was not in the home, having traveled to Islamabad to appear before a judge to face charges he sold state gifts while in office and hid his assets. The judge postponed that hearing until March 30.Sukhera said baton-wielding Khan supporters attempted to resist police by throwing stones and Molotov cocktails and a man on the roof of Khan's residence opened fire. At least three police officers were injured.Sukhera said police broke open the main door of Khan’s residence and found automatic weapons, Molotov cocktails, iron rods and batons used in attacks on police during the week. Sukhera said that inside the sprawling residence, illegal structures had been erected to shelter people involved in attacks on police that have injured dozens of officers.Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said later that police would do a complete search of Khan’s home, where they found bunkers and suspected more illegal weapons and ammunition were hidden.Witnesses in Lahore said police attempted to disperse Khan's supporters by firing tear gas and chased them to several homes in the Zaman Park neighborhood.Khan's lawyer appeared in an Islamabad court on Saturday after a top court a day earlier suspended Khan's arrest warrant, giving him a reprieve to travel to Islamabad and face charges in the graft case without being detained.Khan had been holed up at his home in Lahore since Tuesday after failing to appear at an earlier hearing in the case. His supporters hurled rocks and clashed with baton-wielding police for two days to protect the former premier from arrest.Khan's motorcade arrived Saturday near the federal judicial complex in Islamabad, where his supporters also clashed with police who prevented them from entering the complex. The enraged Khan supporters threw rocks at police who responded by lobbing tear gas canisters to disperse them.Sanaullah said many of Khan's supporters were armed.Khan's attorney, Babar Awan, filed an application for Khan's exemption from appearance in court amid special circumstances.Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar condemned Khan for not turning himself over to police and not appearing in court Saturday despite arriving at the judicial complex gate. He accused Khan of using his protesting supporters to avoid indictment.Khan’s supporters set two police vehicles and several motorcycles outside the judicial complex on fire while dispersing, according to Tarar.Khan, during his road trip to Islamabad, said in a video message that police had broken into his residence in Lahore while his wife was alone at the home. He condemned the action and demanded that those responsible be punished.Khan’s PTI party secretary-general, Asad Umar, in a letter to Pakistan's chief justice noted that police waited until Khan was en route to Islamabad to storm his Lahore residence. He said the “doors and walls have been razed to the ground” and more than 40 people at the home were arrested.Khan, now the opposition leader, was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. He is accused of selling state gifts while in office and concealing assets, charges he denies. It’s one in a string of cases that the former cricket star turned Islamist politician has been facing since his ouster.The 70-year-old Khan, who has called for early elections in Parliament, has claimed that his removal from power was part of a conspiracy by his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and the United States. Both Washington and Sharif’s government have denied the allegation.___Associated Press writer Zarar Khan in Islamabad contributed.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839744,"Japan, German leaders agree to strengthen ties, supply chain","TOKYO (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Saturday held the first round of government consultations in Tokyo and agreed to strengthen economic and defense ties to better cope with China's growing influence and global security concerns.Kishida told a joint news conference after the talks that the sides agreed to strengthen supply chains in minerals, semiconductors, batteries and other strategic areas, in order to “counter economic coercion, state-led attempts to illegally acquire technology and non-market practices,” apparently referring to China.“Japan and Germany, both industrial nations that share fundamental values, need to take global leadership to strengthen resilience of our societies,” Kishida said.Scholz brought six of the 17 Cabinet members for talks with Japanese counterparts, including economy, finance, foreign, interior, transport and defense ministers. They discussed deepening economic and national security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as China’s assertiveness in pressing its maritime territorial claims and its closer ties with Russia.Germany has similar “government consultations” framework with several countries.In Tokyo, the two leaders again condemned Russia's war on Ukraine and agreed to continue tough sanctions against Moscow and strong support for Ukraine, Kishida said.Russia's nuclear threat has made atomic weapons disarmament even more difficult and divided the international community, Kishida said, adding that it's crucial to get China, Russia and other nuclear states to resume discussing nuclear disarmament.Kishida is an advocate of a world without nuclear weapons, though critics say being under the U.S. nuclear umbrella makes his stance less convincing.Scholtz said the government consultations will “further advance our strategic cooperation, and they’re a very important part of giving a new drive to this close cooperation we want to achieve together,” German news agency dpa reported.In separate talks, the two defense ministers confirmed the German armed forces' continued engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and a stronger military cooperation between the countries.Japanese Defense Minster Yasukazu Hamada and his German counterpart Boris Pistorius agreed to coordinate closely in future regional deployments of the German military and step up joint exercises. They also agreed to seek a legal framework to facilitate increased joint defense activities, as well as cooperation in defense equipment and technology, the Japanese Defense Ministry said in a statement.Japan, noting growing threats from China and North Korea, has been expanding military cooperation beyond its main ally, the United States, and has developed partnerships with Australia, Britain, European and Southeast Asian nations. Kishida's government last year adopted a new national security strategy under which Japan is deploying long-range cruise missiles to strengthen its strike-back capability, a major break from the country's postwar self-defense-only principle.Scholtz visited Japan last year before going to China, making a point of prioritizing Germany’s economic ties with Tokyo over Beijing. Scholz is pushing to diversify Germany’s trade partners, while speaking out against a complete decoupling from China.Japan, along with the United States, is seeking ways to stand up to increasing Chinese economic influence in the region. Tokyo also wants to reinforce economic security with other democracies in areas such as supply chains and the protection of sensitive technologies, apparently as a counter to China.But Japan, which is a top U.S. ally and a major trade partner with China, is in a delicate situation and must balance its position between the two superpowers.For Germany, China was its biggest trading partner in 2021 for the sixth consecutive year, as business ties have flourished even though political relations have turned tense.___Associated Press journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Haruka Nuga and Chisato Tanaka in Tokyo contributed to this report.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839745,"Facing arrest warrant, Russia's Putin visits annexed Crimea","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Crimea to mark the ninth anniversary of the Black Sea peninsula’s annexation from Ukraine on Saturday, the day after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader accusing him of war crimes.Putin visited an art school and a children’s center that are part of a project to develop a historical park on the site of an ancient Greek colony, Russian state news agencies said.The ICC accused him Friday of bearing personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine during Russia's full-scale invasion of the neighboring country that started almost 13 months ago.Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move that most of the world denounced as illegal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has demanded that Russia withdraw from the peninsula as well as the areas it has occupied since last year.Putin has shown no intention of relinquishing the Kremlin’s gains. Instead, he stressed Friday the importance of holding Crimea.“Obviously, security issues take top priority for Crimea and Sevastopol now,” he said, referring to Crimea’s largest city. “We will do everything needed to fend off any threats.”Putin took a plane to travel the 1,821 kilometers (1,132 miles) from Moscow to Sevastopol, where he took the wheel of the car that transported him around the city, according to Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhaev.The ICC's arrest warrant was the first issued against a leader of one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The court, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands, also issued a warrant for the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for Children’s Rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation.The move was immediately dismissed by Moscow — and welcomed by Ukraine as a major breakthrough. However, the chances of Putin facing trial at the ICC are highly unlikely because Moscow does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction or extradite its nationals.Despite the court's action and its implication's for Putin, the United Nations and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Saturday that a wartime deal that allowed grain to flow from Ukraine to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia was extended, although neither said for how long.Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov tweeted that the deal had been renewed for 120 days, the period that Ukraine, Turkey and the U.N. wanted. But Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian news agency Tass that Moscow agreed to a 60-day extension.Russia and Ukraine are both major global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other affordable food products that developing nations depend on. They signed separate agreements with the U.N. and Turkey last year to allow food to leave Ukraine's blockaded ports.Russia has complained that shipments of its fertilizers — which its deal was supposed to facilitate — are not getting to global markets. The country briefly pulled out of the agreement in November before rejoining and agreeing to a 120-day renewal.In Ukraine, authorities reported widespread Russian attacks between Friday night and Saturday morning. Writing on Telegram, the Ukrainian air force command said 11 out of 16 drones were shot down during attacks that targeted the capital, Kyiv, and the western Lviv province, among other areas.The head of the Kyiv city administration, Serhii Popko, said Ukrainian air defenses shot down all drones heading for the capital. Lviv Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi said Saturday that three of six drones were shot down, with the other three hitting a district that borders Poland.According to the Ukrainian air force, the attacks were carried out from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov and Russia’s Bryansk province, which also borders Ukraine.The Ukrainian military reported that between Friday morning and Saturday morning, Russian forces launched 34 airstrikes, one missile strike and 57 rounds of anti-aircraft fire. It said falling debris hit southern Ukraine's Kherson province, damaging seven houses and a kindergarten.Russia is still concentrating the bulk of its offensive operations in Ukraine’s industrial east, focusing attacks on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Marinka and Shakhtarsk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk province.Regional Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said one person was killed and three wounded when 11 towns and villages in the province were shelled Friday.Further west, Russian rockets hit a residential area overnight in the city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional capital of the partially occupied province of the same name. No casualties were reported, but houses were damaged Anatoliy Kurtev of the Zaporizhzhia City Council said.British military officials said Saturday that Russia was likely to expand mandatory conscription to replenish its troops fighting in Ukraine. The U.K. Defense Ministry said in its latest analysis that deputies in the Russian Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, introduced a bill to change the draft ages for men to 21-30, from the current 18-27.The ministry said many Russian men ages 18-21 claim exemptions from military service because they are enrolled in higher education institutions. The wider age range would mean they would have to serve eventually. British officials said the law would likely pass and take effect in January 2024.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839746,Paige Bueckers's AP Diary: getting ready for March Madness,"STORRS, Conn. (AP) — I've always been a fan of March Madness.Growing up I remember watching UConn own it. Sure, I remember Stewie (Breanna Stewart) winning four in a row, but my first memory was when Stefanie Dolson helped the Huskies win. She was my favorite UConn player growing up.Fast forward to the last few years where I've actually got to experience playing in it myself. It may not have been the norm with my first year being in the San Antonio bubble because of COVID and last season I was coming back from injury, but it's an amazing feeling to play on the game's biggest stage.You work so hard as a competitor to play in this and win at the end of the season.As many of you know this year I'm out recovering from a torn ACL injury that I suffered over the summer. I've been working hard over the last six-to-seven months on rehabbing. There's still a ways to go, but every day I'm getting strong and healthier. I've been able to do more basketball drills during practice, but still am a bit way from contact.I've trusted my faith and know that God does everything for a reason and that's helped me through this. Even though I can't play I've found other ways to help the team. You don't see certain things when you're playing and I've broken things down on the bench giving tips here and there. I'd rather be “Player P” than “Coach P” but now I do what I can to help us win.I learned last year never take anything for granted when I went down with an injury and was fortunate enough to come back and play in my hometown of Minneapolis for the Final Four.The season is long and grueling and some people get tired and I remind them that they are blessed to play basketball and play here at UConn.I also know that I can still be a positive role model for kids while I'm not playing. I remember when I was young trying to get Maya Moore or Lindsay Whalen's signature and how special that made me feel. Whenever I'm at games, I take a few minutes and take selfies with people and sign autographs.I can also be a role model in other ways. My injury is unfortunately too common in women's basketball and there are many others who have gone through it. It's a long process and I hope my recovery can help inspire others to keep their faith and continue to work hard to get back healthy.Obviously we have one goal in mind and that's winning a championship, but associate head coach Chris Dailey does a great job of helping us have fun, too.The other night we had dinner at Coach’s (Geno Auriemma’s) restaurant and played a mystery game with a pajama party theme where we had to figure out who the “Riddler” was. Everyone on the team was assigned a role and coach was on the side not playing, but stirring the pot trying to distract everyone.There's no doubt that Amari (DeBerry) and Aaliyah (Edwards) were the most committed to their roles and costumes.Of course Azzi (Fudd) was the culprit we had to guess. It was a fun night.CD puts these things together to help us get out of our apartments where we spend most of the day watching basketball. Of course that’s half the fun of March Madness — watching all the games. We’re especially excited to watch our men’s team play.Until next time, go Huskies!___UConn Huskies star Paige Bueckers is checking in periodically during the NCAA Tournament.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839747,Kazakhs to vote in newly energized parliament elections,"MOSCOW (AP) — Voters in Kazakhstan will cast ballots Sunday after a short but active campaign for seats in the lower house of parliament that is being reconfigured in the wake of deadly unrest that gripped the resource-rich Central Asian nation a year ago.The snap election comes on the third anniversary of the resignation as president of Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had led Kazakhstan since independence following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and who had established immense influence. His successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, was widely expected to continue Nazarbayev's authoritarian course and even renamed the capital as Nur-Sultan in his predecessor's honor.But the country's political landscape changed markedly after a wave of violence in January 2022 when provincial protests initially sparked by a fuel price hike engulfed other cities, notably the commercial capital, Almaty, and became overtly political as demonstrators shouted “Old man out!” in reference to Nazarbayev. More than 220 people, mostly protesters, died as police harshly put down the unrest.Amid the violence, Tokayev removed Nazarbayev from his powerful post as head of the national security council. He restored the capital’s previous name of Astana, and the parliament repealed a law granting Nazarbayev and his family immunity from prosecution.Tokayev also initiated reforms to strengthen the parliament, reduce presidential powers and limit the presidency to a single seven-year term. Under the reforms, a third of the lower house of parliament's 98 seats will be chosen in single-mandate races rather than by party list.Tokayev's Amanat party holds the overwhelming majority of seats in the current parliament and the rest belong to parties that are largely loyal to Amanat. Although opinion surveys indicate that Amanat will remain the largest party in the new parliament, the likely final balance is unclear.More than 400 candidates, most of them self-nominated, are competing in the single-mandate races, and the national elections commission authorized two additional parties to enter the proportional contest.The widened competition appears to have energized the electorate.Although electioneering was allowed to start only in mid-February, “the campaign so far appears lively, in particular online and in the single-mandate electoral districts with a large number of candidates,” said an assessment from the elections observation mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Candidates have raised a wide array of issues including further political reforms, housing and rising food prices, and the country does not show a clear path forward. But many are encouraged by the expanded election opportunity.“There is hope that the upcoming parliamentary election that will be held under the new mixed electoral system will bring change and facilitate democratization and political liberalization in Kazakhstan,” analyst Assel Nussopova wrote for the Astana Times newspaper.",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839771,Shiffrin receives slalom trophy; Vlhova wins last race,"SOLDEU, Andorra (AP) — Seven weeks after securing it, Mikaela Shiffrin was finally able to hold and kiss the crystal globe for the best slalom skier of the women's World Cup season.The dominant American had already locked up the discipline title at a mid-season slalom in the Czech Republic in January, but trophies in ski racing are traditionally handed over only in the final week of the season.Her Slovakian rival Petra Vlhova used a frenetic finish on her decisive run Saturday to win the slalom at the World Cup Finals ahead of Croatian prodigy Leona Popovic, while Shiffrin placed third.“It’s the sum of a lot of hard work and many amazing races and the work of the whole team,” Shiffrin said. “I’m very thankful and very proud.”Shiffrin, who also secured her fifth overall and second giant slalom globe, won six of the 11 slaloms this season, making her the first woman to win seven season titles in slalom, surpassing Swiss standout Vreni Schneider, who won it six times in the 1980s and ’90s.Shiffrin will be after her 14th win of the season and 88th in total in Sunday's giant slalom, the last race of the season, a week after setting the record for most career victories with 87 at a slalom in Sweden.“Since Are I felt a little bit more free,” Shiffrin said. “And even then, I still feel the nerves and the pressure, like I want to win just as much as before. I still have the same motivation, which is the most exciting thing.”In a tight finish to Saturday's race, Vlhova trailed then-leader Popovic by eight-hundredths of a second at the last split but gained time through the gates on the flat final sector and finished 0.43 seconds ahead of the Croatian, who earned her first career podium.Shiffrin trailed Vlhova by 0.83 for her 17th podium result from 30 starts this season.Vlhova won the season title in slalom last year and won her second race in the current campaign after triumphing in a night event in Austria in January.“It’s (emotional) because my season was so up and down,” Vlhova said. “I wanted to come here and show my skiing in the last races and have a good feeling for the next season.”After the first run, Vlhova led Popovic by 0.32 seconds. Third-place Anna Swenn Larsson of Sweden straddled a gate in her final run.Shiffrin was 0.59 behind in fourth. The American led the opening run until the final split but lost three-quarters of a second after making a mistake entering the flat finish sector.Canadian skier Laurence St-Germain, who beat Shiffrin to the world slalom title last month, was 10th after the opening run but became one of six skiers who didn't finish the second run, which was affected by rain and wet snow as dark clouds moved over the course.“It was tricky with the snow coming. There’s just like so many weather conditions today,” Shiffrin said. “It was really fun to race, it’s a challenging slope and it’s kind of interesting to finish the season with that. Because for me it gives a lot insight into the things we can work on through the summertime and into the preparation for next season. So, it kind of leaves some motivation.”___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839772,Heathrow security guards to strike for 10 days over Easter,"LONDON (AP) — Security guards at London's Heathrow Airport will walk off their jobs for 10 days over the Easter break, the latest in a wave of strike action to affect the U.K.The union Unite said Friday more than 1,400 security guards employed by Heathrow Airport, one of Europe's busiest, will strike from March 31 to Easter Sunday, April 9, to demand better pay.Unite said those striking include guards who work at the airport's Terminal Five, which is used exclusively by British Airways, as well as those responsible for checking all cargo that enters the airport.The strikes will coincide with the two-week Easter school holidays, traditionally a peak time for travel for many in Britain.The union said workers are forced to take action because they cannot make ends meet as a cost-of-living crisis continues to affect millions of Britons. Heathrow has offered a 10% pay increase, but the union said that wasn't enough amid soaring inflation and following years of pay freezes.“Workers at Heathrow Airport are on poverty wages while the chief executive and senior managers enjoy huge salaries,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said.Inflation in the U.K. climbed steeply last year to 11.1% in October, though it dropped to 10.1% in January. That's still the highest in about 40 years, and a dramatic change after years of 2% inflation.Heathrow said it has contingency plans to keep the airport open and operational.“Threatening to ruin people’s hard-earned holidays with strike action will not improve the deal,"" the airport said in a statement.Tens of thousands of teachers, doctors, health care workers, train and bus drivers and civil servants have staged mass walkouts in recent months to demand higher wages.Union leaders representing nurses and ambulance crews have reached a pay deal with Britain’s government, raising hopes that disruptions at the country's state-funded hospitals will soon end, but many other industries remain locked in bitter pay disputes with authorities.On Saturday, thousands of rail workers staged another round of strikes that paralyzed about half of all train services across the U.K.Britons have endured many days of train stoppages since last summer as the transport unions' bitter dispute with the government drags on. More strikes are planned on March 30 and April 1.",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839775,"French protesters march past garbage piles, resisting Macron","PARIS (AP) — A smattering of protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise France's retirement age from 62 to 64 took place Saturday in Paris and beyond, as uncollected garbage reeked in the streets of the French capital amid a strike by sanitation workers.Largely non-violent protests were held in various cities, including Nantes and Marseille, where protesters got past police to occupy the main train station for around 15 minutes. In the eastern city of Besancon, hundreds of demonstrators lit a brazier and burned voter cards.In Paris, police sought to restore calm after two consecutive nights of unrest. Police banned gatherings on the Champs-Elysées avenue and the elegant Place de la Concorde, where protesters tossed an effigy of Macron into a bonfire as a crowd cheered Friday night.Several thousand protesters gathered Saturday evening at a public square in southern Paris, the Place d'Italie, then marched toward Europe’s biggest waste incineration plant, which has become a flashpoint of tensions. Some set trash cans on fire, and protesters chanted mottos such as “the streets are ours” as firefighter sirens wailed.Protesters are trying to pressure lawmakers to bring down Macron’s government and doom the unpopular retirement age increase he’s trying to impose without a vote in the National Assembly.After Macron ordered Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne to invoke a special constitutional power to skirt a vote in the chaotic lower chamber, lawmakers on the right and left filed no-confidence motions against her Cabinet on Friday. The motions are expected to be voted on Monday.Some Paris residents who were out buying their weekend baguettes blamed Macron’s administration for the fumes wafting from the trash piled up near a bakery in the city's 12th district.“The government should change its position and listen to the people because what is happening is extremely serious. And we are seeing a radicalization,” Isabelle Vergriette, 64, a psychologist, said. “The government is largely responsible for this.”The district’s mayor, Emmanuelle Pierre-Marie, was out and about from the crack of dawn voicing concern in her neighborhood about the consequences of the uncollected garbage, which has become a visual and olfactory symbol of the actions to defeat the president's pension reform plan.“Food waste is our priority because it is what brings pests to the surface,” Pierre-Marie said. “We are extremely sensitive to the situation. As soon as we have a dumpster truck available, we give priority to the places most concerned, like food markets.”Police have requisitioned garbage workers to clean up some neighborhoods, but heaps of refuse remain.More labor strikes were planned for Monday in numerous sectors, from transportation to energy. The Civil Aviation authority asked to have 30% of flights canceled at Orly, Paris’ second airport, and 20% in Marseille.Trade union confederation CGT warned that at least two oil refineries might be shut down starting Monday. Industry Minister Roland Lescure said the government could requisition personnel — order workers back to their posts — to avoid fuel shortages.At Saturday's protest, Melodie Tunc, 22, said Macron passing the bill without a vote was the last straw. Marching carefully to avoid garbage piled up on Paris streets, she said, “It is a good thing that garbage in the streets is so visible. It tells people how garbage collectors are so useful.”“The government used force to pass its bill. But we have to fight for our social achievements and the only way to do it is to take to the streets,” she said.Macron has argued that requiring people in France to work two more years is needed to invigorate the country's economy and to prevent its pension system from falling into a deficit as the population ages.Laurent Berger, head of the moderate CFDT union, said the retirement reform “must be withdrawn.”“We condemn violence. ... But look at the anger. It’s very strong, even among our ranks,” he said on RMC radio.___Jade le Deley in Paris contributed.___Follow AP's coverage of the French government: https://apnews.com/hub/france-government",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839776,Turkey’s top diplomat visits Cairo in effort to mend ties,"CAIRO (AP) — Turkey’s chief diplomat was in Cairo on Saturday for talks with Egyptian officials as the regional powers seek to mend their frayed ties after years of tension.Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, arrived in the Egyptian capital early Saturday. He was the highest ranking Turkish official to visit the Arab World’s most populous nation in over a decade.Egypt and Turkey have been at loggerheads since the Egyptian military’s 2013 ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi amid mass protest against his divisive one year of rule. Morsi hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood group, supported by Turkey. Egypt has designated the group a terrorist organization.Cavusoglu met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry for talks on “various aspects"" of bilateral relations, said Ahmed Abu Zaid, a spokesman for the Egyptian foreign ministry.Shoukry said the two sides have found common ground to relaunch political and economic relations to reach “conclusions in the interests of the two countries.”“The talks were in-depth, transparent, and forthright,” he told a televised joint news conference. “We certainly look forward. We look at everything that can benefit the two countries.”Cavusoglu spoke about making up for time lost since ambassador-level relations ended in late 2013.“There is a huge level of untapped potential but unfortunately we have lost those nine years and in order to close this nine-year gap we have to work even harder,” he said.The Turkish minister added that ties had been eroded “due to the lack of dialogue and misunderstandings.”Referring to the appointment of ambassadors, Cavusoglu said he was certain diplomatic links would return to “the highest level possible.” He also suggested the possibility of an official meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt after Turkey’s May elections.Turkey has abandoned its critical approach toward the Egyptian leader, who as defense minister led the military's overthrow of Morsi in 2013. Erdogan and el-Sissi were photographed shaking hands in November during the World Cup in Qatar, as part of concerted efforts to mend ties.The two countries have collided in other areas, including Libya, where they back opposing sides. Such confrontations nearly led to a direct clash between the two U.S. allies in 2020 at the height of an attack on the Libyan capital by east-based commander Khalifa Hifter, who is backed by Egypt.Egypt, Greece and some other European countries were also angered by a 2019 deal between Turkey and one of Libya's rival governments that sought to boost Turkish maritime rights and influence in the eastern Mediterranean. Egypt and Greece responded by signing a separate deal to delineate their maritime boundaries, a deal which Ankara rejected.Saturday's high-level visit was the first to Cairo by a Turkish chief diplomat since former Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's official visit to the Egyptian capital in 2012 to attend a Syrian opposition conference held by the Arab League.Shoukry and Cavusoglu met last month when the Egyptian foreign minister visited quake-hit Turkey and Syria to show solidarity with the two nations.___Associated Press writer Andrew Wilks contributed from Ankara, Turkey.",2023/3/18,,World

The only real official website was https://6000.gov.tw, with three zeroes and not the letter o, with a dot before the “gov.tw,” and without a “com” referring to commercial companies, the MOF said.The government warned against clicking on unknown website links, and advised netizens to call the 165 anti-fraud hotline if they became aware of a scam.",2023/3/18,2094,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839805,Following Taiwan's politics in Chinese vs. English,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — People love competitions; it seems to be in our nature. For some it is sports, for others it might be talent shows, pageants, reality shows or even dog shows — everyone has some sort of contest they follow or participate in.Not all contests are fun or entertaining, such as the ultimate contest: War. However, war’s precursor — politics — can be very entertaining and interesting, especially in Taiwan.Following politics in Taiwan is quite a popular pastime for many. Considering the population, Taiwan has a staggering number of newspapers, news sites, magazines, news stations on radio and TV and talk shows galore, many of which have extensive political coverage, often in near real-time.All the drama, the colorful characters, intense battles, betrayals, alliances, downfalls, victories and plot twists and turns are covered extensively across the partisan spectrum. There is copious amounts of speculation and interviews with “insiders” on all sorts of political topics. For example, on who will be the Kuomintang’s (KMT) presidential nominee or even very downstream issues like does one Taipei city councillor really get along with another one, or does she secretly hate her.Political pundits and pollsters are stars, even though many of them aren’t very good. Often, taxi drivers, who listen to the radio news all day, are better political analysts than some of the so-called professionals.There are so many ongoing stories and dramas, and with the plethora of media outlets, following Taiwan politics is easy. That is if you speak and read Chinese.It’s much harder to follow in English, and impossible for those who speak other languages, with the possible exception of Japanese. I gather Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong and Macau get pretty good coverage on Taiwan, though.I was strongly reminded of this when working on my previous column on the drama surrounding the KMT’s central election strategy committee, black gold (corrupt) politics and a revolt in the party against party chair Eric Chu (朱立倫). As boring as an election committee might sound, it was actually a gripping drama full of twists and turns, colorful characters like the King of Hualien, vicious attacks, a struggle for power and dominance, and the result of which could be very consequential for Taiwan in general.The entire thing played out over only three days, but it dominated the news. There were interesting new developments coming out constantly in near real time and hundreds of articles, columns and op-eds must have come out covering it all during that short time.Aside from that column, chances are if you only follow English media you’d have no idea it was going on. My column only hit all the key points, plot twists and some of the more important quotes and statements, but there were many more key politicians weighing in, other political party’s reactions (which were pretty predictable) and the memes and jokes floating around (which would have been difficult to explain in English).Interestingly, English language coverage of business, especially tech, and foreign affairs is pretty good. Business sites like Digitimes can narrowly focus on tech, and can profit by paywalling it as business executives are willing to pay for it, because they need it and Digitimes provides good intelligence.Foreign affairs has an international audience because of our unpleasant neighbor and there is almost always an English source text to work from. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Office provide plenty to write about, and stories are often picked up both locally and internationally.But when it comes to local politics, what appears in English is often in summary form or not mentioned at all. There are three main reasons for this.The big reason is that there are only six main English general news sources. These are for reading Taiwan News, the government-run Central News Agency’s Focus Taiwan and Taipei Times, and for broadcast news ICRT Radio (I’m part of their news team), RTI and the newly established TaiwanPlus TV station.The resources available to these outlets are a tiny fraction of what is available to Chinese news outlets, and those three broadcast news sources have limited news content. If you put all the news resources of all six of those outlets together, it is highly unlikely that it would rival even one of the smaller Chinese-language news outlets.This is, of course, due to the fact that the English language market is tiny by comparison. It is only in the low hundreds of thousands at most if all Westerners, Filipinos and Indians and other English speakers are added together, and assuming they all consume news, which is unlikely.Then there is the comprehension problem. This is a chicken and egg problem. Without knowing the background on something, it’s harder to understand something happening now.For example, the primary season is around the corner, and recently Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chair and presidential candidate Lai Ching-te (賴清德) met with former transportation minister Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍). Most Taiwanese would immediately grasp the importance and significance of this.They know that in Taiwan, which primary method is chosen, and for what races, has a significant impact on how candidates are chosen. They also know that, as party chair, Lai has the power in this situation, but that Lin has a powerful seat at the table and considerable negotiating power of his own.This is because Lin is head of an important DPP faction, the Taiwan Normal Country Promotion Association (TNCPA, 正常國家促進會, usually abbreviated to 正國會), which is the second most powerful in the party. Lai is from the rival New Tide (新潮流系統, usually abbreviated to 新系) faction, which is the most powerful.The factions in the DPP are a big deal in Taiwan politics, especially when they’re battling it out in the primaries and when government positions are being handed out. Yet, you never hear of them in English.The problem is that while a Taiwanese reader will know all of that, to an English language reader it is meaningless. So, when writing an article, a journalist would have to fill in an excessive amount of context for it to make any sense, which simply isn’t feasible.To try to help with this problem, I have written about the strategic primary method choices in Taiwan politics and two columns on the DPP factions (here and here). But those three columns took a few thousand words to provide the context, so you can see why local English language journalists aren’t really able to realistically squeeze that into a standard news report.That’s just one example, there are many more examples like it. One of the reasons I wrote those columns specifically was to hopefully help writers, allowing them to provide minimal context combined with links to get the full picture, and to my immense gratification, I have seen some of them used precisely that way.All that being said, it is possible to get a pretty good general idea of what is going on in Taiwan politics. There are some excellent books that provide background and context, blogs and podcasts that cover some topics, and the English news outlets here are good at covering the most important stories, if lacking some granularity.And of course, there is this column.",2023/3/18,1039,Opinion
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839806,Ukraine updates: Scholz welcomes ICC warrant for Putin,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed on Saturday a decision by the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to issue an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying it showed that ""nobody is above the law.""The ICC on Friday called for Putin's arrest on suspicion of unlawful deportation of children and unlawful transfer of people from Ukraine to Russia since Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour last year. Germany is a member of the ICC.""The International Criminal Court is the right institution to investigate war crimes ... The fact is that nobody is above the law and that's what's becoming clear right now,"" Scholz said at a joint news conference in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.The ICC move would require the court's 123 member states to arrest Putin and transfer him to The Hague for trial if he sets foot on their territory. The ICC also issued a warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children's rights, on the same charges.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Saturday, March 18:Widespread Russian attacks continued in Ukraine following the International Criminal Court's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia's commissioner for children's rights.Ukraine was attacked by 16 Russian drones on Friday night, the Ukrainian Air Force said in the early hours of Saturday. Writing on Telegram, the air force command said that 11 out of 16 drones were shot down ""in the central, western and eastern regions.""Among areas targeted were the capital, Kyiv, and the western Lviv province. The head of the Kyiv city administration, Serhii Popko, said Ukrainian air defenses shot down all drones heading for the Ukrainian capital, while Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi said three of six drones were shot down, with the other three hitting a district bordering Poland.According to the Ukrainian Air Force, the attacks were carried out from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov and Russia's Bryansk province, which borders Ukraine.Former British prime minister Tony Blair rejected comparisons between the US-led invasion of Iraq, which Blair backed, nearly 20 years ago and Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine.Blair made his view clear in an exclusive interview with dpa and the European news agencies AFP, ANSA and EFE.He said then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had brutalized his own people, engaged in two wars in violation of international law and used chemical weapons to kill 12,000 people in a single day.He said the coalition forces that went into Iraq and toppled Hussein could not be equated with Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which is ""a country that has a democratically elected president who, to my knowledge, has never started a regional conflict or committed any aggression against its neighbours.""A coalition of countries — led by the United States and allies like Britain — attacked Iraq starting on March 20, 2003, with the aim of removing Hussein from power. The goal was soon achieved but the country quickly sank into a spiral of violence.The Russian authorities are likely preparing to facilitate wider military conscription to resource its military requirements, the British Defense Ministry said on Saturday.""On 13 March 2023, Russian Duma deputies introduced a bill to change the age bracket for conscription to men aged 21-30 years, from the current 18-27. The law is likely to be passed, and would come into force in January 2024,"" the ministry said in its daily intelligence update.The ministry reminded that Russia has continued to run conscription call-up cycles twice a year since Soviet times and that they are distinct from the exceptional ‘partial mobilisation' of veterans carried out since September 2022.Russia continues to officially bar conscripts from operations in Ukraine, though at least hundreds have probably served through administrative mix ups or after being coerced to sign contracts, according to the update.Many 18-21 year old men currently claim exemption from the draft due to being in higher education, the British ministry said. So, the authorities are highly likely changing the age bracket to bolster troop numbers by ensuring that students are eventually forced to serve.Even if Russia continues to refrain from deploying conscripts in the war, extra conscripts will free up a greater proportion of professional soldiers to fight, the update said.US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has clearly committed war crimes and the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to issue an arrest warrant for him was justified.The ICC earlier on Friday called for Putin's arrest on suspicion of unlawful deportation of children and unlawful transfer of people from Ukraine to Russia since Moscow's invasion began of its neighbor last year. The United States is not a member of the ICC.""He's clearly committed war crimes,"" Biden told reporters, referring to Putin.""Well, I think it's justified,"" Biden added, referring to the warrant. ""But the question is: it's not recognized internationally by us either. But I think it makes a very strong point.""The United States separately has concluded that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine and supports accountability for perpetrators of war crimes, a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.""There is no doubt that Russia is committing war crimes and atrocities (in) Ukraine, and we have been clear that those responsible must be held accountable,"" the spokesperson added. ""This was a decision the ICC prosecutor reached independently based on the facts before him.""The ICC move would require the court's 123 member states to arrest Putin and transfer him to The Hague for trial if he sets foot on their territory. The ICC also issued a warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children's rights, on the same charges.Three senior US security officials held a video call with a group of their Ukrainian counterparts to discuss military aid to Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff said.""We discussed the further provision of necessary assistance to our country, in particular vehicles, weapons and ammunition,"" Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram.He added that Zelenskyy had joined the meeting at the end to give his views on the liberation of Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia.Turkey is hoping that a grain export deal between Kyiv and Moscow key to alleviating a global food crisis can be extended for another 120 days. The current deal expires just before midnight on Saturday, Istanbul time.""The deadline is approaching,"" Turkey's Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Friday. ""We are in touch with both Ukraine and Russia about extending the agreement under its original terms.""The original terms Akar referred to were for the 120-day extensions to be automatically renewed for the same period unless one of the parties says otherwise. But on Monday, after a meeting with senior UN officials in Geneva, Moscow announced a proposal to extend the agreement for only 60 days.Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 saw Ukraine's Black Sea ports blocked by warships. But a deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July 2022 has allowed for the safe passage of exports of critical grain supplies.The United Nations is ""doing everything possible"" to ensure the Black Sea grain deal continues, aid chief Martin Griffiths told the UN Security Council on Friday.The International Monetary Fund said its executive board on Friday approved rule changes that would allow the IMF to approve new loan programs for countries facing ""exceptionally high uncertainty."" This move is expected to pave the way for a new Ukraine loan program.The changes to the IMF's financing assurances policy would apply to countries experiencing ""exogenous shocks that are beyond the control of country authorities and the reach of their economic policies,"" the IMF said in a statement.Ukraine, which has been battling a Russian invasion for more than a year, is seeking an IMF financing package of around $15 billion.But the Fund's rules designed to deal with country economic crises did not allow for non-emergency loans to countries facing such massive uncertainties, such as from major wars or multi-year natural disasters induced by climate change.The IMF said the rule revisions would address key barriers to such loans by allowing official bilateral creditors and donors to provide upfront assurances about repayment to the IMF and delivering debt relief to the borrowing country.The IMF statement did not mention Ukraine specifically, but the rule changes have been designed alongside negotiations with authorities in Kyiv over new financing.dh/jcg (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/3/18,,

He was replaced by a coalition government which Imran Khan claims ""cannot win free and fair elections.""Imran Khan was addressing charges in an Islamabad court of unlawfully selling state gifts given to him by foreign dignitaries will he was in office.Khan says he received the gifts legally.The former prime minister told the Reuters news agency that he had formed a committee to lead his center-right Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in case of his arrest.The former prime minister failed to attend a hearing on Tuesday, after which a warrant was issued for his arrest.Imran Khan told DW that he did not attend the hearing because it was a ""death trap"" that lacked proper security guarantees.""The only reason this whole big thing blew up because of one appearance that I didn't make,"" he said. ""And that appearance was in this in a court where all my security team told me that there was no protection.""""On one hand, the government says your life is under threat. Secondly, they want me to appear in this particular court, which is a death trap,"" he said.""It was only that one appearance I missed and that led to these warrants.""Khan was shot and wounded while campaigning in November.The former prime minister has argued that the charges against him are politicized, constituting an attempt to prevent him from running from office.""Ever since my government was ousted 11 months ago, there were 37 by-elections.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839808,Budget dispute exposes cracks in Germany's government,"Beefing up the military, phasing out fossil fuels, modernizing infrastructure, reforming the social benefits system, the education sector, health and the pension system... The German government has a long list of urgent projects. And all of them come with a hefty price tag.The various ministries' wishes add up to around €70 billion ($74,3 bio) but Finance Minister Christian Lindner is digging his heels in.He was set to present the key points for his 2024 federal budget to the chancellor and his ministerial colleagues in mid-March. But with his coalition partners unwilling to accept austerity measures, that appointment was unceremoniously scrapped.""We will have to talk about financial realities again in the Cabinet,"" the finance minister stressed. From his point of view, there is simply no money left for most of the projects the coalition had agreed upon when it came to power in December 2021.An estimated 30 bills are currently on hold because the three coalition partners — Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens, and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) — do not agree. Since the projects are not prioritized in the coalition agreement, each party believes that its respective political concerns should have priority.""We have to learn to make do with the financial framework available,"" the finance minister warns. That means setting priorities, ""because not everything can be financed at the same time.""Lindner is deliberately not naming a new deadline for the budget cornerstones and is thus aiming to build up pressure. Without a financial basis, the ministries cannot tackle any new legislative projects.The FDP chairman is keen to implement one of his most important election promises: To reinstate the so-called ""Schuldenbremse"" (debt brake) enshrined in the constitution — a ceiling limiting fresh debt in any annual budget to 1% of GDP.Germany is sitting on a mountain of debt after billions went into alleviating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, before last year's spending spree: €60 billion for climate protection, €100 billion to upgrade the Bundeswehr, €200 billion to compensate households and businesses for high energy costs.And interest payments have increased significantly due to inflation and interest rate increases. The debts amount to around 2.5 trillion euros. This year, the finance minister will have to transfer around 40 billion euros in interest to creditors. That is ten times more than two years ago.Budget disputes are not unusual. But this time the ideas are so far apart that a compromise is hard to imagine.The Greens see taking on new debt mainly as investments into the future. Weeks ago, Economy Minister and Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck wrote a letter to the finance minister on behalf of all Green ministers, telling him that his party was not prepared to sacrifice its political projects agreed upon by all three parties last year. The debt brake was by no means more important, he said.There is not much left of the former harmony that the SPD, the Greens, and the FDP made a show of when they took office in December 2021.The potential for conflict was there right from the start. The SPD and the Greens are left-leaning parties that care about social justice and ecology and advocate a strong state. If more money is needed, they see tax hikes as a good option.In many respects, the neoliberal FDP propagates the opposite: As little regulation as possible, low taxes for companies and top earners, and as little social spending as possible.The SPD and Greens are now calling for tax loopholes to be closed and subsidies to be eliminated in order to increase the state's revenues.""Subsidies that are harmful to the climate are a burden on the state budget and delay the transformation to a climate-neutral economy,"" Economics Professor Monika Schnitzer the chairwoman of the German Council of Economic Experts told several newspapers this month. This would mean scrapping tax rebates for kerosene, diesel fuel, and privately used company cars and VAT exemption for international flights, which would mean an additional 30 billion euros a year into state coffers.Other economists suggest scrapping the tax breaks for the catering and hotel industry granted in the COVID-19 pandemic or they suggest raising retirement or reducing pensions.The FDP does not want to cut subsidies that benefit its top-earning, car-loving voters. Following a beating in no less than five regional elections, the party is under a lot of pressure to please its voters.But the FDP and the SPD also have every reason to avoid a break-up of the coalition government. Both parties have slumped in the polls, while the center-right opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) have seen their fortunes rise again. In several states, the CDU has teamed up with the Greens, who have seen solid support. New elections, pundits say, would likely cost the Social Democrats the chancellorship.By June, the government must present its 2024 budget proposal to the Bundestag, the federal parliament. The final vote will not be taken until December 1, and experience shows that no budget leaves parliament in the form in which it was submitted by the government.This article was originally written in German.",2023/3/18,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839814,"Lights out for Philly's famous Boathouse Row, for now","The bright lights of Philadelphia’s famous Boathouse Row — long one of the city’s signature nighttime sights — are going dark, at least for now.Outlining a cluster of historic boathouses along the Schuylkill River near the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the twinkly lights reflect off the water and give definition to the unique architecture of each building. “It's in some ways our postcard shot of Philadelphia,” explained Tara Rasheed of Fairmount Park Conservancy, as indelible as the Liberty Bell or the art museum steps in “Rocky.”Starting Monday, though, the lights will be switched off and taken down as work gets underway on a $2.1 million replacement project. If all goes to plan, a new, upgraded lighting system should be ready for the winter holiday season.The buildings store the long, slender boats used by rowing crews, and have wide garage-door-like bays that open onto ramps that slope down to the water's edge. Many have steep roofs or Tudor or Victorian-influenced architecture, which are accentuated by the lights.Strings of lights were first installed along Boathouse Row in 1979 ahead of Pope John Paul II’s visit to Philadelphia. LED replacements arrived in 2005. Since then, time, weather and wildlife have taken their toll, leading to regular outages.“Wholesale replacement to a more robust and durable system made sense in terms of the budget,” said Rasheed, the director of capital projects at Fairmount Park Conservancy, a nonprofit that works with the city to support the public park system.Boathouse Row traces its history to the 1800s as Philadelphians flocked to the river for recreation and the city emerged as a major center of rowing. It became a National Historic Landmark in 1987.Bonnie Mueller, commodore of the Schuylkill Navy, an association of amateur rowing clubs in Philadelphia, said Boathouse Row occupies a unique place in the city — while its buildings are individually maintained by the clubs that own and use them, collectively they form “a very iconic and important public landscape.”“We recognize the lights of Boathouse Row mean something to people, and we see that as a gift and a responsibility,"" she said. """"We are incredibly confident and excited to get the project going and are looking forward to celebrating its completion by the end of the year.""The new, programmable lighting system will have 6,400 individual LED lights with 16 million color combinations — think Eagles green on game day — mounted to a custom track that will help protect them against the elements.A private donor supplied most of the funding for the lighting project, while the City of Philadelphia, which is responsible for maintaining and operating the lights, is contributing $600,000.While the lights are dark, clubs will be able to do building repairs on areas that were previously inaccessible. One club is planning a roof replacement, according to Rasheed,“It is so important for Philadelphians and for visitors alike to have this beautiful landscape,” said Philadelphia Parks and Recreation Commissioner Kathryn Ott Lovell. “It’s the image we think about when we think about Philadelphia. ... We have to take great care to put our best foot forward and make sure the physical beauty of our city reflects the passions of our residents.”",2023/3/18,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839816,UK minister in Rwanda to reinforce migrant deportation plan,"LONDON (AP) — Britain's interior minister arrived in Rwanda on Saturday for a visit aimed at reinforcing the U.K. government's commitment to a controversial plan to deport some asylum-seekers to the African country.Ahead of her visit, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the migration policy “will act as a powerful deterrent against dangerous and illegal journeys.”Britain's Conservative government wants to stop migrants from reaching the U.K. on risky journeys across the English Channel, and a deportation agreement signed with Rwanda last year was part of measures intended to deter the arrivals. More than 45,000 people arrived in Britain by boat in 2022, compared with 8,500 in 2020.Under the plans, some migrants who arrive in the U.K. in small boats would be flown to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be processed. Those granted asylum would stay in the African country rather than return to Britain.But the 140 million-pound ($170 million) plan has been mired in legal challenges, and no one has yet been sent to Rwanda. The U.K. was forced to cancel the first deportation flight at the last minute in June after the European Court of Human Rights ruled the plan carried “a real risk of irreversible harm.”Human rights groups cite Rwanda's poor human rights record, and argue it is inhumane to send people more than 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) to a country they don’t want to live in.Earlier this week, a group of asylum-seekers from countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria were granted permission to launch court appeals against the British government's decision to relocate them.Defending the plan, Braverman said it will “support people to rebuild their lives in a new country” as well as boost Rwanda's economy through investments in jobs and skills.She is expected to meet President Paul Kagame and her counterpart, Vincent Biruta, to discuss details of the deportation agreement.Sonya Sceats, chief executive at the nonprofit Freedom from Torture, described the policy as a “cash-for-humans"" plan.“Rather than pushing through this inhumane and unworkable policy, ministers should focus on establishing safe routes to the U.K. and tackling the unacceptable backlog of asylum claims, so people fleeing war and persecution can rebuild their lives with dignity,"" she said.___Follow AP’s coverage of global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839817,Journalists held over South Sudan president video are freed,"JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — South Sudan’s National Security Service has released the remaining journalists who had been detained for weeks over a video apparently showing the country’s president urinating on himself during an event.At least seven journalists with the state broadcaster were detained in January following the circulation of the video of President Salva Kiir during the inauguration of a road project.In a statement on Friday, the Union of Journalists of South Sudan said the two remaining journalists had been freed. None of the journalists were charged.The union ""will continue to engage with all stakeholders in the country to ensure journalists work in a free and safe environment,” the journalists' organization said.The South Sudan Broadcasting Corporation footage aired in December and was widely shared online. It showed the 71-year-old Kiir standing during the national anthem and then looking down at what appeared to be a spreading stain, before the camera turned away.One of the released journalists, Garang John, in a Facebook post said his health had been “totally compromised” by the 60 days of confinement.“I am completely weak and tired but it shall be well,"" he said.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839818,"Bank failures: Anger in Congress, but division on what to do","WASHINGTON (AP) — Bills were filed, hearings were planned and blame was cast as Congress reacted this past week to the abrupt failure of two banks. A look at what lawmakers are saying and planning as the fallout continues from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.QUICK LEGISLATIVE FIXES UNLIKELYWhile President Joe Biden called Monday on Congress to strengthen the rules for banks to prevent future failures, lawmakers are divided on whether any legislation is needed.Some congressional leaders are skeptical that a closely divided Congress will act at all.“There’s people who are going to choose bills, but I cannot imagine that, with the hold banks have on Republican members of Congress, that we can pass anything significant,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.Republicans say the laws already in place were sufficient to prevent the bank failures, if only regulators had done their job by spotting obvious problems and directing the banks to take steps that would reduce their risk.“If there are ideas out there that people have, you know, at some point, we would be willing to entertain those, but I think it would be premature to start talking about solutions before we fully define the problem and ultimately get answers from the regulators about why they were asleep at the job,"" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican.___SO WHAT'S NEXT? The House Financial Services Committee has announced its first hearing for March 29, featuring at least two witnesses: Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s board of directors, and Michael Barr, vice chair for supervision with the Federal Reserve's board of governors. ""We will conduct this hearing without fear or favor to get the answers the American people deserve,” lawmakers said.On the Senate side, Brown said his committee will also hold a hearing soon to help lawmakers assess what went wrong. He said the first hearing is likely to focus on bringing in witnesses responsible for regulating the failed banks. The Fed board was the primary regulator for Silicon Valley Bank in California, while the FDIC was the primary federal regulator for Signature Bank in New York.Brown spelled out some of the questions lawmakers probably will have for the regulators in a letter Thursday asking them to undertake a comprehensive review of what went wrong. What role did social media-led coordination among customers play? What role did the large percentage of uninsured deposits at Silicon Valley Bank play? Were there regulatory gaps with respect to capital, liquidity and stress testing that played a role in the failures?Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said he wants to know why regulators did not act on detailed reports of a liquidity risk at Silicon Valley Bank and why the FDIC failed to auction off the bank's remaining parts last weekend.Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said she wants to know if regulators intend to use the failure of Signature Bank to further crack down on cryptocurrency. She has been a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency development and is an investor in bitcoin. Signature was the first FDIC-insured bank to offer a blockchain-based digital payment platform in 2019 and had been a go-to bank for the crypto industry.Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he wanted to know how private stock analysts had warned about Silicon Valley's investments but regulators did not seem to know about potential problems.___CONGRESSIONAL ACTION Democrats in both chambers have rallied around two legislative proposals. The first, from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., would repeal the 2018 rollback of certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act enacted after the financial crisis a decade earlier.The Dodd-Frank Act subjected all banks with $50 billion or more in assets to enhanced regulation, such as annual stress testing and the submission of resolution plans or “living wills” in the event of bankruptcy.But after years of complaints from community and regional banks about the cost of compliance, Congress lifted the threshold for meeting all the Dodd-Frank Act requirements to $250 billion.Banks with assets valued at less than $100 billion were automatically exempted from the enhanced regulation. The Fed was given the discretion to apply on a case-by-case basis the enhanced oversight for banks between the $100 billion and $250 billion level. Both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank fell in that category.“President Trump's rollback paved the way for the SVB collapse,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on the Senate floor Thursday.But Republicans have countered that the tiered oversight they established in 2018 with the support of several Democrats in both chambers gave federal regulators all the tools they needed to catch the problems at Silicon Valley and Signature before they became fatal.“I think the issue here is liquidity and there are liquidity stress tests that regulators have established for the banks,” said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and the author of the 2018 changes to Dodd-Frank. “If they need to tighten those up, they have the authority to do it.”With that philosophical divide, it's unlikely the Warren and Porter bill will advance in Congress.A second bill might have a better shot. The bill from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Mike Levin of California would recoup any bonuses and profits that bank executives receive from stock sales make in the 60 days before a bank failure.Republicans also directed considerable ire at the executives of the failed banks this week.“I think all of that ought to be clawed back,” Kennedy said of bonuses. “And this time, I hope somebody goes to jail.”On Friday, Biden called on Congress to grant the FDIC the power to force the return of compensation paid to executives at a broader range of banks should they fail, and to lower the threshold for the regulator to impose fines and bar executives from working at another bank.___POINTING FINGERS AT THE OTHER PARTYThe recent bank failures create an opportunity to shape the political narrative for next year's election.While Republicans are saying that regulators were “asleep at the switch,” they are also trying to tie Biden and Democrats to the turmoil by blaming them for higher inflation, which is leading to the higher interest rates and reduced the value of Silicon Valley Banks investments.“A failure of the bank, a failure with regulators, and without any question, a failure at the top,” said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in reference to Biden.Democrats are pinning the failures on the changes Republicans led in scaling back Dodd-Frank requirements for certain banks, saying it's an example of how Washington caters to powerful interest groups rather than average voters.“The 2018 rollbacks permitted the banks to take on more risk in order to boost their profits,” Warren said. “So what did they do? They took on more risks, boosted their profits, gave their executives big bonuses and salaries, and then blew the banks up.”",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839821,Pro-Moscow voices tried to steer Ohio train disaster debate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Soon after a train derailed and spilled toxic chemicals in Ohio last month, anonymous pro-Russian accounts started spreading misleading claims and anti-American propaganda about it on Twitter, using Elon Musk's new verification system to expand their reach while creating the illusion of credibility.The accounts, which parroted Kremlin talking points on myriad topics, claimed without evidence that authorities in Ohio were lying about the true impact of the chemical spill. The accounts spread fearmongering posts that preyed on legitimate concerns about pollution and health effects and compared the response to the derailment with America's support for Ukraine following its invasion by Russia.Some of the claims pushed by the pro-Russian accounts were verifiably false, such as the suggestion that the news media had covered up the disaster or that environmental scientists traveling to the site had been killed in a plane crash. But most were more speculative, seemingly designed to stoke fear or distrust. Examples include unverified maps showing widespread pollution, posts predicting an increase in fatal cancers and others about unconfirmed mass animal die-offs.“Biden offers food, water, medicine, shelter, payouts of pension and social services to Ukraine! Ohio first! Offer and deliver to Ohio!” posted one of the pro-Moscow accounts, which boasts 25,000 followers and features an anonymous location and a profile photo of a dog. Twitter awarded the account a blue check mark in January.Regularly spewing anti-US propaganda, the accounts show how easily authoritarian states and Americans willing to spread their propaganda can exploitsocial mediaplatforms like Twitter in an effort to steer domestic discourse.The accounts were identified by Reset, a London-based nonprofit that studies social media's impact on democracy, and shared with The Associated Press. Felix Kartte, a senior advisor at Reset, said the report's findings indicate Twitter is allowing Russia to use its platform like a bullhorn.""With no one at home in Twitter’s product safety department, Russia will continue to meddle in US elections and in democracies around the world,” Kartte said.Twitter did not respond to messages seeking comment for this story.The 38-car derailment near East Palestine, Ohio, released toxic chemicals into the atmosphere, leading to a nationaldebate over rail safety and environmental regulations while raising fears of poisoned drinking water and air.The disaster was a major topic on social media, with millions of mentions on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, according to an analysis by San Francisco-based media intelligence firm Zignal Labs, which conducted a study on behalf of the AP.At first, the derailment received little attention online but mentions grew steadily, peaking two weeks after the incident, Zignal found, a time lag that gave pro-Russia voices time to try to shape the conversation.The accounts identified by Reset's researchers received an extra boost from Twitter itself, in the form of a blue check mark. Before Musk purchased Twitter last year, it's check marks denoted accounts run by verified users, often public figures, celebrities or journalists. It was seen as a mark of authenticity on a platform known for bots and spam accounts.Musk ended that system and replaced it with Twitter Blue, which is given to users who pay $8 per month and supply a phone number. Twitter Blue users agree not to engage in deception and are required to post a profile picture and name. But there's no rule that they use their own.Under the program, Twitter Blue users can write and send longer tweets and videos. Their replies are also given higher priority on other posts.The AP reached out to several of the accounts listed in Reset’s report. In response, one of the accounts sent a two-word message before blocking the AP reporter on Twitter: “Shut up.”While researchers spotted clues suggesting some of the accounts are linked to coordinated efforts by Russian disinformation agencies, others were Americans, showing the Kremlin doesn't always have to pay to get its message out.One account, known as Truth Puke, is connected to a website of the same name geared toward conservatives in the United States. Truth Puke regularly reposts Russian state media; RT, formerly known as Russia Today, is one of its favorite groups to repost, Reset found. One video posted by the account features ex-President Donald Trump's remarks about the train derailment, complete with Russian subtitles.In a response to questions from the AP, Truth Puke said it aims to provide a “wide spectrum of views” and was surprised to be labeled a spreader of Russian propaganda, despite the account's heavy use of such material. Asked about the video with Russian subtitles, Truth Puke said it used the Russian language version of the Trump video for the sake of expediency.“We can assure you that it was not done with any Russian propagandist intent in mind, we just like to put out things as quickly as we find them,” the company said.Other accounts brag of their love for Russia. One account on Thursday reposted a bizarre claim that the U.S. was stealing humanitarian earthquake relief supplies donated to Syria by China. The account has 60,000 followers and is known as Donbass Devushka, after the region of Ukraine.Another pro-Russian account recently tried to pick an online argument with Ukraine's defense department, posting photos of documents that it claimed came from the Wagner Group, a private military company owned by a Yevgeny Prigozhin, a key Putin ally. Prigozhin operates troll farms that have targeted U.S. social media users in the past. Last fall he boasted of his efforts to meddle with American democracy.A separate Twitter account claiming to represent Wagner actively uses the site to recruit fighters.“ Gentlemen, we have interfered, are interfering and will interfere,"" Prigozhin said last fall on the eve of the 2022 midterm elections in the U.S. ""Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do,” Prigozhin said at the time.",2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839822,Rainy end to Taiwan weekend to be followed by rising temperatures,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — While the weekend is expected to close with an increasing chance of rain in the north, next week will see temperatures rise up to 35 degrees Celsius in the south and east, forecasters said Saturday (March 18).Northeastern seasonal winds were likely to bring more rain along the northeast coast, the east, and mountainous areas in Taipei Sunday (March 19), with the precipitation expanding across the north Sunday night until Monday (March 20) morning, per UDN. Temperatures would be slightly higher than Saturday at 20 to 22 degrees, though in south Taiwan they were likely to reach 25 to 30 degrees.Southerly winds would dominate the weather from Monday until the next weekend, helping to raise temperatures day by day, according to forecasters. In the second half of the week, most of the country will register temperatures 30 degrees or higher.Areas close to mountains in the center and south as well as the East Rift Valley in the counties of Hualien and Taitung would see the mercury reach 35 degrees, with dry weather across the country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839843,Trump says in social media post he'll be arrested on Tuesday as Manhattan prosecutor eyes charges in hush money case,NEW YORK (AP) — Trump says in social media post he'll be arrested on Tuesday as Manhattan prosecutor eyes charges in hush money case.,2023/3/18,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839844,"Trump says he expects to be arrested, calls for protest","NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump claimed on Saturday that his arrest is imminent and issued an extraordinary call for his supporters to protest as a New York grand jury investigates hush money payments to women who alleged sexual encounters with the former president.Even as Trump's lawyer and spokesperson said there had been no communication from prosecutors, Trump declared in a post on his social media platform that he expects to be taken into custody on Tuesday.His message seemed designed to preempt a formal announcement from prosecutors and to galvanize outrage from his base of supporters in advance of widely anticipated charges. Within hours, his campaign was sending fundraising solicitations to his supporters, while influential Republicans in Congress and even some declared and potential rival candidates issued statements in his defense.In a later post that went beyond simply exhorting loyalists to protest about his legal peril, the 2024 presidential candidate directed his overarching ire in all capital letters at the Biden administration and raised the prospect of civil unrest: “IT’S TIME!!!” he wrote. “WE JUST CAN’T ALLOW THIS ANYMORE. THEY’RE KILLING OUR NATION AS WE SIT BACK & WATCH. WE MUST SAVE AMERICA!PROTEST, PROTEST, PROTEST!!!”It all evoked, in foreboding ways, the rhetoric he used shortly before the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. After hearing from the then-president at a Washington rally that morning, his supporters marched to the Capitol and tried to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's White House victory, breaking through doors and windows of the building and leaving officers beaten and bloodied.District Attorney Alvin Bragg is thought to be eyeing charges in the hush money investigation, and recently offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury. Local law enforcement officials are bracing for the public safety ramifications of an unprecedented prosecution of a former American president.In an internal email following Trump’s statements, Bragg said law enforcement would ensure that the 1,600 people who work in his office would remain safe, and that “any specific or credible threats” would be investigated.“We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York,” he wrote, and added: “In the meantime, as with all of our investigations, we will continue to apply the law evenly and fairly, and speak publicly only when appropriate.”There has been no public announcement of any time frame for the grand jury’s secret work in the case. At least one additional witness is expected to testify, further indicating that no vote to indict has yet been taken, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity.That did not stop Trump from taking to his social media platform to say “illegal leaks” from Bragg's office indicate that “THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE & FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.”A Trump lawyer, Susan Necheles, said Trump's post was “based on the media reports,"" and a spokesperson said there had been “no notification” from Bragg's office, though the origin of Trump's Tuesday reference was unclear. The district attorney’s office declined to comment.Trump's aides and legal team have been preparing for the possibility of an indictment. Should that happen, he would be arrested only if he refused to surrender. Trump’s lawyers have previously said he would follow normal procedure, meaning he would likely agree to surrender at a New York Police Department precinct or directly to Bragg’s office.It is unclear whether Trump’s supporters would heed his protest call or if he retains the same persuasive power he held as president. Trump’s posts on Truth Social generally receive far less attention than he used to get on Twitter, but he maintains a deeply loyal base. The aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, in which hundreds of Trump loyalists were arrested and prosecuted in federal court, may also have dampened the passion among supporters for confrontation.The indictment of Trump, 76, would be an extraordinary development after years of investigations into his business, political and personal dealings.Even as Trump pursues his latest White House campaign — his first rally is set for Waco, Texas, later this month and he shook hands and took selfies with fans during a public appearance Saturday evening at the NCAA Division I wrestling championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma — there is no question an indictment would be a distraction and give fodder to opponents and critics tired of the legal scandals that have long enveloped him.Besides the hush money inquiry in New York, Trump faces separate criminal investigations in Atlanta and Washington over his efforts to undo the results of the 2020 election.A Justice Department special counsel has also been presenting evidence before a grand jury investigating Trump’s possession of hundreds of classified documents at his Florida estate. It is not clear when those investigations will end or whether they might result in criminal charges, but they will continue regardless of what happens in New York, underscoring the ongoing gravity – and broad geographic scope – of the legal challenges facing the former president.Trump's post Saturday echoes one made last summer when he broke the news on Truth Social that the FBI was searching his Florida home as part of an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents.News of that search sparked a flood of contributions to Trump’s political operation, and on Saturday, Trump sent out a series of fundraising emails to his supporters, including one that claimed, “I’m not worried in the slightest.”After his post, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy decried any plans to prosecute Trump as an “outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA” whom he claimed was pursuing “political vengeance.” Rep. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, issued a statement with a similar sentiment.The grand jury has been hearing from witnesses, including former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who says he orchestrated payments in 2016 to two women to silence them about sexual encounters they said they had with Trump a decade earlier.Trump denies the encounters occurred, says he did nothing wrong and has cast the investigation as a “witch hunt” by a Democratic prosecutor bent on sabotaging the Republican’s 2024 campaign. Trump also has labeled Bragg, who is Black, a “racist” and has accused the prosecutor of letting crime in the city run amok while he has focused on Trump. New York remains one of the safest cities in the country.Bragg’s office has apparently been examining whether any state laws were broken in connection with the payments or the way Trump’s company compensated Cohen for his work to keep the women’s allegations quiet.Porn actor Stormy Daniels and at least two former Trump aides — onetime political adviser Kellyanne Conway and former spokesperson Hope Hicks — are among witnesses who have met with prosecutors in recent weeks.Cohen has said that at Trump’s direction, he arranged payments totaling $280,000 to Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. According to Cohen, the payouts were to buy their silence about Trump, who was then in the thick of his first presidential campaign.Cohen and federal prosecutors said Trump's company paid him $420,000 as reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels and to cover bonuses and other supposed expenses. The company classified those payments internally as legal expenses. The $150,000 payment to McDougal was made by the then-publisher of the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which kept her story from coming to light.Federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute the Enquirer’s corporate parent in exchange for its cooperation in a campaign finance investigation that led to charges against Cohen in 2018. Prosecutors said the payments to Daniels and McDougal amounted to impermissible, unrecorded gifts to Trump’s election effort.Cohen pleaded guilty, served prison time and was disbarred. Federal prosecutors never charged Trump with any crime.News that law enforcement agencies were preparing for a possible indictment was first reported by NBC News.___Tucker reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839845,"Haley, Ramaswamy among those taking on 'woke ideology' in SC","NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Republicans who are seeking to lead their party in the 2024 presidential race gathered in South Carolina this weekend with a goal at the forefront of their agenda: taking on “woke ideology.”On Saturday in North Charleston, the group Palmetto Family, which lobbies for what it considers to be “biblical values,"" hosted Vision ’24, described by organizers as “casting the conservative vision"" for the next White House race. Several hundred attendees heard from presidential hopefuls, including Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who was Donald Trump's U.N. ambassador, and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.As organizers expected, issues such as gas prices and national security got plenty of attention, with former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson saying that, to fight inflation, “we've got to bring the federal government under control.”But, as anticipated, much of the focus was on the pushback by some across the U.S. against what they perceive as affronts to conservative ways of life by efforts characterized as “woke."" It's playing out in state-level debates over classroom instruction, gender-affirming care for minors and collegiate diversity programs.The catch-all label of “woke” is taking on a leading a role within the burgeoning GOP presidential contest, with candidate-in-waiting Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, emerging as a fierce opponent of policies designed to ensure equity when it comes to race, gender and public health.Ramaswamy, who entered the race this month, wrote a book on the topic, particularly as it pertains to business: “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”The debate has spilled over into the finance space, too.On Thursday, 19 Republican governors, including DeSantis and South Dakota's Kristi Noem, another possible 2024 contender, signed a letter opposing the Biden administration's support of a federal labor rule allowing retirement plans to consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when making investment decisions. Critics say the efforts are the latest example of the world trying to get “woke,” allocating money based on political agendas, like a drive against climate change, rather than on earning the best returns for savers.DeSantis wasn't on stage in South Carolina, but Ramaswamy and Haley were. Haley has adopted “strong and proud, not weak and woke” on yard signs, shirts and campaign stickers. At the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this month, she said that “wokeness is a virus more dangerous than any pandemic, hands down.” On Saturday, Haley called transgender students competing in sports “the women’s issue of our time,"" adding: “If we don’t stop all this woke ideology that’s happening in our schools, we will lose them.”For Ramaswamy, being “anti-woke” is central to his political brand. Leaving his biotech company following pressures for him “make a statement in favor of the Black Lives Matter movement,” Ramaswamy called at CPAC for “an opportunity for the conservative movement to rise to the occasion and fill that void with a vision of American national identity that runs so deep that it dilutes this woke poison to irrelevance."" He later launched his own firm intended to pressure companies to quit ESG initiatives.On Saturday, Ramaswamy called “woke” a “cultural cancer” in America, saying that, as president, he would advocate for starting over with agencies that “have become a cancerous rot.”“We will shut down the FBI and create something new from scratch to take its place,” he said, to big applause.It's a similar vein of messaging that South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, yet to announce his own 2024 bid but in attendance Saturday, has been making for years. In a 2021 op-ed, Scott wrote that, due to his status as the Senate’s sole Black Republican, he had long endured critique from “woke folk” because “my ideology does not match that which they prescribe based on my complexion.”“The radical left is trying to get people hooked on victimhood,” Scott said Saturday in North Charleston, adding that, according to Democrats, “if you’re white you must be an oppressor. If you’re Black or brown, you are the victim.”Others took on the topic, too.“I think we should protect children ... sometimes even from themselves,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told attendees, referencing transgender student athletes.""Woke is their favorite word, woke-ism is their favorite activity & they adhere to DEI and ESG like it’s a religion,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said of Washington Democrats. “I think that’s why 75% of this country think the country is on the wrong track.”“Republicans are not perfect,” said Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. “But the other side is crazy. ... The American people do not deserve to be governed by deeply woke ... people who hate George Washington, hate Thomas Jefferson ... who think our kids should be able to change genders at recess.”Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who told The Associated Press he would determine if he would seek the 2024 GOP presidential nomination by late spring or early summer — said “woke”-minded Washington politicians “are crushing the spirt of American educators and entrepreneurs and the American spirit.""Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party last year, said her former party is being “driven by this motivation of cowardly wokeness"" and has leaders who “advocate for the mutilation of children in the name of so called gender affirming care.”Previewing the event on Friday, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson called the push by the “MAGA agenda” a “dog whistle” to some.“If they’re talking about a culture war and woke, then you’re not paying attention to the fact that your rights and your freedom to make your health care decisions as a woman are being taken away,” Robertson said, referencing pushes for more restrictive abortion laws in a number of states. “They want to talk about woke because they aren't capable of talking about anything of substance.”___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839908,Millions of dead fish wash up amid heat wave in Australia,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Millions of fish have washed up dead in southeastern Australia in a die-off that authorities and scientists say is caused by depleted oxygen levels in the river after recent floods and hot weather.Residents of the Outback town of Menindee in New South Wales state complained of a terrible smell from the dead fish.“The stink was terrible. I nearly had to put a mask on,” said local nature photographer Geoff Looney.“I was worried about my own health. That water right in the top comes down to our pumping station for the town. People north of Menindee say there’s cod and perch floating down the river everywhere,” he said.The Department of Primary Industries said the fish deaths were likely caused by low oxygen levels as floods recede, a situation made worse by fish needing more oxygen because of the warmer weather.Police have established an emergency operations centre in Menindee to coordinate a massive cleanup this week.State Emergency Operations Controller Peter Thurtell said the immediate focus was to provide a clean water supply to residents.“There is no need for community concern as the initial assessment has determined multiple viable solutions to maintain water supply to the Menindee township and surrounds,” he said.State agencies also started to release higher-quality water where possible to boost dissolved oxygen levels in the area.“We’ve just sort of started to clean up, and then this has happened, and that’s sort of you’re walking around in a dried-up mess and then you’re smelling this putrid smell. It’s a terrible smell and horrible to see all those dead fish,” said Jan Dening, a Menindee resident.Mass fish kills have been reported on the Darling-Baaka River in recent weeks. Tens of thousands of fish were found at the same spot in late February, while there have been several reports of dead fish downstream toward Pooncarie, near the borders of South Australia and Victoria states.Enormous fish kills occurred on the river at Menindee during severe drought conditions in late 2018 and early 2019, with locals estimating millions of deaths.",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839943,Vatican closes embassy in Nicaragua after Ortega's crackdown,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican said Saturday it had closed its embassy in Nicaragua after the country's government proposed suspending diplomatic relations, the latest episode in a yearslong crackdown on the Catholic Church by the administration of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.The Vatican's representative to Managua, Monsignor Marcel Diouf, also left the country Friday, bound for Costa Rica, a Vatican official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Vatican action came a week after the Nicaraguan government proposed suspending relations with the Holy See, and a year after Nicaragua forced the papal ambassador at the time to leave. It's not clear what more the proposed suspension would entail in diplomatic terms.Relations between the church and Ortega's government have been deteriorating since 2018, when Nicaraguan authorities violently repressed anti-government protests.Some Catholic leaders gave protesters shelter in their churches, and the church later tried to act as a mediator between the government and the political opposition.Ortega branded Catholic figures he saw as sympathetic to the opposition as “terrorists” who had backed efforts to overthrow him. Dozens of religious figures were arrested or fled the country.Two congregations of nuns, including from the Missionaries of Charity order founded by Mother Teresa, were expelled from Nicaragua last year.Prominent Catholic Bishop Rolando Álvarez was sentenced to 26 years in prison last month after he refused to board an airplane that flew 222 dissidents and priests to exile in the United States. He also was stripped of his Nicaraguan citizenship.Pope Francis had remained largely silent on the issue, apparently not wanting to inflame tensions. But in a March 10 interview with Argentine media outlet Infobae, after Alvarez's sentencing, he called Ortega’s government a “rude dictatorship” comparable to Hitler’s that was led by an “unbalanced” president.According to Vatican News, the care of the Vatican’s embassy, or nunciature, was entrusted to the Italian government, according to diplomatic conventions. The report said diplomats of the European Union, Germany, France and Italy gave Diouf, the chargé d’affaires, a farewell salute before he shuttered the diplomatic post and left.During the farewell ceremony, Germany's ambassador to Nicaragua, Christoph Bundscherer, expressed regret at the embassy's closure and asked Diouf to share a message with Pope Francis, according to a statement on the German Embassy’s Facebook page.“Together with the Catholic Church, the representatives of the European Union in Nicaragua will also always defend the Christian values of freedom, tolerance and human dignity,” Bundscherer said, according to the statement.The Nicaraguan government, which since September 2018 has banned all opposition demonstrations in the country, also restricted Catholic activities inside churches, including banning the traditional street processions that thousands of Nicaraguans used to celebrate in the lead up to Holy Week and Easter.The restrictions forced church authorities to hold the Stations of the Cross procession on the grounds of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Managua, as they did Friday.___Selser reported from Mexico City.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839944,"Russia, Ukraine extend grain deal to aid world's poor","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — An unprecedented wartime deal that allowed grain to flow from Ukraine to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where hunger is a growing threat and high food prices are pushing more people into poverty was extended just before its expiration date, officials said Saturday.The United Nations and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the extension, but neither confirmed how long it would last. The U.N., Turkey and Ukraine had pushed for 120 days, while Russia said it was willing to agree to 60 days.Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov tweeted Saturday that the deal would remain in effect for the longer, four-month period. But Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian news agency Tass that Moscow ""agreed to extend the deal for 60 days.”“Any claim that it’s prolonged for more than 60 days is either wishful thinking or deliberate manipulation,” Russia's deputy ambassador to the U.N., Dmitry Polyansky, said.Ukraine and Russia are both major global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other affordable food products that developing nations depend on. Two ships carrying more than 96,000 metric tons of corn left Ukrainian ports on Saturday bound for China and Tunisia, according to U.N. data.This is the second renewal of the agreement that Ukraine and Russia signed with the United Nations and Turkey last July to allow food shipments from three Black Sea ports following a halt to shipping after Russia invaded its neighbor over a year ago on Feb. 24, 2022.Russia has complained that a separate agreement with the United Nations to overcome obstacles to shipments of its fertilizers that was part of the July package has not produced results.Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that the United Nations has to recognize it has “no leverage to exempt Russian agricultural export operations from Western sanctions,” and therefore Russia would only extend the deal until May 18.“If Brussels, Washington and London are genuinely interested to continue the export of food from Ukraine through the maritime humanitarian corridor, then they have two months to exempt from their sanctions the entire chain of operations which accompany the Russian agricultural sector,” Nebenzia said. “Otherwise, we fail to understand how the package concept of the secretary-general of the United Nations will work through these simple agreements.”The International Rescue Committee expressed disappointment Saturday that the deal is only for 60 days, stressing that countries in East Africa in particular will be entering the lean grain season at the time of its expiration in May, including Somalia which receives over 90% of its grain from Ukraine and is beset by unprecedented drought and on the verge of famine.Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said in a statement that 25 million metric tonnes (about 28 millions tons) of grain and foodstuffs had moved to 45 countries under the initiative, helping to bring down global food prices and stabilizing markets.“We remain strongly committed to both agreements, and we urge all sides to redouble their efforts to implement them fully,” Dujarric said.The war in Ukraine sent food prices surging to record highs last year and helped contribute to a global food crisis also tied to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate factors like drought.The disruption in shipments of grain needed for staples of diets in places like Egypt, Lebanon and Nigeria exacerbated economic challenges and helped push millions more people into poverty or food insecurity. People in developing countries spend more of their money on basics like food.The crisis left an estimated 345 million people facing food insecurity, according to the U.N.’s World Food Program.Food prices have fallen for 11 straight months. But food was already expensive before the war because of droughts from the Americas to the Middle East — most devastating in the Horn of Africa, with thousands dying in Somalia. Poorer nations that depend on imported food priced in dollars are spending more as their currencies weaken.The agreements also faced setbacks since it was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey: Russia pulled out briefly in November before rejoining and extending the deal. In the past few months, inspections meant to ensure ships only carry grain and not weapons have slowed down significantly.That has helped lead to backlogs in vessels waiting in the waters of Turkey and a recent drop in the amount of grain getting out of Ukraine.Ukrainian and some U.S. officials have blamed Russia for the slowdowns, which the country denies.While fertilizers have been stuck, Russia has exported huge amounts of wheat after a record crop. Figures from financial data provider Refinitiv showed that Russian wheat exports more than doubled to 3.8 million tons in January from the same month a year ago, before the invasion.Russian wheat shipments were at or near record highs in November, December and January, increasing 24% over the same three months a year earlier, according to Refinitiv. It estimated Russia would export 44 million tons of wheat in 2022-2023.___Andrew Wilks in Istanbul, Elise Morton in London, Julie Walker in New York and Edith M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839964,Scotland ends Six Nations on high after edging Italy,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Scotland can crank up its Rugby World Cup preparations in good stead after edging Italy 26-14 to complete an uplifting Six Nations campaign on Saturday.The Scots rebounded from consecutive losses to Ireland and France — Nos. 1 and 2 in the world — with a third win to prove they're the best of the rest in the tournament. They placed third for only the second time in a decade.In contrast, there was more heartbreak for winless Italy, which has been a theme of the championship at the end of which it has finished last for an eighth straight year. Undergoing a competitive revival which had even Ireland and France in trouble late in their matches, the Italians had Scotland at their mercy in the dying moments and Murrayfield tensed up.They trailed 19-14 and were hammering the Scottish tryline for the last few minutes until a knock on in front of the posts gave the ball back to Scotland.Relief was palpable, but Scotland piled more misery on Italy by using the scrum ball to break out from behind its posts. Blair Kinghorn released wing Duhan van der Merwe, took the return pass inside Italy's half and zoomed away from three defenders.Upon his hat-trick try, Kinghorn's teammates poured on top of him in delight as Murrayfield released the tension that had been building as Italy came back from 19-6 down.“Bit scary towards the end there,” Scotland No. 8 Jack Dempsey said. “Credit to the front row with a big scrum to get us out of trouble. It was knee-shaking stuff.”Coach Gregor Townsend's contract ends after the World Cup in October. Talks about a new contract will resume shortly, he said.“I love days like today, even in the bad moments when you're under pressure,"" he said. ""To be involved with your national team, there's nothing better.”Scotland was without star backs Finn Russell or Stuart Hogg in a Six Nations match for the first time since 2019, and without its first-choice locks. It waived off penalty goalkicks in search of tries and was helped by Italy's enduringly frustrating ability to waste chances.From turnover ball, Van der Merwe spectacularly planted the ball beside the left corner flag while airborne and pushed over the sideline by Paolo Garbisi.A second Tommaso Allan penalty put Italy back in front, but then Scotland exposed a creaky Italy scrum. Referee Angus Gardner tired of penalizing Italy after the first three scrums and, after the fourth collapsed, sin-binned tighthead prop Marco Riccioni.Scotland immediately pounced when Kinghorn scored off the next scrum and converted the try.Despite a man advantage for 10 more minutes and dominating territory and possession, Scotland couldn't score again before halftime in the face of Italy's gritty defense. In the half, Italy missed 23 tackles but made 117.The massive effort appeared to have drained Italy when, straight after halftime, Scotland built 10 phases and Kinghorn crossed over between two defenders.At 19-6 up, Scotland seemed to be on its way. But Italy finally began sticking passes and catches and managing the game better.An Allan try from a Garbisi grubber and a Garbisi penalty got them to within five and put the result in doubt.Up stepped Kinghorn, who secured the win and tries bonus point with his second test hat trick, the other also against Italy in 2019.“Before the tournament, I said (I wanted) five good performances; we got four and a half,” Scotland captain Jamie Ritchie said. “Today was a tough one, it was a solid performance. We dug it out.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839968,Bill Self to miss Kansas' NCAA game against Arkansas,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bill Self will miss top-seeded Kansas' second-round NCAA Tournament game against Arkansas on Saturday, the school announced.Self, who is recovering from a heart procedure he received earlier this month, has been with his team since it arrived in Des Moines and attended meetings and practices.Self declined to comment Friday when he walked past reporters after practice, but said in a radio interview before the Jayhawks' first-round win over Howard that he is feeling better and getting stronger — just not yet ready to be on the bench for a game.Norm Roberts, Self's longtime assistant, will serve as acting coach for a fifth game.Self went to the emergency room the night of March 8, shortly after watching the Jayhawks hold a final shootaround ahead of their Big 12 Tournament quarterfinal. He was complaining of chest tightness and concerns with his balance, and the 60-year-old had two stents placed to help treat blocked arteries.Kansas is 3-1 in Self’s absence, with the loss coming to Texas in the Big 12 Tournament championship game.The 57-year-old Roberts is Self’s right-hand man, having been on Self’s staff at four coaching stops.“We have been together for almost 25 years, so we probably do finish each other’s sentences in basketball terms,” Roberts said Friday.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839969,Minnesota hires West Virginia's Plitzuweit to replace Whalen,"Minnesota hired West Virginia head coach Dawn Plitzuweit on Saturday to a six-year contract, turning to another leader with strong regional ties to try to lift up the lagging program.Plitzuweit, who replaces Lindsay Whalen, has 16 years of experience as a head coach with a career record of 356-141 at four schools. She spent just one season with the Mountaineers, who as a 10th seed lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to No. 7 seed Arizona on Friday.Prior to that, Plitzuweit took South Dakota to the NCAA Tournament in four of her six seasons there. She was a three-time winner of the Summit League Coach of the Year award with the Coyotes, who reached the Sweet 16 in 2022.Plitzuweit also spent four seasons at Northern Kentucky and five seasons at Grand Valley State, which won the NCAA Division II national championship in 2006. Between those stops, she was an assistant at Michigan.The 50-year-old native of West Bend, Wisconsin, has also worked as an assistant at Michigan Tech, Wisconsin and Green Bay.“This is a homecoming of sorts, and Minnesota is a program that I am very familiar with from my previous time in the surrounding area and in the Big Ten,” Plitzuweit said in a statement. “I am looking forward to getting back to the area and to meet the team, alumni and fans. I am also looking forward to reconnecting with local high school and club coaches. I can’t wait to get to work.”The university scheduled a news conference on Monday afternoon to introduce Plitzuweit. Terms of her contract weren't immediately available. Whalen's base salary this season was $547,000.Whalen's departure was described by Minnesota athletic director Mark Coyle as a mutual decision, but it seemed like she wasn’t ready to leave. She was supposed to appear at a news conference with Coyle on March 2 when the change was announced, but later said she was too emotional to participate.Whalen was hired five years ago with no previous coaching experience. But she is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and led her home-state Gophers to their only Final Four appearance as a player in 2004, going on to star for the Minnesota Lynx in the WNBA and for the U.S. national team in the Olympics.Whalen went 71-76 with Minnesota, including a 32-58 record in Big Ten play and no NCAA Tournament appearances. The Gophers made it to the NCAAs twice in four years under Whalen's predecessor, Marlene Stollings, their only appearances in the last 14 seasons.Whalen brought in a highly regarded freshman class this season, with four in-state players including leading scorer Mara Braun. The Gophers’ 11-19 season ended with a first-round loss to Penn State in the Big Ten Tournament on Wednesday. They tied for 12th in the Big Ten with a 4-12 record, their fewest wins in 12 years.Plitzuweit will be the 13th head coach in Gophers program history. Her teams have been fifth or higher in regular season conference play in all 16 seasons as a coach, including 11 top-three finishes.“We have everything in place,” Coyle said in early March. “There is no reason why it cannot be done here. That’s the question we have to figure out.”As a player, Plitzuweit was a two-time Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Player of the Year at Michigan Tech with four trips to the NCAA Division II Tournament.She and her husband, Jay, have a son, A.J., who plays for South Dakota, and daughter Lexi plays for Grand Valley State.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839980,Van der Poel matches his grandfather with Milan-San Remo win,"SAN REMO, Italy (AP) — Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel matched his grandfather by winning the Milan-San Remo “monument race” Saturday.Van der Poel attacked near the summit of the Poggio, the race’s final climb, extended his advantage on the twisty and technical descent and crossed the line alone with plenty of time to celebrate.Van der Poel, who rides for the Alpecin-Deceuninck team, finished 15 seconds ahead of Filippo Ganna, Wout van Aert and Tadej Pogacar — the two-time Tour de France champion — after nearly 6 ½ hours of racing.French cyclist Raymond Poulidor, Van der Poel’s maternal grandfather, won the Milan-San Remo in 1961. He died in 2019.Van der Poel said the win was special not only because his grandfather won it, ""but also because it's a monument.“It’s one that I think every rider wants to have one day,” he added. “A special win in a special race.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839982,Judge extends agreement date for Oklahoma poultry lawsuit,"A federal judge is giving Oklahoma and nearly a dozen poultry companies, including the world’s largest poultry producer, Tyson Foods, an additional 90 days to reach an agreement on plans to clean a watershed polluted by chicken litter.U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzell on Friday scheduled a June 16 status conference in Tulsa, saying both sides requested the extension. The state and the poultry companies are to submit a joint status report by June 9.Frizzell ruled in January that Arkansas-based Tyson, Minnesota-based Cargill Inc. and other companies polluted the Illinois River, caused a public nuisance and trespassed by spreading the litter, or manure, on land in eastern Oklahoma, and that it then leached into the river’s watershed. The ruling came from a 2005 lawsuit filed by Oklahoma.“We have had lengthy and productive discussions with the poultry companies about a resolution,"" state Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement.“The poultry industry has made significant improvements over the years in its litter abatement process, and I am hopeful we can craft a plan that protects Oklahoma’s natural resources without placing unreasonable burdens on the companies,” Drummond said.Attorneys for the companies did not immediately return phone calls for comment on Saturday.The January ruling had ordered the companies and the state to present an agreement by March 17 on how to remedy the pollution’s effects, which includes low oxygen levels in the river, algae growth and damage to the fish population.The other defendants named in the lawsuit are Cal-Maine Foods Inc., Tyson Poultry Inc., Tyson Chicken Inc., Cobb-Vantress Inc., Cargill Turkey Production L.L.C., George’s Inc., George’s Farms Inc., Peterson Farms Inc. and Simmons Foods Inc.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839983,"Dortmund beats Cologne 6-1, Leipzig loses again","DORTMUND, Germany (AP) — Borussia Dortmund breathed new life into its Bundesliga title challenge with an emphatic 6-1 victory over Cologne on Saturday as Leipzig lost again following its 7-0 defeat to Manchester City in the Champions League.A draw with Schalke last week had left Dortmund two points off Bayern Munich in its bid to end Bayern's decade-long streak of German titles.Dortmund's biggest win of the season was a way to show it is still in the race as it moved top with a one-point lead over Bayern.Usually a left back, Raphael Guerreiro shone in his new central midfield role. He scored the opening goal off a low cross from Donyell Malen in the 15th minute and assisted two more. Dortmund's second goal came almost immediately with a quick team move through the center which ended with Guerreiro playing in Sébastien Haller, who lofted the ball into the top-left corner.Marco Reus made it 3-0 when he was left in space to meet another Guerreiro pass and shoot in the 32nd. Guerreiro's performance could help persuade Dortmund to renew his contract, which expires at the end of the season. Malen scored Dortmund's fourth soon after before Davie Selke responded with Cologne's first league goal for five games.Haller scored his second in the 69th on the rebound when Mahmoud Dahoud's free kick bounced back off the bar. Reus soon added a sixth, his 150th career Bundesliga goal.Bayern can retake top spot with a win or draw at Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday. Cologne is 13th.Dortmund's next game is the “Klassiker” against Bayern on April 1, after the upcoming international break.LEIPZIG LOSESStill reeling from its heavy defeat to City in the Champions League, Leipzig was beaten 1-0 by lowly Bochum.Coach Marco Rose had spoken of a “realigned” Leipzig team which had put the Manchester ordeal behind them, but the loss showed Leipzig still has work to do. Depending on results elsewhere Sunday, the latest loss could leave Leipzig 10 points off the lead and outside the Champions League places after this weekend.Bochum's goal was a world away from Erling Haaland's spellbinding five-goal haul for City, but a reminder to Leipzig of the need to do simple things well, especially defending set pieces. A long throw-in was flicked on and Erhan Mašović eventually headed in a rebound after a save from Leipzig keeper Janis Blaswich. Leipzig hit the post in stoppage time.MATARAZZO'S MUCH-NEEDED WINA 3-1 win over Hertha Berlin relieved some of the pressure on American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo after he started life at Hoffenheim with five losses. Hoffenheim's first two goals came from Andrej Kramarić's penalties, the first awarded for handball and the second for a trip on Ihlas Bebou, who then scored the third after Hertha failed to deal with a long pass.Matarazzo started the season as Stuttgart coach before being fired after a poor run in October. Hoffenheim dropped to the bottom of the Bundesliga table after losing all five previous games under Matarazzo and had scored just twice in his tenure before Saturday, but is now out of the relegation zone in 15th.Relegation-threatened Schalke extended its unbeaten run to eight games in a 1-1 draw with 10-man Augsburg. Wolfsburg beat Stuttgart 1-0 with a goal from Omar Marmoush, who refused to celebrate after spending last season on loan at Stuttgart. Wolfsburg moves up to seventh and Stuttgart drops to last place.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839984,Supervisor in Tyre Nichols' death retired before firing,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The Memphis police supervisor on scene when Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by officers retired with his benefits the day before a hearing to fire him, according to documents filed to revoke his law enforcement certification.Lt. DeWayne Smith was identified Friday in records obtained by media outlets as the officer that officials said earlier this month had retired before his termination hearing.Some Memphis City Council members were upset an officer was allowed to retire before steps could be taken to fire them, including the council's vice-chairman JB Smiley Jr., who said it didn’t seem fair that the then-unidentified officer could keep pension and other benefits.“I just don’t like the fact that his parents are paying this officer to go on and live and that’s troubling,” Smiley said.The attorney for Nichols' family said the department should not have let Smith “cowardly sidestep the consequences of his actions” and retire after 25 years.""We call for Memphis police and officials to do everything in their power to hold Lt. Smith and all of those involved fully accountable,"" attorney Ben Crump said.Seven other Memphis officers were fired after Nichols died following a traffic stop on Jan. 7 and five of them are charged with second-degree murder. Smith is not charged in Nichols' death.Nichols, 29, was pulled roughly from his car as an officer threatened to shock him with a Taser. He ran, but was chased down. Video showed five officers held him down and repeatedly struck him with their fists, boots and batons as he screamed for his mother.The decertification documents against Lt. Smith reveal additional details about his actions that night.Smith heard Nichols say “I can't breathe” as he was propped up against a squad car, but failed to get him medical care or remove his handcuffs, according to the report.Smith also didn't get reports from other officers about using force and told Nichols' family he was driving under the influence even though there was no information to support a charge, the documents said. Investigators said Smith decided without evidence that Nichols was on drugs or drunk and video captured him telling Nichols “you done took something"" when he arrived at the scene.Additionally, Smith did not wear his body camera — violating police department policy. His actions were captured on the body cameras of other officers, documents said.The U.S. Department of Justice is currently reviewing the Memphis Police Department policies on the use of force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units in response to Nichols' death.",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4839991,France: Paris police ban protests near parliament,"Police in France on Saturday banned protests opposite the National Assembly in Paris following a second night of violence over the government's ducking of a parliamentary vote on unpopular pension reforms.President Emmanuel Macron's overhaul will raise the standard retirement age by two years to 64, which the government says is essential to ensure the system does not go bust.After the government approved the plan by decree on Thursday, bypassing the lower house of parliament, rival opposition parties filed two separate no-confidence motions, which are due to be debated on Monday afternoon but which are also expected to fail.Paris police said the ban around Place de la Concorde, opposite the National Assembly building, as well as the city's famous shopping street Champs Elysees, was ordered because of ""serious risks of disturbances to public order.""Spontaneous gatherings near parliament on Thursday and Friday evenings had led to clashes between some protesters and security forces, including hundreds of arrests.Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse demonstrators and at one point on Friday, an angry crowd tossed an effigy of Macron into a bonfire to cheers from others.Paris wasn't the only French city to witness violence in opposition to the pension reform. In the southeastern city of Lyon, demonstrators tried to break into a town hall and set fire to the building. More than 30 people were arrested.The hope for calm in Paris on Saturday was short-lived. Dozens of students and activists marched through the Forum des Halles shopping mall, chanting loudly and letting off red smoke.Unions said they would instead hold the main Paris protest at Place d'Italie from around 6 p.m. local time (1700 GMT).Mostly peaceful marches took place in several other French cities, including Marseille, Montpellier and Nantes — where one placard read ""Death to the king,"" seemingly in reference to Macron.""We're fed up,"" Ariane Laget, who joined a protest in the small southern town of Lodeve, told French news agency AFP. ""We feel like we're being trampled on and no one is listening.""A broad alliance of France's main unions has said it would continue to mobilize members to try to force a U-turn on the changes.Some unions ordered workers to continue their rolling strikes, severely affecting high-speed and regional rail services this weekend, among other services.Paris' municipal rubbish collectors have kept up their action, and by Friday an estimated 10,000 tons of trash were left festering in the streets.Some French airports will see almost a third of flights canceled on Monday as a result of walkouts, union leaders predicted.The CGT union said its members had shut down the TotalEnergies oil refinery in Normandy on Friday evening. A similar blockade of a refinery in southern France began earlier in the day.A day of nationwide industrial action is also scheduled for Thursday — the ninth since mid-January.Opposition to the pension reform was already high, with two-thirds of the French population against the plan, according to polls.But the sudden move to avoid a parliamentary vote, invoking the controversial article 49.3 of the constitution, caused not only public outrage but also criticism among the political class.In parliament next week, opposition lawmakers hope to garner enough support to topple the cabinet in the no-confidence votes and repeal the law.But Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne's cabinet is largely expected to survive.The motion would need backing from around half the group of opposition right-wing Republicans, a scenario seen as highly improbable. They would also need the shared support of the powerful extreme left and extreme right factions in the National Assembly.Macron put the pension reforms at the center of his re-election campaign last year.While his government argued France needed to fall in line with its European neighbors where the retirement age is typically higher, critics say the changes are unfair to people who work from a young age in physically tough jobs and women who interrupt their careers to raise children.The unrest is reminiscent of the Yellow Vest protests which erupted in late 2018 over high fuel prices, which forced Macron into a partial U-turn on a carbon tax.Macron had also planned pension reforms for his first term as president but had to row back on the idea, campaigning last year on a pledge to finish the job.mm/msh (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/3/18,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840005,Conte slams 'selfish' Tottenham after draw with Southampton,"SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) — The chances of Tottenham returning to the Champions League next season are starting to look a bit slimmer after the team threw away a two-goal lead at last-place Southampton on Saturday.The chances of Antonio Conte returning to coach the team next season are looking even slimmer after the Italian tore into his players for being “selfish” and slammed the club for not having a winning mentality.After James Ward Prowse’s injury-time penalty earned Southampton a 3-3 draw in the Premier League, a despondent Conte responded by questioning his players’ attitude and accused them of not playing as a collective.“I’m not used to see this type of situation,” Conte said. “I see a lot of selfish players. And I don’t see a team.”Conte became known as a serial winner after leading both Juventus and Inter Milan to the Serie A title and Chelsea to the Premier League crown. But he is set to finish a second season at Tottenham without a trophy after the team went out of the Champions League and FA Cup recently. And he could even see the team miss out on a Champions League spot as its grip on fourth place is increasingly shaky.Tottenham has not won a trophy in any competition since the 2008 League Cup and Conte — in comments that will only fuel speculation that he wants to leave the club — accused the Tottenham players and hierarchy of being content with that.“I see selfish players, I see players that don’t want to help each other and don’t put their heart (in),” Conte told his post-game news conference. “Why? Because they are used to it here, they are used to it. They don’t play for something important, yeah. They don’t want to play under pressure, they don’t want to play under stress. It is easy in this way. Tottenham’s story is this. Twenty years there is the (same) owner and they never won something.”Tottenham would have provisionally climbed above Manchester United into third with a win, but is now just two points ahead of fifth-place Newcastle, which has played two fewer games.Tottenham had taken a 3-1 lead after Pedro Porro and Ivan Perisic netted their first goals for the club and Harry Kane scored his 23rd of the campaign.Southampton had only scored twice in its previous five league appearances but the hosts showed the same fight that saw them recently take points off Chelsea and Manchester United to come back and boost their survival hopes.Ward-Prowse’s late penalty, after Pape Sarr had fouled Ainsley Maitland-Niles in the area, added to second-half efforts by Che Adams and Theo Walcott to earn Saints a point.For Southampton, the point could prove crucial in an ever-tightening battle to avoid relegation. The club remained bottom of the standings, but only four points separate it from Crystal Palace in 12th place.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840006,Pope promotes 'humanitarian corridors' for asylum-seekers,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis met Saturday with thousands of refugees and charity groups hosting them in Italy as he sought to promote legal migration routes to Europe as an alternative to smuggling operations that he said have turned the Mediterranean Sea into a “cemetery.”Francis said “humanitarian corridors,” which have operated in Italy since 2016, saved lives and helped newly arrived asylum-seekers get acclimated while church groups provided housing, education and work opportunities.“Humanitarian corridors not only aim to bring refugees to Italy and other European countries, rescuing them from situations of uncertainty, danger and endless waiting; they also work toward integration,” he said.The Sant’Egidio Catholic charity, the Federation of Evangelical Churches and the Waldensian Church spearheaded the ecumenical humanitarian transfer initiative in Italy, which has brought more than 6,000 people to Europe, Francis was told.Under the program, aid workers identify asylum candidates in refugee camps and process initial paperwork to bring them into Italy on humanitarian grounds. Once they arrive, they are then provided with assistance to settle and apply for asylum.Families from Syria, Afghanistan, Rwanda and Ukraine were in the Vatican auditorium to meet with the pope.“It was important for me to come here to show the world that humanitarian corridors are one of the most beautiful things this world has to offer for people who deserve” safety and dignity, Oliver Chris I. Kabalisa, a 22-year-old from Rwanda, said. “Because as a refugee, we do not leave our country because we want to, but because we are constrained, we are forced to.”Afghan refugee Nazani Shakvulla said women in her country were suffering, banned from education, work and travel, and need help from the Vatican and charity groups “to support the humanitarian corridors and find a way to evacuate or find a way that girls in Afghanistan get education.”___Follow AP's coverage of global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840007,Perez on pole for Red Bull in Saudi Arabia for 2nd year,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Sergio Perez stepped up for Red Bull to ensure the team started from the pole at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after a mechanical issue sidelined two-time defending world champion Max Verstappen.Verstappen was fastest in all three practice sessions at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit but his qualifying effort was cut short Saturday when he radioed “I have a problem. Engine, engine problem,” during the second session. The Dutchman drove to the pits, where a driveshaft issue was discovered, and Verstappen's qualifying effort was over.It left Perez as the lone Red Bull representative in the final round of qualifying and he went on to win pole for the second consecutive year — the only two poles of his career.“Max has been really strong the whole weekend, so hopefully we can have both cars up there,” Perez said. “You never know with these cars, reliability issues can hit you at any time.”Verstappen will start 15th.“The driveshaft broke ... It was annoying because the car was good up until then, I was comfortable in every session and every time I was on the track, I was quick, so for sure we could have fought for pole,"" Verstappen said. “Instead, we now have a bit more work ahead of us. It is a long championship and we will stay positive. I think a win is tricky from that position, but I will try to score as many points as possible.”Charles Leclerc qualified second for Ferrari but will drop 10 positions at the start of Sunday's race because of a grid penalty for exceeding the allotted electronics control unit on the car’s engine in the season-opening race.Leclerc said even without the penalty he wasn't all that impressed with his qualifying effort because the entire grid is chasing Red Bull. Verstappen last year won a record 15 races, Perez added two victories and Red Bull claimed both the driver and constructors championships.“The lap — I'm really, really happy. It was really on the limit,” Leclerc said. “On the other hand, I feel the Red Bull are quite far ahead and that is our goal, to beat them, so there is still a lot of work to do.”The penalty to Leclerc pushes Fernando Alonso to the front row for the start after the Spaniard qualified third in his new Aston Martin ride. Alonso finished third in his season-opening debut race with Aston in Bahrain.Is he in position to win his first F1 race since 2013?“No, I think we are not in that position yet. I think on pure pace, Red Bull is in another league,” Alonso said. ""I think we need to focus more on the other teams: Ferrari will be very strong, Mercedes they are strong, and also Alpine, they are fast here.“I think our race is behind us. But we saw Max could not complete qualifying with a mechanical issue, so even if we focus on our mirrors and try to keep the people behind us, if anything happened in front, we will try to take the opportunity, for sure.”George Russell qualified fourth for Mercedes — four spots ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton. The seven-time champion qualified eighth.“We just need to keep trying. No matter what changes we’ve been making, we’ve been struggling to extract the speed, and I just don’t feel properly connected to the car at the moment,” Hamilton said. “That is something we will work on to improve the confidence in the next races. George did a great job and he wasn’t that far off some of the cars at the front, so we just need to keep pushing.”Carlos Sainz Jr. was fifth for Ferrari followed by Lance Stroll of Aston Martin. Esteban Ocon was seventh.Oscar Piastri was ninth for McLaren and Pierre Gasly 10th for Alpine.Logan Sargeant, the American rookie driving for Williams, was briefly atop the speed chart in the first qualifying group until his time was deleted for violating track limits. Sargeant's tire had briefly touched an area of track considered off limits and the FIA quickly deleted his lap.Sargeant later spun in the qualifying group in his desperate push to not qualify last. Had his earlier lap not been deleted, Sargeant would have advanced into the second round of qualifying. He'll start 20th.“I put in a very fast lap but it was deleted as I crossed the pitlane entry by a margin. There was no performance gain so it’s frustrating, but I still had two more laps to deliver and I didn’t, so my apologies go to the team,” Sargeant said. “Although I’ve given myself a lot more work than I needed to, I’m quite optimistic about (Sunday) and I’ll make it up to the team.”Nyck de Vries missed Saturday morning practice with an engine problem then spun almost immediately at the start of qualifying, and Lando Norris of McLaren smacked the wall in the first qualifying group and had to go to the pits for repairs. It prevented him from advancing as his rookie teammate Piastri moved on to the third round for the first time in his career.The Jeddah circuit is the second-longest track on the F1 circuit at 6.174 kilometers (3.836 miles) and was built alongside the Red Sea. It debuted as the penultimate race on the 2021 calendar and is considered the “fastest street track” on the schedule with average speeds exceeding 250 kmh (160 mph).___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840008,Byron out to validate Hendrick's strong start despite fines,"HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) —Back-to-back wins haven't stopped William Byron from believing he and his Hendrick Motorsports team have a lot to prove in Sunday's NASCAR stop in Atlanta.In fact, Byron said Saturday, there's even more on the line. Drivers of the Hendrick Chevrolets want to show the strong start to the season is not the result of illegally manipulating NASCAR's rules.NASCAR slammed Hendrick Motorsports on Wednesday with the largest combined fine on one team in series history for allegedly modifying louvers, which direct air through the hoods of cars. The penalty included a combined $400,000 in fines — $100,000 to each of its four crew chiefs — plus four-race suspensions for the crew chiefs — Byron's, Kyle Larson's and Alex Bowman's included.Those suspensions begin with Sunday's race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Hendrick is appealing the penalties, which also affected the drivers by losing 100 regular-season points and 10 playoffs points.Asked if the penalties provide more motivation for the team this week, Byron said: ""Absolutely. I really get excited about coming to the race track right now.“If anything it just shows that we’re not there yet and we have more to prove and we have more to accomplish. That’s a dangerous thing, right?”Byron qualified 11th on Saturday, while Ford drivers, led by Joey Logano, took the top eight spots. Larson qualified ninth and Bowman was 15th.Byron won last year's spring race in Atlanta while Hendrick teammate and home-state favorite Chase Elliott was the winner in July. Josh Berry, 21st in qualifying on Saturday, is the fill-in driver while Elliott recovers from a broken tibia suffered while snowboarding in Colorado last month.Byron took advantage of a restart to beat Larson at Phoenix Raceway last week, following his win one week earlier at Las Vegas.FREE TO BE DENNYNASCAR also penalized Denny Hamlin 25 points and a $50,000 fine for intentionally wrecking Ross Chastain on last week's final lap at Phoenix. Hamlin posted on his Twitter account that he plans to appeal the penalties, which came after he acknowledged on his podcast his intent to wreck Chastain.Hamlin tweeted the contact with Chastain was “common, hard racing.”Hamlin said Saturday he'll continue to tell the truth despite many believing it was his admission, not his action, that brought on the penalties.“I'm always going to continue to be me,” Hamlin said, adding he likes the idea of inviting Chastain to join him on the podcast.“It'd be good to have an open, honest conversation,” he said, adding the two have talked. Hamlin said he believes the dispute with Chastain has been settled and won't continue on the track.When asked why he believes the feud is over, Hamlin said “just taking each other's word.”PENSKE POWERIn an outcome that was similar to Hendrick drivers qualifying in the top three spots to open the season in Daytona, Team Penske had the three fastest qualifiers for Sunday. Logano took the pole with a speed of 177.374 mph, followed by Austin Cindric and Ryan Blaney.“I’m hoping it’s transferrable to the race,” Logano said of Ford's dominance in qualifying. “... This is kind of our wheelhouse when you come to superspeedways.”SECOND HOMELogano is from Middletown, Connecticut, and said he'll always consider the NASCAR track in Loudon, New Hampshire, to be his home track.But Logano's family moved to Georgia when he was a child. So, to him, Atlanta Motor Speedway — where he competed in Legends races while dreaming of driving on the big track — is his second home.“To me it’s always a dream to win on this race track,” he said.CHILLY QUALIFYINGAfter rain Friday wiped out qualifying for Saturday’s NASCAR truck and Xfinity races, temperatures were in the 40s for Cup qualifying. The first driver on the tack, B.J. McLeod, immediately lost control of his Chevrolet, leading to a spin that challenged the theory a cool track would generate more grip for tires.“It probably was a little bit more interesting than a lot of us expected with cars spinning out and hitting the wall,” Logano said. “Nobody really knows what they have for handling yet.”DEFENDING HENDRICKChad Knaus, vice president of competition for Hendrick Motorsports, said Friday that his team was not trying to work outside the rules. Knaus described the louvers as “a component we’ve all come to the conclusion it is not correct and we’ve all tried to work ... to get it fixed because we’ve done that with other parts.”Knaus said all NASCAR teams have worked together on the Next Gen cars, which debuted in the Cup Series in 2022.“That’s the thing I think we’ve all prided ourselves on in the garage is that there’s been a tremendous amount of give and take as we’ve tried to learn how to race this car and work together,” Knaus said.LOGANO FAVOREDLarson is a 19-2 favorite according to FanDuel Sportsbook. Blaney, Byron and Logano are next at 10-1.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

We are very hopeful that the policy preventing Novak Djokovic from entering the United States will be rescinded, or lapse, in the near future,” the USTA's Chris Widmaier wrote to The Associated Press. “No COVID-19 restrictions are in place at the U.S. Open for any player, fan or other attendee. Novak, one of our sport’s great champions, would be welcome to compete at the 2023 U.S. Open.”The two-week U.S. Open starts in Flushing Meadows on Aug. 28.Djokovic, a 35-year-old from Serbia, was unable to get to New York for the season's last Grand Slam tournament in 2022, when he also missed the Miami Open and BNP Paribas Open because he never got the shots for the illness caused by the coronavirus.A six-time Miami Open champion, Djokovic is out of the field for the event that begins next week, a spokesman for the Miami Open said Saturday.Djokovic is No. 1 in the ATP rankings and is tied with Rafael Nadal — who is injured and also won't be in Miami — at 22 Grand Slam titles, the record for most won by a man. In 2023, Djokovic is 15-1 with two titles, including at the Australian Open in January.But he will now have missed the first two Masters 1000 events of the season. He also pulled out of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, which ends this weekend.Back in in April 2020, as the pandemic raged, Djokovic said he was opposed to needing to be vaccinated to travel. He later said he would not get inoculated even if it meant missing tournaments.In January 2022, he tried to get an exemption to compete at the Australian Open and traveled to Melbourne.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840010,Italy's Democratic head blasts limit on LGBTQ parent rights,"ROME (AP) — The head of Italy’s opposition Democratic Party blasted a bureaucratic crackdown on LGBTQ families as ideological, cruel and discriminatory and vowed Saturday to push through legislation to better recognize and protect their rights.Elly Schlein, who in 2020 revealed she was in a relationship with another woman, joined thousands of people at a demonstration in Milan to protest a move by the far-right-led Italian government to restrict the rights of parents in same-sex relationships.The Interior Ministry this week forced Milan to limit parental rights to the biological parent when same-sex couples register their children with the city.Such registrations are required for parents to get their relationship to a child recognized for purposes such as authorizing medical treatment or participation in school outings. The national government’s prefecture for Milan cited a loophole in limiting that authority to a biological parent.LGBTQ rights activists blasted the move as evidence of the government’s discrimination toward families headed by same-sex couples.Party leader Schlein has never made her sexual orientation a prominent part of her politics, and she didn’t address Saturday’s protest from the main stage.Speaking to reporters as the protest wrapped up, she accused the Premier Giorgia Meroni's government of “cruelly lashing out” at the children of gay parents and denying them rights.“We are talking about rights being trampled upon when they are already recognized by our constitution. We are talking about girls and boys already growing up in our communities, going to our schools,"" Schlein said in comments streamed by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. ""This is no longer tolerable. These families are tired of being discriminated against.”The prefecture decree also says parental rights must be limited to the biological parent even for children of same-sex couples who first were registered in other European Union member countries.LGBTQ rights groups say the underlying decision by an Italian Senate commission to block the recognition of EU documents puts Italy in line with countries such as Poland and Hungary, strong allies of the Meloni government.“This retrograde majority has inexplicably lashed out at children ideologically,"" Schlein said. ""This goes against a European regulation that establishes a trivial thing and that is that if you are recognized as a daughter or son in another European country, you must also be recognized in Italy.”The government hasn’t commented on the Milan directive. Meloni, who has a daughter with her partner, has frequently touted her Christian faith and pro-family values.Schlein said she would press to open debate on legislation to close the legal loophole that resulted in the crackdown.Also attending Saturday's protest was Francesca Pascale, the former longtime companion of ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi. Pascale, who now is in a same-sex union with another woman, blasted Berlusconi's governing allies as “homophobic.” s.“The sovereignists of this country treat us worse than criminals,” she said. “Civil rights are rights for everyone.”___Follow AP's coverage of LGBTQ issues at https://apnews.com/hub/lgbtq-people",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840011,San Diego State dominates Furman 75-52 to reach Sweet 16,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — San Diego State had little trouble ending the run of March Madness darling Furman, getting 16 points from Micah Parrish to pace a balanced scoring attack and pulling away for a 75-52 win on Saturday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.Darrion Trammell had 13 points, Lamont Butler added 12 and leading scorer Matt Bradley finished with 10 for San Diego State (29-6), which is heading to its first Sweet 16 since 2004.The fifth-seeded Aztecs have won 11 of their past 13 games and will play top overall seed Alabama next week in the South Region semifinals in Louisville, Kentucky.“You should play your best at the end of the season, and we're playing our best basketball as the end of the season,” coach Brian Dutcher said.“Obviously we hang our hat on defense. That's the one thing that we do every game,” Dutcher added. “Then when we get the opportunity, we start making shots and play good offensively, then we're very good.”San Diego State is the first Mountain West Conference team to reach the Sweet 16 since Nevada in 2018. It'll be the third regional semifinal appearance for the Aztecs and the seventh for the Mountain West overall.Two days after shrugging off cold shooting and overcoming a 12-point, second-half deficit to shock No. 4 seed Virginia 68-67 on JP Pegues' bracket-busting 3-pointer, Furman was outmuscled and gradually worn down by the much more physical Aztecs.The Paladins feel they still showed they belong in March Madness.“We wish we would have played better. Wish we would have shot the ball a little bit better. But some of that you have to give credit to (San Diego State). But there’s nothing that can take away what this group has done,” coach Bob Richey said.“It’s an unbelievable story, and I couldn’t be more proud of our team, at a time where I’m extremely disappointed that we didn’t advance,” Richey added. “But it’s really hard to not pull the lens back a little bit and still see what that group was able to accomplish.”San Diego State led 39-25 at the half, getting 14 points off the bench from Parrish and limiting Furman to one field goal over the final 11 minutes leading into the break.The Aztecs took control during a 15-0 run that turned a two-point deficit into a 30-17 lead. Furman missed seven straight shots and turned the ball over four times during a 9:56 field goal drought that dumped the Paladins into the big halftime hole.Southern Conference player and the year Jalen Slawson picked up his fourth foul with 16:27 remaining and fouled out shortly after returning midway through the second half. The super senior stomped the floor in frustration, drawing a technical foul that gave San Diego State a pair of free throws that put the Aztecs up 60-37.Mike Bothwell led the 13th-seeded Paladins (28-8) with 15 points. Alex Williams had 11 and Pegues finished with 11 as Furman shot 32%, including 6 of 26 from 3-point range.Like Slawson, Bothwell is a super senior who returned to Furman for a fifth season after the Paladins were denied the Southern Conference's automatic NCAA Tournament berth by a buzzer-beater in their league championship game.Making this year's field, then getting Furman's first win in the tournament in 49 years, created memories that'll last a lifetime.“It’s something no one can take away from this team,"" Bothwell said. “Greatest team in the school’s history. No one has won more games than us, and we enjoyed it. That’s the best part about it.”BIG PICTUREFurman: The Paladins lose Slawson and Bothwell, but feel they've set the tone for continued success.“Sometimes what success can do is make you complacent, and I think the challenge going forward for us is to understand this has to make us hungrier,” Richey said. “This has to push us every day to want to get back here and continue to show that we belong in the NCAA Tournament.”San Diego State: The Aztecs are 0-2 in Sweet 16 games. Dutcher feels this team is capable of going further.“Now that we've settled into the rhythm, and we know what this is about, I think we'll play better moving forward,” the coach said. “And that's really encouraging moving into the Sweet 16.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840012,Gary Lineker back on air to lead BBC's FA Cup coverage,"LONDON (AP) — BBC presenter Gary Lineker made a low-key return to live TV on Saturday as he led the broadcaster's coverage of FA Cup soccer but opted not to directly address his recent suspension over a tweet that criticized the U.K. government’s migration policy.Lineker was reinstated by the BBC on Monday after the public broadcaster backed down and reversed its suspension of the former soccer great following a huge backlash and major interruptions to its normal sports coverage last weekend.The 62-year-old Lineker, a former star for the England national team and one of the BBC's best-known hosts, was back in the studio alongside fellow former players Alan Shearer and Micah Richards ahead of Manchester City's FA Cup quarterfinal against Burnley at the Etihad Stadium.“Alan, it's great to be here,” Lineker said, his voice sounding more hoarse than usual, but he made no other reference to the recent turmoil in his opening remarks.Instead, it was Shearer who addressed the situation after he and a host of other soccer experts and commentators refused to work for the BBC last weekend in solidarity with Lineker. As a result, several soccer programs were canceled and the popular “Match of the Day” — featuring Premier League highlights — was reduced from its normal 80 minutes to just 20 minutes of game footage without any commentators or analysis.“I just need to clear up and wanted to say how upset we were (for) all the audiences who missed out on last weekend,” Shearer said. “It was a really difficult situation for everyone concerned. And through no fault of their own, some really great people in TV and in radio were put in an impossible situation. And that wasn't fair. So it's good to get back to some sort of normality and be talking about football again.”Lineker responded: “Absolutely. I echo those sentiments,"" before switching focus to the upcoming game.Lineker, who is known for his wit and frequent puns, had earlier posted a photo on Twitter from the stadium with the comment: “Ah the joys of being allowed to stick to football.”Lineker was suspended after he criticized the government's new migration plan — aimed at stopping people from reaching the country in small boats across the English Channel — describing it on Twitter as “immeasurably cruel” and calling the government’s language “not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s.”The Conservative government called Lineker’s comparison offensive and unacceptable, and some lawmakers said the BBC should fire him. The broadcaster instead said Lineker would be “stepping back” until he agreed to keep his tweets within BBC impartiality rules. But Lineker refused to backtrack on his comments and critics accused the BBC of suppressing free speech.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

She helped Ohio State to a 33-5-2 record and a berth in Sunday’s NCAA national title game against Wisconsin.Jaques led all NCAA defenders in points (48), goals (24), power-play goals (9) and points per game (1.23) through 40 games. On the Buckeyes’ top defensive pairing, Jaques helped Ohio State hold opponents to 1.75 goals per game and blocked 55 shots this season.“Receiving this award is something I never even could have imagined was possible,” Jaques said in a statement, adding later, ""While this is an individual award, I have been supported by a whole team of people throughout this season and my career at Ohio State, and I owe this all to my coaches and teammates over the last five years.”The 22-year-old, who was among the three Kazmaier finalists last year, is pursuing a master’s degree in civil engineering.Danielle Serdachny from Colgate and forward Alina Mueller at Northeastern also were finalists for the award, which was announced during the women’s Frozen Four.The award is named for Patty Kazmaier, who played for Princeton from 1981 to 1986 and died at the age of 28 of a blood disease.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840014,Indiana women open March Madness with rout of Tennessee Tech,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — All-American center Mackenzie Holmes started Indiana's NCAA title quest on the bench.She doesn't intend to stay there long.After watching Sydney Parrish score 19 points and grab eight rebounds and her replacement, Lilly Meister, add seven points and three blocks in the top-seeded Hoosiers' 77-47 rout of 16th-seeded Tennessee Tech, Holmes said she plans to return for Monday night's second-round game.“It's something we had planned for a while. We're trying to be cautious after I got banged up in the Big Ten Tournament,” Holmes said. “I'm being evaluated day by day and so we've got today, tomorrow and then we'll see Monday.”Holmes missed eight games last season with an injured left knee and still wasn't 100% when the Hoosiers' postseason run ended in the Sweet 16. While she acknowledged it was frustrating to watch again Saturday, the Hoosiers really didn't need her to advance through the first round.With Parrish playing her role, Grace Berger adding 17 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three blocks and Meister and Alyssa Geary splitting minutes in place of Holmes, Indiana (28-3) looked the part of a No. 1 seed over the final three quarters.But the Hoosiers may need Holmes against ninth-seeded Miami (20-12), a 62-61 winner over Oklahoma State in Saturday's second game.“ I thought Berger was exceptional. She led in every way,” Tech coach Kim Rosamond said. “She was just tremendous, especially in the first half.”Maaliya Owens had 17 points and nine rebounds to lead the Golden Eagles (23-10), who had won their previous eight. They just couldn't hold up against the bigger, stronger, deeper Hoosiers — especially in front of a boisterous crowd that topped the 14,000 mark.The score was tied at 18 after one quarter and Tennessee Tech took a 22-20 lead on Anna Walker's layup with 6:53 to go.That's when the Hoosiers flipped the game.Meister tied the score with a layup, Lexus Bargesser broke free for back-to-back fast breaks and when Berger made two free throws with 2:55 left in the first half, Indiana led 37-22. The Hoosiers took a 39-27 lead into halftime.Tennessee Tech never got within single digits again.“We've always called it sharing the sugar around here and this is a team that's unselfish, that's balanced,” Hoosiers coach Teri Moren said after picking up her 200th career win. “This is a team that realizes it could be Grace's night, it could be Syd's night, it just doesn't matter as long as we get the win.”BIG PICTURETennessee Tech: Whether it was the fatigue of playing seven games in 23 days, the 36 1/2-hour turnaround from their play-in game win over Monmouth or simply the disparity in talent, the Golden Eagles' remarkable run came to an unceremonious end. But with much of the roster back from a team that made its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 23 years and won its first tournament game in 33 years, coach Kim Rosamond can build off the momentum of this season.Indiana: The Hoosiers showed their expansive depth and just how solid this overall defense can play in Holmes' absence. While the additional rest may keep Holmes healthier over the long haul, Indiana needs its best player scoring points, grabbing rebounds and creating havoc in the post if it hopes to win a national championship.STAT PACKTennessee Tech: Jada Guinn had eight points and four rebounds. ... The Golden Eagles started the game by making four of their first seven 3-pointers before going 4 of 19 over the final three quarters. ... Tennessee Tech has never won two consecutive games in an NCAA Tournament.Indiana: Yarden Garzon added 12 points and made two 3-pointers to give her 67 this season. She tied the school's freshman record and could break it Monday night against her sister, Lior, a guard with Oklahoma State. ... The Hoosiers had 18 assists, 11 blocks and 10 turnovers.UP NEXTThe Hoosiers will be chasing their third-straight Sweet 16 appearance in front of an Assembly Hall crowd that could be even bigger — and louder — than Saturday.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840015,Louisiana works out deal for family to keep pet nutria,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — After much public outcry, state officials now say they will let a Louisiana couple keep a 22-pound nutria -- a beady-eyed, orange-toothed, rat-tailed rodent commonly considered a wetlands-damaging pest -- as a pet that frolics with their dog, snuggles in their arms and swims in the family pool.The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, in a statement Friday, said Myra and Denny Lacoste are being allowed to apply for a permit so they can legally keep Neuty the Nutria in their New Orleans home, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported. Montoucet said details of the permit are being finalized.The announcement came after more than 17,000 people signed an online petition demanding that the state leave Neuty and his family alone.“I think this is a good conclusion for all sides,” Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet said.The rodent has been living with the Lacostes for more than two years. The wildlife department initially said Thursday that it had arranged for the animal to be transported to the Baton Rouge Zoo, citing state law banning the ownership of a nutria, which is considered an invasive species. But after the response, the agency provided special conditions allowing the family to keep the nutria as a pet within the law, according to the newspaper.“We’re beyond ecstatic,” Myra Lacoste said.Denny Lacoste encountered the injured animal in 2020 when its siblings were killed in traffic. He and his wife hand-fed the animal until it was able to eat on its own. Then they reared it as a pet.Now, the animal is a social media star, featured in TikTok videos and seen in a New Orleans Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate video being held lovingly by Denny Lacoste, scampering across a floor with a towel and chomping down on a raw crawfish. Lacoste told the newspaper that Neuty even likes to ride in the car with his head out the window.Myra Lacoste said she and her husband conceded to several stipulations, including regular veterinary checkups and keeping it caged when at the family's seafood business, in order keep their pet.Nutria were introduced into North America more than a century ago, and they are considered a nuisance invasive species in Louisiana. Their appetite for wetlands vegetation and their burrowing into levees hinder flood control, harm agriculture and contribute to coastal wetlands loss. At various times public officials have put bounties on them and encouraged hunting of them for their pelts and even for food.They are sometimes derided as “nutria rats.” Yet they have also become such a familiar part of Louisiana landscape and lore that a New Orleans minor league baseball team once employed actors in costume as larger-than life caricatures of the creatures as mascots — Boudreaux and Clotilde.Now that the ordeal is over, Myra Lacoste said, “We’re anxious to hold him and smooch on him.”",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840016,Tony Blair: Putin can't use Iraq to justify Ukraine invasion,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine cannot be equated with the US-led invasion of Iraq, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday, ahead of the 20th anniversary of the conflict that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.Blair said Moscow's forces had invaded ""a country that has a democratically elected president who, to my knowledge, has never started a regional conflict or committed any aggression against its neighbours.""The former British leader said Saddam Hussein, on the other hand, had brutalized his own people, engaged in two wars in violation of international law and used chemical weapons to kill 12,000 people in a single day.""At least you could say we were removing a despot and trying to introduce democracy,"" Blair told European news agencies AFP, dpa, ANSA and EFE.The 69-year-old British politician conceded that Russian leader Vladimir Putin could try to use the Iraq invasion, which took place without a UN Security Council mandate, to justify his war of aggression.""But, you know, if he didn't use that excuse, he'd use another excuse,"" Blair said.Under Blair, Britain joined a coalition of countries —  led by then-US President George W, Bush — in attacking Iraq on March 20, 2003. They did so without a formal declaration of war or a UN mandate.The invasion took place in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and the US.The goal of removing Saddam Hussein was soon achieved but Iraq quickly sank into a spiral of violence that lasted years and left hundreds of thousands of people dead.The invasion also spurred some of the largest anti-war demonstrations in Britain.Critics say the war was exposed as a reckless misadventure as no weapons of mass destruction, one of the British government's main justifications for the operation, were found in Iraq.The power vacuum ultimately allowed the self-proclaimed ""Islamic State"" to take control of large parts of the country for a few years.Critics also argue that the Iraq war also hampered the West's ability to stand up to Russian and Chinese autocracy credibly.If Iraq marked the low point of his 10-year administration, Blair said he thinks his role in mediating a peace agreement in Northern Ireland was his greatest legacy.The signing of the Good Friday Peace Agreement on April 10, 1998, brought an end to the violence between Catholic nationalists seeking a united Ireland and Protestants loyal to Britain.The preceding three decades of sectarian strife known as The Troubles had left some 3,500 people dead.Blair was able to complete a process started by his Conservative predecessor, John Major, both of whom have been vocal about the risks of Brexit for peace in Northern Ireland.He spent three days and nights negotiating the final stretch, alongside then-Irish premier Bertie Ahern and an envoy of US president Bill Clinton, finalizing a power-sharing arrangement among the communities.Northern Ireland's position as the only part of the UK with a shared border with European Union member, the Republic of Ireland, has at times reignited tensions between the communities following Britain's departure from the EU.But there are hopes a deal sealed last month between London and Brussels to regulate post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland could help sooth tensions.Turning to the wider issue of Brexit, Blair said he was certain that Britain would not rejoin the EU in the coming years.""Whether and how the UK rejoins the EU will be for a future generation. I think that's the reality,"" he told the news agencies.Blair also said he believed a shock win could not be ruled out for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives, despite the party trailing the opposition Labour Party badly in the polls at present.""In politics, you should never talk of certainties, because there aren't any,"" he said.Labour, under leader Sir Keir Starmer, has an average 20-point lead on the center-left government after a series of scandals forced the resignation of Boris Johnson last summer while his successor Liz Truss lasted just 49 days in office.Sunak, whose polished presentational style has been compared to Blair's, was ""repairing the damage that has been done"" to the Conservative brand by his predecessors, Blair said.mm/msh (AFP, dpa)",2023/3/18,158,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840017,Germany and Japan underline mutual interests in Tokyo,"Tokyo Haneda airport, Saturday, early afternoon. It's pouring down with rain. One by one, after a non-stop 12-and-a-half hour flight with Germany's brand-new ""Konrad Adenauer"" government plane, members of the German cabinet descend the stairs, and are welcomed on the red carpet by officials carrying dripping wet umbrellas in the colors of the German flag.The appearance of Robert Habeck, Boris Pistorius, Volker Wissing, Christian Lindner, Nancy Faeser and Annalena Baerbock – the ministers of economy and climate, defense, transport, finance, interior and foreign policy respectively – show that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has brought with him the highest-ranking delegation he could.That's no coincidence. It is a deliberate gesture of respect towards Japan, a country that is becoming increasingly important for the German government. That wasn't always the case. For a long time, when previous German governments spoke about Asia they meant China.That has changed drastically, not least since Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Japan condemned the war very early on, and adopted western sanctions against Russia, a significant signal from a country that acted differently in 2014 after the invasion of Crimea.The ministers are ushered into cars, and the German motorcade rushes through the rain through Tokyo's city center – again, one should say.It's barely 11 months since the chancellor was last here. In April 2022, only a few months after taking office, Scholz embarked on his first trip to Asia – and made a point of visiting Japan rather than China, as his predecessors Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel had done. Russia's war against Ukraine had triggered the start of a major rethink in Germany's foreign and security policy, and highlighted the need to reduce whatever dependencies the country had not just on Russia, but also China.In the Japanese government, Scholz quickly identified partners faced with the same challenge: The need to diversify. Uncoupling from China is not an option for either of the two, both governments have consistently said. But the COVID pandemic, and above all Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have exposed the vulnerabilities that stem from one-sided dependencies. And so, in 2022, Germany and Japan agreed to plan bilateral inter-governmental consultations to deepen their collaboration – with a focus on economic security.Central Tokyo. The German chancellor arrives at Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's residence to be greeted with military honors. While the two men hold talks, the other German members of cabinet discuss the details of planned collaborations with their respective counterparts. Boris Pistorius will later stress that he's the first German defense minister to have come to Japan in 16 years. His job here is to discuss a potential new legal framework of defense cooperation with Minister Yasukazu Hamada.The Indo-Pacific region is Japan's region, but is also important for Germany. German government officials say it was appreciated here when the German frigate ""Bayern"" came to Japan in 2022. The same applied to the decision to have Eurofighters stop over in Japan on their way to Australia at the end of 2022. Both may have been largely symbolic occasions, but demonstrating that you've got strong partners in other parts of the world is becoming increasingly important. And Japan and Germany want to do more of that in future.Then things get hectic as ministers eventually arrive at the prime minister's residence for the so-called family photo. After a 90-minute plenary discussion behind closed doors, Scholz and Kishida address the press, when they underline their partnership and mutual gratitude.And it becomes clear once again that these two countries have recognized that they share not just values, but increasingly also economic and strategic interests. Collaboration is to be intensified in many areas: the fight against the climate crisis, food security, cybersecurity, telecommunications, and others.As for the overarching topic of the consultations, economic security, the Japanese-German communiqué says the two countries will work together to source critical minerals, considered vital to reducing dependency on China.The German government is being accompanied in Tokyo this weekend by a business delegation. Scholz says he hopes the deepened collaboration between relevant agencies – like the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security and the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources – will give businesses a better idea where to invest in projects.And as for geopolitical security, the German chancellor uses the joint stage in Tokyo to thank Japan again for condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine. Japan supports the so-called West's stance towards Russia and Ukraine. If Vladimir Putin gets away with his aggression in Ukraine, Japan fears that East Asia might be the next region that will be destabilized, and that China might, just like Russia did in Ukraine, push through its own interests in the region with military means.Rising tension in the Taiwan Strait and the South China sea – all of that is happening on Japan's doorstep. At the press conference, neither leader finds a need to mention China directly. Both leaders stress again that the geopolitical status quo must not be changed by force. The German chancellor has said repeatedly that Russia's war in Ukraine is not just a European issue. In the Japanese, it seems, he's found partners who truly agree with him.On Sunday morning, the German delegation will leave Japan again. But Olaf Scholz won't be away for long – he's expected back in Japan in May, for the G7 summit in Hiroshima.While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840018,"Easing labor migration rules threatens wages, unions say","Germany is struggling with a chronic labor shortage. According to the Institute for Employment Research, there are currently 1.98 million job vacancies in the country. Now, Berlin plans to fill these gaps by liberalizing labor migration legislation.This will include two changes to a provision called the ""Western Balkans Regulation,"" which will not only be extended indefinitely from the current expiration date at the end of 2023, but the quota will also be doubled to include 50,000 job seekers annually.When around one million refugees — mainly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq — arrived in Germany via the Balkan route in late 2015 at the height of the so-called ""refugee crisis,"" they were also joined by many people from six Western Balkan countries — Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, northern Macedonia and Serbia. They filed about 30% of the asylum applications at the time, though their chances of acceptance were rather low: Only around 5% of them were granted.To avoid costly repatriations, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government made an agreement with countries of origin for them to take on those who were deported and review the situations of those willing to leave in advance.In addition to this, the Western Balkans Regulation was introduced in 2016, providing for a set contingent of job seekers to work in Germany without major bureaucratic hurdles. Unlike skilled workers who look for work under the Blue Card scheme — this group does not need any qualifications.There are two rules for these people: The application for a work permit must be submitted to German state representations in those countries, and the job seeker cannot apply for asylum beforehand.The regulation was intended to satisfy all sides, regulating immigration of unskilled or medium-skilled workers into the German labor market while relieving the labor surplus in the countries of origin. In Kosovo, for example, the unemployment rate is just under 21% overall, but reaches around 55% among young people. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, or in northern Macedonia, the youth unemployment rate is over 35%.With numbers like that, it's no surprise that Germany's Federal Employment Agency had issued around 260,000 basic permits and 98,000 work visas to workers from the Western Balkan countries by the end of 2020.The planned changes are intended to raise these figures further, a move that has been welcomed by employers who have been pressuring Berlin to liberalize immigration conditions to fill jobs.The German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) is more cautious, however. While it welcomes labor migration, says Evelyn Räder, who is responsible for labor market policy on the DGB's executive board, the basic conditions for workers from the Western Balkans require special attention.""The people who come are largely dependent on their employer. They have a residence permit that is linked to their job. That triggers fears that if they don't toe the line, they'll be sent back,"" Räder says.In addition, they often don't speak German and are not informed of their rights. In practice, this leads to workers accepting worse working conditions, which can subsequently lead to ""wage dumping,"" Räder says, referring to a German term for when wages are pushed lower than the market rate by cheap labor.Three-quarters of workers from the Western Balkans find employment in construction, catering and caregiving, including 44% in construction alone. Most of these are part-time jobs with relatively low wages.Although the federal government justifies reforming the labor law for foreign workers by saying that it wants to counteract the shortage of skilled workers, the Western Balkans Regulation deviates from this claim, as no qualifications are required to obtain a work permit.According to the DGB's assessment, the aim is not to recruit skilled workers at all, but to attract laborers. ""It is purely a labor procurement program for the benefit of employers, who gain workers this way, but can quickly get rid of them when needed,"" Räder says.This situation is particularly pronounced in the construction industry. Last year, the main construction industry association terminated the extension of the decades-old collective agreement. Workers can now be paid a legally guaranteed minimum wage of €12 per hour, down from the previous hourly wages that averaged between €13 and just under €16 on construction sites.Now employers pressure anyone demanding a higher wage with the fact that there is always cheaper labor, and without fear of lawsuits. Workers from the Western Balkans are a particularly vulnerable group. They do not know their rights, and for many even these deteriorating conditions are acceptable compared to the situation in their home countries. Moreover, there are practically no effective state controls.""We fear that this will create pressure on the working conditions of all employees in the construction industry. It will become more difficult to reach good collective agreements, and without them, a dumping program to lower wages will simply emerge,"" Räder says.The DGB suggests that the solution is further changes to the Western Balkans Regulation. One of the most important aspects would be the possibility of changing employers without having to reapply for a work permit — as is the case for other foreign workers.Under the current regulation, the application for a work visa must be made in the employee's country of origin, and the visa is ultimately issued for a specific job. Changing jobs is possible, but must be applied for again through the Federal Employment Agency. It's a complicated process that many workers aren't even aware is an option.Unions are demanding that employment on the basis of the Western Balkans Regulation should only be possible where collective agreements exist. This would protect both the employees and the unions' collective bargaining autonomy.The DGB has a clear message for people in the Western Balkan countries looking for work in Germany: ""Inform yourself about your rights and ask for help if necessary,"" Räder said. ""You don't have to accept everything that is offered to you. Here, workers really do have rights, too.""This article was originally written in German.While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840020,Lady Vols rout March Madness newcomer Saint Louis 95-50,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Jordan Horston spent much of the final quarter cheering from the bench, at one point even waving a towel cheering on her teammates.Coach Kellie Harper has a very deep roster, and the Tennessee Lady Vols started their latest NCAA Tournament in dominating fashion.Horston scored 21 points and Rickea Jackson added 18 as the fourth-seeded Lady Vols remained perfect when opening the NCAA Tournament on their home court, routing No. 13 seed Saint Louis 95-50 on Saturday.“We did what we were supposed to do, and I think the score's a result of that,” Harper said.The Lady Vols (24-11) improved to 25-0 in first-round games on their home court to reach Monday night's second-round where they will play 12th-seeded Toledo, an 80-73 upset winner over No. 5 seed Iowa State. Tennessee improved to 6-2 all-time as a No. 4 seed.Jordan Walker added 11 points and Tess Darby had 10 as 13 Lady Vols scored. They will try to advance to a second straight Sweet 16 in the Seattle 3 region.“It's very important to get a win now because if you don't, you're done,” said Horston, who also had eight rebounds and two steals after missing the tournament a year ago with an injury.The first NCAA Tournament appearance ended quickly for Saint Louis (17-18). The Billikens snapped the six-game winning streak that helped them win the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament after starting the season 6-16.First-year coach Rebecca Tillett said even in the loss she saw her Billikens executing things they had no chance of even 20 games ago because they hadn't been together long enough.“So just to continue to build on that foundation over and over again is why this team will go down in history,” Tillett said.Brooke Flowers led Saint Louis with 17 points. The fifth-year senior also had five blocks, giving her 398 for her career and passing Rebecca Lobo for 18th all-time.  Kyla McMakin, who followed Tillett from Longwood as a transfer, added 11. Camree Clegg added 12 off the bench.“We'll forever be the first champions so a wonderful experience,” Flowers said.The Billikens led twice in the first couple minutes, the last on a McMakin jumper at 4-3. Walker tied it at 4 with a free throw, then finished a fast break with a layup putting the Lady Vols ahead to stay with 6:51 left. Darby added a 3, and Horston's jumper capped an eight-point spurt for Tennessee.The Lady Vols led by as much as 10 before McMakin banked in a buzzer-beating 3 that pulled Saint Louis within 20-15 at end of the first quarter. Flowers hit two free throws to pull Saint Louis within 20-17 to start the second quarter.SCOREGAMITennessee seized control in the second outscoring Saint Louis 28-9 for a 48-24 lead at halftime. The Lady Vols, who led 67-41 at the end of the third, polished off the win exactly matching the second quarter outscoring the Billikens 28-9.That allowed Harper to pull her starters with 6:24 left. Freshman Edie Darby even had four points in less than 3 minutes, and Horston was not surprised when Darby knocked down a jumper, calling her a “baller.”“I knew that shot was going in when it left her hand,” Horston said.BIG PICTURESaint Louis: The Billikens' future seems bright with Tillett picking up where she left off after leading Longwood to the NCAA Tournament a year ago from the Big South. She joined Lisa Bluder (Drake and Iowa) as the only Division I coaches to lead teams in different conferences to tournament titles in consecutive years. This loss was just their second in the final 13 games for a program that last won 11 of 12 in the 1978-79 season. Not bad for a program picked to finish 12th in the A-10.Tennessee: The program that has appeared in every NCAA Tournament improved to 32-2 in the first round. The Lady Vols used their height advantage for a 54-22 scoring edge in the paint. They also took care of the ball with only 10 turnovers and turned the Billikens' 20 turnovers — 13 off steals — into 30 points.UP NEXTTennessee played 15 teams in this NCAA Tournament field, but they will be playing Toledo for only the second time in program history.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840021,"Strong earthquake kills at least 14 in Ecuador, 1 in Peru","QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — A strong earthquake shook southern Ecuador and northern Peru on Saturday, killing at least 15 people, trapping others under rubble, and sending rescue teams out into streets littered with debris and fallen power lines.The U.S. Geological Survey reported an earthquake with a magnitude of about 6.8 that was centered just off the Pacific Coast, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Guayaquil, Ecuador's second-largest city. One of the victims died in Peru, while 14 others died in Ecuador, where authorities also reported that at least 126 people were injured.Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso told reporters the earthquake had “without a doubt ... generated alarm in the population."" Lasso's office in a statement said 12 of the victims died in the coastal state of El Oro and two in the highlands state of Azuay.In Peru, the earthquake was felt from its northern border with Ecuador to the central Pacific coast. Peruvian Prime Minister Alberto Otárola said a 4-year-old girl died from head trauma she suffered in the collapse of her home in the Tumbes region, on the border with Ecuador.One of the victims in Azuay was a passenger in a vehicle crushed by rubble from a house in the Andean community of Cuenca, according to the Risk Management Secretariat, Ecuador's emergency response agency.In El Oro, the agency also reported that several people were trapped under rubble. In the community of Machala, a two-story home collapsed before people could evacuate, a pier gave way and a building's walls cracked, trapping an unknown number of people.The agency said firefighters worked to rescue people while the National Police assessed damage, their work made more difficult by downed lines that interrupted telephone and electricity service.Machala resident Fabricio Cruz said he was in his third-floor apartment when he felt a strong tremor and saw his television hit the ground. He immediately headed out.“I heard how my neighbors were shouting and there was a lot of noise,” said Cruz, a 34-year-old photographer. He added that when he looked around, he noticed the collapsed roofs of nearby houses.Ecuador's government also reported damages to health care centers and schools. Lasso said he would travel on Saturday to El Oro.In Guayaquil, about 170 miles (270 kilometers) southwest of the capital, Quito, authorities reported cracks in buildings and homes, as well as some collapsed walls. Authorities ordered the closure of three vehicular tunnels in Guayaquil, which anchors a metro area of over 3 million people.Videos shared on social media show people gathered on the streets of Guayaquil and nearby communities. People reported objects falling inside their homes.One video posted online showed three anchors of a show dart from their studio desk as the set shook. They initially tried to shake it off as a minor quake but soon fled off camera. One anchor indicated the show would go on a commercial break, while another repeated, “My God, my God.”Luis Tomalá was fishing with others when the earthquake struck. He said their boat began moving “like a racehorse, we got scared, and when we turned on the radio, we heard about the earthquake.” That’s when his group, Tomalá said, decided to stay at sea fearing a tsunami could develop.A report from Ecuador's Adverse Events Monitoring Directorate ruled out a tsunami threat.Peruvian authorities said the old walls of an Army barracks collapsed in Tumbes.Ecuador is particularly prone to earthquakes. In 2016, a quake centered farther north on the Pacific Coast in a more sparsely populated area of the country killed more than 600 people.Machala student Katherine Cruz said her home shook so badly that she could not even get up to leave her room and flee to the street.“It was horrible. I had never felt anything like this in my life,” she said. ___Associated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, and Franklin Briceño in Lima, Peru, contributed to this report.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840022,"6N: France beats Wales 41-28, but loses the title to Ireland","PARIS (AP) — Defending champion France completed its Six Nations campaign by scoring five tries in an entertaining 41-28 win against Wales, but it wasn't enough to retain the title as Ireland beat England 29-16 later Saturday to clinch a Grand Slam.France got the attacking bonus point it needed to move one point ahead of Ireland before its game against England in Dublin. But Fabien Galthié's side needed No. 1-ranked Ireland to lose without collecting a defensive bonus point.Ireland beat France 32-19 last month — a result that ended France's 14-game winning streak and also shifted the momentum Ireland's way.So there was no Grand Slam repeat for France, but a party atmosphere still prevailed on Saturday afternoon at Stade de France.Fireworks went off after the game to celebrate another Six Nations where Galthié's side showed an abundance of attacking flair and thrilled rugby fans with some spectacular tries.“We've won 80% of our matches in the tournament over the past four years, I don't think that's ever happened in the history of French rugby,” said Galthié, ever the perfectionist. “But we must still improve our defending.""Prolific right winger Damian Penaud grabbed two against the Welsh and fullback Tomas Ramos was perfect with his kicking as Les Tricolores took their tournament try tally to an eye-watering 21 — compared to 20 for Ireland.“We can be proud of ourselves after this tournament, although we can have a lot of regrets about the match in Ireland,” star scrumhalf Antoine Dupont said. “We feel that our attacking potential is still growing.”England was reeling from last weekend’s 53-10 win loss to No. 2-ranked France for its third heaviest defeat ever, but clearly wounded from that humiliation it played with great determination even with a player sent off late in the first half.Wales started strongly and took three attacking lineouts over penalties, scoring off the third when scrumhalf Rhys Webb pinged a quick pass to center George North, who went over for a converted try.It was North's 23rd in the tournament's history, taking him one ahead of former Wales winger Shane Williams and three behind all-time record holder Brian O’Driscoll of Ireland.France's response took just two minutes.Flyhalf Romain Ntamack carved a hole in midfield with elusive running and offloaded to halves partner Dupont, who looped a clinical pass to Penaud on the right wing.The Welsh came to play and it took France until the 26th minute to lead through Ramos' penalty.But with the recalled Uini Atonio dominant in the scrum, another penalty soon followed before France stretched the Welsh line with quick passes to allow Penaud to send center Jonathan Danty over on the right wing for a converted try and a 20-7 interval lead.Atonio's first try on his 50th test came four minutes after the restart, when he barged over the line after being set up by the quick-thinking Dupont and Ramos. Just five minutes later, France opened up Wales again and Danty freed Ntamack to feed center Gaël Fickou for France's fourth try.Wales' bench finally ended France's 34-point run when replacement hooker Bradley Roberts burrowed over from close range after flanker Justin Tipuric stole possession, and replacement scrumhalf Tomos Williams got Wales's third try with Tipuric involved again.Ramos set up Penaud's second try in the right corner late on but both players went missing when Wales got a bonus point with a last-gasp fourth try from replacement winger Rio Dyer, converted by veteran Leigh Halfpenny.“We knew Wales would be strong, people had a tendency to write them off a bit in this tournament,” Ntamack said. “But with the players they have and their experience we knew it wouldn’t be easy, and you saw that in the first few minutes.”No. 8 Taulupe Faletau played his 100th Welsh test.Wales won the tournament two years ago, but won only once this year — 29-17 in Rome last weekend. The Italians finished 0-5 for the wooden spoon after losing 26-14 in Scotland earlier Saturday.France’s next objective is to win the World Cup for the first time. The three-time runner-up has a mouth-watering opener against three-time champion New Zealand at Stade de France on Sept. 8 — and the host could meet Ireland in a mouth-watering quarterfinal.“Give us some time,” Galthié joked, not wanting to look too far ahead. “We have a night to finish, a morning to spend together, and then it will be time to say goodbye. Afterward, the next time we meet up will be to prepare for the World Cup.”He parted with a warning shot.“I hope teams fear us,” he said. ""We’ve got an impressive ratio. We’ve lost once at Stade de France in four years.”France is gaining confidence, but Wales is turning a page.Wales coach Warren Gatland said before the game that up to eight of his players — including Faletau and lock Alun Wyn Jones — may have made their last Six Nations appearances as he builds for this World Cup and the next.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840023,Israelis protest legal overhaul plans for 11th week,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israelis on Saturday took to the streets in protests, now in their 11th week, against plans by Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line government to overhaul the country’s legal system.The protesters say the proposed changes undermine the country's democracy by restricting the power of the Supreme Court. Netanyahu and his allies say the plan is needed to curb what they claim are excessive powers of unelected judges.The main protest in the central city of Tel Aviv drew tens of thousands of people who waved Israeli flags and traffic sign banners that read “Dead End!” and “Risk Ahead!” Smaller protests were reported in other parts of the country.On Wednesday, Netanyahu swiftly rejected a compromise proposal by Israeli President Isaac Herzog to resolve the standoff, deepening the crisis over a program that has roiled the country and drawn international criticism.Israeli police deployed a water cannon to disperse protesters gathered at a main junction in Karkur, a town in northern Israel.A video obtained by The Associated Press showed the water canon spraying at protesters as they chanted “Democracy,” in Hebrew. It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured.Netanyahu and his ultranationalist and religious coalition allies have pledged to plow ahead with the legal changes despite the demonstrations. Business leaders, legal experts and retired military leaders have joined the protests, and Israeli reservists have threatened to stop reporting for duty if the overhaul passes.In the latest step of the overhaul plans, the Israeli parliament on Monday advanced a bill that would make it harder to oust Netanyahu over the corruption charges against him, as it plowed ahead with the broader plan to overhaul the judiciary.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840024,Ireland fulfills hype with Six Nations Grand Slam,"DUBLIN (AP) — Jonathan Sexton is all about team. So when it was time to lift the Six Nations trophy as Ireland captain, he wanted to share the moment.Coach Andy Farrell rejected the idea.“I said he mustn't. He deserves it,” Farrell told the BBC. “What a way for him to go out of the Six Nations.”Sexton opened his Six Nations career with a win over England in 2010 and closed it the same way on Saturday. The English were put away 29-16 as Ireland mastered the hype and expectations to win the championship and a historic first Grand Slam in Dublin.The Irish came into the championship as the favorite and swept through it to underline its world No. 1 status and make a huge statement six months out from the Rugby World Cup, where they have never won a knockout match.A month after beating No. 2 and defending champion France at home, Ireland handled a game-but-inadequate England with a bonus-point win at a packed-out Lansdowne Road.Ireland's Dublin home had never witnessed an Irish Grand Slam, nor a title in the Six Nations era, and hundreds of fans remained long after the final whistle to salute their heroes and drink in the history.Stifled by the English from putting on a show, Ireland resorted to wearing down the visitors. From 10-6 ahead at halftime, Ireland punched in three tries in the last quarter; to Robbie Henshaw, a second for hooker Dan Sheehan, and the last for his replacement Rob Herring.Sexton, who is retiring after the World Cup in October, was given the perfect send-off in his last Six Nations match with a second Grand Slam and the championship's all-time point-scoring record. He limped off with six minutes to go to a standing ovation.“We did not quite nail it, but we did enough,” Sexton said. “It does not feel like the end, there is plenty left in this team.”Farrell agrees.“Hopefully, there's bigger fish to fry for Johnny with the World Cup,” he said. “It's unbelievable for him to have this moment and lift the trophy.”England redeemed itself after the hiding at home from France last weekend by fighting hard, but the effort was undermined when fullback Freddie Steward was sent off just before halftime. Steward took some tension with him and the result had an air of inevitability about it.But Ireland couldn't ignite the St. Patrick's weekend celebrations until the late burst of tries capped Ireland's first Six Nations title since 2018 and its fifth in this century. The previous Grand Slams were in 1948, 2009 and 2018.“Today was all about delivering, attacking the game and not the occasion,” lock James Ryan said. ""There was a bit of pressure but every game you play for Ireland is pressure.“We were a little off kilter in the first half but that's good for us. We want to test ourselves and be able to find a way.”Owen Farrell kicked England to an early 6-0 lead while Ireland was adapting to the pressure from the visitors' excellent rush defense and breakdown work. Ireland was pushing too many passes and getting slowed in the rucks.Sexton's first goal kick earned him his first standing ovation. He left behind a tie with Irish predecessor Ronan O'Gara as the championship's highest point-scorer. He improved it to 566 points. Farrell was fourth on the list behind Jonny Wilkinson, who helped Farrell recently repair his 47% goalkicking success. Sexton and Farrell both landed four out of four.Ireland finally converted a try chance in the 33rd from a short lineout. England committed to a rolling maul but, instead, Josh van der Flier snuck in behind and fed inside him Sheehan on a charge to the line.Seconds before halftime, Ireland fullback Hugo Keenan ran head on into Steward, who turned shoulder first to brace for the collision. That failure to show duty of care for Keenan caused Steward to be sent off by referee Jaco Peyper.Keenan didn't return either, failing a head injury assessment during the interval.Ireland was laboring in the new half to expose the man advantage, and Farrell's third penalty closed the gap to one point.Ireland eventually set up an attacking scrum and Henshaw, only recently fit after wrist and hamstring injuries, met a pass from midfield partner Bundee Aki in a gap to score.Minutes later, back-rower Jack Conan drew two defenders to put Sheehan over for his second try of the match. With Sexton's extras, the result was safe and Lansdowne Road broke into song.On a day for hookers, England's Jamie George scored from their only try chance in a rolling maul, but Ireland had the last say when Sheehan's replacement Herring burst off a maul and scored.While the party was underway, Andy Farrell already had an eye on the World Cup in France.“We're a good side that has nowhere near reached its potential,” he warned. “We expect our side when we get to the first game in the World Cup to be a lot better than what we are now.” ___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840025,Some Trump rivals rally to his side as possible charges loom,"NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Top Republicans, including some of Donald Trump's potential rivals for the GOP's 2024 presidential nomination, rushed to his defense Saturday after Trump said he is bracing for possible arrest.“The idea of indicting a former president of the United States is deeply troubling to me as it is to tens of millions of Americans,"" said former Vice President Mike Pence, a likely Trump rival, during a visit to Iowa, an early-voting state. Tech investor Vivek Ramaswamy, campaigning in South Carolina, said he didn't want to live in a country where “the party in power is able to use police force to arrest its political opposition.""The reaction underscores the political risks faced by would-be opponents who are eager to convince voters that it is time to move on from the former president, but who must contend with the fact that he remains the most popular figure in the party. The multiple investigations Trump is facing — his post on social media about the Manhattan district attorney's probe led to the public declarations of support — remain deeply unpopular with his supporters and criticizing Trump too harshly risks alienating his loyal base.Trump garnered similar support last summer after the FBI searched his Mar-a-Lago club as part of an investigation into his handling of classified documents. The search also proved a fundraising boon.Among those coming to Trump's defense were House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who said a possible indictment would be “an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA who lets violent criminals walk as he pursues political vengeance"" against Trump.McCarthy, R-Calif., said he would direct relevant GOP-led House committees “to immediately investigate if federal funds are being used to subvert our democracy by interfering in elections with politically motivated prosecutions.” McCarthy has not endorsed Trump’s White House campaign, but Trump helped McCarthy secure the speakership after a contentious campaign that required multiple rounds of voting.New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican and an early Trump endorser, said action by the district attorney would be “unAmerican.”The comments came hours after Trump claimed in a social media post that he expects to be arrested this coming week as New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg mulls charges in an investigation into hush money payments to women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump. A Trump lawyer and spokesman said Saturday that Trump, who has long denied the charges, had been responding in that post to media reports and had no independent knowledge of any pending legal action.Trump, in a message on his Truth Social network, nonetheless declared that, “THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE & FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.” He then called on his supporters to ""PROTEST, PROTEST, PROTEST!!!” recalling the pleas he made before the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Any potential violence spurred by Trump's comments could change the tenor of reaction. But on Saturday, several of Trump's declared and potential rivals were quick to blast the district attorney's investigation.Pence, who has been escalating his criticism of the former president in recent weeks, said the news was particularly troubling, ""happening in what appears to be a politically-charged environment in New York where the attorney general and other elected officials literally campaigned on a pledge to prosecutor the former president.""“No one is above the law,"" he added. “I’m confident President Trump can take care of himself. My focus is going to continue to be on the issues that are affecting the American people.”Pence had been noncommittal when asked Thursday if Trump should drop out if he is indicted. “I think it’s a free country. Everybody can make their own decisions,” he said.Trump has said he would continue his presidential campaign even if indicted.Ramaswamy, who is already a declared candidate, earlier called on Bragg to “reconsider.""“A Trump indictment would be a national disaster,” Ramaswamy tweeted. “It is un-American for the ruling party to use police power to arrest its political rivals.”Representatives for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another potential candidate who is seen as Trump's most serious rival, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday — a decision publicized by a super PAC supporting Trump's candidacy. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, another declared candidate, did not address the investigation while campaigning in South Carolina.Ramaswamy called on Haley and DeSantis to join him in condemning the possible indictment.Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who won his race in 2022 with Trump’s endorsement, said he had been asked by multiple reporters if an indictment would lead him to rescind support for Trump's campaign.""The answer is: hell no. A politically motivated prosecution makes the argument for Trump stronger,” he tweeted. “We simply don’t have a real country if justice depends on politics.”Prosecutors have been investigating hush money payments made to two women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump decades ago. A grand jury has been hearing from witnesses including former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who says he orchestrated payments in 2016 to the women in exchange for their silence.Trump denies the encounters and has cast the investigation as a “witch hunt” by a Democratic prosecutor bent on sabotaging Trump's latest presidential campaign. Trump has said he believes an indictment would help him in the 2024 race.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a longtime ally, said he agreed.“The prosecutor in New York has done more to help Donald Trump get elected,” Graham said Saturday at the Vision ’24 conference in North Charleston, South Carolina. “They’re doing this because they’re afraid of Donald Trump.""___Colvin reported from New York.

New York was protecting a two-point lead when he made two free throws with 43 seconds remaining, then pushed the ball up the court and threw a lob that Mitchell Robinson slammed down to make it 116-110 with 24 seconds to go.“He started the game, that was probably more adrenaline than anything else,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “But a little rust, but then he got a good rhythm late so it was good.”Brunson had missed five of the last six games and made it through only half the one game he did play when he thought he was ready. With their point guard back, the Knicks won their third straight and improved to 42-30, guaranteeing just their second winning record in the last 10 seasons.RJ Barrett added 21 points and Julius Randle had 20 for the Knicks, including the tiebreaking basket with 2:21 left. Robinson grabbed nine rebounds.Nikola Jokic had 24 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for the Nuggets, who lost for the fifth time in six games. Jamal Murray scored 25 points.The Western Conference leaders had snapped their longest losing streak of the season at four games on Thursday at Detroit, but fell into a quick hole in this one, with Brunson's early burst providing the Knicks and a sold-out crowd of 19,812 more energy than usual for a day game. Fans in it chanted “MVP! MVP!” when Brunson went to the line for his two final free throws.“It’s a great fan base to play in front of and I really appreciate it, but we’ve got a long way to go before that,” Brunson said. “So I’ve just got to continue to help my team win and then move on from there.”Brunson scored the first five points and later in the first quarter had a pair of three-point plays, the latter with 3:55 left giving him 16 points to match Denver's total for the game at that point.New York led 36-28 after one and extended it to 45-32. But the Nuggets began to get comfortable midway through the second, when Jokic's three-point play triggered a 7-0 burst, and they sped by the Knicks just before halftime.Murray hit consecutive 3-pointers to end a 13-2 surge that gave Denver a 67-59 lead before Randle made a three-point play to cut it to five at the break.The Nuggets ran off 10 straight points early in the third to make it 79-67, but the Knicks outscored them 16-5 to end the period and tie it at 91.“Big stretch was that end of the third quarter,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “They close on a 20-7 run, took all the momentum going into the fourth quarter, and then they close the game on a 10-2 run and we just can’t turn the ball over that many times, especially second half, fourth quarter.”TIP-INSNuggets: It was the Nuggets' first loss at Madison Square Garden since Oct. 30, 2017. ...

He also pitched for the Twins, Athletics, Rays, Dodgers, Mariners, Marlins and Blue Jays.Romo signed a minor league deal with an invite to big-league spring training. He'll officially retire during San Francisco's final exhibition game on March 27 when the Giants host the A's at Oracle Park.“The relationship that Giants fans have with their players is unique – few exemplify that bond more than Sergio,” Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi said in a statement Saturday. “After all that he accomplished as a Giant from 2008 to 2016, including his huge contributions to the championship teams, it’s a thrill to have him back in a San Francisco uniform.”Romo is one of the most accomplished relievers in franchise history.

Lars Eller had a short-handed goal and Mikko Rantanen scored his 46th less than a minute later in the third, ending Ville Husso's day after he gave up five goals on just 21 shots.“We stay on the gas the whole game,” Rantanen said. “We don't want to sit back at all.”MacKinnon also had an assist and Alexandar Georgiev made 33 saves for the defending Stanley Cup champions, who won five straight games for the third time this season.“Our goalie probably outplayed their goalie,” Bednar said.Pius Suter pulled Detroit into a 1-all tie in the first period and Magnus Hellberg finished with two saves, filling in for Husso for the last 14-plus minutes.The Red Wings went 0 for 2 with an extra skater in the first period and had a short-handed chance to score late in the second, but Georgiev stopped Adam Erne’s shot.“We didn’t capitalize on our power-play chances,” Detroit captain Dylan Larkin said. “When we had a power play with it 3-1, we give up a shorty and another goal right after that.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840041,Ohio St beats James Madison 80-66 in March Madness 1st round,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Cotie McMahon scored 18 points to help No. 3 seed Ohio State pull away for an 80-66 win over No. 14 seed James Madison in the first round of the women’s NCAA Tournament on Saturday.McMahon made her team’s first 3-pointer with 5:18 left in the third quarter to give Ohio State (26-7) a 44-43 lead, and the Buckeyes didn’t give up the advantage from there on out. They trailed by as many as 16 in the first half before going on a 12-0 run.Jacy Sheldon scored three of her 17 points during an 8-0 run at the start of the fourth quarter. Taylor Thierry shot 7 of 8 and fouled out with 15 points. Taylor Mikesell added 14 points.“We had several open shots in the perimeter and then shots around the basket. We just weren’t finishing it,” Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said. “We looked a little rusty from being off for a couple of weeks and so hopefully this allows us to settle in and we’ll get off to a better start on Monday.”James Madison (26-8) led 26-14 and was making 50% of its shots at the end of the first quarter. The Dukes shot 37.9% in the second half and turned it over 21 times, their most in 10 games.Kiki Jefferson led the Dukes with 17 points and Jamia Hazell added 10.“I thought we put it on them pretty good to start,” James Madison coach Sean O’Reagan said. “Eventually I just thought we ran out of gas a little bit and when you run out of gas against that press it doesn’t bode well for you.”The Buckeyes trailed 37-34 and were shooting 31.3% at the half.MCMAHON GETS IT GOINGMidway through the third quarter, Ohio State didn’t have the lead or a 3-point basket.McMahon changed both of those on one shot.The Big Ten Freshman of the Year stepped up and drained the go-ahead 3-pointer that Ohio State used to punch its ticket to the second round.“We all just needed to see one go in,” McMahon said. “I thought it was really important for us to get going after that, and that was the shot that kind of helped us get going.”PLAYING THEIR STYLEThe Buckeyes have come from behind in each of its past three victories.Ohio State trailed by one point with over four minutes left March 3 against No. 17 Michigan, erased a 24-point deficit — the largest in Big Ten Tournament history — against No. 2 Indiana on March 4 and fell behind at halftime against the Dukes.But to the Buckeyes, they still rely on trust.“We have a style that can play from behind, number one. And number two, we’ve done this before,” McGuff said. “And so I think they have some confidence that regardless of what’s going on, if we keep playing our style and so forth, that we’ll have a chance to come back.”SIGNS OF STRENGTHSheldon missed 20 games this season while nursing a lower leg injury, including 16 straight.It was the most amount of time Sheldon has missed at Ohio State as she started 82 of the 94 games she’s played. Sheldon played 36 minutes, most of any Buckeye, and her 17 points are her most since returning from injury.“I think just finding ways to stay in the gym, find a way to stay around these guys as well,” Sheldon said. “We have a great group, so just being able to see them every day helped a ton.”BIG PICTUREJames Madison: The Sun Belt Tournament winners gave the Buckeyes a scare in their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2016. Jefferson, the conference player of the year, was held to four points in the second half.Ohio State: McMahon’s timely 3 was what the Buckeyes needed, although they still shot 2 of 17 from distance. Ohio State has shot worse than 31.3% from beyond the arc in two of its past three games.UP NEXTOhio State will play the winner of No. 6 seed North Carolina on Monday.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840042,Everton halts Chelsea's run with 2-2 draw in EPL,"LONDON (AP) — Chelsea's three-game winning streak in all competitions came to a halt as Everton came from behind twice to earn a 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Saturday.Abdoulaye Doucoure scored the first equalizer and set up the second for substitute Ellis Simms in the 89th minute to earn what could be a crucial point in Everton's fight against relegation.It was Simms' first goal for Everton but he showed both composure and confidence as he held off a defender and beat goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga with a low shot from a tight angle to silence the Stamford Bridge crowd.Chelsea was looking for a third straight win in the league but struggled to create much in a forgettable first half against a compact Everton side.Then the game came to life after the break.Joao Felix finally broke the deadlock in the 52nd with a low shot past Jordan Pickford and U.S. forward Christian Pulisic — making his first start since Jan. 5 — thought he had doubled the lead with a curling effort minutes later, but it was disallowed for offside.Instead, Doucoure leveled with a header from a corner in the 69th that went over Kepa and crossed the line before it was cleared by Kai Havertz.But Chelsea was back in front after Reece James was fouled in the area and Havertz converted from the penalty spot in the 76th.Simms came on shortly afterward and had the last say with a composed finish after Doucoure had teed up his run into the area.The draw means Everton is two points above the relegation zone in 15th place. Chelsea is in 10th place.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840043,SC's Boston to face similar foe in USF's Fankan Mendjiadeu,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — It's hard not to see similarities between South Carolina All-American Aliyah Boston and South Florida's Dulcy Fankam Mendjiadeu.Both centers are tall and dominant with exceptional footwork and a drive to score down low despite multiple defenders in their way.The two will face each other Sunday when the undefeated, top-seeded and defending national champion Gamecocks (33-0) play the eighth-seeded Bulls (27-6) in the second round of the women's NCAA Tournament.Boston sees a lot of what she does in Fankam Mendjiadeu.“She's a great post player, very physical,” Boston said Saturday. “She rebounds the ball and is pretty good around the basket, so yeah, she does"" play like the two-time Southeastern Conference player of the year.Fankam Mendjiadeu has 24 double-doubles this season, including 22 points and 16 boards in Friday's 67-65 overtime win against Marquette, and Boston has 20.Fankam Mendjiadeu is averaging 16.8 points and 12.4 rebounds. She also leads South Florida with 36 blocks.Boston has averaged 13.1 points and 9.7 rebounds and has a team-high 66 blocks. She was named the SEC's co-defensive player of the year with teammate Brea Beal.“She is really more physical than me, that's for sure,” Fankam Mendjiadeu said. “She's really good, she's one of the best players in the country right now. It's going to be a great game.”Especially down low.Boston came out on top in a similar showdown earlier this season, getting 14 points, nine rebounds and three blocks in an 88-64 domination of then-undefeated LSU on Feb. 12. The Tigers' Angel Reese managed just four rebounds — her first game of the season without double-digit boards.Reese leads the country with 29 double-doubles. Fankam Mendjiadeu is fourth and Boston is sixth.And Fankam Mendjiadeu is able to lock in when the Bulls are in trouble. That was the case against Marquette, which led by 11 points midway through the third quarter before the Bulls rallied. Fankam Mendjiadeu scored 16 of her points and had 12 of her rebounds in the final two quarters and OT.One thing's for sure: Fankam Mendjiadeu will need to play even better, and get some help from her teammates, to slow down Boston.Boston has had four games this season with single-digit scoring, including South Carolina's opening-round, 72-40 victory over Norfolk State, in which she finished with seven points and nine rebounds. Still, the Gamecocks are versatile and deep when Boston's on the bench or off her game.Boston played just 23 minutes Friday. Fankam Mendjiadeu was in for 42 of 45 minutes in the first round.Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley said Fankam Mendjiadeu is strong in the post and active on both sides of the ball. South Carolina will play her straight up, Staley said, and “if she forces us to double her, she's working us over.”CENTER OF ATTENTIONStaley is always a focus of fans and the media — and often opponents. Following the Gamecocks' first-round win over Norfolk State Friday, several of the Spartans sought out Staley for pictures and the chance to chat.Staley told Norfolk State leading scorer Kierra Wheeler, a sophomore, to keep her head up because things will improve. Wheeler, at 6-foot-1, was forced to guard the 6-5 Boston.“I just wanted her to know that I saw her,” Staley said of Wheeler. “Doing what she needed to do and it was real promising.”NO JUNK DEFENSESSouth Florida coach Jose Fernandez won't change what his team does on defense, even if he's facing the country's No. 1 team.Fernandez plans to stick with the Bulls' base man-to-man defense to combat South Carolina's Boston, Zia Cooke and Kamilla Cardoso.“I guess Dawn knows we're going to play man-to-man for 40 minutes,” he said. “We’ve played man-to-man for all year — how many games have we played this year? Thirty-three games? Well, guess what, we are going to play man-to-man tomorrow. That’s what we do.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840044,Miami opens March Madness with 17-point rally over Cowgirls,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — When Miami coach Katie Meier reached the locker room at halftime Saturday, her players were already discussing solutions.When they returned for the postgame celebration, Meier was teary-eyed and reflective.In 22 seasons as a head coach, she hadn't been around many victories as satisfying — or as shocking — as this one.Haley Cavinder scored 12 of her 16 points in the second half and made what proved to be the decisive free throw with 8.9 seconds left to complete a 17-point second half comeback and send Miami into the second round of the women's tournament with a 62-61 victory over eighth-seeded Oklahoma State. It matched the fifth-largest comeback in NCAA tourney history.“I wanted to remind them like when life gets hard and you're going through some stuff and it doesn't look really good, I want you to remember this moment,"" Meier said. “I really want you to look at your teammates and remember what it took for you guys to make the comeback you did.”In basketball terms, it took a more aggressive defense, a more selfless offense, a stronger commitment to covering up miscues and some good fortune in those wild, frantic final seconds.The back-and-forth stretch run — a missed free throw with 8.9 seconds left followed by Anna Gret Asi's 3-pointer to make it a one-point game before a 5-second call on Miami's ensuing inbound play gave Oklahoma State one more chance — tested the nerves and emotions of everyone.But it wasn't actually over until Naomie Alnatas' 10-foot runner rolled off the rim at the buzzer, leaving the sixth-year guard and her teammates seated on the court, lamenting the collapse.Asi led the Cowgirls (21-16) with 16 points and four 3s. Alnatas had 10 points and Taylen Collins grabbed 16 rebounds.Cavinder wound up with eight rebounds and six assists while Jasmyn Roberts added 12 points.Incredibly after facing a 37-20 halftime deficit, Miami (20-12) moves on to face top-seeded Indiana (28-3) on the Hoosiers home court.The explanation for what happened depended on the perspective.“I was really just trying to bring a sense of calm and peace to the chaos and felt it was a combination of some people tightening up and then some people being too lax,"" Oklahoma State coach Jacie Hoyt said through a cracking voice and damp, reddened eyes. ""I know in the future that's going to help me become a better coach.""Miami had a different take.“I think that's March,” Cavinder said. “It was nerve-racking, but we finished the game strong and yeah, it's something I'll remember forever.”The dejected Cowgirls won't forget it, either.After shooting nearly 52 percent in the first half, they gave up the first 11 points of the third quarter before rallying to take a 44-40 lead into the fourth and for a moment, For a moment, Meier thought the magical comeback might be as over.Instead, Miami opened the fourth with seven straight points as they eventually built a 53-46 lead, but the Cowgirls responded with a 10-2 spurt to take a 56-55 lead 3:22 left.Then Cavinder and Harden answered with consecutive layups and Ja'le Williams hit a short shot to make it 61-56 with 62 seconds left before Cavinder made 1 of 2 free throws to set up the finish.“When you say encourage that means to put courage into someone's heart and we had to put courage into each other's hearts, including mine,"" Meier said. “They had to convince me. This is a huge wonderful memory, of sport, but it's a lifetime memory, too.”BIG PICTUREMiami: The Hurricanes showed a lot of moxie by coming back. Defensively, they challenged shots, forced turnovers and found ways to make plays down the stretch. The question is whether they'll have enough energy to make life difficult against Indiana on Monday.Oklahoma State: Hoyt is the first first-year coach to lead the Cowgirls to the tourney. But the early exit and the blown lead will be something Oklahoma State will haunt and perhaps serve as motivation through the offseason.UP NEXTMeier has led the Hurricanes into the second round in each of her last three tourney appearances. A year ago, though, their run ended against eventual national champion South Carolina. This year, they face another No. 1 seed on the road.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

Hernandez quickly began filming. It was over in about 40 seconds, he said Saturday.“Mainly, we were in shock, but amazed that we got to witness it,” Hernandez said in an email. “None of us had ever seen anything like it.”The brewery owner posted Hernandez's video to Instagram, asking if anyone could solve the mystery.Jonathan McDowell says he can. McDowell is an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. McDowell said Saturday in an interview with The Associated Press that he's 99.9% confident the streaks of light were from burning space debris.McDowell said that a Japanese communications package that relayed information from the International Space Station to a communications satellite and then back to Earth became obsolete in 2017 when the satellite was retired. The equipment, weighing 310 kilograms (683 pounds), was jettisoned from the space station in 2020 because it was taking up valuable space and would burn up completely upon reentry, McDowell added.The flaming bits of wreckage created a “spectacular light show in the sky,"" McDowell said. He estimated the debris was about 40 miles high, going thousands of miles per hour.The U.S. Space Force confirmed the re-entry path over California for the Inter-Orbit Communication System, and the timing is consistent with what people saw in the sky, he added. The Space Force could not immediately be reached Saturday with questions._____McDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island.",2023/3/20,,World

(AP) — Neal Pionk scored 55 seconds into overtime to give the Winnipeg Jets a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators on Saturday.Nikolaj Ehlers and Adam Lowry also scored and Connor Hellebuyck made 18 saves for Winnipeg, which snapped a two-game losing streak. Josh Morrissey had two assists.“We played well enough to win that in regulation,” Jets coach Rick Bowness said. “Give their goaltender (credit), he was outstanding. We were really happy with our overall team game for 60 minutes.”Cody Glass and Luke Evangelista scored and Juuse Saros made 30 saves for the Predators, who have lost two straight.“I was really proud of our guys,” Predators coach John Hynes said. “Big magnitude game, lot of guys playing in the first game of that magnitude in the NHL. I thought our guys battled really hard. I’m proud of them.”The Predators trail Winnipeg by five points in the chase for the Western Conference’s second wild-card berth, though Nashville has played three fewer games.“Obviously, you’d love to win in regulation, take all two,” Lowry said. “If we take care of business on our end, we play them again, we’ll put ourselves in the driver’s seat to control our own destiny.”In overtime, Pionk was able to get a tap-in off of a shot attempt from Pierre-Luc Dubois.Just 34 seconds after Ehlers tied the game at 1 early in the third with a slap shot from the top of the left circle, Evangelista took a feed from Tommy Novak in the low slot and banked a shot off of Hellebuyck and into the net. Novak has points in five consecutive games.Lowry converted the rebound of a Morrissey shot at 10:15 of the third.“We stuck with it and I thought we started to generate more as the game went on, make plays when they were there,” Morrissey said.Glass scored the game’s first goal at 5:26 of the opening period. Cal Foote’s shot from the right point hit traffic in front of the Winnipeg net. Just outside the crease on the right side, Glass swatted the bouncing puck past Hellebuyck.“Obviously you’d like two (points), but you got to take what you can get,” Glass said. “We’re still three games in hand or whatever it is. We need to string along a couple wins here and really just come together.”Philip Tomasino also assisted on Glass’ goal, extending his point-scoring streak to four games, which equals a career high.JOSI OUTPredators captain Roman Josi did not return following the first period. Josi was credited with 10:06 of ice time in the first period and one shot on goal.The Predators did not have an update postgame and stated they would likely know more Sunday.“It’s really challenging,” Hynes said. “No one can fill Roman’s role, the amount of ice time he plays with, obviously the natural skill and ability to generate offense, break the puck out of the zone. You have to try to divide it up as best you can.”WHAT’S NEXTPredators: Visit the New York Rangers on Sunday.Jets: Visit the St. Louis Blues on Sunday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840047,"Clark, Iowa prepare for Georgia's zone defense in 2nd round","IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Iowa's women's basketball team has seen plenty of different defenses this season.The zone that the Hawkeyes will see in Georgia in Sunday's NCAA Tournament second-round game is just the latest test.The Lady Bulldogs (22-11), the 10th seed in Seattle Regional 4, held Florida State to 26.9% shooting overall and 27.6% in 3-pointers in Friday's 66-54 first-round game.Now Georgia gets the second-seeded Hawkeyes (27-6), who led the nation in scoring at 87.5 points per game and in field-goal percentage at 51.1%. Iowa also shot 37.2 percent in 3-pointers, 10th best in the nation.The defenses the Hawkeyes have seen this season, especially in Big Ten play, have been an education.“I think everything really helped prepare us for this,” said Iowa center Monika Czinano. “I think we are really equipped for it. A lot of losses, yeah, they sucked. It sucks to lose. But we learned a lot of great lessons from them. They teach us really great lessons for these moments.""The inside-out workings of the Hawkeyes' offense create their own challenges.“It's hard to pick your poison with this team,” said Iowa guard Caitlin Clark, an Associated Press first-team All-American. “There’s only so much you can do, but I don’t know if they’ve really seen a team that has four consistent shooters on the perimeter like we do.”Czinano was third in the nation in field-goal percentage after leading the nation in that category the last two seasons, and she was 10 of 12 from the field in Friday's 95-43 first-round win over Southeastern Louisiana. Clark, who averaged 27 points per game, made 111 3-pointers this season. Forward McKenna Warnock made 50, guard Gabbie Marshall had 47, and guard Kate Martin had 37.“Being able to use that to the best of our ability, it's hard to play zone when you have four people on the perimeter that can really spread the floor out and shoot it like we do,"" Clark said.Georgia coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson hinted the Lady Bulldogs might want to extend their defense.“We try to just do us and play us,” Abrahamson-Henderson said. “That’s always our goal. So you know, dependent on if we are going to press or not in this game, that will change a little of the dynamics. Clearly I’m not giving you all my secrets, people.”Clark will be the biggest concern for the Bulldogs. She leads the nation with 8.5 assists per game.“She makes you change what you have in your game plan,” Georgia guard Diamond Battles said.“Amazing. Amazing,” Abrahamson-Henderson said of Clark. “I mean, she’s one of the best players in the country for sure.”The Hawkeyes have to deal with Georgia's height advantage, especially with a double-post offense the Lady Bulldogs run.“They’re a very physical team,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “We can’t grow overnight, so we have to be able to handle it.”Iowa used its own zone in the second half of Friday's win, and it's likely the Hawkeyes will use that on Sunday.“I think in the second half, we played all zone, and our zone caused them a lot of problems, and I think that’s something we can feed off going into Georgia,” Clark said. “I think our zone defense could be really good playing them. Obviously we’re going to try a lot of different things, but I think there’s a lot we can take away from our zone defense being really good.”The Hawkeyes remember the disappointment of last season, when they were a No. 2 seed and lost in the second round to 10 seed Creighton.“I definitely feel like something was taken from us last season,” Czinano said. “But I'm not letting that loss last year haunt me. That was last year, this is this year.”Sunday's game will be played in front of a sellout crowd of 14,382.“Like I said the other day, every D-I athlete lives for this moment, whether they are cheering for you or cheering against you,” Battles said. “You get to play in front of a sold-out arena, who wouldn’t want to do that?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840048,Sharks goalie James Reimer declines to wear Pride jersey,"San Jose Sharks goalie James Reimer won't take part in pregame warmups Saturday night, saying the team's decision to wear Pride-themed jerseys in support of the LGBTQ community runs counter to his religious beliefs.Reimer said in a statement Saturday that he made the decision based on his Christian beliefs, adding that he “always strived to treat everyone with respect” and that members of the LGBTQ community should be welcome in hockey.“In this specific instance, I am choosing not to endorse something that is counter to my personal convictions, which are based on the Bible, the highest authority in life,” Reimer said.Reimer is the second NHL player this season to refuse to take part in warmups with Pride-themed jerseys, with Philadelphia's Ivan Provorov declining to in January. Reimer was not slated to start in Saturday night’s home game against the New York Islanders, which is Pride night.Additionally, the New York Rangers opted not to wear Pride jerseys or use Pride stick tape as part of their night in January despite previously advertising that plan.The Sharks said in a statement that they are proud to host Pride Night, saying the event reinforces the team's commitment to inclusiveness.“As we promote these standards, we also acknowledge and accept the rights of individuals to express themselves, including how or whether they choose to express their beliefs, regardless of the cause or topic,"" the team said in a statement. “As an organization, we will not waver in our support of the LGBTQIA+ community and continue to encourage others to engage in active allyship.”The You Can Play Project, which works to promote inclusiveness in sports, said the organization was disappointed in Reimer's actions.“Religion and respect are not in conflict with each other, and we are certainly disappointed when religion is used as a reason to not support our community,” the organization said. “Wearing pride jerseys, like any celebration jersey worn, is not about the personal feelings of an athlete; rather the communication from the team that a community is welcome in the arena and the sport.”___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840049,Frese prepares for March Madness reunion with alma mater,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Before she became a national title-winning basketball coach at Maryland, Brenda Frese played at Arizona and earned a communications degree there 30 years ago.“We're doing a college reunion in May, where a lot of us are coming together,” Frese said.First, Frese will have another kind of reunion with her alma mater, and expect her to be all business for this one. Her second-seeded Terrapins host seventh-seeded Arizona on Sunday in the women's NCAA Tournament with a spot in the Sweet 16 on the line.“I do know one of my closest friends, my mom was sharing today, had already posted on Facebook today that she was rooting for Maryland — and where people needed to be at,” Frese said.The Terps (26-6) are trying for their 11th Sweet 16 appearance under Frese and third in a row. To accomplish that, they'll have to beat an Arizona team that made it all the way to the national title game two years ago under another alum, Adia Barnes.The Wildcats (22-9) lost three straight before beating West Virginia in their March Madness opener Friday. They looked pretty sharp in that game and certainly could be more dangerous than their seeding suggests. However, the challenge of playing on the road against Maryland is real.“I think as you progress through the tournament, you have to raise your game up a notch, just because teams get better, competition's better,” said Barnes, who graduated from Arizona in 1998. “We're playing at Maryland, they're a really good team, and they're different, we're not as familiar with them. So I think when I mean raise it up, it’s be more on point on the road defensively.""The Terrapins are 3-0 against Arizona, and the meetings were during Frese's tenure but a while ago. Maryland beat the Wildcats in January of 2005, then in December of ’05 during the Terps’ national championship season. Maryland won another meeting in November of 2006.This year's Terrapins are led by star guard Diamond Miller, and they can press, force turnovers and push the pace. Arizona would love to disrupt those plans, but it won't be easy.“They play really fast, they shoot the ball really well,” Barnes said. “We have to be able to score, so they're not in transition, and I think for us, we can't take really fast shots.”The Wildcats played a key stretch against West Virginia without guard Shaina Pellington, who was in foul trouble. Arizona actually went on a run without her, re-taking control of the game after the Mountaineers had cut into an early gap.Maryland scored the first 14 points of its first-round win against Holy Cross, so the Wildcats will try to avoid that kind of start in a tough environment.“We’re the underdog, and I think usually the underdogs have the more — they’re able to play better just because they don’t have as much pressure,” Arizona guard Lauren Fields said. “So I think we can use that to our advantage going into this game, and I think we just got to come out and play hard, and I think we will get the win.”Arizona was a No. 3 seed in 2021 when it went all the way to the championship game before losing by a point to Stanford. Maryland exited in the Sweet 16 that season, but Frese said she pulled for the Wildcats during their run.As for whether her Arizona friends will reciprocate this weekend, that's still a little unclear.“There's a group of us as teammates,"" Frese said. ""I haven't had time yet to hit the chat yet, who they're all rooting for.”___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

(AP) — David Pastrnak scored his 47th goal of the season and Linus Ullmark made 29 saves as the Boston Bruins beat the Minnesota Wild 5-2 on Saturday.Jake DeBrusk, David Krejci, Patrice Bergeron and Trent Frederic also scored for Boston, which has won two in a row as it seeks to surpass the record 62 wins and 132 points in a season.Pastrnak has six goals and seven assists in his past eight games and is second in the league in goals behind Connor McDavid, who started the day with 57.“I thought we went after them as good as we’ve gone for a 60-minute game,” Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said. “It was good to try and have a mentality where we have an opportunity to end someone’s streak. Instead of being the hunted, we were hunting.”Minnesota, which started the day one point behind Dallas for first and two points ahead of Colorado in the Central Division, hadn’t lost in regulation since Feb. 15 against the Avalanche. The Wild were 11-0-3 in a franchise-record, 14-game point streak.Marcus Johansson and Oskar Sundqvist, both acquired by Minnesota at the trade deadline, scored goals. Filip Gustavsson stopped 34 shots in goal for the Wild.“Obviously, they’ve been the best team in the league the whole year and we proved we can play with them,” Johansson said. “A tough few breaks. That’s the way it goes. We played a good game and we’ve got to learn from it and move on.""Johansson, who was acquired from Washington for a third-round draft pick, opened the scoring against the East leaders midway through the first.Minnesota appeared to take a 2-0 lead, but a goal by Matt Dumba was waived off after a review for offsides.The Wild had two apparent scores taken away by offsides reviews in the game. Connor Dewar was clearly offside on the Dumba goal and Matt Boldy was declared offside after he passed the puck entering the zone and appeared to cross the line before the puck.“They’re both off-sides, so there’s nothing to complain about,” Minnesota coach Dean Evason said. “Couple of bad breaks, obviously a third goes off our stick and goes into the net. Those are three goals right there, we’re in this hockey game.""DeBrusk then tied the game before the first intermission with his 21st goal of the season. Pastrnak and Krejci scored in the second period. It was Krejci’s first goal in 11 games.The Bruins (52-11-5) had lost three of four before winning the past two games. They’re looking to surpass the NHL-record 62 wins by the 1995-96 Red Wings and 2018-19 Lightning. They also have a chance to surpass the record 132 points amassed by the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens.“Usually when we play tough teams and teams who’ve been doing well, we get to our game right away because we know we have to,” Boston forward Charlie Coyle said of stopping the Wild’s point streak. “So, usually our start is on. Whether we score the first goal or not, we just stay at it. We do the right things. We play simple and you see when we do that, we kind of take over.”Sundqvist scored for the second-straight game in the third on the power play. He has two goals in six games for Minnesota since being acquired for a fourth-round draft pick.Boston entered the game with the best penalty kill in the league, killing 85.7% of their shorthanded situations.Bergeron answered with his 25th goal of the season and Frederic tallied an empty-net goal.QUITE A PAIRBergeron and Brad Marchand assisted on DeBrusk’s goal in the second, the 407th time in their careers they’ve combined on a goal. It set a new franchise record, surpassing the total of Phil Esposito and Ken Hodge. Marchand had three assists in the game.“I thought Bergeron’s line set the tone for us,” Montgomery said. “A couple of great forechecking goals. I thought everybody was involved. … That unselfishness that we’ve seen throughout the year was very evident tonight.”UP NEXTBruins: Finish their five-game road trip at Buffalo on Sunday.Wild: Host Washington on Sunday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840051,Prosecutor to release video of death of man in custody,"DINWIDDIE, Va. (AP) — Prosecutors plan next week to release the video that led authorities in Virginia to charge seven deputies and three state mental hospital employees with second-degree murder in the death of a handcuffed and shackled man.The family of Irvo Otieno saw the video of his death Thursday. With their blessing, the footage will be released to the public in the next several days, Dinwiddie County Commonwealth’s Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.Attorneys for the family described the video to reporters as 12 agonizing minutes of deputies pushing down and smothering Otineo, a Black man whose arms and legs were restrained.“You can see that they’re putting their back into it. Every part of his body is being pushed down with absolute brutality,” family attorney Mark Krudys said.Prosecutors said Otieno, 28, didn’t appear to be combative and was sitting in a chair when he was pulled down by officers.The 12-minute video also showed a lack of urgency to help Otieno after the deputies determined “that he was lifeless and not breathing,"" Krudys said.Ten people so far have been charged with second-degree murder in Otieno’s death — seven Henrico County Sheriff’s deputies and three people employed by the hospital.Attorneys for the people arrested have not seen the video yet.“They show the plaintiffs’ attorneys the video. But we’re representing these people charged with murder that are locked up. It’s really disappointing. It seems like it’s more important to curry public favor, to try the case in the media, instead of letting the criminal justice process work the way it’s supposed to work,"" defense attorney Peter Baruch told the Richmond newspaper.Otieno's case marks the latest example of a Black man's in-custody death that has law enforcement under scrutiny. It follows the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year and comes nearly three years after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.Otieno, who was a child when his family emigrated from Kenya and grew up in suburban Richmond, had a history of mental health struggles and was experiencing mental distress at the time of his initial encounter with law enforcement earlier this month, his family and their attorneys said.That set off a chain of events that led to him spending several days in custody before authorities say he died March 6 as he was being admitted to the Central State Hospital south of Richmond.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840052,Florida may ban girls' period talk in elementary grades,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Legislation moving in the Florida House would ban discussion of menstrual cycles and other human sexuality topics in elementary grades.The bill sponsored by Republican Rep. Stan McClain would restrict public school instruction on human sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases and related topics to grades 6 through 12. McClain confirmed at a recent committee meeting that discussions about menstrual cycles would also be restricted to those grades.“So if little girls experience their menstrual cycle in 5th grade or 4th grade, will that prohibit conversations from them since they are in the grade lower than sixth grade?” asked state Rep. Ashley Gantt, a Democrat who taught in public schools and noted that girls as young as 10 can begin having periods.“It would,” McClain responded.The GOP-backed legislation cleared the House Education Quality Subcommittee on Wednesday by a 13-5 vote mainly along party lines. It would also allow parents to object to books and other materials their children are exposed to, require schools to teach that a person's sexual identity is determined biologically at birth and set up more scrutiny of certain educational materials by the state Department of Education.McClain said the bill's intent is to bring uniformity to sex education across all of Florida's 67 school districts and provide more pathways for parents to object to books or other materials they find inappropriate for younger children.At the committee meeting, Gantt asked whether teachers could face punishment if they discuss menstruation with younger students.“My concern is they won't feel safe to have those conversations with these little girls,” she said.McClain said “that would not be the intent” of the bill and that he is “amenable” to some changes to its language. The measure must be approved by another committee before it can reach the House floor; a similar bill is pending in the Senate.An email seeking comment was sent Saturday to the office of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely seen as a potential 2024 presidential candidate.",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840055,Haaland nets 3 as City roll; Conte fumes after Spurs draw,"LONDON (AP) — The goals just keep flowing for Erling Haaland and Manchester City, no matter the competition.Haaland bagged another hat trick to make it eight goals in his last two games as City eased into the FA Cup semifinals with a 6-0 home win over Championship side Burnley on Saturday. That came on the heels of a 7-0 win over Leipzig on Tuesday in the Champions League — when Haaland netted five — showing that City may be hitting another gear as it enters the decisive part of the season.It was City's sixth straight win in all competitions, having scored 23 goals in that stretch.“We are in that part of the season where we should be at our best,"" said Haaland, whose extraordinary tally is now at 42 goals in all competitions. ""Now is when things get decided.”City is still in the hunt for three trophies, but while Pep Guardiola's team are the big favorites in the FA Cup they may need to maintain this kind of form to win the other two. They face Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals next month, and could go into the international break eight points behind Arsenal in the Premier League if the Gunners beat Crystal Palace at home on Sunday.That's a minor worry, though, compared to the headache facing Antonio Conte at Tottenham.Conte tore into his players for being “selfish” and launched a tirade against the club's lack of winning mentality after his team threw away a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3 at last-place Southampton.That result cost Tottenham a chance to climb provisionally into third place, and made things even tighter in an increasingly intriguing relegation fight that involves no less than nine teams. Only four points now separate 12th-place Palace and Southampton at the bottom of the table.One win was enough for Leeds to climb from 19th up to 14th after beating Wolverhampton 4-2 away, while Leicester remained firmly entrenched in the relegation struggle despite halting a five-game losing streak in all competitions with a 1-1 draw at Brentford.That keeps Leicester just one point above the drop zone — and two points ahead of Southampton — while midtable Aston Villa made it three wins in four games with a 3-0 victory over relegation-threatened Bournemouth.In the late game, 15th-place Everton twice came from behind to draw 2-2 at Chelsea.HAALAND HAT TRICKThe buildup to Burnley's visit to the Etihad had all been about its manager Vincent Kompany, the former City captain who already has a statue outside the stadium after winning 10 major trophies with the club.Haaland may get his own statue before his playing career is even over if he keeps scoring at this rate.The prolific Norwegian scored his first two goals in a three-minute span shortly after the half-hour mark and completed his hat trick by slotting in a rebound in the 59th.World Cup winner Julian Alvarez also scored twice while the 20-year-old Cole Palmer got on the scoresheet as Burnley's resistance collapsed over the last 30 minutes.Gary Lineker was back on the air to spearhead the BBC's coverage of the game after being suspended last week for criticizing the U.K. government's migration policy.The other three quarterfinals are played Sunday, with Manchester United hosting Fulham in the most notable matchup.CONTE TIRADEAfter seeing his players throw away a two-goal lead, Conte did little to quell the speculation that he's already looking for a way out of the club.“I see a lot of selfish players. And I don’t see a team,” the Italian manager said after James Ward-Prowse's injury-time penalty earned Southampton the draw.And he wasn't done there, adding that Tottenham's lack of a winning mentality is deeply rooted within a club whose last trophy came in 2008.“They are used to it. They don’t play for something important, yeah,” Conte said. ""They don’t want to play under pressure, they don’t want to play under stress. It is easy in this way. Tottenham’s story is this. Twenty years there is the (same) owner and they never won something.”Conte won league titles at Juventus, Inter Milan and Chelsea, but will finish a second season at Tottenham without a trophy. It's looking increasingly unlikely that he'll be back for a third.CHELSEA STUMBLESAfter showing signs of momentum under Graham Potter, Chelsea had another setback against Everton.The London club's three-game winning streak in all competitions came to a halt as Abdoulaye Doucoure scored the first equalizer and set up the second for substitute Ellis Simms in the 89th minute.It was Simms’ first goal for Everton but he showed both composure and confidence as he held off a defender and beat goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga with a low shot from a tight angle to silence the Stamford Bridge crowd.“We thought we played well enough to get the three points but ultimately if you don’t defend well, you don’t get the result,” Potter said.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840056,"Tennessee beats up Duke, wins 65-52 to advance to Sweet 16","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Olivier Nkamhoua was a little hesitant to enter Tennessee's postgame locker room after a career performance against powerhouse Duke in the NCAA Tournament. So Uros Plavsic picked him up and delivered him to teammates waiting to douse him with water.It was a fitting payback considering Nkamhoua had carried the Volunteers much of the afternoon.Nkamhoua tied his career high with 27 points, including 13 straight for Tennessee during a decisive stretch in the second half, and the fourth-seeded Volunteers bullied Duke 65-52 on Saturday to advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2019.“We're a tough, hard-nosed team,” Nkamhoua said. ""That's how we play everybody. But knowing they had a lot of freshmen, we knew that if we come in and apply more pressure and be tough and physical, then they would have to deal with it.“What we were saying before the game is we were going to bring them into the mud with us and make them play a tough, hard-nosed game and see if they were ready for it.”They weren't, and Tennessee's experience — the Vols start four seniors — proved too much for Duke's highly touted freshmen.Santiago Vescovi added 14 points and five assists for Tennessee (25-10), which ended Duke’s 10-game winning streak and sent first-year coach Jon Scheyer — charged with replacing Mike Krzyzewski — home after just two NCAA Tournament games. Not sure Coach K could have done anything different to combat these Vols, who used a level of “bully ball” to send the fifth-seeded Blue Devils (27-9) packing.“We feel we’re at our best when we can do that,"" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said.Nkamhoua made 10 of 13 shots and put an exclamation mark on Tennessee’s victory with an emphatic slam with 1:15 remaining. It prompted Vols fans to start chanting and sent Duke fans scrambling for the the exits.“You have to really work for everything in a game like this,” said Scheyer, whose team turned the ball over 15 times and made just 6 of 22 from 3-point range. “You have to work to get open.”Tennessee advanced to face Florida Atlantic or Fairleigh Dickinson on Thursday at Madison Square Garden in New York City.Duke didn’t handle Tennessee’s imposing style very well all afternoon. The Volunteers set the tone early, clearly wanting to push around Kyle Filipowski and get their hands in the faces of guards Jeremy Roach and Tyrese Proctor.Vols big man Uros Plavsic picked up two offensive fouls in the first four minutes, both going against Filipowski. Duke’s 7-footer later took an elbow to his face and ended up with a small cut under his left eye.Proctor struggled to inbound the ball several times, getting a five-second call, turning it over once and nearly giving it up again. Roach had even more issues, picking up up his fourth foul with 15 minutes remaining and finishing with five turnovers.“We prepare for a dogfight every game,"" Nkamhoua said. “When we get people playing our game, it just guarantees that we're going to be in our element.""It helped that the Vols took much better care of the ball than they did in their first-round victory against Louisiana-Lafayette. They turned it over just nine times, half as many as they did Thursday and their fewest since point guard Zakai Zeigler sustained a season-ending knee injury last month.Proctor led Duke with 16 points and six assists. Roach and Filipowski chipped in 13 points apiece. Dereck Lively II was scoreless but had 11 rebounds and two blocks.“I thought we ran out of gas down the stretch,"" Scheyer said.BIG PICTUREDuke: The Blue Devils played without 6-foot-8, 220-pound forward Mark Mitchell, who was a late scratch because of a knee injury. It's unlikely Mitchell would have made a difference, but he surely would have helped down low against the Vols.Tennessee: The Vols stumbled into the tournament having lost six of 10, but now they have a winning streak and have clearly re-established their identity as a big, physical, deep, defensive-minded team capable of giving anyone fits.UP NEXTDuke: The Blue Devils turn their attention to what happens with their talent-laden team and the NBA. All eyes will be on freshmen Dereck Lively II, Filipowski and Proctor and their pending decisions.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840057,"Still room for bigs like Sanogo, Timme in college basketball","ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — UConn center Adama Sanogo punctuated one of the best games of his career by nailing a jumper from around the top of the 3-point line that brought a roar from Huskies fans.After a review, it only counted as a 2, but the points weren't really the point. At 6-foot-9, 245 pounds, Sanogo is a force in the paint, with a combination of quickness and power. He wants to be something more.“You can be a good player, but if you want to be a great player, you have to be able to do a little bit of everything,” Sanogo said. “So being able to shoot was something in my mind that I wanted to do.”Having a dominant post player is not the advantage it used to be. Just ask top-seeded Purdue. The Boilermakers and 7-4 All-American Zach Edey were eliminated Friday night by 16th-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson, the shortest team in the tournament.Modern basketball has marginalized big guys who play close to the basket and the NBA is no longer coveting their skills.But there is still a place for them in the college game, and it will be on display when fourth-seeded UConn from the Big East takes on fifth-seeded Saint Mary's on Sunday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament's West Region.The Gaels of the West Coast Conference will counter Sanogo with Mitchell Saxen, a 6-10, 242-pound junior who had 17 points on 8-of-11 shooting in the first round against VCU.“I would rather play against guys like him,” Sanogo said Saturday. “I feel like it's better for me to bang with people, play against people that are the same size as me.”Sanogo was overwhelming in the first round against Iona. He scored 28 points on 13-for-17 shooting, most of it from right around the rim.The junior has added some range to his game this season, taking 48 3-pointers (and making 17) after trying just one in his first two years.Behind Sanogo, UConn has 7-2 freshman Donovan Clingan, who had 12 points and nine rebounds in 13 minutes against Iona.Clingan said sometimes he wonders if he was born too late to maximize his basketball talents.“At the same time, I'm trying to develop my game behind the 3-point line, which is what the NBA is nowadays: 3s and layups,” he said. “Just trying to adapt to the new style of basketball.”Clingan might even get to play against another 7-footer Sunday. Saint Mary's freshman Harry Wessels (7-1, 255) averages about six minutes per game, but UConn would seem to present a matchup suitable for his skills.“You’re not winning our league playing small,” Gaels coach Randy Bennett said. ""Gonzaga’s going to play big. They always have. They have pros in there at their fours and fives. You can't play small ball and beat them.”The third-seeded Zags and All-American big man Drew Timme are on the other side of the West bracket, playing their second-round game Sunday in Denver against sixth-seeded TCU.Timme, a 6-10 senior, has been one of the top players in the country for the last three seasons, despite being only 17 for 74 in his career from beyond the arc. In another era, he probably would already be in the NBA.“I think you see a lot of great bigs around the country, this year especially,” Timme said. ""I just think other people don’t value it as much. I wouldn’t say it’s lost, I just say it’s not as appreciated as it was 15, 20 years ago.”But now, with college players permitted to earn money off their names, images and likenesses, staying in school can make sense and dollars.“I think for those guys, for a guy like Adama, obviously it’s lucrative to stay in the college game with NIL valuations,"" UConn coach Dan Hurley said.Bennett said post play on the offensive end still has a lot of value. It’s on defense where it can be a challenge to keep the fives on the floor.Bennett said coaches are better than ever about using screens to create defensive switches that force big players to guard small ones away from the basket.“Those guys have to be athletic enough to defend, and I think that’s why people have gone away from it a little bit is because offensively people have gotten so good with using on-balls to attack them,” he said.___AP Sports Writers Pat Graham and Eddie Pells in Denver contributed.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840058,"FGCU tops WSU 74-63, reaches 2nd round of March Madness","VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) — Maddie Antenucci shot pogo-sticked twice off the rim and the play seemed to go in slow motion for Florida Gulf Coast. Once the ball knocked twice off the top of the backboard - and in! — it was almost time to crank some celebratory Iron Maiden in the locker room.“It was like, ahhh,” FGCU guard Sha Carter said of the shot. “When it hit, you could just feel the electricity in the arena.”Antenucci’s 3-pointer bounced four times before going through the net as part of her game-changing spree from beyond the arc that sent 12th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast into the second round of the NCAA Tournament with a 74-63 win Saturday over No. 5-seed Washington State.Carter scored 24 points and Tishara Moorehouse had 16 for the Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament champion Golden Eagles (33-3).“We have a team that can be explosive,” coach Karl Smesko said.FGCU will try and reach the Sweet 16 with an upset against fourth-seeded Villanova on Monday at the Wildcats’ on-campus arena, the Pavilion. The Wildcats beat Cleveland State 76-59 in the late game.The Eagles sent the Shania Twain karaoke club out of Washington State (23-11) home early after a surprising run to win the Pac-12 Tournament. Tara Wallack led the Cougars with 16 pointsAntenucci, who scored 11 points, turned into a sudden-scorer and turned a tight game into FGCU's game to lose. She averaged only 4.1 points this season, but hit FGCU’s second 3 of the game in the third quarter for a 43-38 lead. Her second straight 3 only 35 seconds later made it 46-40 and started to put some separation in the game.Her third straight 3 was one for the highlight reel. Her shot bounced twice straight up off the back rim, tapped twice off the front corner of the backboard and plopped through the net. The three 3s in a 1 minute, 12-second span were Antenucci’s first three shots and first points of the game.“I feel like that pretty much summed it up for us in the third quarter,"" Carter said, laughing.The FGCU fans that filled a couple of sections inside the Pavilion erupted and Washington State called timeout. The Cougars never recovered. FGCU outscored Wazzu 30-16 in the third quarter.Antenucci’s teammates took it from there. Moorehouse was fouled on a driving layup -- Cougars guard Astera Tuhina slammed the ball in frustration -- and she hit the free throw for a 58-47 lead. They took a 61-48 lead into the fourth quarter.“It just felt like we didn’t get a handle on how to guard them,” coach Kamie Ethridge said.The Eagles closed as 1½-point favorites, per FanDuel Sportsbook, so this would be no underdog upset, no matter the seeding.While the Cougars made a habit of singing along in victory to Twain's signature tune, the Eagles did their coach a solid and blasted one of his favorites, Iron Maiden's “The Trooper” in the locker room.Florida Gulf Coast sent a basketball program back to the area 10 years after the men’s famed “Dunk City” team won two games as a 12 seed in Philadelphia and advanced to the Sweet 16.Smesko said he didn’t believe that magic could be recreated.Unless, he joked, if the Eagles won.Maybe Antenucci's funky 3 can earn them some “Kerplunk City” fame.With 4:14 left in the game, and the Cougars trailing 70-56, the school band belted out Twain's “Man! I Feel Like A Woman!” to try and rally the team. The 1997 smash had become an anthem for the program and even caught the attention of Twain. The Cougars also had Twain’s “Let’s Go Girls” printed on the back of the warmup shirts.They're just not going to the second round.“I hope it's a gut-punch for the ones that are coming back,” Ethridge said.IT HIM!The Washington State band played to the local crowd -- that filled in with Villanova fans late in the second half -- with masks in honor of Flyers mascot Gritty.INTERNATIONAL FLAIRWashington State’s starters were from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Estonia and Rwanda.BIG PICTUREFlorida Gulf Coast: The Eagles came in shooting a modest 38% from 3-point range this season. Antenucci made 27 3s this season and shot 38% from beyond the arc. She did shoot 41% on 3s in conference play.Washington State: The Cougars played in their third straight NCAA Tournament but fell to 0-4 in the tourney. The No. 5 seed was the highest Washington State had ever earned in March Madness.“We're very, very hungry to come back and get past that first round,” guard Charlisse Leger-Walker said. “That’s definitely personal for me in something I want to help this team do.”UP NEXTThe Eagles will face a rowdy home court for the Wildcats on Monday night.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840059,Vinícius to face Araújo again in Camp Nou 'clasico',"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Vinícius Júnior will get another shot at trying to get past Barcelona defender Ronald Araújo on Sunday in the latest “clasico” that will impact the Spanish league title race.The last time they met just two weeks ago, Araújo got the better of the Real Madrid forward and was key in Barcelona earning a gritty 1-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals.Barcelona coach Xavi Hernández is hoping for another strong performance at Camp Nou from his versatile defender, who can play at center back or line up on the right side of the defense against Vinícius.“Araújo is big, very strong, and he likes defending. He is a leader, takes on responsibility, wins one-on-one situations. He is a world-class defender,” Xavi said. “When he has had to face off with Vinícius, he has come out on top. But Vinícius decides games. I like him a lot as a player, and we will have to keep an eye on him.”Over the last two seasons Vinícius has established himself as the perfect strike partner for Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema. Fast and unpredictable, the 22-year-old Vinícius leads the league in successful dribbles to get past opponents with 77. Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams is next with 54.Vinícius and Benzema have both scored 19 goals in all competitions this season for a Madrid side in the hunt to also keep its Champions League title. The Brazilian set up Benzema’s goal in the 1-0 win over Liverpool as Madrid sealed its aggregate 6-2 win to reach the quarterfinals.But where most defenders have failed, Araújo has had success.The Uruguay defender kept Vinícius under control in two wins over Madrid this year, including stopping Vinícius from scoring in a 3-1 win in the Spanish Super Cup final in January.When Araújo was unavailable due to injury in October, Madrid beat Barcelona 3-1 in their first league meeting of the season.Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti acknowledged that his talented winger has had “difficulties,” but said that he would once again keep him on the left side of the attack --- where Araújo will surely be waiting.“Vinícius is always Vinícius. His mobility always helps us a lot,” Ancelotti said.Barcelona leads the league by nine points over Madrid. A win would put it on the brink of its first league title since 2019 and its first major title since Lionel Messi left the club in 2021.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

Orlando scored 39 points in the final period, including 18 in the final 3:52.Orlando coach Jahmal Mosley said the offensive performance “ranks up there” among the Magic's best.“But to be honest with you, I'm happier that we finally sat down and guarded in the fourth quarter,” Mosley added. “Our guys did a great job of finally putting it all together down the stretch.”Fultz had another impressive game in his late-season surge, going 10 for 17 and grabbing six rebounds. He got all 12 of his fourth-quarter points in the final 4:36.“It was huge, especially because we've had moments like this in the past where we didn't close out,” Fultz said. “To put together a whole game and weather their runs and continue to push it was big tonight. It just shows what we're capable of when we stay locked in the whole game.”Paul George scored 30 points for the Clippers, whose four-game winning streak ended on the last contest of a five-game homestand.Kawhi Leonard skipped the game to rest his right knee, sitting out for the 29th time in the Clippers’ 71 games.

Carter then dramatically blocked a layup attempt by Russell Westbrook, leading to a layup by Fultz.“What you’re seeing from me is a guy that doesn’t take anything for granted,” said Fultz, who is healthy after struggling with numerous major injuries in the first five seasons of his NBA career. “I feel like I have a high ceiling. I have so much room to grow.”George hit a 3-pointer with 1:03 left to trim Orlando's lead to 106-104, but Wagner answered with his own 3. Fultz made a tough layup in traffic to maintain Orlando's lead, and George finally missed a late 3-point attempt to seal it.Westbrook played the entire fourth quarter in Leonard's absence, but scored just three points — making his only field goal with 10:45 to play — and committed two turnovers. Westbrook said the loss is “on me.”“He’s going to get through it,” George said. “(Westbrook) knows that we trust him and got his back. ... I know the value he brings to the team. He plays hard, and that’s a guy that I want to roll with and compete with.”Leonard averaged 31.5 points per game during the Clips' four-game winning streak, but the franchise is sticking to its plan not to play its star in back-to-back games.

(AP) — Toledo's a very confident group, and now the program's biggest victory in nearly three decades has the Rockets ready to see how far they can go.Quinesha Lockett scored 24 points and grabbed 13 rebounds as Toledo knocked off No. 5 seed Iowa State 80-73 Saturday for the second win by a 12 seed in the opening round of the women's NCAA Tournament.“We’re still dancing,” Lockett said. “We’re very excited. We just know we still have another game to play, and we’re ready to keep playing. But I just know everybody is real excited, and we had a good time out there.”Senior guard Jayda Jansen said they're not satisfied just to be here.“Honestly, we're not scared of anybody,” Jansen said.Toledo became the second 12 seed to win Saturday, joining Florida Gulf Coast not long after its win over Washington State. Toledo now will play No. 4 seed Tennessee, a 95-50 winner over 13th-seeded Saint Louis, on Monday night seeking its first Sweet 16 ever in the Seattle 3 region.The Rockets (29-4) matched the program record for most wins for a second straight season by winning a record 17th straight game, topping the 16-game streak of 2000-01. They also posted their first NCAA win since 1996 in their ninth tournament appearance overall and first since 2017.Jansen finished with 17 points for Toledo, which used its athleticism to help smother Iowa State's shooters. Sophia Wiard added 15 points and Nan Garcia 12.Iowa State got within 78-73 on Denae Fritz’s 3 with 29.4 seconds left. Toledo didn’t make a bucket after Lockett’s layup with 3:35 to go, but the Rockets hit its final eight free throws over the final 63 seconds.When Lexi Donarski’s 3 missed with 24 seconds left, Toledo got the rebound and Justina King dribbled and then just held the ball as the final seconds ticked off before the Rockets ran onto the court to celebrate.Iowa State (22-10) came in as the Big 12 Tournament champ for the first time since 2001 after stringing together upsets of a trio of NCAA Tournament teams in Baylor, Oklahoma and Texas. The Cyclones also had the Big 12 Player of the Year in Ashley Joens looking for a second straight Sweet 16 berth.Instead, the Cyclones head home with their first opening round loss since 2017. Coach Bill Fennelly said he applauded Toledo, the program he coached between 1988 and 1995 to three NCAA berths himself.“When you get into the NCAA Tournament or any big game, especially, I’ve always said it’s a make or miss shot game,” Fennelly said. “And they made a lot of shots, and we missed a lot of shots. So credit to them, and certainly wish them the best moving forward.”Toledo coach Tricia Cullop called the win “bittersweet” coming against friends.“That was a tough handshake line,” Cullop said.Joens led Iowa State with 23 points and 13 rebounds, including a perfect 11-of-11 at the free throw line. Joens was 0-of-4 in the fourth quarter. Donarski finished with 13, and Fritz and Emily Ryan each had 11.Iowa State took its biggest lead at 23-18 and was up 23-20 after the first quarter.Garcia's layup put Toledo ahead to stay with 7:52 left in the second as Toledo outscored Iowa State 23-13 in the second for a 43-36 lead into halftime. Toledo led 61-53 going into the fourth.BIG PICTUREToledo: The Rockets also won 29 games in 2012-13. They improved to 4-8 in the NCAA Tournament with their first win since downing Ole Miss in 1996. The Rockets were the No. 10 seed and lost in the second round to Old Dominion.Iowa State: The Cyclones had a strong argument to be hosting themselves as the Big 12 Tournament champ and ranked 17th nationally. They won their first-round games in 2019, 2021 and 2022 when they lost to Creighton in the Sweet 16.BREAKDOWNJoens broke down into tears trying to talk about the end of her career. Fennelly and teammate Morgan Kane tried to console her. Kane then chimed in to defend her teammate as she cried.“Ashley has had a huge impact not only on the court through her leadership but also off the court, she’s really brought us together as a team,” Kane said. “And when things get hard and challenging, she’s the first one to bring us together. And so really grateful for that, that leadership, and more to come for her.”UP NEXTToledo will play No. 24 Tennessee for the second time in program history on Monday night for the program's first ever trip to the Sweet 16.

You bet.That would certainly describe what the Knights, college basketball's smallest squad which includes some Division II players brought to FDU by Tobin Anderson, the team's fast-talking, first-year vagabond coach, have accomplished in a few days.From underdogs to overnight sensations. March madmen.Only in the NCAA field due to a technicality, Fairleigh Dickinson, which went 4-22 last season, won a First Four game in Dayton before the Friday night stunning 63-58 win over top-seeded Purdue. It was just the second No. 16 seed win over a No. 1 seed in men's tourney history.The Knights awakened Saturday to a new world.“Life changing,” said FDU forward Sean Moore, who scored 19 points and blocked a layup in the final seconds to help seal the win over Purdue. ""That whole game has changed everybody on our team, staff, students, everybody who goes to Fairleigh Dickinson University.""Everything is different now. Phone has been going crazy, still is.”Same for Anderson, who spent much of his morning doing national TV interviews following an upset that reverberated across the sports world.“I've got, like, 1,200 unanswered texts right now,” he said. “The problem each time I look at my phone it’s more and more. My message, if anybody’s listening, stop texting right now. Give me a chance to catch up.”Using their superior speed and quickness at both ends of the floor to fluster the Big Ten champion Boilermakers, FDU's players brought Purdue 7-foot-4 star center Zach Edey down to their level and advanced in the East Region.On Sunday, the Knights (21-15) will face No. 9 seed Florida Atlantic (32-3), which nipped Memphis 66-65 in the final seconds late Friday night, for a spot in next week's Sweet 16 at Madison Square Garden in New York.That possibility is almost too much for the 51-year-old Anderson to fathom.“I wouldn’t have to fly back to Jersey,” he said. “I could jog back, take off running, be like Forrest Gump or something. That would be incredible.”Incredible may have already happened. FDU's feel-good story seems to have been pulled from a Hollywood movie script.Over the past few days, Anderson, who was born in Iowa, played college ball in Connecticut and started his coaching career bouncing from one small college to another in upstate New York, has referenced “Hoosiers” several times. There are indeed parallels to the famous Indiana high school hoops miracle and what FDU is doing.In May, Anderson took over a program in need of a massive renovation. Just hours after he was hired at Fairleigh Dickinson, he held his first practice and quickly realized the job would require patience along with an influx of talent.He knew just where to find some, convincing four players on his team at St. Thomas Aquinas College, a Division-II power about 15 miles from New York, to join him at FDU.One of them to make the leap was 5-foot-8 guard Demetre Roberts.“Coming out of high school, not having no D-I looks, I didn’t pout,” said Roberts, who had 12 points, four rebounds and four assists against Purdue. “I didn’t sit around and mope all day. I trusted coach. I trusted him all the way and I'm still with him. And five years later, I’m still here.”Not only did Anderson's sales pitch to enroll at FDU work, so did his proposal to the Knights on how to beat Purdue. They took the floor fully confident they could contain Edey despite being outsized, a 23 1/2 point underdog and a statistically deficient team.“We felt we could beat them ever since we were watching film, trying to prepare for them,” said 6-foot-6 center Ansley Almonor, FDU's tallest player. ""We’re all close. We're like brothers. That was just a regular game for us.“We felt we could go out there and beat them, and that’s what we did.”The fact that the Knights are even in the tournament is another twist in their captivating tale. By all rights, they're a No 17 seed.FDU lost the Northeast Conference tournament title game 67-66, but still received the league's automatic bid because champion Merrimack remains ineligible for postseason play after moving up from Division II to Division I.Now, the Knights, who opened the tourney with an easy win over Texas Southern in Dayton, are 40 minutes and one win from being one of the last 16 teams standing.Beating FAU, a team with a similar playing style and swagger to FDU's, will be tall task. But after taking out one of the nation's top players — a literal giant — nothing seems too big for this group.“They’re not huge,” Anderson said of the Owls. ""They’re still bigger than us. Who is not bigger? There’s five guys in the hallway bigger than us. But we’ve got to box out, rebound, be tough, be scrappy.“We'll have to play really, really well, compete our tails off and hope they’re maybe not quite as sharp. That’s just the way it is. And it worked last night. We’re hoping that it will help us tomorrow.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840074,UConn opens March Madness run with 95-52 rout of Vermont,"STORRS, Conn. (AP) — UConn coach Geno Auriemma was a bit concerned about how this group of Huskies might respond to the pressure of the NCAA Tournament.He needn't have worried.Few teams can match the strength and athleticism of Connecticut's front court and Vermont was not one of those teams.Aaliyah Edwards scored a career-high 28 points, Dorka Juhasz added a double-double and the second-seeded Huskies routed the 15th seeded Catamounts 95-52 on Saturday, giving Connecticut a 29th straight win in the tournament's opening round.“From the jump ball I knew personally, individually that I'd be able to dominate inside,” Edwards said. “And I think Dorka held her own too and I think we just flowed together as a team.”Juhasz scored 15 points and pulled down 10 rebounds, the Hungarian's 13th double-double this season for the sixth-ranked Huskies.Caroline Ducharme added 12 points, helping Connecticut (30-5) to its 26th 30-win season during Geno Auriemma’s 38 years as coach.Catherine Gilwee scored 14 points, while Emma Utterback and Maria Myklebust each had 13 for Vermont (25-7), which had its 17-game winning streak snapped.UConn will play No. 7 seed Baylor on Monday. The Bears came back from an 18-point first quarter deficit to beat Alabama 78-74 on Saturday night.This was the fourth straight game the Huskies have had 10 available players, after spending much of the season with just seven.“Having some of the wing players that we have now, when the defense runs back they have to run wide,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “When we didn’t have them, the defense just ran back into the lane. ”Azzi Fudd (five points), who missed 22 games, including the final 14 of the regular season with knee injuries, made her first start since Dec. 4 and scored the first basket on a short jumper from the lane. That started a 7-0 run and the Huskies never trailed.Edwards had 12 of her points in the first 10 minutes as the Huskies led 27-12 after a quarter.UConn took its first 20-point lead at 32-12 and a fast-break layup from Aubrey Griffin made it 48-18. The Huskies shot 67% over the first 20 minutes (62% for the game) and it was 53-20 at halftime.The Huskies extended that to as many as 46 in the second half.BIG PICTUREVermont: The Catamounts last lost on Jan. 1 to UMBC. Vermont's defense had been holding opponents to an average of 52.8 points per game. UConn had 53 at the half.“Seventeen games in a row to get here is pretty hard to do,"" Vermont coach Alisa Kresge said. “There's some really good things that we can take from this game and stuff that we're going to build off to build our program.”UConn: This is UConn’s 34th straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament, where they are now an almost incomprehensible 131-22. The Huskies improve to 22-4 as a No. 2 seed.KEY STATSThe Huskies outscored Vermont 54-10 in the paint, outrebounded the Catamounts 43-19 and had 27 assists on 39 field goals. Nika Muhl had 10 of those.INJURIESUConn’s Lou Lopez Senechal (nine points) left the game with a leg injury in the third quarter. She jogged off the court, but did not return to the game. Griffin, who has been suffering from back spasms, played just 6 1/2 minutes. Auriemma said both sat as a precaution and could have returned.UP NEXT.Vermont: With a young team, coach Alisa Kresge is hoping for more success next season, though she is aware that with the portal, some of her players may be given opportunities at larger schools.“When you make it to the big dance obviously you’re in the spotlight,” she said. “At the end of the day we’re going to stay true to who we are and we take care of people and we give everything to them. If they decide that they need something else, I’ll be their biggest supporter.”UConn: The Huskies haven't lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament since 1992 and will be looking to make a 29th appearance in the Sweet 16. They beat Baylor 69-67 in the 2021 Regional Finals.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840075,"Miami, Xavier look to refocus after narrow 1st-round escapes","GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — If Miami's Jim Larrañaga and Xavier's Sean Miller didn’t have their players’ complete attention heading into the NCAA Tournament, they do now.Larrañaga’s Hurricanes and Miller’s Musketeers both needed huge second-half comebacks against lower-seeded opponents in the first round.Now, as the teams move through March Madness, the veteran coaches are hoping players realize the importance of cherishing every possession on both ends of the floor and avoiding lapses in concentration that can lead to an opponent's run.“You just realize that we’re here and these teams are trying to win as bad as we are, and we’ve got to play our best every night,” Xavier forward Jerome Hunter said.Miami trailed 12th-seeded Drake by eight points with 5:40 remaining in the first round of the Midwest Region, but rallied and finished the game on a 19-1 run behind 21 points from Nijel Pack to win 53-46.Likewise, third-seeded Xavier survived a scare from tournament first-timer Kennesaw State, the 14 seed, after battling back from 13 points down with 9 1/2 minutes to go. The Musketeers needed a game-saving block from 7-foot center Jack Nunge in the final seconds to advance.“I feel like the last 15 minutes really woke us up,” Xavier’s Colby Jones said. “And that’s what we talked about, that’s how we need to play the rest of the tournament.”The Musketeers went through a similar scenario in the Big East Tournament, needing a rally to beat DePaul in the quarterfinals. Xavier beat Creighton in the semis before losing in the title game to Marquette.Xavier meets another upset-minded team in 11th-seeded Pittsburgh, which has already won two tournament games. The Panthers beat Mississippi State in the First Four before shutting down No. 6 seed Iowa State 59-41.“My hope is against Pitt that we can be better and we can be more consistent from start to finish,"" Miller said.Fifth-seeded Miami (26-7) faces Indiana (23-11) on Sunday in Albany, New York, after the fourth-seeded Hoosiers defeated Kent State 71-60 behind an enormous game from All-American Trayce Jackson-Davis.Larrañaga said he has been preaching to his players that anyone can beat anyone — a point driven home when his team watched 16th-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson knock out No. 1 seed Purdue.“I’ve told them that all these games are close, every team is really good,” Larrañaga said. “They checked out all the scores. You see what FDU did and (Florida Atlantic) did, and what Furman did to Virginia. Those crazy things happen, but they happen because the games are so closely contested.“The game is close, and every possession has a lot of value. You’ve got to play great defense and great offense to finish out a really close game,” he added.HOOD-SCHIFINO GROWS UPIndiana coach Mike Woodson went into the season hoping to combine the present and the future for the Hoosiers at the point guard position.Senior Xavier Johnson and freshman Jalen Hood-Schifino would start and the veteran would teach the rookie how to play the point, either by watching or alternating. It worked for 11 games until Johnson sustained a foot injury that required surgery, ending his season.Hood-Schifino inherited the spot.Not only did Hood-Schifino survive in the tough Big Ten Conference, he’s given foes another worry alongside Jackson-Davis, Miller Kopp and Race Thompson.The conference freshman of the year, Hood-Schifino averaged 13.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists.“Basically, we’ve thrown Jalen to the wolves, and he’s kind of handled it, man,” Woodson said. “I mean, he’s been poised. He’s had his ups and downs, man, but for the most part, we are sitting here playing Miami because Jalen Hood-Schifino has had a good freshman season.”MILLER ROYALTYMiller will face his alma mater with a Sweet 16 berth on the line.Miller spent four years as Pitt's starting point guard and assisted on the memorable “Send it in, Jerome!” dunk — a powerful one-handed slam by Jerome Lane that shattered the backboard in a game against Providence.Miller said as great as his memories are of playing for Pitt and growing up in Pennsylvania, he'd like to keep them that way. That's why he has never considered pursuing a head coaching job at Pitt, even though he spent one season there as an assistant 27 years ago.“It never worked out,” Miller said. “I think for me that’s all the better because in some ways I want my memories of Pitt to be when I was there as a student, as player. ... I think it’s simpler that way.”This won't be Miller's first time facing Pitt in the NCAA Tournament.During his first coaching stint at Xavier, the Musketeers they lost to the top-seeded Panthers in the 2009 regional semifinals. Xavier avenged that loss the following season with a second-round win, but Miller had moved on to coach at Arizona. He returned to Xavier last offseason.WHO'S THE FIVE?The country is getting a look at Pitt's literal “twin towers,” freshmen Guillermo and Jorge Diaz Graham. The wiry 7-foot centers from Spain are identical twins and would be nearly impossible to tell apart on the court if not for their jersey numbers.In fact, Pitt coach Jeff Capel still has trouble figuring out who is who.“To be honest with you, I can’t tell them apart,” Capel said. “In practice one of them wears yellow shoes, one of them wears white. Off the court Guillermo has an earring, Jorge doesn’t. And that’s the only way I can tell them apart.”Even teammates have a tough time.“At first it took us some time to figure out which one was which,” Pitt guard Jamarius Burton said. “As we got to know them and be around them more, we’ve been able to pick them apart.”___AP Sports Writer Tom Canavan in Albany, New York, contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

At 41 years and 166 days, Ibrahimovic beat the previous record for oldest scorer held by Alessandro Costacurta, who was 41 years and 25 days when he scored in 2007 — also for Milan with a penalty against Udinese.Having recently returned from knee surgery, Ibrahimovic started for the first time since January of last year.Beto quickly restored Udinese’s advantage from close range in a wild end to the first half, and Ehizibue sealed it midway through the second half.Also, Bologna was held to a 2-2 draw at Salernitana, and Monza and Cremonese drew 1-1. ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840078,Calipari pushing Kentucky to play free in March Madness run,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Kentucky was back in the NCAA Tournament, seeking to move past a stunning exit a year earlier and playing with the expectations that come as one of college basketball’s blueblood programs.Maybe that explained why Antonio Reeves looked over at coach John Calipari after missing a few early shots in the Wildcats’ first-round win.“What did I tell you?” Calipari asked afterward.“Keep shooting,” Reeves answered.“You better keep shooting,” Calipari said.Every coach is dealing with the challenge of managing the mindset of their players alongside the X's and O's while navigating March Madness. But that challenge is particularly acute at Kentucky, which spent a season spent grappling with last March’s loss to No. 15 seed Saint Peter’s, frustration that built through midseason struggles and the overall pressure to win at an elite level — at all times, no exceptions.It's why Calipari has been preaching a play-free mentality and going out of his way to take a positive and encouraging tone throughout the Wildcats' stay in Greensboro for the East Region games. The next comes Sunday against Kansas State for a spot in the Sweet 16.“I want them to have a great experience,” Calipari said Saturday. “Don't listen to anybody try to steal your joy. ... Just go have fun. Let's see where this goes if we have enjoyment. If two teams are enjoying the game and playing well, probably who has the ball last wins.”Sixth-seeded Kentucky (22-11) passed its first NCAA test with Friday’s win against Providence, a performance highlighted by two-time Associated Press All-American Oscar Tshiebwe snaring 25 rebounds in an indomitable performance that marked the biggest output in the tournament since 1977.Yet this trip has been as much about the off-court details for Calipari, a Hall of Famer who won the 2012 NCAA title and is trying to get Kentucky back to its first Final Four since 2015.He has mentioned the good feeling he got from listening to the players' excited chatter amongst themselves during a team meal instead of being silently immersed in reading their cell phones or tuning out the world by putting on headphones.And when Jacob Toppin referenced “relief” from winning that first tournament game, Calipari later circled back to point out the feeling for advancing in the NCAAs should always be joy.This is the vibe that Calipari is trying to inject in his locker room in hopes of unburdening his players from outside expectations. He has empowered Toppin and junior forward Lance Ware as team captains to take on leadership, while Toppin said that has freed Calipari to be even more of a “cheerleader.”Perhaps the steps are working. At minimum, his players are listening.“I feel like we’re doing a better job now because obviously it’s win or go home,” Toppin said, “and we play our best basketball when we’re not thinking, when we're just playing loose and free.”It's a welcome sign for the Wildcats after an at-times bumpy season. Kentucky started ranked No. 4 in the AP Top 25, but opened 10-6 — including some frustrated grumbling from Tshiebwe in January and angst from a a rabid fan base — and fell out of the poll by early January.Kentucky returned to the poll later in the season and won 11 of 15 games to close the Southeastern Conference schedule before a one-and-done showing in the SEC Tournament by losing to Vanderbilt.As Ware put it: “We went through the ringer already.”“You may say it’s only a game,” Calipari said. “Put yourself in their shoes. Be 18, 19 years old and read the stuff on social media that is so nasty, it’s ridiculous. ... None of you in here dealt with that stuff, but they have.”That's where Calipari's “cheerleader” comes in. Reeves pointed to Calipari's message after those early misses against Providence as the springboard for the senior on the way to 22 points with five 3-pointers.“It just helps a lot, the coaches believing in you, the players believing in you,” Reeves said. “That's all you really need when you're a basketball player.”It worked for one night. The Providence win marked not only a chance to move past the Saint Peter's upset, but it also marked the program's first win in the NCAA Tournament since reaching the Elite Eight in 2019.Now it’s about carrying it forward. If they can, the Wildcats might be sticking around a while.“We’ve got more confidence and we know we’ve got to stay together,” Tshiebwe said. “We’ve got to get enough sleep, stay away from phones, stay away from social media, stay locked in. That’s my mentality right now.”___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840079,"Zags, Saint Mary's keep West Coast Conference front & center","DENVER (AP) — It's no secret that bigger conferences are always looking at Gonzaga, and that Gonzaga has been looking at them, too.But the Zags, for the time being, are still in the West Coast Conference. Contrary to what some analytics and big-conference biases might suggest, it has done nothing to hold them back.For the second straight year — and third since 2017 — Gonzaga's toughest competition in the WCC is also in the second round at the NCAA Tournament. That team is Saint Mary's, which is a No. 5 seed for the second straight year and which actually went into the conference tournament earlier this month as the top seed thanks to a split of the regular-season matchups with the Bulldogs.In a pair of West Region contests with trips to the Sweet 16 at stake on Sunday, Saint Mary's faces UConn of the Big East, while third-seeded Gonzaga plays TCU of the Big 12.A decade or two ago, these games might've been viewed as chances for the little guy to strike a blow against big schools from big conferences. Nobody has mistaken Gonzaga for a little guy in a while, though. Saint Mary's, meanwhile, is a 3 1/2-point underdog according to FanDuel Sportsbook against the Huskies, who have three national titles to their credit since 1999. The Gaels came into the tournament ranked 11th in the NET rankings, only three spots behind UConn.“That’s a question I answer all the time in recruiting,” Gaels coach Randy Bennett said of the mid-major tag. “It’s your program. Like, you may be in a mid-major league, but it’s your program.”Bennett says mid-major programs with mid-major resources and mid-major aspirations usually end up as just that — mid-majors. But teams that do big-school things, such as chartering flights, and working (and sometimes paying) to build a tough nonconference schedule, can rise beyond that.It's a formula Gonzaga has been perfecting over a quarter-century. The Bulldogs haven't missed an NCAA Tournament since 1998. Along that road, they've been to the national final twice, been seeded No. 1 five times and have rid themselves of the underdog label.They've become such an attractive program that the Big East (starting in 2012 and continuing sporadically ever since) and Big 12 (more recently) have both made inquiries about the Zags joining them, even though they don't have a football program.It's a possibility any school with as strong a basketball program as Gonzaga has to at least consider, with yet another round of conference realignment upending college sports.Athletic director Chris Standiford said he spends time exploring possible moves because the realities of college sports demand that schools bring in enough revenue to compete at the highest level.“In the West Coast Conference, with success, you can have that contribution, but you always have to be assessing the balance between” revenue and staying true to your roots, Standiford said.Gonzaga, at least so far, has held that off, in part because the travel commitments and the overall feel of the big conferences haven't quite meshed with the private, 7,200-student Jesuit school in Spokane, Washington.But if Gonzaga does go, nobody will forget where it built its reputation.The competition in the WCC has not proven to be a hindrance to its postseason success, the way many skeptics thought it might. This season, Santa Clara made its second straight appearance in the NIT and Loyola Marymount won 19 games, one of which was at Gonzaga and snapped the program's 75-game home winning streak. BYU, a longtime factor in hoops, will end its 12-year stay in the WCC after this season for a move to the Big 12.Saint Mary's has been in four of the last five March Madness brackets.“The WCC has been great for us because it hasn't gotten in our way,” coach Mark Few said. “The best thing we've done over the years is — even back to ’99 — we wanted to stay in growth mode. We did not want to just be a one-hit wonder.”These days, Gonzaga has no problem getting regular-season games against the Baylors and Purdues of the world. Saint Mary's scheduled Houston, San Diego State and Vanderbilt this year. In between those games and March Madness, the WCC rivals played each other three times. After their first-round games earlier this week, a pair of double-digit wins, nobody was saying they weren't ready for the big time.“They push us for sure, but we push them, too,” Saint Mary's guard Logan Johnson said. “They tell us all the time that we’re the toughest team they play. We get the respect from them, and we also give the respect to them because of what they’ve done in the past.”___AP College Sports Writer Ralph D.

I watched that game against South Carolina,” Brooks said. “They’re not afraid of the moment. They’re not afraid of whoever they’re playing. I watched them play against Louisville in the Bahamas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840082,"Schenk's late birdie gives him lead over Spieth, Fleetwood","PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) — Adam Schenk looked as though he and everyone else would get passed by Jordan Spieth on Saturday at the Valspar Championship. When a wild and windy round finished, Schenk was still the player everyone was chasing.Schenk hit his approach to the 18th hole to 5 feet and made the birdie putt for a 1-under 70, giving him a one-shot lead over Spieth and Tommy Fleetwood as he goes after his first victory on the PGA Tour.“We didn't have a ton go our way until the very end,” Schenk said.Neither did Fleetwood, who opened with a birdie and followed with 12 straight pars. He wound up with a bogey-free 69 and realized not losing ground was one of the best things he had going on the Copperhead course at Innisbrook.Spieth, however, is who dictated the action.He had a 69 and had to decide when it was over whether that was a good score on account of all the mistakes he made or a wasted chance to separate himself from the field. Spieth opened with a 6-iron to 7 feet for eagle. He led by as many as two shots.But he made only three pars over his final 12 holes — on four of those occasions, he followed a bogey with a birdie. But that ended on the 18th when he hit a tree on his drive, went into a front bunker and then blasted by the pin to the collar for a final bogey.“I didn't have my best stuff in the approach game, but overall I'm in a good spot for tomorrow,” Spieth said.Schenk was at 8-under 205 and will play in the final group with Spieth, whose game appears to be rounding into form with the Masters on the horizon.Schenk is playing his 10th week in a row because his wife, Courtney, is expecting their first child at the end of April. He also is entered in the field next week in the Dominican Republic, though a victory could change everything.That feels a long way off.Eight players were within three shots of the lead. Webb Simpson had a 68 that included a bogey on the par-5 14th when he hit into the water while trying to lay up. He was two shots behind, along with Taylor Moore (69) and Cody Gribble (70), who had short birdie putts on the 16th and 17th hole and narrowly missed a 20-footer in his bid to birdie all three holes as part of the “Snake Pit"" on the Copperhead course.Patton Kizzire had a 67 and posted early, not sure where that would leave him. Spieth had a lot to do with that and he wound up keeping everyone close.“Eventful,” is how Spieth described his round.He missed a 5-foot par putt on No. 7. He hit 6-iron to 12 feet for birdie on No. 8. He missed a 7-foot par putt on the 10th, and then hit a bunker shot that landed in the collar and bounced out to 3 feet for birdie on the par-5 11th.Spieth followed a three-putt bogey on the 13th with a 3-wood to 35 feet for a two-putt birdie on the 14th. It was like that throughout the back nine, and Spieth looked to have settled down with a 10-foot par putt on the 17th, only to send his tee shot into the trees on 18.“I made a few too many mistakes, but overall in these conditions, I think I would have signed for 2 under,” Spieth said.The weather was as wild as his round, gusting to 20 mph and shifting to an entirely different direction as the final groups were on the back nine. Players were hitting 9-iron into the par-3 17th earlier in the round, and Gribble had to hit 5-iron late in the day.Rain that was expected never arrived, though Innisbrook was expecting showers overnight that could put a premium on scoring.Fleetwood was the steadiest of the bunch. He made birdie on the par-5 opening hole and the par-5 14th, and was had a collection of big par putts to keep some momentum.“I kept plugging away,” Fleetwood said. “Pars were good. Birdies were hard to come by. The middle stretch the par saves on 9 and 10 were good putts to hole. I never went backward. I was very happy with anything par or better.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

In the end it took 44 songs and just over three hours for her to span her 17-year career.Having not toured for her previous three albums, this concert series is intended to play catchup by providing the live debut of many of those songs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840085,Michigan-LSU clash means Kim vs. Kim III in March Madness,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — LSU coach Kim Mulkey's admiration for the effort that Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico extracts from her players was encapsulated in short a video clip that Mulkey thought the Tigers needed to see.Michigan guard Leigha Brown's diving attempt to corral a loose ball on the hardwood in the Wolverines' first-round women's NCAA Tournament triumph over UNLV meant nothing on the stat sheet; Brown wasn't able to prevent the ball from rolling out of bounds.But it meant plenty to Mulkey and Barnes Arico as they prepared for a second-round tilt between No. 3 seed LSU (29-2) and sixth-seeded Michigan (23-9) on Sunday night — a game that could be billed as “Kim vs. Kim III.”“I’m happy that, you know, they saw, and the rest of the world saw, that our team is willing to sell out and willing to sacrifice and make those type of plays, because we do believe those could be difference-makers,” Barnes Arico said after learning that Mulkey had highlighted Brown's dive while LSU reviewed video of Michigan game action. “LSU and Kim-coached teams, they will play the same way. And our kids will know that. And they will be aware of that.”LSU guard Alexis Morris got the message when Mulkey played the Brown clip.“We know we've just got to have a certain toughness about ourselves on Sunday,"" Morris said. “We've got to get those 50-50 balls — you know, do the dirty work that people don't like to do.”Barnes Arico knows what it's like to go up against Mulkey because she's done so twice before in the previous four NCAA Tournaments — in 2018 and 2021, when Mulkey was at Baylor.Baylor won the first of those meetings, 80-58, in the second round. Their third-round meeting in 2021 went to overtime before the Bears emerged with a 78-75 victory.Several Michigan senior leaders — Brown, Emily Kiser and Maddie Nolan — played in that 2021 meeting, and Brown recalled Mulkey complimenting the Wolverines on how hard they played.“That really meant a lot to us and I know that definitely means a lot to coach Arico,” Brown said. “I do know there’s a mutual respect.”Mulkey summed up her appreciation for Barnes Arico this way: “She's one of the good ones. Good coach. Good person. A good mother. Good wife. I hate that we have to play each other.”POST PARTNERSMuch of LSU's success this season has hinged on the prolific play of 6-foot-3 All-America power forward Angel Reese, whose combination of height, quickness, and ball skill make her one of the nation's most dynamic players.Her 34 points — which tied Marie Ferdinand's 2001 LSU record for scoring in an NCAA Tournament game — and 15 rebounds led LSU to a first-round 73-50 victory over Hawaii.But Reese emphasized that her chemistry with 6-4 center LaDazhia Williams — whose quiet demeanor stands in contrast to that of the outspoken and expressive Reese — is a key element to LSU's usual dominance in the paint.“People underestimate LaDazhia's skill because the light is kind of shined on me a lot,"" Reese said. “But, I mean, she's very successful and does a lot of great things that people don't see.”Reese, a transfer from Maryland, and Williams, who transferred from Missouri, said they spent a lot of time last summer developing chemistry by playing pick-up basketball.“We know how to throw each other the ball,"" Reese said. ""We know how to get each other good shots.”STYLE QUESTIONSBarnes-Arico laughed when asked whether she had an outfit planned for the matchup against Mulkey, who is known for wearing high heels and flashy outfits.“Oh my gosh,"" Barnes Arico began. “I can’t keep that pace. I don’t know how she does it.”During Friday's first round games, Mulkey wore a white top with glitter-laden, multi colored trim. The front of the top read, “Kiss me, I'm a Queen,” which Mulkey clarified was a reference not to her, but the name of the company (Queen of Sparkles) that made the outfit.Barnes Arico wore a dark blue crew neck emblazoned with Michigan's trademark “M” on the chest and maize pants, with comfortable (Jordan Brand) shoes.Barnes Arico used to wear heels and dress up more for games.“And then COVID hit and I’m like, ‘Oh my goodness, my feet feel so good and my legs aren’t screaming at the end of the night. I don’t wake up with pain in my calves anymore,'” Barnes Arico recalled.But she did concede she had “something special” planned for the second-round game.“I’m not going to be Kim. No one is Kim. I’m the other Kim,” she continued. “But no one is Mulkey. So, she has her own look and it works for her.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

The Serb, a five-time champion in Indian Wells, withdrew before the tournament began after he wasn't allowed to enter the U.S. because he is unvaccinated against COVID-19.Alcaraz and the 11th-seeded Sinner had split their four previous meetings, with Alcaraz winning both matches on hard courts.“Jannik is a great player, and he pushes me to improve and makes me play at a high level,” Alcaraz said. “I’m really happy with the level that I played, and the way that I overcome the problem, I saved one set point in the first set.”Alcaraz never faced a break point against Sinner, who only made 48% of his first serves and 19 of 36 points on serve in the second set. He trailed 3-0 in the second set.“I didn’t serve well today, which made the biggest difference,” Sinner said. ""The baseline rallies I felt okay, I had my chances, especially first set. But he played the important points better than me today, so he deserved to win.”Alacarz had 28 winners and 14 unforced errors.Medvedev, the fifth seed, has dominated Tiafoe, winning all five of their career meetings, including 12 of 13 sets in the process.But the 14th-seeded American put up a valiant fight, saving seven match points in the second set before succumbing.“If I didn’t win this match, I think I would have nightmares for a very long time. I would not sleep well tonight and a few nights more,” Medvedev said on court.Tiafoe regularly charged the net to counter Medvedev's power baseline game. He saved three break points and stayed on serve until the 11th game of the first set. But Medvedev had a net-cord forehand winner to go up 6-5 and then served out the set.Tiafoe saved three match points while serving down 5-3 in the second. Medvedev piled up four more match points while serving for the match leading 6-5, but couldn't cash in until the tiebreaker.“That makes me even happier mentally that I still managed to win,” Medvedev said, “because try playing a tiebreak when you just lost seven match points. I managed to start it well straightaway doing great shots and great rallies.”Medvedev had 30 winners and just nine unforced errors.Medvedev's 19-match winning streak dates to his title run in Rotterdam in February. He then won tournaments in Doha and Dubai. Now, the 2021 U.S. Open champion and former world No. 1 is in position to add another one.Medvedev has proven resilient during the 12-day tournament in the Southern California desert. He overcame a badly twisted ankle and a cut thumb in two straight matches to power through to the final.Rohan Boponna of India and Matt Ebden of Australia defeated top-seeded Wesley Koolhof of the Netherlands and Neil Skupski of Britain 6-3, 2-6, 10-8 to win the men's doubles title.Boponna, who is 43, won his fifth Masters 1000 doubles title and first since 2017. He and Ebden, who is 35, were in their third final of the year.Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova won the women’s doubles title with a 6-1, 6-7 (3), 10-7 victory over Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil and Laura Siegemund of Germany.The Czech duo improved to 11-0 this year, having won the Australian Open championship in January.They men's and women's doubles winner each split $436,730 in prize money.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840088,Evander Kane's hat trick lifts Oilers past Kraken 6-4,"SEATTLE (AP) — Evander Kane needed just three shots to show the Edmonton Oilers can be more than just Connor McDavid. And the timing couldn't be better with the playoffs on the horizon.Kane recorded his second hat trick of the season and the Oilers gained some cushion in the Western Conference playoff chase with a 6-4 win over the Seattle Kraken on Saturday.Kane capped the sixth three-goal game of his career by scoring on an odd-man rush with 9:40 remaining just after a power play for Seattle ended. Kane also scored Edmonton’s first goal less than two minutes into the game, and his second goal came 43 seconds into the second period.“That’s part of my job is to be productive for this group,"" said Kane, who has played in just 29 games due to injuries. ""Obviously we have two of the best players in the world, but they can’t carry a team and win a championship. You need everyone pulling their weight.”McDavid still did his part with a goal and two assists, giving him 134 points for the season — the seventh-most points by any player in the past 30 years. McDavid scored his 58th goal of the season on a power play with 3:50 remaining.McDavid recorded his 20th three-point game of the season, the first player to reach that mark since both Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr did it in the 1995-96 season.The victory moved Edmonton three points ahead of Seattle for the final automatic playoff spot from the Pacific Division. Edmonton has one less game remaining than Seattle, but the Oilers gained the upper hand in the final matchup of the regular season between the teams.“It's really big. Every game down the stretch right now is huge for us,” said Edmonton's Kailer Yamamoto, who scored his ninth goal of the season in the first period. “We need to keep chipping away and keep finding ways to get these W's.”Zach Hyman scored his 30th of the season and Leon Draisaitl had three assists, giving him 104 points on the season. Stuart Skinner made 33 saves for Edmonton.Jaden Schwartz, Jordan Eberle, Oliver Bjorkstrand and Eeli Tolvanen all scored for Seattle, but the Kraken lost for the sixth time in their past seven home games. Vince Dunn extended his points streak to 12 games when he assisted on Seattle’s first goal that was tipped in by Schwartz. The goal was originally credited to Dunn, but later changed to Schwartz.“Obviously this is frustrating. You see the standings and where we're at,” Eberle said. “Obviously we're fighting until the end. It's a big road trip for us coming up.”Seattle's Philipp Grubauer made seven saves, but left with 13:30 left in the second period and immediately went down the tunnel to Seattle’s locker room. Martin Jones replaced Grubauer and the first shot he faced found the back of the net when Hyman collected a pass from McDavid and flicked a wrist shot over Jones’ blocker.Seattle announced Grubauer left due to a non-COVID illness. Jones made 10 saves.“It's a disappointing outcome. Our team played hard, our team played well,"" Seattle coach Dave Hakstol said. ""We had to play a little too much from behind.”NOTES: Kane had his first game with multiple goals since returning from wrist surgery after suffering a cut on the wrist by a skate blade Nov. 8 at Tampa Bay. He missed 31 games recovering from the surgery and had scored five goals in the 14 games played since he returned. ... Seattle F John Hayden went limping to the locker room with 7:45 left in the second period after a fight with Klim Kostin. Hayden fell awkwardly on his right leg during the fight.

The team didn't announce terms, but Thomas' new contract is worth $3.9 million, according to reports.Thomas will help offset the losses of defensive linemen Sheldon Rankins (Texans) and Nathan Shepherd (Saints), who signed elsewhere this week as free agents.Thomas was the No. 3 overall pick of San Francisco in 2017 out of Stanford. He had six sacks in four years with the 49ers, with his 2020 season limited to two games after tearing an ACL in a game against the Jets. Thomas signed with Las Vegas the following offseason and had a career-high 3 1/2 sacks before joining the Jets.In 82 NFL games, including 30 starts, Thomas has 10 sacks, 39 quarterback hits and 21 tackles for loss.Thomas, who's heavily involved in charity work off the field, was the Jets' nominee for the Walter Payton Award last season.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/19,,World

He also was stripped of his Nicaraguan citizenship.Francis has largely stayed out of the row, but last week he referred to Ortega's government as a ""rude dictatorship"" comparable to Hitler's, led by an ""unbalanced"" president. The pope was responding to Alcarez's sentencing.In reaction, the government proposed suspending relations with the Holy See.Last year, it forced the papal ambassador at the time to leave the country.It's not clear what more the closure would entail in diplomatic terms.The embassy has been entrusted to the Italian government, according to Vatican News.The US and the European Union have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Ortega and his relatives due to his government's erosion of democracy and civil rights.Ortega expelled the EU's ambassador to the country after she called for a return to democracy.mm/sms (AP, AFP, dpa)",2023/3/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840092,Siegrist powers Villanova past Cleveland St in March Madness,"VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) — Maddy Siegrist had a packed Villanova house rocking, another fallen foe reeling, and a simple reason why perhaps — and really, there is no doubt — the greatest player in program history seemingly keeps racking up milestones in the most clutch moments with ease.“It's hard to guard a moving target as Coach always says,” she said.Now, Siegrist has Villanova moving on as March Madness contenders.Siegrist became the fifth women’s player in NCAA history to score 1,000 points in a season and the first-team AP All-American had 35 points to lead fourth-seeded Villanova into the NCAA Tournament’s second round with a 76-59 win Saturday over Cleveland State.The Wildcats (29-6) will play No. 12-seed Florida Gulf Coast (33-3) on Monday for the right to advance to the Sweet 16. The Eagles topped Washington State 74-63 in Saturday's first game.Villanova's 29 wins this season tie the 1981-82 team for most in program history.The two-time Big East Player of the Year, Siegrist got hot early and reached her milestone 1,000th-point bucket in style. Siegrist followed her shot after she missed a jumper from the elbow, crashed the boards and stripped the ball from a Cleveland State defender that had grabbed the rebound. She tossed up a fadeaway and banked in the bucket .She pounded her fist in the air looking for the and-1 and got it. Siegrist sank the free throw for point No. 1,001 in the 2022-2023 season and gave Villanova a 34-16 lead.Villanova fell just shy of a sellout at the Pavilion but more than 6,000 fans roared for Siegrist — whose No. 20 jerseys sold in the team store for $120 a pop — on the bucket. When the 1,000-point milestone was announced to the crowd later in the game, she received a standing ovation. She finished 15 of 28 from the field.“You can't stop her,” Kielsmeier said. “Anyone who thinks they can is wasting too much time trying to throw too much at her because she's that good.”Siegrist has more records, firsts and memorable milestones that most players can ever dream of reaching. Hitting 1,000 points, though, was never on her to-do list.“I never thought it was an achievable goal,” Siegrist said. “I’m really glad we won the game. It’s better when you win and get the milestone.Yes, Siegrist at one point had 31 points while the Vikings (30-5) scored just 32. But this was no one-scorer's show for the Wildcats. In fact, the Pavilion was never at its loudest than when Bella Runyan buried a 3 for a 37-15 lead and she went into a timeout with her signature braided ponytail bouncing behind her. She hit three 3s overall and scored 13 points.“Bella's like an X-factor for us,” coach Denise Dillon said. “Today, it was finding open spots and taking the shots.""The Wildcats were 16-of-38 from the field and 6-of-15 on 3-pointers in the first half for a 42-21 lead. No wonder President Joe Biden picked the Wildcats i n his bracket to win the national championship.Destiny Leo scored 25 points for the Horizon League Tournament champion Vikings.The two home games will serve as a raucous farewell for Siegrist after the Poughkeepsie, New York native absolutely sliced up the Villanova and NCAA record books. She entered the game leading the nation in scoring (28.9 points), has scored 20-plus points in all 35 games, and scored a career-best 50 points against Seton Hall. She's also the career leading scorer in Philadelphia women’s Division I history, as well.She’s already the career leading scorer for men and women in Big East regular-season games and she’s Villanova’s career leading scorer counting the men’s and women’s teams.Siegrist also set Villanova's tournament single-game scoring record on Saturday and led the Wildcats to their first March Madness win at the Pavilion (1-2).She has one more in sight.BIG PICTURECleveland State: The Vikings played in their first NCAA Tournament since 2010 and fell to 0-3 overall in the tourney. They also lost in 2009. But Cleveland State had never played higher than a 15 seed in March Madness.“We didn’t handle the moment quite as well as I had hoped,” Kielsmeier said.Villanova: Dillon improved to 2-2 in the NCAA Tournament and led the Wildcats to their 23rd home win in their last 25 games. The Wildcats are 32-7 at home in three seasons under Dillon.CAN I HAVE THAT?Kielsmeier didn't leave the dais before he snagged his March Madness placard — and asked for the rest for his team.“These kids with their mementos,” Kielsmeier cracked.UP NEXTRunyan is the daughter of former Philadelphia Eagles great Jon Runyan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840093,"California, drugmaker partner to produce affordable insulin","DOWNEY, Calif. (AP) — The state of California and a generic drug manufacturer announced a 10-year partnership Saturday to produce affordable, state-branded insulin that they hope will rival longtime producers and push down prices for a medication used by millions of Americans.The product is not expected on store shelves until at least next year, and it was difficult to predict what effect it would have on a market already shaken by change. Earlier this week another major insulin maker promised steep price cuts as pressure builds on drugmakers and insurers to slash the cost of the drug.Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he hoped California’s emergence as an insulin-maker would prompt prices to collapse. Research has shown that prices for the drug have more than tripled in the past couple of decades.“We are intent to make this about market disruption,” Newsom said at a ceremony announcing the pact at a pharmaceutical warehouse near Los Angeles. He called it “a game changer” for 8 million Americans who use insulin to treat diabetes.Many questions remain. The state and its partner, the nonprofit Civica, have yet to locate a California-based manufacturing facility. Regulatory approvals will be needed. Newsom said a 10- milliliter vial of the state-branded insulin would sell for $30, but it's possible competitors could slash their prices and undercut the state product.“Is this perfect? We don't know yet,” Newsom acknowledged at one point.Just days ago, President Joe Biden said his administration is focused “intensely” on lowering health care costs, including pressuring pharmaceutical companies to lower the costs of insulin. Legislation enacted last year capped copayments for insulin at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries. Biden has proposed extending that cap to all Americans.Novo Nordisk said Tuesday that it will slash some of its U.S. insulin prices up to 75% starting next year. The announcement comes less than two weeks after rival Eli Lilly said it will drop some of its prices by 70% or more later this year.Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a statewide consumer health care advocacy group, welcomed Newsom's announcement, saying efforts by California and others to develop a competing generic are likely a factor in getting insulin manufacturers to cut their prices.Still, there are obstacles.“The work to develop a generic, get FDA approval and set up manufacturing will take real time,” Wright said in an email. “There may even be more time in the effort to get doctors to prescribe the drug, insurers and (pharmacy benefit managers) to include it on their formularies and patients and the public to accept and ask for it.”There could be other risks. State analysts have warned that California's entry into the market could prompt other manufacturers to reduce the availability of their drugs, a potential unintended consequence.State lawmakers approved $100 million for the project last year, with $50 million dedicated to developing three types of insulin and the rest set aside to invest in a manufacturing facility.Even with the challenges of entering a competitive, established market, Newsom said taxpayers would have “very ample protections.”If for whatever reason the deal didn't work out to the state's benefit, “there’s all kinds of provisions that would allow us to ... pull out,” he said.According to state documents, the proposed program could save many patients between $2,000 and $4,000 a year. In addition, lower costs could result in substantial savings because the state buys the product every year for the millions of people on its publicly funded health plans.The state also is exploring the possibility of bringing other drugs to market, including the overdose medication Naloxone. The drug, available as a nasal spray and in an injectable form, is considered a key tool in the battle against a nationwide overdose crisis.“We are not stopping here,” Newsom said.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840094,Clark: Rules changes would be smoother with player input,"MIAMI (AP) — Union head Tony Clark claims Major League Baseball's rules changes would have gone more smoothly during spring training if player thoughts had been incorporated.MLB implemented its first pitch clock, limited defensive shifts and pickoff attempts and installed larger bases as part of the biggest alteration in playing rules since the mound was lowered for the 1969 season.“My hope despite the fact that nearly all of the things that we have seen that would otherwise be characterized as challenges could have been avoided with the input that the players offered when these rules were being constructed,"" Clark said Saturday before the United States played Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic quarterfinals.“My hope is that moving forward that the league continues to take the input of players to heart, such that each of the adjustments that we’ve seen that have been implemented this year are of benefit in the long run,” Clark said.The average time of spring training games has dropped to 2 hours, 36 minutes, from 3:00 last year. The changes have had almost no impact on offense, with runs per game rising to 10.7 from 10.6 and batting average to .260 from .259.Stolen bases have gone up to 1.8 per game from 1.1.“Spring training is spring training,” Clark said. “I appreciate everyone focusing on spring training game times have been shortened by `X' number of minutes. I appreciate everyone’s focus on it. But when the lights come on and these count, count for the managers, count for the organizations, count for the players, we’ll see how all of these moving pieces come together.""After the Mets' Max Scherzer timed the pitch clock to throw a quick pitch to Washington's Riley Adams on March 3, MLB reminded teams that a pitcher must wait until a hitter is reasonably set in the batter's box to deliver a pitch.Baseball's 11-man competition committee, established in the labor agreement last March, adopted the pitch clock and shift limits last September over the opposition of the four players on the panel.Saying it was responding to player concerns, MLB set the pitch clock at 15 seconds with no runners and 20 seconds with runners, up from 14/19 at Triple-A and 14/18 in the rest of the minors.MLB also liberalized its planned limit for pickoff attempts, known as disengagements. In the minors, a pitcher had two pickoff attempts per plate appearance and a third would result in a balk unless there was an out. In the majors the limit resets if a runner advances.MLB umpires also have permission to provide additional time if warranted, such as the catcher making the final out of a half-inning. MLB altered limits on mound visits, which started in 2018, adding an allowed trip in the ninth inning if a team has exhausted its total by the end of the eighth.This is the fifth edition of the World Baseball Classic, started in 2006, and the first since 2017 following a delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic. There seems to be little support for holding WBCs more frequently.“Having it happen as perhaps infrequently as we do offers a certain level of excitement around the event akin to what you often see with the Olympics every four years, as well,” Clark said.He was not concerned that the U.S. team has been given more limits on pitcher use than other nations.“Each federation and each country against the backdrop of when their season starts and how that federation works have their applicable guidelines for participation for their players,” he said. “Ours may be a little different than some others.”Clark also said it was feasible to reach an agreement on a collective bargaining agreement for minor leaguers by opening day on March 31.“A lot of progress has been made,” he said. “We'll see if we're able to get it across the finish line before opening day.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840095,Tough defense fueling Princeton's NCAA Tournament success,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Princeton is traveling on a familiar road.For a second straight season, the 10th seeded Tigers are in the second round of the NCAA Tournament as a double-digit seed. When Princeton faces second-seeded Utah in Salt Lake City on Sunday, a shot at reaching the Sweet 16 for the first time in school history is on the line.Some things changed for Princeton (24-5) from last season to set up this year’s success. The Tigers overcame an 0-2 start in Ivy League play and navigated a tough nonconference schedule featuring losses to UConn, Texas and Villanova.“We have had a lot of growing to do this year,” Princeton guard Grace Stone said.The Tigers erased an eight-point deficit by holding NC State without a point over the final 5:44 in their 64-63 win over the Wolfpack in the first round. It underscored the toughness of Princeton’s defense, which allowed only 52.5 points per game in the regular season – ranking fifth nationally.“There’s some players that just don’t really care about that end of the floor and only care about offense,” Princeton coach Carla Berube said. “But I have a group that truly cares and loves just getting stops and what it can do to offenses and players when you can frustrate them.""Utah (26-4) underwent its own defensive evolution to earn a shot at going to the Sweet 16.The Utes made a name for themselves with an explosive and efficient offense during the regular season season. They led the Pac-12 in scoring offense (83.5 ppg) and field goal percentage (48.5%). But Utah also held opponents to 65.9 points per game, showing a marked improvement on the defensive side of things from last season.“The teams that make a great run in March are known for their defense as well as their offense,” Utah guard Kennady McQueen said. “You can’t just play one side and we know the importance of that.”The Utes made getting stronger on defense an offseason focus and it has showed off in their ability to disrupt passing lanes and control the glass throughout the season.“We worked on it a lot differently, a lot more intentionally and then, strategically, we made some changes too of how we’re going to defend,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said. “You got to figure out what fits your personnel and so that’s what we did.”SECOND ROUND REDEMPTIONBoth Utah and Princeton are looking to bounce back from disappointing second-round exits in last year’s NCAA Tournament.The Tigers fell to Indiana by one point after upsetting Kentucky in the first round. The Utes got blasted by Texas following a comfortable first-round win over Arkansas. Both schools made finishing unfinished business from last season a primary goal for this year.“Our goal since this summer when we all came back was to make it to the Sweet 16 and fill in that empty circle in our gym,” McQueen said. “Just to have the chance and be one win away from that is a huge, huge deal.”PASSING THREATUtah's Alissa Pili is not just a proficient scorer. Pili is also an underrated talent as a passer out of the post. She dished out a career-high eight assists in a 103-77 victory over Gardner-Webb on Friday. It marked the ninth game this season where Pili has tallied three or more assists in a game.Her ability to kick out to shooters makes Pili that much harder to defend around the basket.“She kind of is the straw that stirs the drink for us right now,” Roberts said.IVY CLIMBINGPrinceton’s victory on Friday made a little bit of history for the Ivy League. It marked the first time that Ivy League teams won first-round games in both the men’s and women’s NCAA Tournaments in the same season.Princeton was also responsible for the victory on the men’s side. The 15th-seeded Tigers knocked off second-seeded Arizona 59-55 in the first round of the men's tournament on Thursday.“I think people are starting to realize that the Ivy League can be really competitive with other bigger name schools,” Princeton guard Kaitlyn Chen said. “It’s really exciting to be able to play in a conference like that.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

(AP) — Austin Hill continued his dominant start to the NASCAR Xfinity season, holding off Daniel Hemric at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Saturday night for his third win in five races.Hill overcome a record-setting day of cautions in doubleheader Xfinity and truck series races. There were 11 cautions, the most for an Xfinity race in Atlanta, knocking out 12 drivers.Hill previously collected Xfinity wins at Daytona on Feb. 18 to open the season and at Las Vegas on March 4. Hill, a native of Winston, Georgia, added a home-track win to his strong start for the Richard Childress Racing team.The final caution came with eight laps remaining and Hill holding a slim lead over Parker Kligerman in a battle of Chevrolets. The race resumed with two laps remaining and Hill held on as Kligerman wrecked before the finish line and finished fourth. Ryan Truex was third.“I knew I had it when I came across the line,” Hill said. “Before that I had no idea.”The chaos near the finish line threatened to take the win from Hill.“I have no idea how I saved it at the line,” Hill said. “I got hit in the right rear.”One of the cautions led a frustrated Josh Williams to make an unusual exit in the first stage, leaving his car parked on the start-finish line for dramatic effect.Four cautions in the first stage covered 26 of 40 laps, including a final yellow after debris came off Williams' No. 92 Chevrolet and he was ordered by NASCAR to park his vehicle.A frustrated Williams followed, but on his terms. He parked his car on the checkered start-finish line, climbed out and walked toward his pit crew with a wave to the fans, apparently delivered with sarcasm.Before exiting his car, Williams angrily complained to his crew on his radio it was “apparently” NASCAR regulations to park your vehicle following a wreck “of any kind.” Added Williams: “This is some bull you know what. I've never heard of this in my life.”Williams was taken to the infield care center and then escorted to his team hauler without speaking to reporters.There were 11 cautions, also an Atlanta record, in Christian Eckes' second career truck series win earlier Saturday.The first caution in the Xfinity race came out on only the second lap following a collision between Ceasar Bacarella and Joey Gase. The second caution followed only 10 laps later, and more slowdowns followed, including a crash by Justin Allgaier that ended the second stage.“I'm kind of embarrassed by our sport right now just because of the way this has gone,” Allgaier said, adding “it's just a shame” to have so many cautions.UP NEXTThe series moves to Austin, Texas, next Saturday at Circuit of the Americas.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840099,Arkansas ousts defending champ Kansas from March Madness,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Eric Musselman and his players rushed across the floor at the final buzzer to celebrate with their joyfully delirious friends from Arkansas.The 58-year-old coach jumped onto the press table, ripped off his red polo shirt and waved it over his head, shouting all the while to the fans' delight, as has become his tradition after the biggest of his wins.And this was a really big one.Kansas' national title defense ended in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Saturday when Arkansas' Ricky Council IV made five free throws in the closing seconds and the eighth-seeded Razorbacks beat the No. 1 seed Jayhawks 72-71.“I would love to lie and say that I felt composed, but we only led for 1:43,” he said. “This has been as challenging and as up-and-down a season as I’ve ever been a part of.""For these guys to be rewarded for sticking with it and being able to go to Las Vegas and participate with only 16 teams still standing. ... It’s really hard to make this tournament. It's really hard to win a game in this tournament. It’s really hard to beat defending champions, No. 1 seed. We did it.”Arkansas was playing a No. 1 seed for the third straight year. Last year, the Razorbacks knocked out Gonzaga on the way to their second straight Elite Eight. This time, the Razorbacks survived shaky offensive play early and foul trouble late. They became the first team to beat a No. 1 seed with three players fouling out, according to OptaSTATS.“That’s such an unbelievable win for our program,” Musselman said. “I keep telling people that we’re getting better. Not many teams can get better this time of year. I’ve never been prouder of a team like tonight.”Davonte Davis scored 25 points and Council added 21 as Arkansas rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit. Kansas, playing without ailing coach Bill Self, became the second top seed not to escape the tournament's first weekend after Purdue lost on Friday night to No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson.Arkansas (22-13) is in the Sweet 16 for the third straight year and will play either Saint Mary's or UConn in the West Region semifinals in Las Vegas on Thursday.Self has been with the Jayhawks (28-8) since they arrived in Des Moines and has attended practices and meetings, but he still didn't feel well enough to coach a game after having a heart procedure March 8 to clear clogged arteries.Longtime assistant Norm Roberts was acting coach for a fifth straight game in Self’s absence.Kansas, bidding to become the first repeat national champion since Florida in 2006-07, was ahead 35-27 at halftime and lost for the first time in 27 games when entering the second half with a lead. Kansas had been 47-0 in the NCAA Tournament when leading by eight points or more at the half.“Our guys have been terrific all year,” Roberts said. “They fought to the very end, made huge plays. It was tough not having Coach here, but we don’t make any excuses. We have to line up and get it done, and we came up a little bit short today.”Davis scored 21 of his points in the second half. He fouled out with 1:56 left, turning things over to the veteran Council, a transfer from Wichita State who scored nine of the Razorbacks’ final 11 points.“This team was struggling and we figured it out,” Davis said. “I’m glad we did at the right time. Hopefully we continue to do it.”Outside the locker room, a sobbing Musselman hugged Davis and shouted, “I (expletive) love you, man!”Council's free throw put Arkansas ahead to stay, 68-67, with 24 seconds left. He then rebounded his own miss of the second free throw and made two more to give the Razorbacks a three-point lead.The teams traded free throws, and Arkansas sent Kansas' Jalen Wilson to the line with 3 seconds left to prevent a potential tying 3-pointer. Wilson made the first free throw and appeared to try to miss the second intentionally, but it banked hard off the glass and in, and Kansas never regained possession.Wilson led the Jayhawks with 20 points but lamented grabbing only four rebounds, which he said was a factor in Arkansas holding a 15-2 advantage in second-chance points. No missed rebound hurt more, he said, than when Kansas failed to grab the ball off Council's missed free throw in the waning seconds.“It always comes down to one play, especially hustle plays like that,” Wilson said. “It’s just disappointing to end like that, especially with how great our year was. Credit to them for how they played.”Arkansas, which beat Illinois in the first round, was considered a scary matchup for the Jayhawks with its explosive transition game and ability to play lockdown defense.But circumstances were less than ideal for the Razorbacks. Guard Anthony Black tweaked a nagging ankle injury early and went to the bench to get re-taped and change shoes, and fellow guard and projected high NBA first-round draft pick Nick Smith Jr. picked up two quick fouls and was limited to 10 minutes and no points in the first half. Also, big man Kamani Johnson was ill and played with a sore toe.The Razorbacks were too eager to shoot 3-pointers early. They missed 8 of 9 in the first half and couldn’t get their running game going.Kansas was in control for stretches but never could put away the Razorbacks.Davis started a game-turning 11-0 Arkansas run in the middle of the second half and Jordan Walsh’s 3-pointer with eight minutes left gave the Razorbacks their first lead since their first basket of the game.Arkansas neutralized Wilson when it mattered most, allowing the All-American only two shots over a 15-minute stretch of the second half.Arkansas is in the Sweet 16 for the 14th time. The only lower-seeded Razorbacks team to reach a regional semifinal was the 1996 squad, which was a No. 12 under Nolan Richardson, who led the school to its only national title two years earlier.If Musselman reaches his first Final Four, he will evoke more memories of those glory years.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840100,"Stanford's VanDerveer, McPhee-McCuin of Ole Miss keep giving","STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — They are two coaches spreading goodwill from opposite sides of the country, the legend and the lady who vows to be one and considers herself a key figure in the future of women's basketball.When Tara VanDerveer’s top-seeded Stanford team had eliminated surprising Sacred Heart in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Hall of Fame coach took a moment in the handshake line to offer her encouragement and best wishes to coach Jessica Mannetti and her star freshman guard, Ny’Ceara Pryor.Mississippi coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin has received that same kindness from VanDerveer, who went out of her way to welcome the Rebels to campus this week.Now, these two community-focused coaches will face off when the top-seeded Cardinal (29-5) take on No. 9 seed Ole Miss (24-8) in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Sunday night for a spot in the Sweet Sixteen at next weekend's Seattle Regional.Stanford star Cameron Brink returned to the practice floor and is expected to play Sunday after missing a 92-49 first-round win against 16th-seeded Sacred Heart on Friday because of a stomach bug.“We need Cam, happy she’s back,” VanDerveer said.In Oxford, Mississippi, fifth-year coach McPhee-McCuin makes sure her players participate in one community service activity each month despite the pressures of classwork and basketball practice and preparations. The Rebels call it fellowship.“It is core for our program,” said McPhee-McCuin, born in The Bahamas. “... We’re all over the place. Our community, we’re the women’s basketball team for the Oxford community and we take pride in that, and they have put their arms around us as a program.”Recently, the Ole Miss women bought meals for people in need and spent time with them as they ate — from kids to seniors. When the state capital of Jackson faced a water crisis last year, the Rebels sent a truckload of cases of water to the Jackson State women’s basketball program.“The moment I got into Oxford they welcomed me with open arms. It's like my second family, so it's always good to give back to them and just being a positive influence on the younger generation and being a positive influence on the community as a whole,"" junior guard Snudda Collins said.McPhee-McCuin comes by her grace and giving ways naturally.That mindset was instilled in her as a young child when her educator parents, Gladstone “Moon” McPhee and former principal mother Daisy, routinely brought in young people who needed a safe place to stay. Whether a pregnant teen who had been kicked out of her home or a troubled boy, they were welcome in the McPhee home.“So all my life I’ve known how to be a part of any type of philanthropic work because my parents embody community service and servanthood,” McPhee-McCuin said Sunday. ""My dad next month is going to have a street named after him. He has a park named after him. My mom is a Hall of Famer, so I come from a legendary group. All I know is excellence. And when I talk about excellence I’m talking about from a servanthood mindset.""VanDerveer is always one to give of her time to other coaches and programs. She admires McPhee-McCuin from afar.“Whether it’s community service things or just coaching, really coaching is not just giving candy to players, it’s making corrections, it’s helping them reach their potential,” VanDerveer said. ""Seems like she’s doing a great job. It was fun to just visit with her, even though it was a very short visit. I just kind of welcomed her to Stanford ... they had a good game yesterday and just don’t want her to have a great game tomorrow.""Women's basketball's all-time winningest coach was impressed with the grit of Ole Miss delivering a defensive gem getting past No. 9 seed Gonzaga 71-48 on Friday night to advance out of the first round after last year's exit in the opener while back on the NCAA stage for the first time in 15 years. Stanford has won 21 consecutive NCAA games on its home floor and is 41-4 all-time at Maples during March Madness.These programs played once previously and that came in the 1990 Sweet Sixteen as Stanford went on to capture its first national title.Whatever the outcome Sunday, no question the 40-year-old McPhee-McCuin — who notes, “someone’s going to get knocked out tomorrow” — is making her homeland of The Bahamas proud and leaving her mark on the big stage.“I believe that I’m the future of women’s basketball. Being 40 years old, I’m pretty young,” she said.Just as she does when going up against No. 1 South Carolina coach Dawn Staley in the Southeastern Conference, McPhee-McCuin will cherish her moment on the opposite bench from VanDerveer, who turns 70 in June.“Listen, I’m the young thunder cat in the group, right?” she said. “I look up to a lot of coaches.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840101,MATCHDAY: Barcelona hosts Madrid; Arsenal can stretch lead,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Sunday:SPAINBarcelona hosts Real Madrid in the Spanish league aiming to deal a heavy blow to its rival's title defense. Madrid trails Barcelona by nine points and needs to win the latest “clasico” at Camp Nou. Barcelona won’t be able to count on midfielder Pedri González, who coach Xavi Hernández says has not recovered from his leg injury in time. Karim Benzema will be available for Real Madrid despite the knock he took after scoring in his team’s 1-0 win over Liverpool in the Champions League. A win by Barcelona would put it well on its way to winning its first league title since 2019 and since the exit of Lionel Messi. Real Sociedad, Real Betis, and Villarreal will all try to rebound from their respective eliminations from European competition this week. Fourth-place Sociedad welcomes Elche, while fifth-place Betis hosts Mallorca. Villarreal is at Osasuna.ENGLANDArsenal can go into the international break with an eight-point lead over Manchester City in the Premier League if it beats manager-less Crystal Palace at home. Former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira was fired by Palace on Friday with the team yet to win a game in 2023 and having lost its last three matches. Arsenal was knocked out of the Europa League by Sporting Lisbon after a penalty shootout on Thursday but can take advantage of Manchester City playing in the FA Cup quarterfinals to increase its league lead. After City beat Burnley on Saturday, the other three quarterfinals are on Sunday. Manchester United hosts Fulham as it continues its quest for a domestic cup double, while Brighton hosts fourth-tier Grimsby Town and Sheffield United welcomes Blackburn.ITALYRunaway Serie A leader Napoli visits Torino, Lazio meets Roma in the Rome derby and Inter Milan hosts Juventus in a big day for Serie A. Napoli has a nearly 20-point advantage as it cruises toward its first Italian league title since Diego Maradona helped the Partenopei to its only two champoonships in 1987 and 1990. Lazio, Roma and Inter are fighting for Champions League places, while Juventus is looking to get back into the European places despite a 15-point penalty for false accounting.FRANCELeague leader Paris Saint-Germain is out of the Champions League and the French Cup, meaning it has just the league title left to focus on. PSG has a comfortable nine-point lead before hosting a Rennes side which is very strong at home — beating PSG this season — but has trouble on the road. PSG striker Kylian Mbappé will look to increase his 19 league goals this season. Third-place Marseille faces a tough test at Reims, which is unbeaten in 19 matches. Fourth-place Monaco needs to get back to winning ways when it travels to Corsica to face Ajaccio. Monaco has picked up only one point from the last three matches.GERMANYBayern Munich can retake top spot of the Bundesliga with a win or draw at Bayer Leverkusen. Borussia Dortmund leads Bayern by one point after routing Cologne 6-1. Also Sunday, fourth-place Union Berlin hosts sixth-place Eintracht Frankfurt. Fifth-place Freiburg travels to Mainz.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

Trump provided no evidence of leaks from the district attorney's office and did not discuss the possible charges in his post.""Protest, take our nation back!"" said Trump, whose supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat.The probe comes as Trump seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2024.No U.S. president - while in office or afterward - has faced criminal charges. Trump has said he will continue campaigning even if he is charged with a crime.A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office has been investigating a $130,000 hush payment Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels, declined to comment.Sources have said Bragg's office has been presenting evidence to a grand jury about the payment, which came in the waning days ofTrump's 2016 campaign in exchange for Daniels' silence about an affair she said she had with Trump a decade earlier.Trump has denied the affair happened and called the investigation by Bragg, a Democrat, a witch hunt.An additional witness is expected to appear before the grand jury on Monday, at the request of Trump's lawyers, a person familiar with the matter said on Saturday.Trump's statement that he expected to be arrested on Tuesday is based on news reports that Bragg's office is going to be meeting with law enforcement to prepare for a possible indictment, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, on Saturday decried the investigation.""Here we go again — an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA who lets violent criminals walk as he pursues political vengeance against President Trump,"" McCarthy said on Twitter.'RECKLESS'McCarthy's predecessor as speaker, Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi, who like McCarthy was present at the Capitol when hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the building, battling with police, denounced Trump's call.""The former president's announcement this morning is reckless: doing so to keep himself in the news and to foment unrest among his supporters,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""He cannot hide from his violations of the law, disrespect for our elections and incitements to violence.""Bragg's office earlier this month invited Trump to testify before the grand jury probing the payment, which legal experts said was a sign that an indictment was close. Trump declined the offer, the person familiar with the matter said.Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance violations tied to his arranging payments to Daniels and another woman in exchange for their silence about affairs they said they'd had with Trump, among other crimes. He has said Trump directed him to make the payments. The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan did not charge Trump with a crime.The probe is one of several legal woes Trump faces as he seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency.Trump is also confronting a state-level criminal probe in Georgia over efforts to overturn the 2020 results in that state.A special counsel named by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is currently investigating Trump's handling of classified government documents after leaving office, as well as his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to President Joe Biden, a Democrat.Bragg's office last year won the conviction of the Trump Organization on tax fraud charges. But Bragg declined to chargeTrump himself with financial crimes related to his business practices, prompting two prosecutors who worked on the probe to resign.Trump leads his early rivals for his party's nomination, holding the support of 43% of Republicans in a February Reuters/Ipsos poll, compared with 31% for his nearest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has not yet announced his candidacy.Trump in 2018 initially disputed knowing anything about the payment to Daniels. He later acknowledged reimbursing Cohen for the payment, which he called a ""simple private transaction.""Cohen, who served time in prison after pleading guilty, testifiedbefore the grand jury this week. Grand jury proceedings are not public. Outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan, he told reporters he did not testify out of a desire for revenge againstTrump.""This is all about accountability,"" he said. ""He needs to be held accountable for his dirty deeds.""Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, spoke with prosecutors last week, according to her lawyer.Trump founded his Truth Social media platform after being banned by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube following the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. He has since regained his accounts on those services, though he limited his Saturday statement to Truth.""His messages on Truth Social are very concerning as he is declaring the entire justice system corrupt,"" said Jennifer Stromer-Falley, a senior associate dean at Syracuse University and an expert in social media use during elections.(Reporting by Luc Cohen and Karen Freifeld in New York, additional reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Scott Malone, Daniel Wallis, Noeleen Walder and Alistair Bell)",2023/3/19,404,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840117,Aho's hat trick lifts Hurricanes past Flyers 5-4 in OT,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Sebastian Aho had a hat trick, including the winning goal 28 seconds into overtime after Martin Necas tied it with 0.3 seconds left in regulation, and the Carolina Hurricanes rallied to beat the Philadelphia Flyers 5-4 on Saturday.Brady Skjei also scored for the Hurricanes, and Frederick Andersen had 29 saves. Carolina held onto its lead in the Metropolitan Division after entering a point ahead of second-place New Jersey.“We finally woke up,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “We were sleeping through the game for that third period and even the second period. We were just kind of going through the motions. Can’t do that in this league. So it was a good lesson.”Tyson Foerster, Noah Cates and Brendan Lemieux each had a goal and an assist for the Flyers, and Joel Farabee also scored. Owen Tippett and Morgan Frost each had two assists for Philadelphia, which has dropped 11 of 15. The Flyers began play with the sixth-fewest points in the NHL. Felix Sandstrom finished with 29 saves.“I thought we played really well,” Flyers coach John Tortorella said. “I thought we had the game controlled. I don’t know how to evaluate it right now.”It looked like Philadelphia was headed to just its fifth winning streak of the season before Necas’ power-play tally. The Hurricanes went on the man-advantage with 7 seconds left in regulation when Scott Laughton was whistled for holding.After Carolina won the draw, Shayne Gostisbehere fired a slap shot that was stopped by goalie Felix Sandstrom with a stellar left pad save. But the puck caromed toward the other side of the net, where a wide-open Necas fired it home.“I was just standing on the back door and the puck just, I don’t even know, somehow showed up there and I just banged it into the net,” he said.The Hurricanes celebrated wildly and then again when officials confirmed that the goal beat the end-of-game buzzer.“The goalie made an unbelievable save, so you think the game’s over,” Brind’Amour said. “And then, you know, we got a lucky break there. I’ll take it.”Aho didn’t waste much time to end the contest, deking past defenseman Tony DeAngelo before beating Sandstrom with his 30th goal of the season. Aho had been held without a point in seven straight games before recording his third career three-goal effort.“I was able to gather a lot of speed and there was an offensive gap there so I just went for it,” Aho said. “You don’t really think about it too much when you’re out there. Just try to play with your instincts, and it worked this time.”After Farabee tied it at 3-all 3:33 into the final period, Lemieux put the Flyers on top at 5:50. Frost made the play by blocking Andersen’s clearing attempt from behind the net, corralling the puck and sending it to Lemieux, who scored into a wide-open net with Andersen trying to recover.Aho notched his second of the night with 6:05 left in the second on a wrist shot from the slot past Sandstrom’s glove. He opened the scoring with 5:08 left in the first on a wrist shot from close range that beat the goalie on the glove side.NOTES: Carolina played its third game without third-leading scorer Andrei Svechnikov, who is out for the season with a knee injury. ... Philadelphia played the third contest of a seven-game homestand. ... Carolina swept the four-game season series against the Flyers, winning each game by one goal. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840118,"Transfers step up for Baylor, Creighton in March Madness","DENVER (AP) — There’s some good-natured debate over which is the better Baylor — Scheierman or the Bears.Some answers arrive on Sunday when Baylor Scheierman and No. 6 seed Creighton take on third-seeded Baylor in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.One thing both schools can agree on: the importance of a transfer stepping in to fill a missing piece for an otherwise-solid program. There are schools that use the transfer portal to get good quick. Then there are schools like Baylor (23-10) and Creighton (22-12) that use the portal to stay good for a while.The Bears brought in two players in Jalen Bridges (from West Virginia) and Caleb Lohner (BYU) to fill in holes and try to make a run to a second title in three seasons.For Creighton, the big addition was Scheierman, the highly sought-after player who left South Dakota State and chose to stay close to home (he's from Nebraska).He's definitely on the radar of Baylor coach Scott Drew.“Love his name,” Drew cracked. “Hopefully, this Baylor does better than that Baylor tomorrow.”Scheierman made a big impression in a first-round win over North Carolina State, sealing the game with a late basket and blowing a kiss to the crowd in celebration.Safe to say he has settled into his new surroundings.“Ever since I stepped on campus, the guys have taken me in and treated like I’ve been there all along,” said Scheierman, who was the 2021-22 Summit League player of the year at South Dakota State. “The process coming in has been smooth and the chemistry on the team is very good, and at a very high level right now.”The same can be said at Baylor (the school).When Bridges was considering a new program for this season, he had a definitive checklist with warm weather, winning culture and family atmosphere leading the way.Check, check and check with the Bears.“It was kind of easy to see myself here because they played in a way that fits my style,” said Bridges, who is averaging 10.2 points 5.6 rebounds this season. ""I just try to do my best to make a play.”Same with Lohner, who appeared in 62 games with BYU before joining Baylor this season. He scored a season-high 13 points in a first-round win over Santa Barbara on Friday.“For me, (the transfer portal) has been awesome,” Lohner said. “One of those situations that all lined up and I’m really grateful and blessed to be in a spot like this.”At South Dakota State, Scheierman was counted on for his scoring (more specifically, his 3-point shooting).At Creighton, he has plenty of company. The Bluejays have big man Ryan Kalkbrenner and guard Trey Alexander to help carry the scoring load.“Coming in, I knew my role is going to be much different than it was in South Dakota State and I was accepting of that,” Scheierman said. “I knew that if we put everything together and we made a deep run that it would eventually help all of our individual goals pan out.”Sharing the same name as the school the Bluejays are about to play has been ""a lot of fun,” Scheierman said.Along with it, a bit of confusion.“The past 24 hours the coaches have been saying Baylor a lot and it’s kind of thrown me off a little bit,” Scheierman cracked. “I didn’t really follow them a lot growing up and what-not. Obviously, I always knew that we had the same name, but at the end of the day, it’s just another basketball game.” ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840119,15th-seeded Princeton beats Missouri 78-63 to reach Sweet 16,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — As the final minute ticked off the clock, the Princeton fans started chanting “Sweet 16! Sweet 16!” and coach Mitch Henderson cleared the bench with the victory easily in hand.This upset was no small-school fluke against a more heralded team. It was a thoroughly dominating performance that sent Princeton to a place it hadn't been in more than a half-century.Blake Peters made five 3-pointers in the second half and Princeton shocked another power conference team to reach the NCAA Tournament regional semifinals for the first time in 56 years by beating Missouri 78-63 on Saturday.“The world looks at us as two upsets,” forward Tosan Evbuomwan said. ""But I feel like we’re supposed to be here. We have a lot of confidence in one another, what we’re doing. There’s definitely no letup with this group.”The No. 15 seeded Princeton (23-8) followed up a first-round win over Pac-12 tournament champion Arizona by overwhelming seventh-seeded Missouri (25-10) of the Southeastern Conference from the start.The Ivy League school known for giving powerhouses scares and occasionally pulling off upsets a generation ago has reached the round of 16 for the first time since 1967 when only 23 teams even made the tournament.“I have no words for you,” Peters said. “We have such an unbelievable section (of fans) here. I have the best teammates in the world. I love each and every one of them. when we go out and believe in each other, anything is possible. I know it’s cliche, but anything is possible.”Princeton will play the winner of Sunday’s game between Baylor and Creighton in the Sweet 16 in Louisville, Kentucky, on Friday night.The Tigers will be the second Ivy League school to make the Sweet 16 in the past 43 tournaments, joining Cornell in 2010. No team from the academically prestigious league that doesn’t give athletic scholarships has gone further since Penn made the Final Four in 1979.“I’ve always dreamed of playing deep into the tournament,” said Henderson, a player on Princeton’s teams in 1996 and ’98 that won first-round games. “As a player, got to the second round a couple times. Never got beyond it.”This marks the third straight year a team seeded 15th made it to the Sweet 16, following Oral Roberts in 2021 and fellow New Jersey school Saint Peter's last year. The only other time a 15 seed made it this far came in 2013 when Florida Gulf Coast did it.Ryan Langborg led Princeton with 22 points and Peters added 17.DeAndre Gholston scored 19 points and Noah Carter added 14 for Missouri, which was seeking its first berth in the Sweet 16 since 2009.“We were able to get the lead one time,” coach Dennis Gates said. “We held the lead for 30 seconds in the entire game. Every time we got the lead or when they had the lead, we cut it to six, they came back down and did what a good team would do: Make a shot or make a play.”Princeton showed no signs of being outclassed against another power conference team, controlling the play from the start. Keeshawn Kellman had two dunks and a blocked shot in a span of 16 seconds midway through the half.Princeton built the lead to 10 points on a corner 3 by Zach Martini and went up 33-19 on a drive by Evbuomwan.Missouri responded by scoring the final seven points of the half to go into the break down seven.Every time Missouri threatened early in the second half, Princeton had an answer with Peters hitting five 3-pointers. The fourth gave Princeton a 62-43 lead and Missouri never threatened after that.“Blake Peters has been making shots coming off the bench for us for weeks,” Henderson said. “This is a very, very confident group. We are so thrilled to be going to the Sweet 16. It is an absolute pleasure being around these guys. They just grit their teeth and they do it.”BIG PICTUREPrinceton: Princeton was more than a match physically with Missouri with a 44-30 rebounding edge and 16 offensive rebounds that led to 19 second-chance points. Caden Pierce led the way with 16 rebounds.“They’re playing absolutely fearless,” Henderson said. “They’re unafraid of anyone.”Missouri: Coach Dennis Gates' first season at Missouri was a successful one with 25 wins but still had a disappointing finish.UP NEXTPrinceton will look for its first Elite Eight appearance since 1965 when Bill Bradley was the star.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840122,Mexico president holds massive rally ahead of 2024 elections,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador held a massive rally in Mexico City’s main plaza attended by tens of thousands of people Saturday.Though it was called to commemorate Mexico's 1938 expropriation of the oil industry, many of those attending the rally Saturday agreed that it was the de-facto opening salvo to the 2024 elections that will choose the president’s successor.Perhaps conscious of recent tensions with the United States over U.S. overdose deaths from fentanyl smuggled in from Mexico, López Obrador spent part of his speech praising former U.S. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who didn't actively oppose the 1938 oil expropriation despite the fact many of the firms were American.“”The best example of the authenticity of his ‘Good Neighbor’ policy was his respect for our nation's sovereignty,"" López Obrador said of Roosevelt.It may be one of the last rallies that will be headed by López Obrador, who is known for his folksy style and charisma. The process to nominate a presidential candidate for his Morena party will begin later this year. After that, the party's candidate is likely to take center stage.But most agree that few of the presidential hopefuls can match the popularity of a president whose approval ratings are routinely above 60%. That is especially true for the Morena party, which was largely built around López Obrador.Alberto Martínez, 59, said he hoped Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum would be the party's nominee. “We like her education, her prudence,” Martinez said. But he would settle for anyone Morena choose.Most polls show Sheinbaum as the front-runner in the race, followed by Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard.“The important thing is for the ideology of López Obrador to continue,” Martínez said. “This train is already in motion, somebody just to get aboard and drive it.”Former President Lázaro Cárdenas, one of López Obrador's heroes, delighted Mexicans when he expropriated the largely foreign-owned, privately operated oil industry on March 18, 1938.One of López Obrador's main policy initiatives has been to save the state-owned oil company that Cárdenas founded from crushing debt and low oil production.Those attending the rally in the Zocalo wholeheartedly approved of López Obrador, who has struck a nationalist stance, drastically reducing the ability of U.S. anti-drug agents to operate in Mexico.Blas Ramos, 69, an electrical engineer, held up a sign reading “Get out of Mexico, FBI, CIA, Gringos!”He said the president was right to oppose U.S. calls to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations or to use the U.S. military to crack down on the gangs.“They are hypocrites,” he said of U.S. politicians calling for such measures, “because they don't do anything to reduce drug consumption” in the United States.The synthetic opioid fentanyl, which kills about 70,000 Americans per year, is mainly manufactured in Mexico with precursor chemicals smuggled in from China.López Obrador has claimed that Mexico doesn't produce fentanyl — something most experts disagree with — and that the U.S. has a fentanyl problem because American families don't hug their kids enough.López Obrador thundered against the U.S. proposals. ""Mexico is a free and independent country, not a colony or protectorate of the United States,” he said, shouting: “Cooperation, yes, submission, no!”Ramos was confident that the president's movement, which he calls “the fourth transformation of Mexico,” would not end when he leaves office in September 2024.“This is a movement that began a long time ago,” he said. “We have spent our whole lives waiting for this movement.”“This movement isn't over in six years,” Ramos said, referring to the length of presidential terms in Mexico. “This is a process, that will take 30, 40 years.""",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840123,Marquette coach Smart faces mentor Izzo in NCAA 2nd round,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Watching Tom Izzo's Michigan State team win the 2000 national title was a seminal moment for Shaka Smart, then a 22-year-old graduate assistant at Division II California University of Pennsylvania.“That cemented in my mind college basketball was where I wanted to be,” Smart said Saturday, a day before his second-seeded Marquette team was to face Izzo and No. 7 seed Michigan State in the East Region, with the winner advancing to the Sweet 16.Smart's respect turned into a friendship. The younger coach sought advice from Izzo after bursting onto the national scene in 2011 by taking VCU from the First Four all the way to the Final Four in his second season leading the Rams.“I think if you polled the coaches across the country, Coach Iz would be at or near the top in terms of coaches that we look up to, that we call every once in a while for advice, that we watch press conferences and keep a close eye on, just what he’s doing because he’s had such a high standard of excellence for so long,” said Smart, the Big East Coach of the Year.After VCU, Smart coached at Texas for six seasons without a tournament win before taking the Marquette job in 2021. The Golden Eagles are making a second straight tournament appearance and got their first March Madness win since 2013 on Friday with a rout of No. 15 seed Vermont.Izzo must see a bit of himself in Smart, who demands maximum effort and focus from players who are besieged daily by social media pressure and other distractions. He is admittedly hard on them.“I've been a fan,” the 68-year-old Izzo said. ""I’ve stayed in touch when he went through some things at Texas and enjoyed watching (his teams) play. Unfortunately, it’s going to be from 40, 50 feet away now for a little bit more.“He does it the right way,” Izzo said. “He coaches the kids hard, but he’s a damn good coach.”Michigan State had a tumultuous season, representing a university scarred by tragedy when a gunman killed three students in a campus shooting on Feb. 13.Izzo led the Spartans to the Big Dance for the 25th straight season. The Spartans beat No. 10 Southern California 72-62 on Friday night. A win on Sunday would get them to the Sweet 16 for the first time in four years.Marquette guard Tyler Kolek, the Big East Player of the Year, injured his thumb and sat out most of the first-round game. Averaging 33.7 points per game, he had just eight points and picked up his fourth foul early in the second half.Smart said he expects Kolek to play against Michigan State.MIRROR IMAGEFDU, FAU. So alike in so many ways.When Fairleigh Dickinson, which brought down top-seeded Purdue in only the second No. 16-over-No. 1 upset in NCAA Tournament history, takes on Florida Atlantic in the East region, it will be a matchup of teams with striking similarities.Both prefer to push the tempo offensively while defending as a team to offset any size disadvantage.“FDU is going to be a little like playing us in practice,” FAU coach Dusty May said. “We’re not the biggest team on paper, when you look at our heights and weights. We’re not the most imposing team. But most of our guys play much bigger than what they are, much like FDU.”Fairleigh Dickinson is the smallest team in the country, but the Knights showed their toughness and tenacity by containing 7-foot-4 Purdue center Zach Edey, who rarely got a clean look at the basket despite being guarded by players more than a foot shorter.TANGLING WITH TSHIEBWEKansas State knows it has a big challenge on the glass against Kentucky’s Oscar Tshiebwe.The teams meet Sunday in a Wildcats-vs-Wildcats matchup in Greensboro, North Carolina. Tshiebwe — a two-time Associated Press All-American and last season’s national player of the year — is coming off a 25-rebound performance in the first-round win against Providence. That's the most boards by any player in the tournament since 1977.Third-seeded Kansas State will try to counter Tshiebwe with slender 6-10 junior Nae’Qwan Tomlin and 6-6 fifth-year senior Keyontae Johnson.“It’s going to be a team effort,” Johnson said. “We know he gives them a lot of second-chance points, so we just have to limit their offensive rebounds, box him out, find him when they get shots up. He is going to get his no matter what.”Tshiebwe doesn't just pull down defensive rebounds. He keeps possessions alive, grabbing 11 offensive rebounds against Providence while powering through and over would-be rebounders.“You can’t wrestle with Oscar, right?” Kansas State coach Jerome Tang said. “You’re going to lose that.""___AP sports writers Tom Withers and Aaron Beard contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840124,First round of March Madness features double-digit comebacks,"No lead seemed safe on Saturday in the first round of the women's NCAA Tournament. Baylor, Miami and Ohio State all rallied from double-digits deficits to advance to the second round.The Bears trailed by 18 points against Alabama early on and overcame it for a 78-74 win. It was tied for the third-largest comeback in the history of the tournament. Baylor was down by 11 at the half and coach Nicki Collen took a calm approach at the break.“No swear words, I gave those up for Lent, but a lot of challenges thrown out about how we needed to compete,” she said. “I challenged like, ’You have to be better, you just have to be better.”Texas A&M still holds the biggest rally in NCAA history, coming back from 21-down against Penn in 2017. Oklahoma State's 19-point rally in 2010 against Chattanooga is No. 2 on the list.Hours before the Bears' rally, Miami trailed Oklahoma State by 17 points at the half. The team had a heart-to-heart at the break and used a stellar third quarter to get back in the game. Miami then made enough plays down the stretch for the 62-61 victory.“When you say encourage that means to put courage into someone’s heart and we had to put courage into each other’s hearts, including mine,” Miami coach Katie Meier said. “They had to convince me. This is a huge wonderful memory, of sport, but it’s a lifetime memory, too.”Haley Cavinder propelled the Hurricanes to the comeback with 12 of her 16 points in the second half.“I think that’s March,” Cavinder said. “It was nerve-racking, but we finished the game strong and yeah, it’s something I’ll remember forever.”Ohio State got the comeback trend started when the Buckeyes found themselves down 16 points to James Madison at home before finally getting going and pulling away for an 80-66 win.""We had several open shots in the perimeter and then shots around the basket. We just weren’t finishing it,” Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said. “We looked a little rusty from being off for a couple of weeks and so hopefully this allows us to settle in and we’ll get off to a better start on Monday.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840125,UN commission calls for closing the gender digital divide,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N.’s premiere global body fighting for gender equality on Saturday called for wide-ranging efforts to close the gap between men and women in today’s technology-driven world and urged zero tolerance for gender-based violence and harassment online.In a document approved by consensus after all-night negotiations at the end of a two-week meeting, the Commission on the Status of Women expressed grave concern at the interrelation between offline and online violence, harassment and discrimination against women and girls — and it condemned the increase in these acts.It called for a significant increase in investments by the public and private sector to bridge the gender digital divide. It also called for the removal of barriers to equal access to digital technology for all women and girls, and new policies and programs to achieve gender parity in emerging scientific and technological fields.Sima Bahous, executive director of UN Women, an entity of the United Nations focusing on gender equality and the empowerment, called the document “game-changing” in promoting a blueprint for a more equal and connected world for women and girls. The challenge now, she said, is for governments, the private sector, civil society and young people to turn the blueprint “into reality for all women and girls.”At the start of the commission’s two-week meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said its focus was very timely because women and girls are being left behind as technology races ahead.“Three billion people are still unconnected to the internet, the majority of them women and girls in developing countries, (and) in least developed countries just 19% of women are online,” Guterres said. “Globally, girls and women make up just one-third of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics” and men outnumber women two to one in the tech industry.Bahous told the opening meeting that “the digital divide has become the new face of gender inequality,” with 259 million more men than women online last year. She also cited a survey of female journalists from 125 countries that found three-quarters had experienced online harassment in the course of their work and a third had engaged in self-censorship in response.The “agreed conclusions” document adopted Saturday by the 45-member commission calls for equal quality education for women and girls in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, information and communications technology, and digital literacy so they can thrive in the rapidly changing world.During lengthy negotiations on the document, which has 93 paragraphs, U.N. diplomats said language on women’s rights was challenged by Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Holy See and human rights language was also challenged by those countries as well as Cuba and China. There were also intense debates over language on gender-based violence facilitated by technology, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because negotiations were closed.The final document reaffirms the 1995 Beijing platform adopted by 189 countries which said for the first time in a U.N. document, that women’s human rights include the right to control and decide “on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.”The final issue blocking consensus was Pakistan’s insistence on adding a reference to “foreign occupation” to the document, and Israel’s strong opposition, diplomats said. The reference was not included and before the document’s adoption Pakistan’s representative expressed regret that the needs and priorities of women belonging to developing countries and facing humanitarian crisis including foreign occupation were not included.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840126,Panthers have 4-goal 3rd in 4-2 comeback win over Devils,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Sam Reinhart scored two of Florida's four third-period goals and the Panthers rallied to beat the New Jersey Devils 4-2 on Saturday night.Aleksander Barkov had a goal and an assist to tie former teammate Jonathan Huberdeau for the franchise career points lead with 613.Matthew Tkachuk also scored and Sergei Bobrovsky made 33 saves. The Panthers kept pace in the Eastern Conference wild-card race, extending their points streak to six at 5-0-1.“I liked our bounce-back in the third,” Reinhart said. “We started moving our feet a little, started creating some chances and we capitalized. It was a back-and-forth night and they hung on. … This is the most fun time to play. You could sense the atmosphere from the start. Fans know the position we are in. We’re enjoying the battle.”Nico Hischier and Jesper Boqvist scored in the second period for New Jersey and rookie goalie Akira Schmid made 37 saves. The Devils have lost three straight.“Just a couple of big breakdowns. I’m embarrassed what we did to our goaltender,’’ New Jersey coach Lindy Ruff said. “After recovering from a tough first period and playing such a good second period to do that to ourselves, that’s more than the punch in the gut.”Hischier opened the scoring while killing a penalty, intercepting an errant pass at the top of the offensive zone and charging in on Bobrovsky at 2:16.A little over five minutes later, Boqvist scored, with Bobrovsky and a couple of his teammates down on the ice after the goalie's previous save.“The second period wasn’t what we wanted, but we had one hell of a first and we wanted to get back to that,’’ Tkachuk said. “I thought we played a really strong 50 minutes — some of the second we would like back. But that third period is how we want to play.”Florida got on the board at 6:14 of the third on an odd play when Brandon Montour's shot from the point hit Marc Staal as he was going toward the net. The puck dropped right onto the stick of Barkov, who scored.The Panthers then scored twice within a span of a minute as Reinhart deflected a Brandon Montour shot past Schmid at 7:54. Tkachuk beat Schmid off a backhander following a pass from Carter Verhaeghe.Reinhart added an empty-net goal, with Barkov assisting to tie Huberdeau.UP NEXTDevils: At Tampa Bay on Sunday night.Panthers: At Detroit on Monday night.___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840134,Formann scores 21 as Colorado's 3s sink Middle Tennessee,"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Frida Formann scored 21 points and Colorado unleashed a torrid 3-point shooting display to roll past Middle Tennessee 82-60 in the NCAA Tournament’s first round Saturday night.Jaylyn Sherrod added 13 points and Aaronette Vonleh had 11 points for the Buffaloes, who made a season-high 13 shots from beyond the 3-point arc. Seven Colorado players made at least one 3, led by Formann’s 5-for-8 effort.“If that’s what they’re giving us, I think we’re really good at taking advantage of it,” Formann said.Sixth-seeded Colorado (24-8), which will be in the second round for the first time since 2003, meets host Duke on Monday.“We’ve just worked so hard to get here and I’m just happy we’re back on this stage finally,” Formann said.Anastasiia Boldyreva’s 16 points, Savannah Wheeler’s 15 points and Kseniya Malashka’s 13 points led No. 11 seed Middle Tennessee (28-5), which had won 10 in a row.“They played extremely well,” Middle Tennessee coach Rick Insell said. “We didn’t play that bad.”The Buffaloes were making 3s pretty much from the opening tip – and they kept shooting them. After hitting seven from long range in the first half, they nailed four more in the first 4½ minutes of the third quarter. Three of those came in a 54-second span, creating a 56-36 lead.“I think we all came out with just a sense of confidence,” Sherrod said.The 13 baskets from 3-point range were the most for Colorado in 11 years.“We were so locked into the game plan for this week,” Colorado coach JR Payne said. “(This) was the best shoot-around we’ve had all year. Our energy, our focus is I think right where it needs to be at this time of year.”The Buffaloes drained five 3s, two each by Formann and Tayanna Jones, in the first seven minutes to open a 17-6 lead.“We had them pegged,” Insell said. “We didn’t expect them to go hit that many 3s. We intended to slough off a couple of the shooters.”Most of the 3s came from in front of the Colorado bench, giving Insell an unfortunate up-close view of the Buffaloes’ accuracy. Jones, playing in her home state, had two 3-pointers in the first quarter after connecting on just nine shots from beyond the arc all season.“We played pretty good defense,” Insell said. “(Formann) was relocating and we just lost her.”Colorado made 7 of 16 of its first-half 3s compared with Middle Tennessee’s 1-for-9.The Buffaloes opened an 11-point lead in the first quarter, aided by hitting five 3s to nearly exceed their season per-game average of 3-pointers.Middle Tennessee didn’t convert enough off 17 Colorado turnovers.“Our fight was definitely there,” Wheeler said.The gap was down to 33-28 with less than two minutes to play in the half before Colorado closed the quarter with a 9-0 burst, capped by Kindyll Wetta’s 3 just a step or two from the sideline in front of the Middle Tennessee bench.BIG PICTUREMiddle Tennessee: The Conference USA champion Blue Raiders suffered their first four losses of the season by a combined 14 points, but they couldn’t keep up with Colorado’s efficiency. The Blue Raiders have lost their last 10 games in the NCAA Tournament dating to 2007.Colorado: The Buffaloes might like seeing new opponents at this time of the season.

He grimaced as he walked off with an athletic trainer, and Altuve was replaced by Luis Rengifo.“The Astros will provide an update tomorrow after further evaluation,” the club said in a statement.A Houston athletic trainer was concerned Altuve's thumb was broken but had not received a scan to confirm a break, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press speaking on condition of anonymity because the team had not announced a diagnosis.Altuve's injury occurred three days after New York Mets All-Star closer Edwin Díaz sustained a season-ending knee injury during the postgame celebration of Puerto Rico's 5-2 win over the Dominican Republic.Altuve did not answer questions from media after the game, saying only in Spanish: “All is good.”“It didn't look good,” said Venezuela manager Omar López, the Astros first base coach. “It took 10 seconds for Tomas Vera, my trainer, to get him out of the game. I said, `Oh, my God.' We'll see what happens. I started to pray right away for Jose, for the entire team. That was our momentum right here when we took the lead. And at some point, the whole dugout kind of died, like quiet, and we kind of pushed everybody to get up and move on.”Astros closer Ryan Pressly pitched the ninth inning for the U.S., which advanced to a Sunday night semifinal against Cuba.“I’m pretty concerned about Jose,” Pressly said. “He’s a big part of our lineup in Houston. Just on top of that, he’s an unbelievable teammate.”Bard relieved Lance Lynn to start the inning and was wild throughout, walking two batters and throwing a pair of wild pitches. The 37-year-old Colorado allowed all four batters who faced him to reached base as Venezuela overcame a three-run deficit to take a 6-5 lead.“We know he has trouble with command, and the first thing that we said, just be patient at the plate. But I never thought that he was going to come up with a pitch inside, up and in, to Jose in that situation,” López said. “Unfortunately, Jose wasn't able to kind of recognize right way.”Díaz tore the patellar tendon in his right knee and has surgery on Thursday.___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

Aunoby 15 and Scottie Barnes 10.Rudy Gobert had 14 points and 12 rebounds and Naz Reid scored 22 points for the Timberwolves, who were playing the second game of a back-to-back. Minnesota lost in double overtime at Chicago on Friday, and didn’t arrive at its Toronto hotel until 5 a.m. Saturday.“A lot of adversity for us, but we came out and we tried to compete to try to win the game,” Gobert said. “Obviously, Toronto is a very physical team. They kind of wore us down throughout the whole game. At the end, we just ran out of gas.”The Wolves played without guard Anthony Edwards, who left in the first quarter Friday because of a sprained right ankle. Coach Chris Finch said Edwards is using a walking boot, adding there’s no timetable for his return.A first–time All-Star this season, Edwards was injured when he landed awkwardly after jumping while throwing a pass.Jaden McDaniels scored 18 points as the slumping Wolves lost their third straight and fifth in six.“We’ve got to keep our heads up, we’ve got to keep fighting,” Finch said. “We’ve got to stay positive right now. That’s all we can do.”Minnesota has lost 18 straight in Toronto. The Timberwolves last won north of the border on Jan. 21, 2004, when Sam Cassell, Kevin Garnett and Latrell Sprewell were the Wolves’ leading scorers in a 108-97 victory.Toronto’s only home loss in the series since was a 116-112 defeat on Feb. 14, 2021, when the Raptors were playing in Tampa, Florida, because of border restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Siakam made just one of six from 3-point range Saturday, but shot 10 for 16 inside the arc.“He’s had a couple of games in a row now where we’ve seen a lot of variety in what he’s doing,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “That, to me, is his recipe for having a good night.”Toronto led 32-26 after one and 66-58 at halftime.Reid’s basket with 4:16 left in the third gave Minnesota its first lead since the opening minutes of game but the Raptors closed the period with an 11-2 run to take a 94-85 lead to the fourth.“We didn’t do a great job of managing the end of any quarter tonight,” Finch said.TIP-INSTimberwolves: Mike Conley and Kyle Anderson each scored 12 points. ...

Philadelphia legends Allen Iverson and Wilt Chamberlain each had eight-game runs of 30 points or more.“Embiid is right now probably the (NBA) MVP with what their team is doing and how he’s just elevated his game,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “He’s as a difficult a guy to plan for as there is in the game. He had 31 points and made it look like he wasn’t even trying to do it. He’s a walking cheat code.”De’Anthony Melton started in Harden’s place and finished with 14 points, five assists, five rebounds and six steals, while Maxey had seven assists.“I was really happy,” Sixers coach Doc Rivers said. “Everybody contributed. Joel at times was our point guard. He probably had 15 hockey assists, and that was just terrific. Low turnovers. Against a high-scoring team on the road, you had to do that.”Aaron Nesmith led the Pacers with 25 points and six rebounds, Andrew Nembhard scored 20 points, and Myles Turner finished with 20 points. Indiana shot 51% from the field, but never led after the first quarter and dropped to 6-4 in its last 10 games.Philadelphia, in third place in the Eastern Conference, led 34-24 entering the second period, 72-61 at halftime and 106-95 entering the fourth before breaking it open with a 9-0 run to start the final frame. Harden missed the game due to “injury recovery,” according to the team.“The thing about Harden being out is now the ball is going to be in Joel’s hands a lot more and Maxey’s hands a lot more, and we didn’t do enough things to make it hard on them,” Carlisle said. “Bad game for us.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840141,"Sasser, Houston moving on at March Madness, beating Auburn","BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — When Marcus Sasser felt the occasional twinge in his groin, he simply blocked it out. With so much on the line, he was determined to stay on the court for top-seeded Houston.Now, he's got a few more days to recuperate before the Sweet 16.Tramon Mark scored a career-best 26 points and Sasser added 22 — including five 3-pointers — as the Cougars stifled local favorite Auburn in the second half for an 81-64 victory at the NCAA Tournament on Saturday night.The Cougars (33-3) wiped out a 10-point halftime deficit, returning after the break with a chip on their shoulders.“We came out on fire,"" Mark said. “Everything was clicking for us in the second half.”Essentially shutting down the lane, Houston played with the desperation of a national championship contender that wasn't ready to suffer the same fate as Purdue and Kansas — No. 1s that already were sent home.Houston advanced to face either No. 4 Indiana or No. 5 Miami, which play Sunday, at the Sweet 16 in Kansas City, Missouri.All eyes were on Sasser at the start of the game as he continued to deal with a groin injury that forced him to sit out the second half of Houston's NCAA opener. But the All-American was determined to go all the way in this one.The only thing that sent him to the bench was foul trouble, not the groin.“I probably felt it a couple of times,” said Sasser, who played nearly 31 minutes. “But it was pain I could go through and keep pushing.”Now, Houston doesn't play again until Friday. More time for Sasser to feel even better.“I don't know about eliminating it,” he said. “But I feel like it will get way better.”The ninth-seeded Tigers (21-13) were doomed by a stretch of more than 10 1/2 minutes without a field goal and finished just 4 of 24 from the field in the second half.Auburn did draw plenty of fouls, only to struggle mightily at the line with a 19-of-36 showing. Jaylin Williams and Johni Broome led the Tigers with 14 points apiece.“I kind of wish it were a 20-minute game instead of a 40-minute game,” Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. “They came out and guarded us much harder, much better. And we didn’t respond to it.”When Sasser swished a 3-pointer to push Houston back ahead, 46-45, he let out an emphatic scream on his way back down the court. He finished 5 of 9 beyond the arc.Fouls were his only real issue. The All-American guard and his running mate, point guard Jamal Shead, were both forced to the bench with four fouls apiece with the game still in doubt.But Mark kept the Cougars right on rolling offensively, and the the big guys simply refused to let Auburn back in the game.Houston had 12 blocks, half of them swatted away by Jarace Walker, with five more shots turned away by J'Wan Roberts.“I think the biggest adjustment was in our attitude,” coach Kelvin Sampson said. “I was almost glad it was Auburn’s ball first (in the second half), because I thought we needed to set the tone with a stop.""It wound up lasting an entire half.Houston scored the last nine points to blow it open at the end, with Sasser delivering one more 3-pointer that sent the Auburn fans — and there were plenty of them — heading for the exits.It was quite a change from the first half.Auburn closed on a 17-4 run while Houston missed six of its last eight shots, its only baskets coming on a pair of layups.ROAD WARRIORSLeading up to the game, the Cougars shrugged off being a No. 1 seed that was forced to play what felt like a road game in the second round.But once they were victorious, it was clear they took pleasure from silencing the large Auburn contingent at Legacy Arena — only about a two-hour drive from the Tigers' campus in east Alabama..“It's crazy that we had to play Auburn in Birmingham,” backup guard Emanuel Sharp said to a group of teammates in the locker room.“Road warriors!” one of them shouted back.Houston improved to 17-1 in road and neutral-site games this season.BIG PICTUREAuburn: The Tigers wrapped up an inconsistent season in appropriate fashion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840142,"Van Lith, Louisville survive Drake March Madness upset bid","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Drake's offensive finesse controlled the first three quarters of their upset bid against Louisville.Cardinals guard Hailey Van Lith's grit and tenacious drives to the basket took over the fourth, and No 5 Louisville survived what would have been another dose of March Madness from the No. 12 Bulldogs.Van Lith scored 26 points, 13 of them coming over the final five minutes, to pull Louisville to an 83-81 win Saturday night in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. She played only 27 minutes because of early foul trouble.“I had a nice break there,"" Van Lith said. ""My team did a great job. of keeping us in the game while I wasn’t on the court. So that’s the only reason it was possible for us to win that game in the end. I was fully rested and ready to go.”Her three-point play off a layup out of timeout with 16 seconds left put Louisville up by four before Drake answered with a 3-pointer by Sarah Beth Gueldner. Van Lith then made two more free throws to all but seal the win for the Cardinals.Mykasa Robison scored 14 for Louisville (24-11), which advances to Monday's second round matchup of the winner between No. 4 Texas (25-9) and No. 13 East Carolina (23-9).A Final Four team last season, Louisville will be playing for a chance to advance to the Sweet 16 for the sixth consecutive NCAA Tournament.Katie Dinnebier scored 20 points for Drake (22-10), which confused Louisville's defense early with a series of backdoor cuts that had the Bulldogs shooting layup after layup. Anna Miller scored 17 for Drake.The Bulldogs had five players score in double figures and scored 42 points in the paint. They made 21 layups as Louisville struggled to close passing lanes and close down on shooters.“They abused us. It was a layup clinic. They pretty much scored at will,” Louisville coach Jeff Walz said. “The second half, they just missed some (layups). I thought we wore them out some by being as aggressive as we were trying to press full court.”Louisville did its best job on Maggie Bair, Drake's leading scorer and rebounder this season. She scored just five points on 2-of-10 shooting, and five six rebounds before she fouled out with just under four minutes to play.That was about the same time Van Lith took the game on her shoulders. Her mid-range jumper with 53 seconds left put Louisville ahead for good at 77-75. Miller had a chance to tie it again but missed a layup.“I think they’re just a very physical, aggressive team,"" Drake senior forward Grace Berg said.BIG PICTUREDrake: The Bulldogs have a solid history of reaching the NCAA Tournament with four appearances in the last seven seasons. But there have been no wins in that span. To change that, second-year coach Allison Pohlman will be leaning heavily on Berg, who has said she plans to return next season, and Miller, who took over a starting role the final third of the season. Berg scored 17.Bair said she will not be coming back for another season. Drake hasn’t won a tournament game since reaching the Sweet 16 in 2002.“It has nothing to do with anybody or anything at Drake,"" Barid siad. ""I just think I’m ready for a new chapter.”Louisville: The Cardinals are rarely on the road so early in the tournament but look quite comfortable in Texas. They aren't hosting the first two rounds for the first time since 2015, not including the 2021 pandemic tournament that was played entirely in the Lone Star State. Louisville twice advanced to the Final Four (2009 and 2013) opening the tournament away from home.QUICK BUT SLOPPY STARTThe game started at a frenetic pace as Louisville launched 21 shots in the opening quarter and Drake made 8 of 12. But Drake’s efforts to push the pace of the game also led to 14 first half turnovers that set up 14 Louisville points as the teams went to halftime tied 39-39. Drake had just five turnovers in the second half.CAN'T CLOSE IT OUTDrake went 0-5 in games decided by 10 points or less this season.UP NEXTLouisville will play Texas or East Carolina. They won a December matchup with the Longhorns 71-63 at a tournament in the Bahamas. The Cardinals did not play East Carolina this season.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

(AP) — Brandon Hagel had his second NHL hat trick, Steven Stamkos reached the 30-goal mark for the eighth time and the Tampa Bay Lightning rallied in the third period to beat the Montreal Canadiens 5-3 on Saturday night.Stamkos tied it at 3 at 3:14 of the third with a power-play one-timer. Hagel put the Lightning ahead to stay at 5:58 with his second of the game when his deflection of Mikhail Sergachev’s shot went past Samuel Montembeault.Hagel, playing his 200th NHL game on the first anniversary of being traded to the Lightning by the Chicago Blackhawks, completed his hat trick by hitting the empty net with 43.6 seconds remaining.“Last year, I was packing my stuff up a year ago and playing a hockey game tonight, and I wouldn’t have traded it for the world,” Hagel said. “I think I couldn’t have come to a better place.”Hagel’s ability to play up and down the lineup has impressed coach Jon Cooper.“You can put him anywhere,” Cooper said. “He’s like a Swiss army knife. You can put him on different lines and he blossoms in different roles. This year he’s showing all sides of how versatile he is, and so it’s good for him. You love to see guys like that get rewarded.”Victor Hedman also scored for Tampa Bay, which was coming off back-to-back road wins against the New Jersey Devils. Brian Elliott finished with 18 saves.“We stepped on the gas,” Hedman said of the Lightning’s third-period domination. “These are tough games. There’s not an easy game in this league and we knew that coming in. (Montreal) has lost games, but they’ve scored a lot of goals in those losses.”Mike Hoffman, Denis Gurianov and Jesse Ylonen scored, Nick Suzuki had two assists, and Montembeault made 36 saves for the Canadiens. They were coming off a 9-5 road loss to the Florida Panthers on Thursday night in which they allowed seven goals in the first period.“I felt that the group practiced hard yesterday; we were engaged, we worked on things, and tonight it showed,” Montreal coach Martin St. Louis said after his team fell to 1-7-2 in March. “I really love the fight of our group today and the engagement. I think it’s a step in the right direction for us, to allow ourselves to compete down the stretch in tough circumstances.”The Canadiens opened the scoring 5:12 into the game when Hoffman took Suzuki’s pass from the right boards and snapped a shot from the slot past Elliott. The Lightning got even at 11:31 when Hedman’s wrister from between the circles beat Montembeault.Tampa Bay went ahead 2-1 at 4:50 of the second period when Hagel took the rebound of Nikita Kucherov’s shot off the end boards and beat Montembeault from the right circle. But Montreal got even 1:29 later when Gurianov beat Elliott on a one-timer from the lower right circle, then went ahead 3-2 when Hoffman set up Ylonen’s power-play goal.Canadiens forward Jonathan Drouin dressed for the game but did not see the ice after missing a team meeting Friday.“Everyone has rules and accountability,” Drouin said. “I don’t want to be a special case.”St. Louis said he’s turning the page.“I think tonight was a fair thing, and Jo (Drouin) handed it tremendously well,” he said. “Me and (Drouin) have a great relationship. I got to know him a lot this year, and he’s had a great season for us this year. I love the kid, and for him to handle it the way he did, I gained even more respect for him.” UP NEXTCanadiens: Host Tampa Bay on Tuesday night.Lightning: Host New Jersey on Sunday night. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840145,Taiwan to experience warmer temperatures next week,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Northeasterly monsoon winds headed south yesterday (March 18), bringing cooler air across much of Taiwan, though this trend is not likely to last as temperatures are expected to rise day-by-day.Central and southern regions will see the mercury rise rapidly due to clear skies and bright sunshine during the start of the week, with noontime temperatures rising as high as 25 C on Sunday (March 19) according to a report by meteorologist Li Chih-sheng (李至晟) of Weather Risk.Li said that only windward areas in the northern and eastern half of Taiwan would experience more cloud cover, especially around Keelung, experiencing some intermittent rain with highs of around 20 C, with Taipei and Taoyuan experiencing more stable weather with temperatures around 20 to 23 C though still wet and cool on Sunday (March 19).Li said that Monday morning (March 20) will see a weather front brining moisture quickly passing through northern areas, leading to some drizzle or light rain in plains areas north of Miaoli. However, by morning rush hour this weather front will pass and isn’t expected to affect those heading to the office or school.The weather forecast for the week ahead includes warmer temperatures as Li believes that the lack of significant continental high pressure systems will give way to southwest and southerly winds continually bringing warmer air to Taiwan.From tomorrow (March 20), Li said temperatures around Taiwan will begin to warm day-by-day, with Wednesday to Thursday (March 22-23) being the warmest period. Northern Taiwan may even experience high temperatures above 30 C, creating a summer-like feeling.The lack of water vapor and thermal effects won’t help drought like situations in southern and central Taiwan. The only good news is that these areas will experience shifting winds that will improve air quality from the recent orange light warning to normal conditions.In northern areas, air quality will potentially worsen throughout the week as diffusion effects lessen and those sensitive to air quality will need to pay more attention to changing conditions.By the end of the week, the weather will be affected by the arrival of yet another northeasterly monsoon. Li forecasts increasing cloudiness beginning Friday afternoon in northern Taiwan with intermittent rain beginning next Saturday (March 25) and continuing into the following week.Li added that this weather front is currently still very weak and has yet to become a cold air mass and will provide little rainfall but not enough to relieve long-term drought conditions. Li urges citizens to slow their water consumption and save water as much as possible.",2023/3/19,943,Environment

Delegation members include group chairman Bob Stewart, Deputy Chairman Rob Butler, Sarah Atherton, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Afzal Khan, Marie Rimmer, and other lawmakers and parliamentary staff, according to a MOFA press release. This is the second visit by a U.K. parliamentary delegation since a group from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee visited Taiwan in November 2022, MOFA said.
During their stay, the delegation will meet President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁), and National Security Council Secretary-General Wellington Koo (顧立雄). They will also attend two banquets, one hosted by Legislative Speaker You Si-kun (游錫堃) and the other by Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮).
The delegation will visit the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Mainland Affairs Council, and other ministries, hold discussions with the Legislative Yuan’s Taiwan-U.K. Parliamentary Friendship Association, and visit cultural and economic institutions in the nation. Additionally, the lawmakers will exchange views with other Taiwan government departments and experts on issues such as Taiwan-U.K. relations, developments in the region, and economic resilience, MOFA said.










This is Stewart's second visit to Taiwan. As British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group chairman, he co-sponsored a proposal to hold a debate in the House of Commons about U.K.-Taiwan friendship and cooperation last February, MOFA said. He also sent letters to the U.K.’s Ministry of Defence and Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan-U.K. relations.
He also sent a letter to all members of the U.K. parliament, detailing the current situation of U.K.-Taiwan relations and China's military threat towards Taiwan. He called on lawmakers to firmly support Taiwan and deepen the friendship with Taiwan, MOFA said.
Taiwan and the U.K. are solid partners who share the values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights and have a close and friendly relationship, the ministry added.
At a time when authoritarianism continues to expand globally, the U.K. government and parliament continue to pay more attention to security in the Taiwan Strait, support Taiwan's participation in international organizations, and deepen bilateral relations, the foreign ministry said.
As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan will continue to work with like-minded partners such as the U.K. to strengthen the resilience of the global democratic community, support the development of democracy, and promote cooperation and exchanges in multiple fields, in order to jointly maintain peace, stability, prosperity, and sustainable development in the Indo-Pacific region.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomed the arrival of a delegation from the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group, which is in Taiwan for a six-day trip from March 19-24.Delegation members include group chairman Bob Stewart, Deputy Chairman Rob Butler, Sarah Atherton, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Afzal Khan, Marie Rimmer, and other lawmakers and parliamentary staff, according to a MOFA press release.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840170,Tourists hoping to see Arizona falls forced out by flooding,"PHOENIX (AP) — Shannon Castellano and Travis Methvin should have spent this weekend seeing world-famous waterfalls on the Havasupai Tribe Reservation in northern Arizona.Instead, the two friends from San Diego spent Friday night along with 40 other hikers camped out on a helipad. But sleep was elusive because tribal members warned that an emergency services helicopter could potentially land anytime during the night.“Yeah, so we didn’t really sleep,” Castellano said Saturday while driving to a hotel in Sedona. “I just kept one eye open really and one ear open ... You just do not expect any of that to happen. So, I think I’m still in shock that I’m not even there right now.”Tourists hoping to reach the breathtaking waterfalls on the reservation instead went through harrowing flood evacuations.The official Havasupai Tribe Tourism Facebook page reported Friday that flooding had washed away a bridge to the campground. An unknown number of campers were evacuated to Supai Village, with some being rescued by helicopter.The campground is in a lower-lying area than the village of Supai. Some hikers had to camp in the village. Others who weren’t able to get to the village because of high water were forced to camp overnight on a trail.But floodwaters were starting to recede as of Saturday morning, according to the tribe's Facebook post.Visitors with the proper permits will be allowed to hike to the village and campground. They will be met with tribal guides, who will help them navigate around creek waters on a back trail to get to the campground.Tourists will not be permitted to take pictures. The back trail goes past sites considered sacred by the tribe.Meanwhile, the tribe said in its statement that it has “all hands on deck” to build a temporary bridge to the campground.Abbie Fink, a spokesperson for the tribe, referred to the tribe's Facebook page when reached for comment Saturday.Methvin and Castellano decided to leave by helicopter Saturday rather than navigate muddy trails with a guide. Despite losing money on a pre-paid, three-day stay, Methvin says they can still try to salvage their trip. Having only received permits last month, he feels especially sad for hikers they met with reservations from 2020.“They waited three years to get there,” Methvin said. “At least we have the ability to go do something else versus having that whole weekend ruined. It sucks, but it’s making lemonade for us.”From Supai to Sedona, several areas of northern Arizona have been slammed this week by storms. The resulting snow combined with snowmelt at higher elevations has wreaked havoc on highways, access roads and even city streets.The flooding of the Havasupai campground comes as the tribe reopened access last month to its reservation and various majestic blue-green waterfalls — for the first time since March 2020. The tribe opted to close to protect its members from the coronavirus. Officials then decided to extend the closure through last year's tourism season.At the beginning of this year, President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration initiated by the Havasupai Tribe, freeing up funds for flood damage sustained in October. Flooding at that time had destroyed several bridges and left downed trees on trails necessary for tourists and transportation of goods into Supai Village.Permits to visit are highly coveted. Pre-pandemic, the tribe received an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 visitors per year to its reservation deep in a gorge west of Grand Canyon National Park. The area is reachable only by foot or helicopter, or by riding a horse or mule. Visitors can either camp or stay in a lodge.Castellano is already planning to try to get a permit again later this year if there are cancellations. “We just want to see i in all its glory, not muddy falls,” she said.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840171,"KU season ends with top players shut down, coach sitting out","DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Kansas' best two players were neutralized for long stretches, its point guard played on a sprained ankle in the second half, and the Jayhawks once again were without their Hall of Fame coach.It was all too much to overcome, even for a No. 1 seed desperately trying to keep alive its bid for a second straight national championship.The Jayhawks' 72-71 loss to No. 8 seed Arkansas on Saturday marked the third time in four NCAA Tournaments they have failed to make it out of the first weekend.Defending their 2022 title was always going to be extremely challenging. Only point guard Dajuan Harris Jr. and All-America forward Jalen Wilson were starters on the title team, and only four other returning players from last year played significant minutes.The season started with Self serving a self-imposed four-game suspension stemming from the 2017 NCAA investigation into the program, and it ended with him sitting out the last five games recovering from a procedure he had on March 8 to clear blocked arteries in his heart.“One thing about all year, no one is going to feel bad about anything that Kansas goes through,” Wilson said. “We have rallied through with each other and understood that it’s really us against everybody else.”Freshman Gradey Dick, a possible NBA lottery pick in June who had his first career double-double against Howard in the first round, was held to seven points and only got off three 3-point attempts against Arkansas' smothering defense.“We've dealt with that all year, but they have some long athletes that made it tough on him to get shots,” acting coach Norm Roberts said. “I don’t think we screened as well as we wanted to for him. Maybe we could have ran a few more things for him, but they did nullify him a little bit.”Wilson scored two baskets in the first four minutes of the second half and didn't make another field goal. He still finished with 20 points but had difficulty getting the ball in good position to score and collected nine of his points at the free-throw line.Harris sprained his right ankle going for a loose ball late in the first half. He returned for the second half to score eight of his 12 points but only had one assist after the break.The Jayhawks won the Big 12 regular-season title and lost by 20 points to Texas in the conference tournament championship game.Next year's roster is uncertain with Wilson and Dick likely heading to the NBA and others considering their options in the offseason.Self continues his recovery from having two stents placed in his heart to help treat blocked arteries. He went to the emergency room the night of March 8, shortly after watching the Jayhawks hold a final shootaround ahead of their Big 12 Tournament quarterfinal. Kansas went 3-2 in Self's absence.“Our guys have been terrific all year,” Roberts said. “They fought to the very end, made huge plays. It was tough not having Coach here, but we don’t make any excuses. We have to line up and get it done, and we came up a little bit short today.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840172,"Disu's 28 points lead Texas past Penn State, into Sweet 16","DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Dylan Disu had a season-high 28 points on 14-for-20 shooting, steadying Texas down the stretch after a late Penn State surge and leading the Longhorns to their first Sweet 16 in 15 years with a 71-66 victory in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Saturday night.The No. 2 seed Longhorns (28-8) were just 1 for 13 from 3-point land, so Disu turned this into a mid-range game. He went 5 for 5 over the last 4 1/2 minutes and grabbed 10 rebounds for good measure.“We've never played against a big man with that type of touch,"" Penn State's Seth Lundy said. “I don’t remember him missing, not one floater. He would do it from 10 feet, 15 feet, 5 feet.”Sir'Jabari Rice scored 13 points for Texas, which will play the Pittsburgh-Xavier winner on Friday in the Midwest Region semifinals in Kansas City, Missouri. The 11th-seeded Panthers and third-seeded Musketeers meet on Sunday.“A lot of my shots I took one dribble on, so that means my teammates had to find me first,” said Disu, who has family in Iowa and had several close relatives watching him at Wells Fargo Arena. “Credit to them and credit to the coaches for putting me in positions to score.”Camren Wynter had 16 points for the No. 10 seed Nittany Lions (23-14), who were coming off their first NCAA Tournament victory in 20 years as the capstone of rising star coach Micah Shrewsberry's second season.“These are my guys forever, because they took a chance on me,” said Shrewsberry, with red-eyed seniors Lundy, Myles Dread and Jalen Pickett next to him at the podium.Second-team All-American Jalen Pickett had 11 points and 10 rebounds with seven turnovers for Penn State. Andrew Funk (12 points) and Lundy (11 points) rallied after a scoreless first half for each, but the top two 3-point shooters in the Big Ten this season went a combined 4 for 16. Penn State was 8 for 28 from deep, despite a steady stream of clean looks in the second half.The outside shots that each team leaned on the first round mostly dried up, with the Longhorns going 31:18 without one until Rice — who hit seven 3s on Thursday — connected for a 55-48 lead.Then the Nittany Lions responded with a 10-0 run. Myles Dread hit his fourth 3-pointer of the game with 6:08 left to cut the deficit to one. After Wynter gave Penn State its first lead since 4-3 with a pair of free throws, Timmy Allen threw a wild pass into the backcourt for a Texas turnover that Lundy tracked down for a layup to make it 58-55.But Disu came back with three straight baskets — a layup, a jumper and a turnaround — to give Texas the lead back for good.Marcus Carr fouled Lundy on a 3-pointer with 4 seconds left for a four-point play that made it a one-possession game, but Carr finished off the game with a pair of free throws. After the final horn, Allen flashed a big smile as he approached Rice for a hug and yelled “Sweet 16, baby!”GREATER PURPOSETexas last went to a regional semifinal in 2008 and hasn't made the Final Four since 2003. Interim coach Rodney Terry was an assistant on that team, and the Longhorns have made no secret of their love for their unassuming, raspy-voiced leader who took over for Chris Beard in December. Beard was suspended and later fired over a since-dropped domestic violence charge.“What they’ve had to go through, these guys have been amazing,” Terry said.NO ‘D’ FOR DISUHailing from Pflugerville, Texas, just outside Austin, Disu joined the Longhorns last season after starting his career at Vanderbilt.Disu, the Most Outstanding Player of the Big 12 Tournament, is the tallest player at 6-foot-9 on this guard-dominant team. His long arms and ability to softly drop in rainbow floaters in and around the paint — a skill he recently added to his game — make him play bigger than he is.“Our game plan offensively was to really own the paint,” Terry said.Disu's scoring in an NCAA Tournament game was the most for Texas since Kevin Durant had 30 points in 2007, and the NBA star was watching from afar, tweeting his praise.SECURITY PERIMETERThe Longhorns squeezed Colgate’s best-in-the-country 3-point shooting in their first-round victory, when the Raiders went 3 for 15 from long range.Penn State presented the same perimeter threat, ranked fifth in the nation and fresh off a 13-for-23 clinic in its first-round win over Texas A&M. The Nittany Lions set the single-season Big Ten record for 3-pointers.This Texas defense has some teeth, though. Funk pulled up from the right wing for a 3-point try 14 seconds into the game that hit the front of the rim, a sign of how the night was going to unfold. Carr, Rice and Tyrese Hunter took turns following Funk around after he went 8 for 10 from deep on Thursday.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

Coby White made four 3-pointers and finished with 18 points, Zach LaVine also had 18 and Patrick Beverley added 17 as the Bulls shot 56.3% (45 for 80) from the field overall, including 17 for 34 from 3-point range.“No matter how well I shoot it, I’m 38% for my career from 3-point (range) for over a decade,” said Beverley, who shot 5 of 10 against Miami. ""No matter how well I shoot it, I think it’s the look of me that people want to leave me open. Keep letting them do it.“Everyone sees me as a defensive guy. They don’t see me as a 3-point shooter, but my numbers are there with the best of them.”Chicago nearly blew all of a 27-point lead after Nikola Vucevic converted a 3-point play with slightly more than 10 minutes left in the third quarter. Miami, led by 24 points from Jimmy Butler and 23 from Bam Adebayo, cut its deficit to 93-90 with nine minutes left.“It was more like we were playing on our heels and passively in the first half,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. “They got into a great groove. They really didn’t feel us at all in the first half. So even some shots they normally might not make, the basket just got bigger and bigger. Before we knew it, we surrendered 70 (in the first half).”The Bulls showed few signs of fatigue during the first half, one night after outlasting Minnesota 139-131 in two overtimes. They didn't need to rely heavily on DeRozan, who scored 49 points in 52 minutes against the Timberwolves or LaVine (39 in 47).Beverley scored 11 of his 14 first-half points during an 11-2 run that enabled the Bulls to expand their lead to 21 midway through the second quarter. But he drew his fifth foul with 7:14 left in the third quarter. The Heat were in the early stages of a 15-0 run during a six-minute stretch.Beverley had to leave briefly midway through the first quarter after claiming he got kicked on a jump shot by Jimmy Butler. White substituted for Beverley and sank three shots and stole a pass in the final six minutes of the quarter.“They didn't want to let DeMar get 49 points again,” said White, referring to DeRozan's season-high Friday. “They were doubling Zach because he's at a superstar level.”Bulls guard Alex Caruso left with 6:55 left in the second quarter because of a left mid-foot sprain and did not return.TIP-INSHeat: G Kyle Lowry (left knee soreness) was held out as part of an injury management plan as the Heat played the first of two games on back-to-back nights. “This is the plan for this week,” Spoelstra said. ""We're formulating the plan for next week. We'll see where we go from here."" Lowry played in three consecutive games after missing 15 straight because of soreness.Bulls: G Javonte Green (right knee soreness) was ruled after after experiencing soreness following consecutive days of practicing involving contact drills. “It was good progress,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “He put a few good days in.

He has 30, nine and nine. Extremely efficient on 12 shots. How do you get 30 on 12 shots? That’s ridiculous. I got to keep reminding guys that he is an All-NBA guy. That’s just a reminder that he’s that guy.”Six players scored in double figures for the Kings. Keegan Murray scored 19, Malik Monk added 17, De’Aaron Fox had 12 and Harrison Barnes 11. Sacramento shot a 22 for 37 from 3-point range, a season-best 59.5%, with five each from Murray, Davis and Monk.Murray felt Sabonis played a major role in the team’s performance from beyond the arc.“I think with Domas, he brings a lot of attention with him offensively,"" Murray said. ""With our offense, it’s just fluid. You never know what to expect. We can do different things at different times. Tonight we did that. We got a lot of open looks. We made shots.”Sacramento has won 11 of its last 13 games since the All-Star break and seven straight on the road. The Kings are tied with the Grizzlies at 43-27, four games behind the Nuggets in the race for the top spot in the Western Conference.“I think it’s just our backs against the wall,” Murray said. “We knew this was going to be a tough stretch for us. A lot of really good teams we had to play, a lot of wins that we had to get. I think we have just been playing 100% every single game and just see how the tables turn.”Kyle Kuzma scored 33 points and Bradley Beal added 20 for the Wizards, who have lost seven of their last nine games.The Kings led 71-60 at the break behind 18 points from Sabonis and four 3-pointers by Davis.“He hadn’t played in awhile,” Brown said of Davis. “He’s just a guy that continually keeps himself ready. He hit some timely shots for us. He had seven boards tonight which was fantastic to see. He was big.”Kessler Edwards, subbing for the injured Kevin Huerter, played tight defense on Beal, limiting the Wizards’ leading scorer to five points in the first half on 2-for-8 shooting while playing most of the second quarter with three fouls.Kuzma scored 20 in the first half, despite having to leave the game for five minutes early in the first due to a leg injury.TIP-INSKings: Edwards made his first start with Sacramento and second overall this season, replacing Huerter, who was out with mild right leg muscle strain.Brown likes Edwards youthful confidence on the floor: “His ability to offensive rebound, every possession he runs extremely hard, in transition with directions. For a young guy, he doesn’t seem to be afraid of the moment.”Brown gave forward Trey Lyles a rest day because of right shoulder soreness. “It’s not bad,” Brown said. “If it were a playoff game, he most likely would play.”Wizards: Coach Wes Unseld Jr. said newly signed forward Xavier Cooks completed his first workout with the team Saturday morning. Cooks made his NBA debut in the fourth quarter, playing five-plus minutes and grabbing one rebound. “Another guy with size, athleticism,” Unseld Jr. said.“He’s got the versatility to defend multiple positions.”Forward Corey Kispert started for center Krystaps Porzingis, who sat out with an illness.UP NEXTKings: At Utah Jazz on Monday night.Wizards: At Orlando Magic on Tuesday night.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

A lot of emotion out there, a lot of energy in the building. Obviously, nice to get that extra point. It was a fun one to be a part of.”Trailing 4-2 midway through the third period, Tkachuk tied it for Ottawa with two goals in a nine-minute stretch.Tkachuk beat Murray from the slot to pull the Senators within one with 9:18 left, and then got his second of the night and 30th of the season to tie it on the power play with 10.1 seconds remaining.“We always want to win, but in the end you always have to see the whole picture and fighting back against a team like that and two goals down, I think we did a great job to stay with it the whole time,” Stützle said. “We were there when we had to be and unfortunately really no luck in the shootout.”Stützle gave the Senators a 2-1 lead with a short-handed goal as he raced up the right side and fired a shot past Murray from the right circle for his 35th at 5:32 of the second.Marner scored on the power play to tie it just 37 seconds later for his 26th.Jarnkrok's one-time off a pass from Matthews put the Maple Leafs ahead at 9:16 of the middle period, and his second of the night and 17th of the season made it 4-2 at 9:39 of the third.“He’s a great player,” Matthews said of Jarnkrok. “I mean, he’s just so sneaky good at so many things. ...

(AP) — Jaren Jackson Jr. had 31 points and four blocks and the Memphis Grizzlies used a fourth-quarter push to defeat the Golden State Warriors 133-119 on Saturday night.Desmond Bane added 26 points for Memphis and Dillon Brooks finished with 18 points while shooting 7 of 10, including all four of his 3-point attempts.Jonathan Kuminga matched his season high with 24 points to lead the Warriors. Jordan Poole had 21 points and Stephen Curry scored 16, but was 5 of 15 from the field. Klay Thompson added 14 points on 6-of-17 shooting, part of the Warriors finishing the night at just 43%.The Grizzlies were able to close out the game capitalizing on the Warriors' mistakes and poor shooting. Golden State was 7 of 21 in the fourth quarter and made only one of its eight 3-point attempts.While Memphis outscored Golden State 29-19 in the final frame, no player reached double figures.“The ball's moving and multiple guys are getting opportunities,” Bane said. “Coming down the stretch when everybody's been involved in the game, it is easy to step up and knock down a big shot.”The Warriors faced a 14-point deficit in the third but made 16 of 19 free throws and a handful of 3-pointers to cut into Memphis' advantage. Golden State got within one possession a couple of times early in the fourth, but Memphis went on a 21-3 run to seal its fourth win in the last five games.“I think we stopped making simple plays,"" Draymond Green said of the Warriors' fourth-quarter collapse. ""We got back into the game just by making simple plays. Then you don't make simple plays and make a couple of mistakes.“We were fighting an uphill battle all night, so it's hard to continue to come back.”For the Grizzlies, it is a change from not so long ago when they struggled in the fourth quarter. They have played better closing games recently.“It's really on the defensive side when we're executing our game plan,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “That's the biggest thing. Holding teams to 19 points in the fourth quarter is really huge for us.”TIP-INSWarriors: Green returned after serving a one-game suspension in Friday's loss to Atlanta after picking up his 16th technical foul this season. He had 11 points, seven rebounds and five assists. ... The game was the second night of Golden State's 15 back-to-back games this season, the most in the league. “I'm glad this is our last one,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ... Golden State dropped to 7-29 on the road, leaving Kerr shaking his head. “Never in my wildest dream did I see this coming,” Kerr said of the road woes.Grizzlies: Tyus Jones had 13 points matched his career high with 14 assists. ...

The Grizzlies' All-Star guard was suspended eight games for displaying a gun while at a Colorado strip club in the early hours of March 4. While Morant is eligible to return to the team for Monday's game against Dallas, he is not expected to play in order to give him time to get back in shape after two weeks away from basketball.“We'll see when he gets back in the team environment on Monday,” Jenkins said. “But our anticipation is he is at least out on Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840180,North Korea launches missile into sea amid US-SKorea drills,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea launched a short-range ballistic missile toward the sea on Sunday, its neighbors said, ramping up testing activities in response to ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal.The North’s continuing missile tests showed its determination not to back down despite the U.S.-South Korea exercises, the biggest of their kind in years. But many experts say the missile tests are also part of North Korea's bigger objective to expand its weapons arsenal, win global recognition as a nuclear state and get international sanctions lifted.The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency open meeting Monday morning at the request of the United States, United Kingdon, Albania, Ecuador, France and Malta in response to North Korea's previous ICBM launch March 16.The missile launched Sunday from the North’s northwestern Tongchangri area flew across the country before landing in waters off its east coast, according to South Korean and Japanese assessments. They said the missile traveled about 800 kilometers (500 miles), a range suggesting the weapon could target South Korea.The chief nuclear envoys from South Korea, Japan and the U.S. discussed the launch by phone and strongly condemned it as a provocation and threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula and in the region. They agreed to strengthen coordination and issue a firm international response, according to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry.The launch was the North’s third round of weapons tests since the U.S. and South Korean militaries began joint military drills last Monday. The drills, which include computer simulations and field exercises, are to continue until Thursday.South Korea’s military said it will continue joint drills with the U.S. and maintain a readiness to “overwhelmingly” respond to any provocation. As part of the drills, the U.S. on Sunday flew long-range B-1B bombers for joint training with South Korean warplanes, according to South Korea’s Defense Ministry.North Korea is highly sensitive to the deployment of B-1Bs, which can carry a huge conventional weapons payload. It responded to the February flights of B-1Bs by test-launching missiles that demonstrated potential ranges to strike some air bases in South Korea.Japanese Vice Defense Minister Toshiro Ino said the most recent missile landed outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone and there were no reports of damage to vessels or aircraft. He said the missile likely had an irregular trajectory, a possible reference to North Korea’s highly maneuverable, nuclear-capable KN-23 missile.The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the latest launch doesn’t pose any immediate threat to the U.S. territory or its allies. But it said the North's recent launches highlight “the destabilizing impact of its unlawful” weapons programs and that the U.S. security commitment to South Korea and Japan remains “ironclad.”The weapons North Korea recently tested include its longest-range Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile designed to strike the U.S. mainland. The North’s state media quoted leader Kim Jong Un as saying that launch was meant to “strike fear into the enemies.”Thursday’s launch, the North’s first ICBM firing in a month, drew strong protests from Seoul, Tokyo and Washington. It came hours before South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol flew to Tokyo for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.At the summit, Yoon and Kishida agreed to resume their defense dialogue and further strengthen security cooperation with the U.S. to counter North Korea and address other challenges.Ties between Seoul and Tokyo suffered a major setback in recent years over issues stemming from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.But North Korea’s record run of missile tests last year — it launched more than 70 missiles in 2022 alone — pushed Seoul and Tokyo to seek stronger trilateral security partnerships involving Washington, which also wants to reinforce its alliances in Asia to better deal with China’s rise and North Korean nuclear threats.North Korea has missiles that place Japan within striking distance. Last October, North Korea fired an intermediate-range missile over northern Japan, forcing communities there to issue evacuation alerts and halt trains.After Sunday’s launch, Kishida ordered a prompt response, including working closely with South Korea and the U.S., according to Ino, the Japanese vice defense minister.A day before the start of the drills, North Korea also fired cruise missiles from a submarine. The North’s state media said the submarine-launched missile showed the country's resolve to respond with “overwhelming powerful” force to the intensifying military maneuvers by “the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet forces.”According to South Korean media reports, the U.S. and South Korea plan more training involving a U.S. aircraft carrier later this month after their current exercises end.The U.N. Security Council held an informal meeting Friday where the U.S., its allies and human rights experts shone a spotlight on the dire rights situation and increasing repression in North Korea. China and Russia denounced the meeting as a politicized move likely to further escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea's U.N. Mission issued a statement Sunday calling the meeting about “our non-existent `human rights issue'"" unlawful. It denounced the United States for waging a pressure campaign against human rights in the country as “a flagrant violation” of its dignity and sovereignty and accused Washington of being “the world's worst human rights violator.”The North's U.N. Mission said the U.S. held Friday's meeting “while staging the aggressive joint military exercise which poses a grave threat to our national security.""__Associated Press writers Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo and Edith M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840208,"EU says Serbia, Kosovo stop short of deal to normalize ties","Serbian and Kosovar leaders have reached a framework agreement on how to implement an EU-brokered plan to normalize relations, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrrell announced Saturday following marathon talks lasting 12 hours in Ohrid, North Macedonia.Still missing though was the implementation agreement, signatures of the two leaders and a significant breakthrough to ease decades of tension between Serbia and Kosovo.At a news conference in Ohrid, Borrell said Serbian leader Alexander Vucic and Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti ""reached an agreement on how to do it.""""The parties were not able to find a mutually acceptable solution as ambitious as we were providing or proposing,"" Borrell said, adding, ""It is about the stability, the security and the prosperity of the whole region.""Though neither side put pen to paper to sign it. Vucic and Kurti also continued to trade insults, blaming each other for the lack of progress.Last month, both sides hammered out an EU-backed 11-point plan to normalize relations.The move to ease tensions comes after decades of disputes following open conflict in the late 1990s.In 1998-1999, Serbia responded with force when Albanians, who form the majority in Kosovo, rebelled against Belgrade. Nearly 13,000 people died, most of them ethnic Albanians.NATO's military intervention in 1999 forced Serbia to withdraw, though NATO maintains a peacekeeping presence.In 2008, Kosovo declared itself independent from Serbia.Both Serbia and Kosovo have said they aspire to join the European Union. To do so, they must repair relations with one another.Resolving the dispute has become more urgent in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and wider concerns about Russia's reach potentially destabilizing the western Balkans.The draft agreement, provided by Germany and France, calls for Serbia and Kosovo to maintain good neighborly relations. They must also recognize each other's official documents and national symbols.The US supports the agreement, which stops short of seeing Serbia and Kosovo provide diplomatic recognition.If implemented, Belgrade would not block Kosovo's attempts to seek membership in the UN and other multilateral institutions.Under pressure from far-right groups in Serbia, Vucic appeared to backtrack after agreeing to the initial document last month.Serbian nationalists consider Kosovo the birthplace of the nation and the country's Orthodox Christian church. Roughly 120,000 ethnic Serbs remain in Kosovo, most of whom continue to identify with Belgrade over Prishtina.On Thursday, Vucic said he ""won't sign anything"" in Ohrid. Earlier, he vowed that he would never recognize Kosovo or allow it to have UN membership. He repeated Saturday that he had not signed the implementation document.ar/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/3/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840209,UBS holds talks to save Credit Suisse — report,"Credit Suisse is in advanced talks to be taken over by its larger Swiss rival UBS, the Financial Times (FT) reported Saturday.The beleaguered lender was given a $54 billion (€50 billion) lifeline by the country's central bank this week after investor confidence evaporated due to years of scandals, multi-billion dollar losses and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.But the liquidity boost has failed to restore trust in the 167-year-old lender, whose shares have lost more than 75% of their value over the past twelve months.Citing two unnamed sources, the FT said UBS was negotiating to buy all or part of Credit Suisse, with the blessing of Swiss regulators.The Swiss National Bank (SNB) — the country's central bank — ""wants the lenders to agree on a simple and straightforward solution before markets open on Monday,"" one of the sources told the paper.The FT said the source acknowledged there was ""no guarantee"" of a deal but that the government was prepared to use emergency measures to fast track the merger.One of the sources said significant obstacles were raised at the talks and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combine.Bloomberg said another sticking point was Credit Suisse's investment banking business, which has underperformed.The proposed plan could see Credit Suisse's domestic business spun off, the FT said.Credit Suisse, the SNB and the Swiss financial watchdog FINMA all declined to comment about the talks.Reuters news agency cited an unnamed source as saying that UBS is asking the Swiss government to cover about $6 billion in purchasing costs.The cash would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges, two people told Reuters.The Swiss competition commission could also raise eyebrows depending on how the takeover is configured.Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Bank was also looking at the possibility of buying some of Credit Suisse's assets.A merger between Credit Suisse and UBS has been mooted before being dismissed due to monopoly concerns.Swiss government officials held an urgent meeting with banking experts at the finance ministry in the capital Bern on Saturday evening, the Neue Zurcher Zeitung newspaper reported.Credit Suisse is the biggest name ensnared in the turmoil unleashed by the collapse of US lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past week.The bankruptcy sparked a rout in banking stocks, prompting authorities to rush out extraordinary measures to keep banks afloat and prevent contagion.Like UBS, Credit Suisse is one of 30 financial institutions around the world deemed too big to fail, because of its systemic importance to the entire banking system.The Zurich-based lender has been beset by scandals in recent years, and in 2022, suffered a net loss of $7.9 billion. It expects a ""substantial"" pre-tax loss this year.""This is a bank that never seems to get its house in order,"" IG analyst Chris Beauchamp commented in a market note this week.Despite this week's central bank injection, Credit Suisse struggled to regain the confidence of investors and by Friday evening Credit Suisse was worth just over $8.7 billion.The FT reported that Credit Suisse customers withdrew 10 billion Swiss francs ($10.8 billion, €10.1 billion) in deposits in a single day late last week — a measure of how trust in the bank has vaporized.mm/sms (AFP, Reuters)",2023/3/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840210,US attempting to deter Honduras from severing ties with Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. is trying to dissuade Honduras from switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, Reuters cited sources familiar with the matter as saying.
President of Honduras, Xiaomara Castro, on Tuesday (March 14) revealed in a tweet that she had instructed Honduras Foreign Minister Eduardo Reina to oversee the process of forming official ties with Beijing. She justified her decision as being “a sign of my determination to fulfill the government plan and expand borders.”
However, she has yet to officially recognize Beijing, leaving bilateral ties with Taiwan in an awkward state of limbo.
""We truly don't know whether it will be days or weeks or months,"" Reuters quoted a U.S. government official as saying. ""Is it a negotiating tactic? We don't know for sure, but we will continue to make our case.""










John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama, said he received “an hour heads up,"" even after he had talked to the president when the nation switched recognition to Beijing in 2017.
The U.S. may choose to cut aid to the Central American country if it follows through on its decision to sever ties with Taiwan, which is authorized by the 2020 Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act. The act gives the Department of State the authority to expand, reduce, or terminate U.S. aid to countries depending on whether they improve, worsen, or sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Castro had pledged to recognize Beijing during her presidential campaign but seemingly backtracked once she took office.
Chinese Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Xie Feng (謝峰) met with Reina in January when the two both attended Brazilian President Lula da Silva’s inauguration. The two ministers reportedly discussed potential cooperation on the Patuca II hydropower project in Honduras.
However, Reina later stressed that the conversation with Xie ""was a purely commercial issue, we maintain the relationship with Taiwan.”
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Tah-ray Yui (俞大㵢) met with Honduran Ambassador to Taiwan Harold Burgos on Wednesday morning (March 15), expressing serious concern over Honduras President Xiomara Castro's decision to establish diplomatic ties with China, per a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release.
Yui reiterated that Taiwan and Honduras have been friends for more than 80 years. Over the years, Taiwan has promoted many cooperation projects with the Honduran government to benefit the people of the two countries, he said.
""Taiwan is a sincere and reliable ally of Honduras,"" he said.
""The government and people of Taiwan have always assisted in Honduras' development and construction within the scope of their capabilities and have lent a helping hand when it was most needed,"" Yui added, which is in contrast to the ""flashy promises"" made by the Chinese dictatorship.
Beijing intends to wrest control of Taiwan's diplomatic relations and reduce Taiwan's international space, the vice minister said. He reminded Honduras to carefully consider its decision and not to ""fall into China's trap"" by damaging the long-term friendship between Taiwan and Honduras.
Reina later explained to Honduras’ Canal 5 television channel that the Honduran government had requested Taiwan to double its annual US$50 million in aid and consider ""realigning"" its US$600 million debt, but did not receive positive responses, AFP reported.
He said that Honduras has energy needs and growing debt, which is ""drowning the country.""
If Honduras ends up officially establishing ties with China, Taiwan will have 13 remaining diplomatic allies.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840211,UCLA beats Northwestern 68-63 to advance to Sweet 16,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The best news for UCLA came after the Bruins finished off their second-round win over Northwestern.Key guard David Singleton didn't break his ankle when he went down with an injury late in UCLA's 69-63 victory over Northwestern on Saturday night, giving the Bruins hope that he might be able to return when they play in the Sweet 16 next week.“I knew it wasn’t that bad,” said Singleton, who was on the court in pain for a few minutes before being helped to the locker room. “I broke my foot before. I didn’t feel it pop or anything. It was just hurting at the moment. I’m fine. I’m just going to get with my trainer.”Coach Mick Cronin said the injury conjured up bad memories from two decades ago when he was an assistant at Cincinnati and star Kenyon Martin broke his leg right before the tournament.Now he hopes to get Singleton back to a thin lineup already missing injured defensive stopper Jaylen Clark.“I was having flashbacks to when I had a full head of hair in the spring of 2000 running out there and Kenyon Martin was playing there,"" Cronin said. “Looks like he’s got a bad sprain. ... I’m just happy he didn’t break his ankle. It’s been crazy for us here lately.”Jaime Jaquez Jr. scored 24 points and UCLA withstood a second-half push from Northwestern to get back to the Sweet 16.The second-seeded Bruins (31-5) turned up the defensive intensity late, holding the seventh-seeded Wildcats to 1-for-12 shooting during a key late-game stretch to seal the win.“We started getting up, switching up into them, bringing up the pressure again like in the first half,” Jaquez said. “I think we shied away from it (early) in the second half with just light switching. I think we picked it up a lot more.”UCLA made it to a third straight Sweet 16 for the first time in 15 years. The Bruins will play the winner of Sunday’s game between Gonzaga and TCU in the West Region semifinals in Las Vegas, on Thursday night.Amari Bailey added 14 points and Tyger Campbell scored 12 for UCLA.Boo Buie scored 18 points to lead Northwestern (22-12), Matthew Nicholson added 17 and Chase Audige scored all 16 of his points in the second half.“I wasn’t surprised the way we played in the second half because that’s what these guys have been, that’s what our team has been all year long,” coach Chris Collins said. “We have a fighter’s spirit. ... I could not have been prouder of my guys.”The Wildcats ended their second trip to the tournament in the same fashion as the first six years ago, losing in the second round.They put up a good fight against the more tournament-tested Bruins and had a chance until going cold from the field late in the game.The key moment came in the final two minutes when Adem Bona blocked a drive by Audige, sending UCLA out in transition. David Singleton hit the 3-pointer that put the Bruins up 62-56 with 1:50 to play.UCLA controlled the game early and built the big lead by neutralizing Northwestern's high-scoring backcourt of Buie and Audige and getting Jaquez out in transition.Buie finally made his first basket of the game with a drive just before the buzzer to cut UCLA's lead to 35-25 at the break.Audige got going in the second half with 14 points in the first eight minutes. The Wildcats tied it at 45 when Buie was credited with a basket on a goaltending call midway through the half.But they couldn't close the deal.“This is what we wanted, an eight-minute fight,"" Collins said. ""Give UCLA credit. Every time we made a run, they made big plays.”BIG PICTURENorthwestern: The Wildcats followed up their first tournament appearance with losing records the next five seasons. Collins got them back into second place in the Big Ten in the regular season and now looks to build from there.UCLA: Bona returned after missing the last two games with a left shoulder injury. He aggravated the injury on a dunk in the second half and went to the bench immediately but did return to the game and had the key block late. His presence will be key next weekend.UP NEXTUCLA is two wins shy of its 20th Final Four appearance.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Adam Wainwright will start for the U.S. against Cuba.Venezuela second baseman and Houston Astros star Jose Altuve left in the fifth with a right hand injury after he was hit by a pitch from Daniel Bard. The Astros said there will be an update on his status Sunday.Trailing 7-5, the United States loaded the bases in the eighth on a walk, single and hit by pitch against losing pitcher Jose Quijada. Silvino Bracho relieved and Turner, the No. 9 batter in the U.S. lineup, sent his 0-2 changeup 407 feet to deep left field for the third grand slam in American WBC history.“Individually, I think this is probably the biggest hit that I’ve had ... probably right up there with any hit I’ve ever had,” Turner said.U.S. manager Mark DeRosa said Saturday's win was one of the three greatest game's he's ever been a part of — including winning the World Series with the San Francisco Giants in 2010.“I told the guys before the game, I wanted to match their passion,” said DeRosa, who once played for the Venezuelan professional team Leones del Caracas. “I had played over there. I had been a part of that, coming out of the dugout and jumping around ... When Trea clipped that ball, honestly, I saw about 35 guys, including the coaches, kind of black out and lose their minds for a minute. So it was just an awesome moment.”David Bednar, the fifth of seven U.S. pitchers, got the win and Ryan Pressly finished with three straight outs for the save.Luis Arraez, playing the ballpark that he'll soon call home with the Miami Marlins, had the first multihomer game of his professional career and drove in four runs for Venezuela.The U.S. team boasts a roster of big names that many picked to repeat as WBC champions.All nine batters in the U.S. starting batting order were All-Stars, including Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts, Los Angeles Angels center fielder Mike Trout, Cardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and third baseman Nolan Arenado.The U.S. is in the top six in the tournament in batting average (.296), RBIs (34) and hits (48), and every American starter had a hit against Venezuela, which had gone 4-0 in group play.“Unfortunately, this is baseball,” Venezuela manager Omar López said. “We have to accept this and as men we have to keep our heads up. It is not easy, especially when they came back in the game.”Venezuela took a 6-5 lead in a four-run fifth after Ronald Acuña Jr.’s sacrifice fly to deep center.Salvador Perez drove in the tying run with a line-drive double that sneaked just inside the left-field foul line.Arraez hit a two-run drive to right field in the first off Lance Lynn, his first home run in his new home park, and added another high off the right field foul pole in the seventh against Bednar to give Venezuela a two-run lead. Arraez, the reigning AL batting champion, was traded to the WBC host Miami Marlins this offseason after four seasons in Minnesota.Bard replaced Lynn with a 5-2 lead in the fifth and loaded the bases with two walks, an infield hit and the pitch that injured Altuve.Bard was pulled after Gleyber Torres scored on a wild pitch to make it 5-3 and Arraez hit an RBI groundout against Jason Adam.The U.S. hit five straight singles to start the game. Betts led off the first with an infield single, then the speedster raced from first to third on Trout’s single to center, scoring when he forced a throwing error by Acuña.Kyle Tucker homered for the U.S. in the fifth off Astros teammate Luis Garcia.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

He nimbly denied Pittsburgh forward Mikael Granland with a sprawling save five minutes into the third period to preserve the shutout, the 10th of his career. His other one this season was a 1-0 home win over Philadelphia on Nov. 1.“When you put in hard and honest work, miracles happen,'' Shesterkin said through a translator. ”We played wonderfully today — scored many, many goals. Honestly, I hope the fans loved it. We're playing for them.""The Penguins lost their third straight and trail the Rangers by 12 points for third place in the Metropolitan Division. Pittsburgh, still in wild-card position, is trying to reach the playoffs for the 17th straight time.“Tonight was a humbling experience for all of us,'' coach Mike Sullivan said. ”At this time of year, you have to have a short memory. We still have control of our destiny.""Patrick Kane and defenseman K’Andre Miller also had two assists apiece as New York improved to 7-1-1 in its last nine home games against Pittsburgh. The Rangers are five points behind the second-place New Jersey Devils, who lost at Florida on Saturday.“This was a big game for our goalie and our team,'' Panarin said. ""If you work at playing the right way, you have opportunities for goals.”Since Dec. 5, when they turned around their season with a 6-4 comeback win at home over St. Louis, the Rangers are 29-9-5.As he did on Thursday when the Rangers beat the Penguins 4-2, Zibanejad opened the scoring. He got his team-leading 36th goal at 5:10 of the first, beating Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry. Trouba and Miller assisted.Panarin made it 2-0 at 19:49 on the power play, whipping the puck past Jarry from the left circle off a pass from Adam Fox.Tarasenko increased the lead at 3:54 of the second with his fifth goal since joining the Rangers in a trade with St. Louis on Feb. 9. Tarasenko has points in 10 of his first 18 games with the Rangers.Kreider made it 4-0 at 6:43 with his 31st goal and third in two games against the Penguins. Kane and Vincent Trocheck assisted on Kreider’s 260th career goal, which moved the Rangers forward within two of Vic Hadfield for fifth place on the franchise list.New York won Thursday when Kreider scored the go-ahead goal in the third and added an empty-netter.After Casey DeSmith replaced Jarry in net following Kreider’s goal, Trouba beat the replacement with a sharp-angle shot at 8:39 for his eighth to increase the margin to 5-0. Trouba has points in six of his last eight games.Panarin scored again at 16:38 of the second — his 22nd goal of the season — to make it 6-0, with assists to Kane and Filip Chytil.“We're building chemistry, building every day and every game,” Kane said.Panarin has points in eight of his last 10 games and leads the Rangers with 77 points overall, while Kane has seven points in his last six games.“It’s nice to see that many great players on your team,” added Panarin, whose first two NHL seasons were played alongside Kane with the Chicago Blackhawks. “We're happy tonight.”Zibanejad assisted on goals by Tarasenko and Trouba and has 25 points — including 14 goals — over his last 20 games.""It was just one of those nights when the puck goes in for us,'' Zibanejad said. “And obviously Igor gives us a boost making all those saves.”NOTES: The Penguins were missing defenseman Jeff Petry after he was hit with an unpenalized elbow from Rangers forward Tyler Motte on Thursday. … Pittsburgh also scratched defenseman Jan Rutta and forward Dalton Heinen and played defenseman Mark Friedman for the first time since Feb. 11. … The Rangers were without injured defenseman Ryan Lindgren for the 10th straight game.UP NEXTPenguins: Host the Ottawa Senators on Monday.Rangers: Host the Nashville Predators on Sunday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840214,"Fans embracing PSL, despite national team woes","LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan had a dismal home international cricket season, but over the last five weeks stadiums in four major cities were packed with thousands of spectators to witness a quality brand of modern-day Twenty20 cricket.Over 25,000 spectators -- mostly supporting the home team Lahore Qalandars -- saw their team edge out Multan Sultans by just one run in an epic final at Gaddafi Stadium and became the first Pakistan Super League franchise to successfully defend the title in eight editions of the tournament.The vociferous crowd got behind Pakistan premier fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi-led Lahore which beat Multan Sultans, led by one of world’s top T20 wicketkeeper-batters, Mohammad Rizwan in a last ball finish.Only hundreds of spectators had turned up during Pakistan’s home international cricket season in stadiums with Pakistan drawing four test matches and losing three beside finishing on the wrong side of the result in five of the eight T20s internationals it hosted.But fans came out in big numbers at Karachi, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan for the enthralling PSL games that also featured Peshawar Zalmi, captained for the first time by Pakistan all-format skipper Babar Azam; two-time champion Islamabad United and former title-holders Karachi Kings and Quetta Gladiators.When the Pakistan Cricket Board conceived the idea of PSL, it’s primary objective was to bring back international cricket which was suspended since 2009 when terrorists attacked a Sri Lanka cricket team bus in Lahore. Gradually foreign teams started touring Pakistan and after hosting the first season of PSL in the United Arab Emirates, the PCB brought back its premier T20 league back in the country.“The league has now grown bigger and stronger by the year,” PCB Managing Committee’s head Najam Sethi told the AP. “The credit for this goes not just to PCB but also to the passionate cricket-loving Pakistanis who have thronged to the stadiums for the eighth edition (of PSL).”Sethi, who is also a renowned journalist and had previously served as chairman of the PCB, was reappointed at the helm of the PCB late in December last year in place of Ramiz Raja.Sethi recognizes Pakistan’s economic problems along with political unrest, but believed the PSL could still turn into a brand in its own right. Sethi claimed at times, during the eighth edition of the tournament, it attracted more eyeballs around the world than the India Premier League.“At halfway stage of PSL8 I was told by my team that our digital numbers had hit 150 million. The figures in IPL, during the same stage of the tournament, were 130 million,” Sethi said.The PCB head said he was “shocked” when he was told that only $100,000 had been set aside for the branding of PSL in late December. Sethi increased the money to $1 million after convincing the six franchise owners to bear half the amount.“I went to Dubai and saw all the drafts (of branding),” Sethi said. “I went through all the technical details, approved it and increased the branding budget to 10 times.”Sethi is interested to add two more teams, with the approval of six present franchises, in the PSL and make it a bigger league.“It should be a win-win situation for everyone,” he said. “Next month we will decide how to add two more teams and after 10 years how to tweak the model of PSL.”It is the first time that the PCB organized PSL at four venues with Multan and Karachi hosting the first leg of the tournament before the league was moved to Rawalpindi and Lahore.Sethi said it was tough learning for the PCB to organize 34 league games in four cities, but it has given them enough experience, if in future, it hosts the event abroad with United States as one of the potential venues.“We were managing two production teams and many a time the turnaround time was very tight, but their undying spirit and resolve made sure that we never faced any obstacles,” he said, adding that the PCB even sought help from Pakistan Air Force, which provided a C-130 aircraft on a short notice when production equipment had to be transported from Karachi to Lahore during the tournament.The quality of cricket played during the tournament also impressed Sethi with most of the Pakistani players dominating the tournament. There was a run-fest in Rawalpindi where a T20 world record 515 runs were scored in a game between Multan Sultans and Quetta Gladiators with opening batter Usman Khan scoring the fastest ever PSL century off 36 balls.Multan also chased over 240 against Peshawar in Rawalpindi, while Jason Roy of England recorded the highest ever individual PSL score of 145 not out while representing Quetta against Peshawar in another over-240 run-chase.Multan’s two fast bowlers Abbas Afridi and Ihsanullah finished as tournament’s top wicket-takers, claiming 23 and 22 wickets respectively with Afridi also recording the only hat-trick in the tournament.“We produced pitches that supported batting and bowling and provided perfect setting for evenly contested matches,” Sethi said. “Never before we saw as many as seven centuries being scored in one edition of PSL.”PSL might still be far behind the cash-rich IPL, but it has made several stars not only for Pakistan but for other countries like Harry Brook of England, Tim David of Australia and revived the international career of South Africa’s Rilee Rossouw.“PSL has been a great asset globally, but obviously also for Pakistan,” Sethi said.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840216,"Fear, grief follow deadly quake on Ecuador's southwest coast","QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — Some affectionally call Machala the ""Banana Capital of the World."" This port community on Ecuador's Pacific coast is home to about a quarter million people and normally bustles with commercial activity. But not this weekend, not after the deadly quake.Grief hung in the air on Sunday, a day after a powerful temblor rocked this city, toppling homes and buildings along the coast and as far off as the Ecuadorian highlands and even parts of Peru.Rubble covered some streets of Machala. Neighbors held simple funerals to bury the dead. A pier was no more. And a day after the quake that killed nine residents alone along this hard-hit coast, many in Machala were feeling anguished and uneasy.“The city is quiet, fear and mourning are felt,” resident Luis Becerra said. “You feel the pain, the drama, wherever you go. Everyone is alert, with great fear in case"" a major aftershock.The quake, which the U.S. Geological Survey reported at magnitude 6.8, killed at least 15 people and injured more than 445 others. Fourteen died in Ecuador, and one in Peru.The quake damaged and brought down hundreds of homes and buildings in vastly different communities, both in coastal areas and the highlands. But in Ecuador, regardless of geography, many of the homes that crumbled had much in common: many were old, did not meet modern building standards of a quake-prone country and many of their inhabitants were poor.Yajaira Albarracín, Graciela Chila, Silvina Zambrano Chila and two children died under the rubble of their home in a low-income neighborhood of Machala. On Sunday, a few neighbors stopped by a tent where the caskets of the women where set out with floral arrangements and a crucifix. Some relatives said rescuers found the bodies of the women and children as if they had been clutching one another when disaster struck.The earthquake was centered just off the Pacific Coast, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Guayaquil, Ecuador’s second-largest city. Of the country’s 14 victims, 12 died in the southwest coastal state of El Oro, which includes Machala, and two in the highlands state of Azuay.Ecuador is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. In 2016, a quake centered farther north on the Pacific Coast killed more than 600 people.Machala resident Hamilton Cedillo said Sunday that he and his family barely slept in the hours afterward, fearful of deadly aftershocks. They have come up with an evacuation plan and watched videos on how to protect themselves should another quake strike.“I am afraid of leaving and that my family will be left here alone at home,” Cedillo said.Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims during his weekly Sunday noon blessing.“I’m close to the Ecuadorian people and assure them of my prayers for the dead and suffering,” Francis said.Ecuador’s government issued an emergency declaration covering the roads in Azuay, where the quake debris cut off several roads and worsened already poor conditions attributed to the winter’s rainstorms. One of the victims was a passenger in a vehicle crushed by rubble from a house in the community of Cuenca.In El Oro, according to the Risk Management Secretariat, Ecuador’s emergency response agency, several people were trapped under rubble or in damaged buildings.Quito-based architect Germán Narváez said houses hit hardest tend to be poorly built, lacking solid foundations, and deficient in structure and technical design. He added that the houses most vulnerable are often old and built with materials such as adobe, once frequently used in the region.“At critical moments of seismic movements, they tend to collapse,” he said.Juan Vera lost three relatives when the earthquake brought down his niece’s home. The government has offered to pay for the woman’s funeral and those of her baby and her partner.Now, Vera wonders why local authorities ever allowed his relatives to live there to begin with, saying the municipality should better regulate building conditions and ensure only those that are really safe are rented out or occupied.“Because of its age, that building should have been demolished already,” Vera said of the place where his relatives died. ___Garcia Cano reported from Caracas, Venezuela.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840217,"Duke rejoins March Madness, defeats Iona in first round","DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Celeste Taylor and Elizabeth Balogun each scored 13 points and Duke marked its return to NCAA Tournament action with an 89-49 romp past Iona on Saturday night.It was the first NCAA Tournament win for Duke since 2018, when it last had a spot in the tournament. Duke has won at least one NCAA Tournament game in all 25 seasons when it has been in the field.Duke’s Kara Lawson, who appeared in three Final Fours as a Tennessee player, coached in an NCAA Tournament game for the first time.“I thought our team started the game with great intensity,” Lawson said. “I thought there was a preparedness about them. All of our players who played tonight were really locked in to what we were trying to do. And that’s what you hope for as a coach in March.”Kennedy Brown and Jordyn Oliver added 10 points apiece as the Blue Devils shot 57.1% from the field.Third-seeded Duke (26-6) will face sixth-seeded Colorado, an 82-60 winner over Middle Tennessee in the site’s first game, in Monday’s second round.Lawson has the Blue Devils in a confident mood.“She just keeps reminding us how great we are,” Balogun said.“Coach always believes in us,” Oliver said. “She always told us throughout the whole year that we’re a confident team.”Ketsia Athias led No. 14 seed Iona (26-7) with 20 points. Juana Camilion had 12.“Obviously not the way we would want to end our season,” Iona coach Billi Chambers said. “We’re not going to allow one game to take away from what this group has done this season.”Duke led 47-16 at halftime, shooting 60.6% from the field. Ten players scored for the Blue Devils in the first half.Duke’s late-season scoring snags didn’t resurface, aided by 25 second-chance points and a 14-0 advantage in fast-break scoring.“I feel like most of the year we’ve generated quality transition opportunities,” Lawson said. “We played a lot on the move tonight and that was good to see.”In part because of 13 turnovers, Iona managed only 20 shots from the field in the first half and attempted just one free throw.“This stage was just a little bit big,” Chambers said.Duke scored the game’s first eight points, but Iona had the next six. Then the Gaels only had four points in the next nine-plus minutes extending into the second quarter. By then, Duke was up 32-10.“We tried our best and it didn’t work,” Camilion said.Duke ended up with a 44-14 rebounding advantage.BIG PICTUREIona: The Gaels couldn’t get on track and posted their second-lowest point total in any half of the season while allowing the most first-half points this season.Duke: The Blue Devils hadn’t scored more than 44 points in their last three games, so seeing the ball go in the basket was a bonus. Duke has five victories this season with margins of 40 or more points.UP NEXTDuke will play Monday at home against sixth-seeded Colorado. ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840222,"Markkanen's scoring, Kessler's block lifts Jazz past Celtics","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Lauri Markkanen scored 28 points and Walker Kessler had a game-saving block to help the Utah Jazz to a 118-117 comeback win over the Boston Celtics on Saturday night.Grant Williams, who had 23 points and a career-high seven 3-pointers, was driving for a potential game-winner but ran into Kessler, who blocked his shot just before the final buzzer.“I figured he was going to shot fake so I stayed down and tried to time it as best as I could and I got a hand on it,” Kessler said about his rejection at the rim.The play was designed to go to Jayson Tatum on a dribble handoff, but Williams had 12 points in the fourth quarter and took it to the hoop.“I’m not frustrated at Grant. If he made it, everybody would be happy. It’s not why we lost, that last play,” Tatum said.Talen Horton-Tucker had 19 points and Ochai Agbaji added 16 for the Jazz, who overcame a 19-point deficit to win and stay in the thick of the Western Conference playoff race.“We want to make the playoffs,” said Markkanen of his team that was universally picked near the bottom of the league before the season began. “That playoff intensity will just help this young team grow.”Jaylen Brown scored 25 points, Malcolm Brogdon had 16 and Tatum finished with 15, but was shut out in the second half as the short-handed Celtics were playing their third game in four nights.“Our physicality waned,” Williams said. “They started playing more aggressive and … we started playing a little more passively.”The Jazz played a hybrid zone defense at times and doubled Tatum whenever they could on the perimeter. That left other Celtics wide open, especially in the corners as the Jazz scrambled to keep up.The Celtics (49-23) made 22 3-pointers, one off their season high, but missed enough down the stretch for the Jazz to pull off the win.“Our defensive intensity picked up and our communication got better,” Utah coach Will Hardy said.After Brown’s 3-pointer gave the Celtics a 117-113 lead with 1:19 to play, Markkanen made a 3-pointer and Horton-Tucker drove for a layup while Tatum missed two jumpers.But the Jazz allowed the Celtics one last chance when Horton-Tucker dribbled for 20 seconds and then lost the ball out of bounds.Kessler, who had 12 points and 14 rebounds, saved Utah’s comeback effort with the defensive play of the game and his third blocked shot.Kelly Olynyk had 13 points, 13 rebounds and six assists for the Jazz (34-36), who have won three of four.The Jazz hadn’t played a home game since Feb. 28 and were coming off five days of rest after a six-game trip.Meanwhile, the injury-riddled Celtics were looking for someone to score, and the Jazz were daring somebody other than Tatum to beat them.“I was just playing the game the right way. They were trying to get the ball out of my hands,” Tatum said.Williams nearly pulled it off, but was one shot short.Regular Boston starters Marcus Smart (hip) and Al Horford (back) missed the game. Fortunately, Brogdon (Achilles) made his return.The Jazz weren’t at full strength either, with Jordan Clarkson (thumb) and Collin Sexton (hamstring) on the injured list.Despite Tatum going scoreless in the third quarter, Brogdon hit a 3 and fed Luke Kornet for a dunk to power a 16-3 Boston run and make it 91-85 with 39 seconds left in the third.The Celtics led 64-57 at the half on the strength of 13 3-pointers and Tatum’s three free throws after being fouled with 0.4 seconds left in the second quarter.THE DO-FLY ZONEOlynyk and Markkanen asked Hardy to revisit the zone the Jazz had tried without much success earlier in the season.It looked like a 1-3-1 zone at times with switching and doubling, especially when Tatum or Brown had the ball. Once the Jazz went down 19, Hardy didn’t feel like he had much to lose.“He’s super open-minded. He’s an outside-the-box thinker and loves that kind of stuff and all the different opportunities and possibilities,” Olynyk said.Markkannen lobbied for it because of the team’s youth and athleticism with Kessler as the anchor.“It’s chaos,” Markkanen said. “Just flying around, really trying to mess up their rhythm and make them hesitate on their decision making.”TIP-INS Celtics: Robert Williams III (hamstring) missed his eighth game in a row, while Payton Pritchard (heel) has been held out of six straight. … Brown was called for a Flagrant Penalty 1 on Walker Kessler’s drive with 1:43 to play, but Kessler missed both free throws. … The Celtics committed six turnovers.Jazz: Outscored Boston in the paint, 48-30. ... Kelly Olynyk got a technical when he was on the bench in the first quarter. … The Jazz outrebounded the Celtic 56-40 and had 20 second-chance points.UP NEXTCeltics: At Sacramento on Tuesday to finish their season-high six-game road trip.Jazz: Host Sacramento on Monday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

He added it’s the responsibility of everyone to work together on party-related issues.The KMT will now revert to a Central Nomination Committee to nominate party candidates in 2024. There is speculation that mayors and local leaders, such as Hou, will be invited to join the committee.Hou's meeting with the media took place on the sidelines of New Taipei City’s WJS Marathon. He addressed topics including cross-strait issues which he described as a concern for everyone in Taiwan.Hou said ""as a local municipal leader and member of the public, Hou hopes that the situation across the Taiwan Strait will be stable.""Questions regarding the 319 shooting of then Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) and Vice President Annette Liu (呂秀蓮) in 2004 were also posed to Hou as he was in charge of the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) and responsible for investigating the crime at the time.On the 19th anniversary of the shooting, former Vice President Annette Liu called for Hou to address the matter publicly if he has the ambition to seek the KMT’s nomination in the presidential primary.Hou said that all of the evidence collected in the case has been presented to the public as well as the judiciary. He added that all physical evidence, relevant material, and witness testimony remain and can be examined through professional and scientific means.The 319 shooting incident involved former President Chen Shui-bian and former Vice President Annette Lu while canvassing Tainan City for a 2004 re-election campaign, where both were shot and injured.",2023/3/19,1321,Politics

(AP) — Cornell's Yianni Diakomihalis became the fifth Division I wrestler to win four national titles and Penn State won its 10th team title in 12 years on Saturday at the NCAA Division I wrestling championships, with former President Donald Trump in attendance for the evening session.Trump shook hands and took selfies with fans and greeted several of the national champions. He sat with staff members and U.S. Senator Markwayne Mullin. The crowd stood when he went to the arena floor before the night session began with Mullin and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt.Diakomihalis capped the evening by defeating Ohio State's Sammy Sasso 4-2 in the 149-pound final. He joined Kyle Dake, Pat Smith, Logan Stieber and Cael Sanderson — Penn State's coach — as the only four-time champions ever in Division I.“All those guys are great because they’re different,"" Diakomihalis said. ""And, you know, my style is different. I might take bits and pieces from each guy, but when you see the final product, it’s its own form.”Diakomihalis, 23, won national titles in 2018 and 2019. He took an Olympic redshirt year while trying to make Team USA in 2019-20, then couldn't wrestle in college during the 2020-21 season because the Ivy League cancelled winter sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. He came back to win in 2022 and 2023, and now has bigger goals in mind with the Olympics coming in 2024.“What I did this weekend is far from the best version of myself,” he said. “And it’s far, far, far from what I need to be an Olympic champion, world champion.”Penn State ran away with the team title, mathematically clinching before the evening session began. The Nittany Lions finished with 137.5 points. Iowa was second with 82.5 points and Cornell placed third with 76.5.Two Penn State wrestlers won titles for the third straight season — Penn State's Carter Starocci at 174 and Aaron Brooks at 184.Starocci pinned Nebraska’s Mikey Labriola early in the second period. He had defeated Labriola in the Big Ten final and gave him his only two losses of the season. Brooks, the No. 3 seed at 184, defeated top-seeded Parker Keckeisen of Northern Iowa 7-2.All didn't go as planned for Penn State. Third-seeded Vito Arujau of Cornell defeated Penn State's Roman Bravo-Young — a two-time defending champion and an unbeaten No. 1 seed — 10-4 for the title at 133. Bravo-Young had the nation's longest winning streak at 56 matches.“The team had a great weekend,"" Sanderson said. ""A lot of gutsy, great performances. It’s an individual sport as well as a team sport. So as a coach, you’re always -- your heart and mind is with the guys that don’t quite reach their goals. But we’ve got a lot to be happy about and proud of.”Iowa’s Spencer Lee was in the running to win his fourth title before losing in the semifinals to Purdue’s Matt Ramos at 125 on Friday night. Lee medically forfeited out of Saturday’s action and officially finished sixth.Ramos followed up his stunning upset by facing Princeton’s Pat Glory, the unbeaten No. 2 seed who was the runner-up in the class last year. Glory won 3-1 to claim Princeton’s first national title since 1951.Glory expected a battle from Ramos.“Not everybody goes off and knocks off Spencer Lee like that,” Glory said. “It takes cojones, and I knew he would have the same mentality coming into the match. I knew it was going to be dogfight. And I knew it was going to be one opportunity and I needed to capitalize and I knew I was going to be ready for it when it came.""In other finals, at 141, Northern Colorado's Andrew Alirez defeated Iowa's Real Woods 6-4 in a matchup of unbeatens. There was a long delay to sort out a series of moves in the second period, and the challenge by Northern Colorado paid off. It gave Alirez four points for a near fall instead of two and it pushed his lead to 6-2. He went on to claim his school's first national title since 1962.At 157, North Carolina's Austin O'Connor won his second national title with a 6-2 win over Penn State true freshman Levi Haines. O'Connor, who won at 149 in 2021, is now a five-time All-American. O'Connor got on the board with an escape early in the third, then scored two takedowns to take command.At 165, Missouri's Keegan O'Toole repeated by defeating Iowa State's David Carr, 8-2. The second-seeded O'Toole avenged two losses to Carr this season by dominating the third period to pull away. Carr, the champ at 157 in 2021, was unbeaten and the No. 1 seed this season.At 197, Pitt's Nino Bonaccorsi, the No. 1 seed, finished an unbeaten season by defeating South Dakota State's Tanner Sloan 5-3. Sloan, the No. 7 seed, took a 2-0 lead on a takedown in the first period. Bonaccorsi took a 4-3 lead on a takedown in the final minute to take the lead for good.

Taylor Jones had 16 points, eight rebounds and five blocks for Texas (26-9). Texas blocked 12 shots.The Longhorns raced to a 45-24 lead by halftime with Rori Harmon's eight assists in the first half driving the Texas offense.“We just played really well tonight,” Texas coach Vic Schaefer said. ""They ran into a Texas team I was proud of. ... Rori ran our team like a point guard is supposed to. She found the right people at the right time.""Gonzales, a graduate transfer from BYU and last season's West Coast Conference player of the year, made three consecutive baskets in the opening minutes of the third quarter that pushed her over 2,000 points for her career. Texas led by 33 to start the fourth.“Super special,"" Gonzales said of the milestone. “I definitely have worked super hard in my whole basketball career.”Texas advanced to Monday’s second-round matchup with No. 5 Louisville (24-11), which beat No. 12 Drake 83-81 earlier Saturday.Danae McNeal led East Carolina (23-10) with 13 points in the Pirates' first NCAA Tournament game since 2007. Texas outscored East Carolina 40-16 in the paint.“It takes heart, and we didn't show that tonight,” McNeal said.Gonzales is the only Longhorn to start every game this season as the Longhorns were battered by a series of injuries. Ranked No. 3 to start the season, Texas quickly tumbled all the way out of the Top 25 as injuries mounted.But after shoving around the Pirates, Texas is now within one win of the Sweet 16 for the third consecutive year.BIG PICTUREEast Carolina: The Pirates hope to become tournament regulars after such a long drought for the program. Coach Kim McNeill has a foundation to build on with guard Amiya Joyner, the American Athletic Conference freshman of the year, and junior guard Synia Johnson, who was the most valuable player of the conference tournament.“We’re going to make this a place that is familiar to us. We’ve learned what it takes to be successful at this level. It’s made us hungrier,” McNeill said. “I really hope people don't remember us on how we finished, this one game.”Texas: Shooting guard Sonya Morris returned to the court in the first quarter after being out since Feb. 4 with a deep thigh contusion. Morris wore a football-like thigh pad on her right leg. She played only 13 minutes but made her first shot, a 3-pointer from the right wing. She was Texas' best 3-point shooter before she was hurt.“I'm not sure we ever thought we'd get her back until we got back from the Big 12 (tournament),” Schaefer said. “We were kind of hoping next (weekend).”DEFENSE DOMINATESTexas is 22-0 when holding opponents under 60 points this season. The Longhorns held the Pirates under 10 points in each of the final three quarters.UP NEXTTexas plays No. 5 Louisville on Monday.

It was Sporting KC's first goal of the season and Sallói's seventh goal against Dallas, his most against any opponent.Dallas (2-1-1) didn't get on the scoreboard until Velasco took a pass from Sebastian Lletget and scored 10 minutes into the second half. Ferreira's match-winner was unassisted in the 84th minute.Dallas picked up a win after getting off to a 1-1-1 start for the fifth straight season. Dallas has allowed a goal in 10 straight matches dating to last season and including the playoffs, the longest active streak in the league.Sallói has scored five of Sporting KC’s last eight goals in the series. The club had gone 274 minutes without scoring or surrendering a goal after playing to scoreless draws in its last two matches and yielding a goal to the Portland Timbers six minutes into the season opener.Sporting KC came into the match without a goal despite taking a league-high 26 shots on goal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840255,No. 1 seed Alabama beats Maryland 73-51 in drama-free game,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Before Alabama took the court, two No. 1 seeds had fallen and a third had to rally from a double-digit deficit.By comparison, the Crimson Tide had a drama-free night.Jahvon Quinerly scored 22 points, Brandon Miller heated up with 19 and top overall seed Alabama brushed aside Maryland 73-51 behind a dominant second half Saturday.The second-round romp followed a 21-point blowout of Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in the Tide's tournament opener.“I feel like our job’s not done,” Miller said. “We’re here to win a national championship.”The Crimson Tide (31-5) advanced to their second Sweet 16 in the past three tournaments and ninth overall. Alabama will face fifth-seeded San Diego State in the South Region semifinals Friday in Louisville, Kentucky.Before the late-night game, Purdue and defending national champion Kansas had lost, and No. 1 seed Houston trailed Tide rival Auburn by 10 points at halftime earlier at Legacy Arena before pulling away.“Of course we watched those games and that was crazy,” Quinerly said. “But Coach (Nate Oats) didn’t really address the team.“We all know anybody can win in March. We just kind of focused on the task at hand.”Alabama and Miller got off to a slow start, but the All-America freshman and top NBA prospect wound up with a more typical performance after going scoreless in the first-round game. Miller has been nursing a groin injury and missed his first nine shots of the tournament.“It seems the more he goes, the looser it got,” Oats said. “He didn’t have the same pop. He was 3 of 11 on 2s. A lot of those were at the rim. His finishing has been really good. He definitely wasn’t 100%. He’s a tough kid. He’s playing through some stuff. He doesn’t let people know he’s hurt.”Quinerly had a big game on the one-year anniversary of his left knee injury early in a second-round loss to Notre Dame, which still limited him early this season. He shot 4 of 6 on 3-pointers.Maryland coach Kevin Willard had offered the New Jersey native a scholarship while at Seton Hall when Quinerly was just a ninth-grader.Charles Bediako had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Alabama's starters hit the bench with a couple of minutes left to chants of “Sweet 16” in the friendly crowd.“It’s been unbelievable to play in front of our hometown fans to have a chance to go to the Sweet 16,” Oats said.Julian Reese had 14 points for Maryland (22-13) before fouling out. Jahmir Young scored 12.Reese scored seven quick points but picked up his second foul three minutes into the game and only played four minutes in the first half, picking up a quick third.“His first foul was a foul. But the second one was mysterious, and the third one was the game,” Willard said. ""You can’t call that second foul in a physical game. It was a horrible call. It changed the game.""I’ll elaborate as much as you want. Do you want me to get in a little bit of trouble or a lot of trouble? But the second call was a terrible foul call. A horrible call. It changed our whole game plan. We were gonna pound it inside, pound it inside.”The Tide wound up with a 44-32 rebounding advantage.Alabama had an easy time in the end, unlike the other No. 1 seeds.No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson toppled top-seeded Purdue 63-58 on Friday night in only the second such upset. Then No. 8 seed Arkansas beat the Jayhawks 72-71 earlier Saturday. Houston ultimately pulled away from Auburn as the Tide waited for their opportunity.The first half was more to Maryland's liking — other than the 28-23 deficit — for a team that came in giving up just 63 points a game.BIG PICTUREMaryland: The 2002 national champion Terps failed to make their 15th trip to the Sweet 16 in Willard's first season. They also lost to Alabama in the second round two years ago under former coach Mark Turgeon. Maryland's defense was on point enough that it kept the lead for much of the first half despite a stretch of nine straight misses.Alabama: It was the largest win in NCAA Tournament history by a team that shot under 40% overall and under 30% on 3-pointers, according to STATS. ... Alabama's depth has been on display so far. The Tide controlled the game despite not getting much scoring from starters Mark Sears and Noah Clowney or Nick Pringle, the star of the opening game against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.UP NEXTAlabama faces a San Diego State team making its first Sweet 16 appearance since 2004, which was also the year of the Tide's only Elite Eight run. The Crimson Tide have never reached the Final Four.“I know San Diego State’s defense is elite,” Oats said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/19,,World

J.T. Miller and Quinn Hughes each had two assists, and Demko saved a penalty shot by Adrian Kempe midway through the second period.“We kind of played better in the third, and you rope-a-dope and you win the game,” Vancouver coach Rick Tocchet said.Miller and Andrei Kuzmenko converted in the shootout. Demko denied the second and decisive Los Angeles attempt.Carl Grundstrom and Alex Edler scored for the Kings, who earned one point and moved into a tie with Vegas for first place in the Pacific Division. Joonas Korpisalo made 15 saves.Los Angeles hasn’t lost in regulation in its past nine games and is 12-2-3 since the All-Star break. But in the shootout, Gabe Vilardi fired over the net and Trevor Moore was stopped after Demko waited him out.“It’s a tough game for me to describe,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “I think we can play that game over again and have a chance at success. … I think we were trying to bear down and it just didn’t go for us tonight.”The Canucks were outshot 23-6 through two periods but were able to stay in it thanks to Demko’s outstanding play.“I mean, Demko was incredible tonight,” Tocchet said. “He kept us in the game. LA’s an impressive team, they defended really well, and we didn’t have an answer the first two periods.”Pettersson buried a shot from the right circle seven seconds into Vancouver’s lone power play of the night to tie it at 2 midway through the third period.Tocchet was pleased with the character demonstrated by his group once again in a lost season.“We can’t afford to just, you know, ‘Let’s wait for next year,’” Tocchet said. “These are important games for us. We’re trying to build stuff around here.”MISSED OPPORTUNITIESThe Kings failed to get a shot off in overtime after managing to get the puck on net three times during two unsuccessful power plays, and it was the latter that drew McLellan's ire. Injuries to F Kevin Fiala and D Sean Durzi, who rank second and third on the Kings in power-play assists, have sapped effectiveness from both units, but McLellan said those absences should not hinder the basic execution.“They're important pieces, and they're creative, they're effective, they're dynamic, both of them in their own way,” McLellan said. “Each of them belongs to a unit, so all of a sudden both units are affected. ... Right now it's looking for something when we should just be playing it.”GIVE AND TAKEEdler, who holds the Canucks record for most points by a defenseman, factored in on both goals in the first. His stick struck Boeser’s shot and redirected it off the left post to put Vancouver up midway through the period, but Edler got his first goal against the Canucks with three minutes left to tie it at 1.RUNNING HOTGrundstrom continued his excellent play on the fourth line to put the Kings up 2-1 late in the second when he used his skate to redirect Rasmus Kupari’s shot. The assist was the fifth point in eight games for Kupari since returning from a lower-body injury.NOTES: Korpisalo is 3-0-1 since being acquired from Columbus in a trade on Feb. 28. He has allowed eight goals in that span. … Canucks defenseman Ethan Bear was a plus-1 playing 23:46 in his return after missing eight games because of a facial injury.

He's the third in team history, joining Dino Ciccarelli (three in a row in 1985-86, 1986-87 and 1987-88) and Dave Gagner (1989-90, 1990-91).“They put me out there to try to produce,” Robertson said. “A lot of guys on this team are having fantastic seasons.

Andersson gave Calgary the lead at 9:53 of the third period, and Hakanpaa tied it with 7:51 left.“We had two losses to this team in our barn,” Robertson said. “One especially we’d really love to get back.

Pierre Engvall extended his point streak to four games with an assist on Pulock's goal. New York moved two points ahead of Pittsburgh for the first wild card in the Eastern Conference.“I just think we try and play our game which has some physicality to it for sure,"" Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. ""They’re a quick team that has some skill. So we try and play physical against those teams. So there was a bit of design to it.”Kevin Labanc scored his 12th goal of the season for the Sharks and Kaapo Kahkonen made 29 saves in his 17th loss of the season.Labanc gave the Sharks the lead 7:31 into the first period beating Sorokin over the blocker.“I’m just trying to help the team win,"" Labanc said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840272,Silicon Valley Bank collapse concerns founders of color,"In the hours after some of Silicon Valley Bank’s biggest customers started pulling out their money, a WhatsApp group of startup founders who are immigrants of color ballooned to more than 1,000 members.Questions flowed as the bank’s financial status worsened. Some desperately sought advice: Could they open an account at a larger bank without a Social Security Number? Others questioned whether they had to physically be at a bank to open an account, because they're visiting parents overseas.One clear theme emerged: a deep concern about the broader impact on startups led by people of color.While Wall Street struggles to contain the banking crisis after the swift demise of SVB — the nation's 16th largest bank and the biggest to fail since the 2008 financial meltdown — industry experts predict it could become even harder for people of color to secure funding or a financial home supporting their startups.SVB had opened its doors to such entrepreneurs, offering opportunities to form crucial relationships in the technology and financial communities that had been out of reach within larger financial institutions. But smaller players have fewer means of surviving a collapse, reflecting the perilous journey minority entrepreneurs face while attempting to navigate industries historically rife with racism.“All these folks that have very special circumstances based on their identity, it’s not something that they can just change about themselves and that makes them unbankable by the top four (large banks),” said Asya Bradley, a board member of numerous startups who has watched the WhatsApp group grapple with SVB's demise.Bradley said some investors have implored startups to switch to larger financial institutions to stymie future financial risks, but that's not an easy transition.“The reason why we’re going to regional and community banks is because these (large) banks don’t want our business,” Bradley said.Banking expert Aaron Klein, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, said SVB’s collapse could exacerbate racial disparities.“That’s going to be more challenging for people who don’t fit the traditional credit box, including minorities,” Klein said. ""A financial system that prefers the existing holders of wealth will perpetuate the legacy of past discrimination.”Tiffany Dufu was gutted when she couldn’t access her SVB account and, in turn, could not pay her employees.Dufu raised $5 million as CEO of The Cru, a New York-based career coaching platform and community for women. It was a rare feat for businesses founded by Black women, which get less than 1% of the billions of dollars in venture capital funding doled out yearly to startups. She banked with SVB because it was known for its close ties to the tech community and investors.“In order to have raised that money, I pitched nearly 200 investors over the past few years,” said Dufu, who has since regained access to her funds and moved to Bank of America. “It’s very hard to put yourself out there and time after time — you get told this isn’t a good fit. So, the money in the bank account was very precious.”A February Crunchbase News analysis determined funding for Black-founded startups slowed by more than 50% last year after they received a record $5.1 billion in venture capital in 2021. Overall venture funding dropped from about $337 billion to roughly $214 billion, while Black founders were hit disproportionately hard, dropping to just $2.3 billion, or 1.1% of the total.Entrepreneur Amy Hilliard, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, knows how difficult it is to secure financing. It took three years to secure a loan for her cake manufacturing company, and she had to sell her home to get it started.Banking is based on relationships and when a bank like SVB goes under, “those relationships go away, too,” said Hilliard, who is African American.Some conservative critics asserted SVB's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion were to blame, but banking experts say those claims were false. The bank slid into insolvency because its larger customers pulled deposits rather than borrow at higher interest rates and the bank's balance sheets were overexposed, forcing it to sell bonds at a loss to cover the withdrawals.“If we’re focused on climate or communities of color or racial equity, that has nothing to do with what happened with Silicon Valley Bank,” said Valerie Red-Horse Mohl, co-founder of Known Holdings, a Black, Indigenous, Asian American-founded finance and asset management firm focused on the sustainable growth of minority-managed funds.Red-Horse Mohl — who has raised, structured and managed over $3 billion in capital for tribal nations — said most larger banks are led by white men and majority-white boards, and “even when they do DEI programs, it’s not a really deep sort of shifting of capital.”Smaller financial institutions, however, have worked to build relationships with people of color. “We cannot lose our regional and community banks,"" she said. ""It would be a travesty.”Historically, smaller and minority-owned banks have addressed funding gaps that larger banks ignored or even created, following exclusionary laws and policies as they turned away customers because of the color of their skin.But the ripple effects from SVB's collapse are being felt among these banks as well, said Nicole Elam, president and CEO of the National Bankers Association, a 96-year-old trade association representing more than 175 minority-owned banks.Some have seen customers withdraw funds and move to larger banks out of fear, even though most minority-owned banks have a more traditional customer base, with secured loans and minimal risky investments, she said.“You’re seeing customer flight of folks that we’ve been serving for a long time,” Elam said. “How many people may not come to us for a mortgage or small business loan or to do their banking business because they now have in their mind that they need to bank with a bank that is too big to fail? That's the first impact of eroding public trust.”Black-owned banks have been hit the hardest as the industry consolidates. Most don't have as much capital to withstand economic downturns. At its peak, there were 134. Today, there are only 21.But change is on the way. Within the last three years, the federal government, private sector and philanthropic community have invested heavily in minority-run depository institutions.“In response to this national conversation around racial equity, people are really seeing minority banks are key to wealth creation and key to helping to close the wealth gap,"" Elam said.Bradley also is an angel investor, providing seed money for a number of entrepreneurs, and is seeing new opportunities as people network in the WhatsApp group to help each other remain afloat and grow.“I'm really so hopeful,” Bradley said. “Even in the downfall of SVB, it has managed to form this incredible community of folks that are trying to help each other to succeed. They're saying, 'SVB was here for us, now we're going to be here for each other.'”___This article has been corrected to say that Known Holdings is a finance and asset management firm focused on the sustainable growth of minority-managed funds.___Stafford, based in Detroit, is a national investigative race writer for the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840277,"Robertson, Canada deny Burling, New Zealand home SailGP win","Phil Robertson steered Team Canada to its first SailGP victory on Sunday by recovering from a penalty late in the podium race in Christchurch to deny Peter Burling and Team New Zealand a victory in home waters.Robertson, himself a New Zealander, sailed his foiling 50-foot catamaran aggressively in the three-boat final to win the New Zealand Sail Grand Prix, the penultimate regatta in Season 3 of tech tycoon Larry Ellison's global league.Two-time defending SailGP champion Team Australia, which finished third in the podium race, and Team New Zealand remain 1-2 in the season standings heading into the final regatta in San Francisco May 6-7, which will conclude with the $1 million, winner-take-all Grand Final among the top three boats.But the victory was huge for Canada, which is in its first season in SailGP. The Canadians reached the podium races in the season's first two regattas but didn't reach another final race until Sunday. Their wingsail was smashed and the platform damaged during an intense storm that hit just after racing concluded in the previous regatta in Sydney on Feb. 18. The rest of that regatta was canceled and the damage was repaired in time for this regatta.The Canadian crewmembers whooped and hollered as their catamaran held off the Kiwis heading into the finish line and then had their first onboard Champagne celebration.“It's awesome. I'm so stoked to win at home,” said Robertson, who sailed in front of several family members. “It's super, super special for me. I've got good mates on the shore. I haven't raced here before so I'm pumped. For Canada, it's just amazing. This team is pretty new and pretty fresh and we've been working hard to be competitive with all these top teams. Today's just an example of what we can do when we put it all together.”Australia, skippered by Olympic gold medalist and former America's Cup champion Tom Slingsby, leads the standings with 84 points. The Aussies will sail for a third straight $1 million check, barring serious damage to their catamaran or a major penalty. The Kiwis are second with 73 points. France is third with 69 and Emirates Great Britain is fourth with 68. Denmark has 60 and Canada 59 in the nine-boat fleet.Slingsby, in fifth place after Saturday's three fleet races, won Sunday's two fleet races wire-to-wire to earn a spot in the podium race. Canada squeaked into the podium race by one point over Britain.Robertson led Burling, the reigning two-time America's Cup champion helmsman, on the final downwind leg before straying just across the boundary, drawing a penalty that forced him to fall behind the Kiwis. But Robertson cleared the penalty and had more speed going into the final gate and then onto the short reach to the finish.“I think you've been seeing it all along but we haven't strung it all together so it's nice to put the whole package in and get that final race,” Robertson said. “We gave it a good shot of letting the Kiwis back into it but we held strong. The boundary penalty must have been a half-meter or something over it. We managed to scrub that and stay on lay and come fast into the bottom, so happy days.”Slingsby said being just behind the Canadians approaching the first mark in the podium race was costly.“We needed another five meters to roll over Canada and then it would have been a different story. We would have led to mark one like we did in the first two races and there's a good chance we would have gone on with it,"" he said. ""Unfortunately we weren't able to get it. We got luffed and moved out of second to third place. Just tough going. Two good teams, it's going to be tough to catch them.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

Kahlaijah Dean scored 11, but was 3 of 19 from the field.UCLA also had a 17-point lead at halftime and was up by as many as 24 late in the fourth quarter.“The first quarter got away from us.

We were prepared — they didn't do anything different.”Neither team shot well: UCLA was 29 of 70 while Sacramento State went 17 for 50. The Bruins did outrebound the Hornets by 15 and had a 34-24 edge in points in the paint.BIG PICTURESacramento State: The Hornets made their first tournament appearance just two years after going 3-22. They won the Big Sky Tournament after finishing in a three-way tie for the regular-season crown.“It’s incredible. The development came faster than I would have guessed, but we’re not going backwards,” said Campbell, who has been the coach for two seasons. “It put us on the map and gave us validity to what we are doing.”UCLA: The Bruins have won all seven first-round games in Close's 12 seasons as coach. They are looking to get to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2019.UP NEXTIt will be the first meeting between UCLA and Oklahoma since November 2013.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840306,Long-serving Montenegro president to face newcomer in runoff,"PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — The long-serving incumbent will face a political newcomer in a runoff presidential election in Montenegro next month no one won in the first round of voting on Sunday held amid a political turmoil in the Balkan country, early projections showed.President Milo Đukanović, 61, won around 35% of the votes while 37-year-old economist Jakov Milatović won some 29%, according to projections released by the Center for Monitoring and Research.If confirmed in the official tally, the two will face each other in the April 2 runoff. The CeMI monitoring group insisted that they don't expect major changes as the counting continues. It was not immediately clear when official results will be published.The presidential election came after months of political crisis and uncertainty over whether the small NATO member state in the Balkans would unblock its bid to join the European Union or instead seek to improve ties with Serbia and Russia.Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Montenegro, the ballot also is seen as a key indicator of popular sentiment before a parliamentary election set for June 11.“We achieved exactly what we wanted, this is what we planned,” Djukanovic said.He described the outcome as “wind in the back” for his DPS party ahead of upcoming parliamentary votes ""so that we confirm the strength of European Montenegro and form a government that will continue to lead Montenegro on the European path.""Milatovic, a former economy minister and a leader of the recently-formed Europe Now group, also struck a victorious tone in the post-election speech, pledging to “send Djukanovic to political retirement” following his more than 30 years in power.“This is a victory of entire Montenegro that generations have waited for,” said Milatovic.Đukanović and his Democratic Party of Socialists, or DPS, led Montenegro to independence from Serbia in 2006, and defied Russia to join NATO in 2017. An alliance dominated by parties seeking closer ties with Serbia and Russia ousted DPS from power in 2020, accusing the party of corruption and links to organized crime.The new ruling alliance, however, soon plunged into disarray, which stalled Montenegro’s path toward the EU and created a political deadlock. The latest government fell in a no-confidence vote in August, but has remained in office for months because of the stalemate.Observers say Milatović, who served in the government elected after the 2020 parliamentary vote but later split from the ruling coalition, has sought to portray himself as civic-oriented, centrist and pro-EU.Milatovic received backing from Andrija Mandic of the staunchly pro-Serbia and pro-Russia Popular Front party. Mandic won around 19%, on Sunday and urged his voters to support Milatovic in the runoff.Montenegro, whose population is around 620,000, long have been deeply split between supporters of Đukanović’s policies and those who view themselves as Serbs and want Montenegro to ally itself with Serbia and fellow-Slavic Russia.Đukanović, who has served multiple times as both president and prime minister in the past 30 years, has seen his popularity plummet. He has hoped to regain trust among Montenegro's approximately 540,000 eligible voters and help pave the way for his party's return to power.Đukanović has portrayed the presidential election as a choice between an independent Montenegro and a country controlled by neighboring Serbia and Russia.The political chaos and stalled reforms in a country long seen as the next in line for EU membership has alarmed U.S. and EU officials, who fear Russia could try to stir trouble in the Balkans to divert attention from the war in Ukraine.",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840326,Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic: The integration miracle,"Few windows in the Waltrovka office complex in Prague's Jinonice neighborhood are illuminated. The work day has ended; everyone has gone home. The complex, buzzing with activity during the day, is now almost entirely deserted — save for a group of Ukrainian men and women standing at the entrance.They are waiting for Tereza Matonohova, a headhunter. She is among the hundreds of thousands of Czech citizens who volunteer their free time to help Ukrainian war refugees integrate. Matonohova has organized a late afternoon information and language class for those waiting to get in.""I used my professional contacts to find a company that would let us use a room for free,"" says Tereza. Today's session will focus on questions about housing and finding a job. Refugees will also get a language lesson from an experienced teacher. Tereza managed to use Czech government funds already earmarked for integration to pay for the teacher's time.""Knowledge of the Czech language is the foundation for finding an opening and a qualified job with decent pay in the Czech labor market,"" as Tereza explained to DW. ""This allows refugees to leave behind poorly paid jobs like stocking supermarket shelves for those where they can really show their skills.""Of those who have come to Tereza's evening class, generally between 15 and 20 people each time, almost all have found work. ""Today there are fewer participants because some are working afternoon shifts,"" she says. Speaking with those present, it is clear that one year on they are all capable of basic communication in their new language.Thanks to thousands of volunteers like Tereza, the Czech Republic and its 10 million residents were able to master the largest influx of refugees in its history. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine a little over a year ago, the country has offered temporary shelter to nearly half a million war refugees. Proportionate to population, that puts the Czech Republic at the EU's forefront.A portion of those refugees who fled to the Czech Republic have returned home, meanwhile. Still, more than 100,000 Ukrainians have found work in the Czech labor market and 90% of all Ukrainian children (roughly 50,000) are enrolled in Czech schools. They currently make up about 5% of the Republic's child population.Speaking at a press conference marking the one year anniversary of the first arrival of Ukrainian war refugees, Minister of the Interior Vit Rakusan told journalists that the Czech Republic had passed the stress test. ""We were able to take in nearly half a million Ukrainian refugees. And we did it without crashing or overburdening our health and education systems.""The minister said the country had been able to create admissions mechanisms that allowed refugees to integrate into the labor market, adding, ""Many have already seized that opportunity.""Rakusan admits there have been problems. ""We couldn't have done it without help from the Czech people, without the mayors, the police and the firefighters and so many others."" Meanwhile, the situation has greatly improved. The country is no longer in an acute crisis and nor does it have to deal with waves of tens of thousands of refugees at its borders. ""We have a system that works,"" says Rakusan.The fact that a large number of Ukrainian adults work and their children attend school is also important for society on the whole. Nevertheless, representatives from extremist and far-right nationalist parties and organizations have claimed the Czech government is helping Ukrainian refugees to the detriment of Czech citizens.Among them is the leader of the opposition ANO party and a finalist in the country's most recent presidential election, Andrej Babis. Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Lipavsky refutes the claim, telling DW: ""That's not true. Expenditures for Ukrainian refugees are but a fraction of the overall budget made available to Czech citizens during the energy and financial crises.""According to the Czech Ministry of Finance, total expenditures for Ukrainian refugees until the end of January 2023 were 28.5 billion Czech crowns (about €1.2 billion / $1.27 billion). The lion's share went to refugee welfare assistance. Prague has doled out about €400 million for it, coming to roughly €200 monthly for each non-working refugee as the ministry posted on its Twitter account.But the state doesn't only have expenditures — it also profits from those Ukrainians who have found work and pay Czech taxes. That has allowed the Czech government to take in about €350 million in tax revenue from Ukrainian laborers.""Costs for Ukrainian refugees will be lower than initially anticipated,"" says Minister of Finance Zbynek Stanjura. Refugees integrated into the Czech labor market quicker than expected and have been less of a burden on the health care system than feared. Furthermore, Czech citizens have been generous when it comes to sheltering Ukrainian refugees free of charge.One problem, however, remains unresolved: Many new arrivals work in low-skill, poorly paid jobs because their qualifications are not recognized in the Czech Republic. Getting such qualifications recognized is difficult, as Tomas Prouza tells DW.Prouza is president of the Confederation of Trade and Tourism and an adviser to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. ""There are hundreds of Ukrainian nurses and doctors here but they can't get their diplomas acknowledged because they lack the correct documents from Ukraine.""But those many Ukrainian refugees are a blessing to the Czech economy. That's why Prouza suggests the Czech Republic concentrate on how to take full advantage of their professional and labor potential.This article was translated from German by Jon Shelton",2023/3/19,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840336,Macron's leadership at risk amid tensions over pension plan,"PARIS (AP) — A parody photo appearing on protest signs and online in France shows President Emmanuel Macron sitting on piles of garbage. It's both a reference to the trash going uncollected with Paris sanitation workers on strike — and to what many French people think about their leader.Macron had hoped his push to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 would cement his legacy as the president who transformed France's economy for the 21st century. Instead, he finds his leadership contested, both in parliament and on the streets of major cities.His brazen move to force a pension reform bill through without a vote has infuriated the political opposition and could hamper his government's ability to pass legislation for the remaining four years of his term.Demonstrators hoisted the parody photo at protests after Macron chose at the last minute Thursday to invoke the government’s constitutional power to pass the bill without a vote at the National Assembly.In his first public comment on the issue since then, the 45-year-old leader expressed his wish for the bill to “reach the end of its democratic path in an atmosphere of respect for everyone,'' according to a statement Sunday from his office provided to The Associated Press.Since becoming president in 2017, Macron often has been accused of arrogance and being out of touch. Perceived as “the president of the rich,'' he stirred resentment for telling a jobless man he only needed to “cross the street” to find work and by suggesting some French workers were “lazy.”Now, Macron’s government has alienated citizens “for a long time” to come by using the special authority it has under Article 49.3 of the French Constitution to impose a widely unpopular change, said Brice Teinturier, deputy director general of the Ipsos poll institute.He said the situation's only winners are far-right leader Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party, “which continues its strategy of both ‘getting respectable’ and opposing Macron,” and France's labor unions. Le Pen was runner-up to Macron in the country's last two presidential elections.As the garbage piles get bigger and the smell from them worse, many people in Paris blame Macron, not the striking workers.Macron repeatedly said he was convinced the French retirement system needed modifying to keep it financed. He says other proposed options, like increasing the already heavy tax burden, would push investors away, and that decreasing the pensions of current retirees was not a realistic alternative.The public displays of displeasure may weigh heavily on his future decisions. The spontaneous, sometimes violent protests that erupted in Paris and across the country in recent days have contrasted with the largely peaceful demonstrations and strikes previously organized by France’s major unions.Macron's reelection to a second term last April bolstered his standing as a senior player in Europe. He campaigned on a pro-business agenda, pledging to address the pension issue and saying the French must “work longer.”In June, Macron’s centrist alliance lost its majority in the lower house of parliament, though it still holds more seats than other political parties. He said at the time that his government wanted to “legislate in a different way,” based on compromises with a range of political groups.Since then, conservative lawmakers have agreed to support some bills that fit with their own policies. But tensions over the pension plan, and widespread lack of trust among ideologically diverse parties, may end attempts at seeking compromise.Macron's political opponents in the National Assembly filed two no-confidence motions Friday against the government of Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. Government officials are hoping to survive a vote on the motions set for Monday because the opposition is divided, with many Republicans expected not to support it.If a motion passes, however, it would be a big blow for Macron: the pension bill would be rejected and his Cabinet would have to resign. In that case, the president would need to appoint a new Cabinet and find his ability to get legislation passed weakened.Macron notably hopes to propose new measures designed to bring France’s unemployment rate down to 5%, from 7.2% now, by the end of his second and final term.If the no-confidence motions fail, Macron could enact the higher retirement age but try to appease his critics with a government reshuffle.Either way, Macron would keep his job until his term runs out in 2027, and retain substantial powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense. As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he can make decisions about France's support for Ukraine and other global issues without parliamentary approval.France’s strong presidential powers are a legacy from Gen. Charles de Gaulle’s desire to have a stable political system for the Fifth Republic he established in 1958.Another option in the hands of the president is to dissolve the National Assembly and call for an early parliamentary election.That scenario appears unlikely for now, since the unpopularity of the pension plan means Macron's alliance would be unlikely to secure a majority of seats. And if another party won, he would have to appoint a prime minister from the majority faction, empowering the government to implement policies that diverge from the president's priorities.Le Pen said she would welcome a dissolution.And Mathilde Panot, a lawmaker from the leftist Nupes coalition, said with sarcasm Thursday that it was a “very good” idea for Macron to disband the Assembly and trigger an election.“I believe it would be a good occasion for the country to reaffirm that yes, they want the retirement age down at 60,"" Panot said. ""The Nupes is always available to govern.”___Follow AP's coverage of the French government at https://apnews.com/hub/france-government",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840337,Russia's Putin makes surprise trip to occupied Mariupol,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the occupied port city of Mariupol, his first trip to Ukrainian territory that Moscow illegally annexed in September and a show of defiance after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest on war crimes charges.Putin arrived in Mariupol late Saturday after visiting Crimea, southwest of Mariupol, to mark the ninth anniversary of the Black Sea peninsula’s annexation from Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Sunday. He was shown chatting with Mariupol residents and visiting an art school and a children’s center in Sevastopol, Crimea.Mariupol became a worldwide symbol of resistance after outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian forces held out in a steel mill there for nearly three months before Moscow finally took control of it in May. Much of the city was pounded to rubble by Russian shelling.Putin has not commented on the arrest warrant, which deepened his international isolation despite the unlikelihood of him facing trial anytime soon. The Kremlin, which does not recognize the authority of the ICC, has rejected its move as ""legally null and void.""The surprise trip also came ahead of a planned visit to Moscow by Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, expected to provide a major diplomatic boost to Putin in his confrontation with the West.In an essay published Monday in the People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, Putin said: “We are grateful for the balanced line (of China) in connection with the events taking place in Ukraine, for understanding their background and true causes. We welcome China's willingness to play a constructive role in resolving the crisis.”China in February released a position paper calling for an end to fighting in Ukraine and for upholding all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. It did not address how to resolve Russia's illegal claim to have annexed four regions of Ukraine.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told “Fox News Sunday” that any call for a cease-fire in Ukraine coming out of the Putin-Xi meeting would be unacceptable to the U.S. because it would only “ratify Russian’s conquest to date,” and give Moscow “time to refit, retrain, re-man and try to plan for a renewed offensive.”Putin arrived in Mariupol by helicopter and then drove himself around the city’s “memorial sites,” concert hall and coastline, Russian news reports said. The state Rossiya 24 channel on Sunday showed Putin chatting with locals outside what looked like a newly built residential complex, and being shown around one of the apartments.Following his trip to Mariupol, Putin met with Russian military leaders and troops at a command post in Rostov-on-Don, a southern Russian city some 180 kilometers (about 112 miles) farther east, and conferred with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who is in charge of the Russian military operations in Ukraine. Peskov said.Peskov said the trip had been unannounced, and that Putin intended to “inspect the work of the (command) post in its ordinary mode of operation.”Speaking to the state RIA-Novosti agency, Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin made clear that Russia was in Mariupol to stay. He said the government hoped to finish the reconstruction of its blasted downtown by the end of the year.“People have started to return. When they saw that reconstruction is underway, people started actively returning,” Khusnullin told RIA.Mykhailo Podolyak, chief of staff for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, heaped scorn on Putin's trip to Mariupol.“The criminal is always drawn to the crime scene,"" he said. ""While the countries of the civilized world are announcing the arrest of the ‘war director’ in the event of crossing the border, the organizer of the murders of thousands of Mariupol families came to admire the ruins of the city and mass graves.”When Moscow fully captured the city in May, an estimated 100,000 people remained, out of a prewar population of 450,000. Many were trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.Mariupol’s plight first came into international focus with a Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital on March 9, 2022, less than two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine began. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in the bombing of a theater being used as the city's largest bomb shelter. Evidence obtained by The Associated Press suggested the real death toll could be closer to 600.A small group of Ukrainian fighters held out for 83 days in the sprawling Azovstal steel works in eastern Mariupol before surrendering, their dogged defense tying down Russian forces and coming to symbolize Ukrainian tenacity in the face of Moscow’s aggression.Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move that most of the world denounced as illegal, and moved in September to officially claim four regions in Ukraine’s south and east as Russian territory, following referendums that Kyiv and the West described as a sham.The ICC on Friday accused Putin of bearing personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. U.N. investigators also said there was evidence for the forced transfer of “hundreds” of Ukrainian children to Russia. According to Ukrainian government figures, over 16,000 children have been deported to Russian-controlled territories or Russia itself, many of them from Mariupol.While the ICC's move was welcomed by Kyiv, the chances of Putin facing trial are slim because Moscow does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction or extradite its nationals.Ukrainian officials reported Sunday that at least three civilians had been killed and 19 wounded by Russian shelling in the previous 24 hours. The deaths were in the eastern Donetsk region, amid fierce battles for control of the city of Bakhmut, according to Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko on Ukrainian TV.Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said in a Telegram update that a 51-year-old woman was “fighting for her life” after being hit by shrapnel as Russian troops fired on the border town of Dvorichna.Top Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak said Ukrainian troops were holding the line near Bakhmut, a key target of a long, grinding Russian offensive, adding that the enemy's plan to occupy the city ""are now foundering.”The spokesman for Ukraine’s eastern forces said Russian troops are “tactically unable to complete” Bakhmut's capture.“Yes, there are very active battles, (the Russians) continue to carry out several dozen attacks by inertia, but they suffer huge losses,” Serhii Cherevaty said on Ukrainian TV, adding that Ukrainian defenses are “bleeding the enemy, breaking his fighting spirit.”Taking Bakhmut would give the Kremlin a battlefield victory after months of setbacks, and could pave the way for Russia to threaten other Ukrainian strongholds in the region, including Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.Russian forces shelled a house in Bilozerka, a suburb west of the southern city of Kherson, and a woman who was pulled from the rubble was hospitalized, according to the Kherson regional military administration, writing on Telegram.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840368,"In Zimbabwe's rainy season, women forage for wild mushrooms","HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe's rainy season brings a bonanza of wild mushrooms, which many rural families feast upon and sell to boost their incomes.But the bounty also comes with danger as each year there are reports of people dying after eating poisonous fungi. Discerning between safe and toxic mushrooms has evolved into an inter-generational transfer of indigenous knowledge from mothers to daughters. Rich in protein, antioxidants and fiber, wild mushrooms are a revered delicacy and income earner in Zimbabwe, where food and formal jobs are scarce for many.Beauty Waisoni, 46, who lives on the outskirts of the capital, Harare, typically wakes up at dawn, packs plastic buckets, a basket, plates and a knife before trekking to a forest 15 kilometers (9 miles) away.Her 13-year-old daughter Beverly is in tow, as an apprentice. In the forest, the two join other pickers, mainly women working side by side with their children, combing through the morning dew for shoot-ups under trees and dried leaves.Police routinely warn people of the hazards of consuming wild mushrooms. In January, three girls in one family died after eating poisonous wild mushrooms. Such reports filter through each season. A few years ago 10 family members died after consuming poisonous mushrooms.To avoid such a deadly outcome, Waisoni teaches her daughter how to identify safe mushrooms.“She will kill people, and the business, if she gets it wrong,” said Waisoni, who says she started picking wild mushrooms as a young girl. Within hours, her baskets and buckets become filled up with small red and brown buttons covered in dirt.Women such as Waisoni are dominant players in Zimbabwe's mushroom trade, said Wonder Ngezimana, an associate professor of horticulture at the Marondera University of Agricultural Science and Technology.“Predominantly women have been gatherers and they normally go with their daughters. They transfer the indigenous knowledge from one generation to the other,” Ngezimana told The Associated Press.They distinguish edible mushrooms from poisonous ones by breaking and detecting “milk-like liquid oozing out,” and by scrutinizing the color beneath and the top of the mushrooms, he said. They also look for good collection points such as anthills, the areas near certain types of indigenous trees and decomposing baobab trees, he said.About one in four women who forage for wild mushrooms are often accompanied by their daughters, according to research carried out by Ngezimana and colleagues at the university in 2021. In “just few cases” — 1.4% — mothers were accompanied by a boy child.“Mothers were better knowledgeable of wild edible mushrooms compared to their counterparts — fathers,” noted the researchers. The researchers interviewed close to 100 people and observed mushroom collection in Binga, a district in western Zimbabwe where growing Zimbabwe's staple food, maize, is largely unviable due to droughts and poor land quality. Many families in the Binga are too poor to afford basic food and other items.So mushroom season is important for the families. On average, each family made just over $100 a month from selling wild mushrooms, in addition to relying on the fungi for their own household food consumption, according to the research.In large part due to harsh weather conditions, about a quarter of Zimbabwe's 15 million people are food insecure, meaning that they’re not sure where their next meal will come from, according to aid agencies. Zimbabwe has one of the world's highest rates of food inflation at 264%, according to the International Monetary Fund.To promote safe mushroom consumption and year-round income generation, the government is promoting small-scale commercial production of certain types such as oyster mushrooms.But it appears the wild ones remain the most popular.“They come in as a better delicacy. Even the aroma is totally different to that of the mushroom we do on a commercial aspect, so people love them and in the process communities make some money,” said Ngezimana.Waisoni, the Harare trader, says the wild mushrooms have helped her put children through school and also weather the harsh economic conditions that have battered Zimbabwe for the past two decades.Her pre-dawn trip to the forest marks just the beginning of a day-long process. From the bush, Waisoni heads to a busy highway. Using a knife and water, she cleans the mushrooms before joining the stiff competition of other mushroom sellers hoping to attract passing motorists.A speeding motorist hooted frantically to warn traders on the sides of the road to move away. Instead, the sellers charged forward, tripping over each other in hopes of scoring a sale.One motorist, Simbisai Rusenya, stopped and said he can’t pass the seasonal wild mushrooms. But, aware of the reported deaths from poisonous ones, he needed some convincing before buying.“Looks appetizing, but won’t it kill my family?” he asked.Waisoni randomly picked a button from her basket and calmly chewed it to reassure him. “See?"" she said, ""It’s safe!”",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840369,Pepper-grinder move unwelcome in Japan high school tourney,"TOKYO (AP) — Lars Nootbaar's imaginary pepper-grinder was the talk of World Baseball Classic games in Japan, but the fun-loving gesture by the St. Louis Cardinals outfielder does not appear welcome in Japan's popular high school baseball tournament.When a player for Tohoku High School twisted his two fists together — imitating Nootbaar — after getting on first base Saturday, the umpire told him to stop.Hiroshi Sato, manager for Tohoku High School, defended his player. Tohoku lost to Yamanashi Gakuin Senior High School 3-1 at Koshien Stadium in Osaka.“It’s so popular the whole nation is talking about it,” Sato was quoted as saying in the nationally circulated Mainichi newspaper and other Japanese media.“The children are just having fun. Why do adults have to put a stop to it,” said Sato, who played for Tokyo's Yomiuri Giants.“We should be thinking more about how children can freely enjoy baseball.”High school baseball tournaments are extremely popular in Japan. Major leaguers Daisuke Matsuzaka and Hideki Matsui got their start in the tournament. San Diego Padres pitcher Yu Darvish, who is on Japan's team in the WBC, played for Tohoku.High school baseball regulations tend to curb expressions of emotions, such as making a clenched fist after scoring.“We have always asked high school baseball to abstain from unnecessary performances and gestures. We understand the players’ feelings of wanting to have fun, but the federation believes the fun should come from the game,” the Japan High School Baseball Federation said in a statement.Taro Kono, who is in the cabinet of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, raised the issue of the strict rules on a Twitter post. Kono was a leading candidate for prime minister when Kishida was chosen late in 2021.Nootbaar's pepper-grinder imitation was a hit in Japan's five games at the Tokyo Dome, with television cameras often focusing on Nootbaar's teammates making the gesture, or his mother Kumiko as she watched from the stands.Nootbaar was born in California and is the first to play for Japan's national baseball team by virtue of ancestry.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840394,Taiwan temporarily freezes egg prices,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The government decided to freeze egg prices next week after a tense meeting between domestic egg producers and merchants on Saturday (March 18).The Council of Agriculture (COA) communicated with the Poultry Association of Taiwan that it wanted to observe the impact of imported eggs on the market before allowing an upward price adjustment. In response to the price freeze, egg merchants threatened to suspend operations if a similar decision went into effect the following week (March 27-April 1).The decision to freeze egg prices this week has left bulk and wholesale prices ranging between NT$45.5-55 (US$1.47-1.80) per Taiwanese catty (600 grams), according to UDN.In response, Chiang Wen-chuan (江文全), deputy head of the COA's Department of Animal Industry, said the production and sale of eggs is not dependent upon a wholesale market like fruits and vegetables or pigs, so there will be fewer problems if such markets close. At present, egg prices are negotiated directly by egg producers and egg merchants, with the COA refraining from final pricing.The government’s decision to import eggs from overseas markets to overcome the domestic shortfall brought some negative reactions among local merchants and producers. Lin Tien-lai (林天來), who leads an egg producers’ association in Taipei, is expected to visit the COA with a warning that he may suspend operations. However, according to Chiang, Lin’s threat was unilateral and did not involve other egg producers or merchants.Many laying hens are forced to endure cruel cage conditions. (CNA photo)Taiwan has an estimated 44 million laying hens. The COA estimates 30% of the laying hen population's egg production rate is too low. Lower numbers may be the main reason behind the egg shortage in recent months which has led to higher prices.Lower production may be due to traditional laying hen farms encountering a molting season where laying hens regrow their feathers and stop laying eggs for approximately one month beginning around Lunar New Year. The 2023 molting season led to much lower production than expected, per CNA.According to Chiang, the egg production rate of active laying hens dropped from 70% to 52%. This decrease has been attributed to bird flu, cold weather, and poultry barns.Industry insiders say there is little transparency regarding avian flu outbreaks, with some farms simply halting operations without reporting to authorities to protect upstream suppliers whose reputation may be affected by such outbreaks.Reforming laying hen farms to improve efficiency may help Taiwan to reach an equilibrium between supply and demand, Chiang said. Traditional laying hen farmers are A-shaped, with protection only offered by an overhead roof. This means laying hens are susceptible to wind and rain, as well as disease.The 44 million laying hens in Taiwan are distributed at more than 2,100 poultry farms. The COA believes that newer, better-designed laying hen farms overseas can achieve egg production of around 85-90%. As for new domestic laying hen farms, production can range between 72-80%.The culprit behind the current egg shortage may be associated with traditional cage feeding and exposure to bad weather, as well as poor safety surrounding avian flu. Solving these problems will ultimately help shore up the domestic egg supply.",2023/3/19,2706,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840401,Shiffrin ends World Cup ski season with yet another record,"SOLDEU, Andorra (AP) — After capping her record-setting season with career win 88, Mikaela Shiffrin was asked one question over and over again – and she couldn't really answer it.What's next?“What do you think will come next? How many victories?,” Johan Eliasch, president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, wanted to know after handing Shiffrin her fifth big crystal globe, the prize for winning the World Cup overall title.“I don't have a guess at how many,” Shiffrin replied. “Sometimes a part of me feels like that's always my last victory. I hope not, I keep heading for more.”A week after breaking the record of Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark, the American extended the all-time best mark for most career wins to 88 by winning the last race of the season, a giant slalom at the World Cup Finals on Sunday.Her 21st career win in the discipline marked yet another milestone as it moved Shiffrin past Swiss skier Vreni Schneider, who had 20 World Cup GS victories between the mid-80s and mid-90s. The American has won seven of the last eight events and took the GS world title last month.The overall record, between men and women, is held by Stenmark, who won 46 giant slaloms in the 1970s and 80s.The “what’s next?” question also came from her boyfriend and World Cup downhill champion, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, who conducted a course-side interview after the race.“I don't know, you guys tell me. Just keep moving right along,” said Shiffrin, who also secured the slalom and GS titles this season.After Kilde asked her about plans to improve for next season, Shiffrin quipped: “We can discuss that later, in private.”Shiffrin also set a personal best of 2,206 World Cup points from 31 starts this season, two points more than her tally from 2018-19, when she competed in 26 races.Only one skier secured more points in a single season: Slovenian great Tina Maze ended her 2012-13 campaign on 2,414.Later, Shiffrin posed for photos with men's overall champion Marco Odermatt, who set the men's record of 2,042 points. It's the first World Cup season in which both the women's and men's overall champion finished on more than 2,000 points.Sunday's result also marked Shiffrin's record 138th career World Cup podium, moving her one ahead of former teammate Lindsey Vonn's mark of 137.But for Shiffrin, her personal favorite record came nine years ago.“Honestly, I think probably being the youngest Olympic slalom champion. That was really the only record that I actually ever wanted, like really shot for,” said Shiffrin, who was 18 when she won her first Olympic gold at the 2014 Sochi Games.“It happened quite some time ago, and I’m still motivated today, I still had that nervous feeling up there. I was so nervous at the start ... because you want to do well. And it doesn’t matter about records, it’s just you want to do well.”With the sun beaming down on the Avet course, Shiffrin held on to her a first-run lead to edge Thea Louise Stjernesund by 0.06 seconds. The Norwegian earned her first career podium.Canadian skier Valerie Grenier was third, trailing Shiffrin by 0.20.Three of the top seven ranked racers did not finish their first runs, as Petra Vlhova, who won Saturday’s slalom, Federica Brignone and Olympic champion Sara Hector all missed a gate.Two-time former world champion Tessa Worley placed 11th in what she said would be the last race of her career. The French GS specialist has won 16 races and three season titles, most recently last year.___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

But he also underwent surgery for appendicitis just before the world championships in February.“Here it is, my baby. It's been one of my dreams all season and now it's here,” Braathen said while holding the trophy.“My globe represents a lot of dedication and sacrifices over a long time. It's not this year, it's every single hour I put in since I was nine years old and started skiing.”Ramon Zenhaeusern held on to his first-run lead to beat Braathen by 0.06 seconds and win the race, but the result was not enough for the Swiss skier to overtake the Norwegian in the standings as he remained in third position.Henrik Kristoffersen finished the race 0.63 behind in third and trailed his teammate Braathen by 52 points in second place in the final standings. Kristoffersen had won the slalom title for the third time last season.After finishing his decisive run in warm and sunny conditions, Braathen bent over and buried his face in his gloves, then looked up and made the V sign with both hands.“I couldn't believe it. I knew I had a possibility but fighting Ramon and Henrik in that last run, it was probably the longest slalom of the year, some of the toughest conditions,” Braathen said.“I don't think words can describe how proud I am to follow up in that second run.”Braathen became the third Norwegian skier to lift the slalom title, after Kristoffersen and Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who won it 23 years ago.Daniel Yule was the only other globe contender coming into the last race but the Swiss skier went out in his second run.Overall World Cup champion Marco Odermatt does not compete in slaloms. The Swiss standout ended his season after winning Saturday’s giant slalom and setting the men’s record for most World Cup points in a single season with 2,042.___ More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840430,Netanyahu urges military chief to contain reservist protest,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the military's chief of staff on Sunday to contain a wave of protest from within the ranks over a contentious government plan to overhaul the judiciary.Netanyahu's remarks come as Israel is embroiled in a major crisis that has sent tens of thousands of people into the streets protesting every week for the last two months. The divide over Netanyahu's plans to change the legal system has not spared the country's military, its most trusted institution, where many reservists have pledged not to show up for duty under what they see as impending regime change.Starting Sunday, more than 700 elite officers from the Air Force, special forces, and Mossad said they would stop volunteering for duty. The typically taboo talk of refusal to serve in a military that is compulsory for most Jews and is highly respected by the Jewish majority underlines how deeply the overhaul plan has divided Israel.Netanyahu has rejected a compromise plan proposed by the country's ceremonial president meant to defuse the crisis. He made no mention of reaching an agreement with opponents during the remarks to his Cabinet, instead saying he would not accept “anarchy,” listing off demands that his security chiefs rein in road blockages by protesters, incitement against him and his ministers and the refusal to serve by a growing number of reservists.“I expect from the military chief of staff and the heads of the branches of the security services to aggressively combat the refusal to serve. There’s no place for refusal to serve in the public discourse,” he said. “A state that wishes to exist can’t tolerate such phenomena and we will not tolerate it as well.”The military had no immediate comment about Netanyahu’s remarks. The military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzl Halevi, has reportedly warned Netanyahu that the reservists’ protest risks harming the military’s capabilities. He has pledged to make sure it doesn’t and keep the military outside of the public debate on the overhaul.Opposition leader Yair Lapid tweeted in response that if Netanyahu suspended the overhaul, reservists would stop refusing to serve.The protest from within the military comes as Israel is mired in a year-long round of fighting with the Palestinians, and as Israel's archenemy Iran races ahead with its nuclear program. Israel says Iran is developing a nuclear bomb — a charge that Tehran denies.Netanyahu said Sunday the legal changes would be carried out responsibly while protecting the basic rights of all Israelis. His government — the country's most right-wing ever — says the overhaul is meant to correct an imbalance that has given the courts too much power and prevented lawmakers from carrying out the voting public's will.Critics say it will upend Israel's delicate system of checks and balances and slide the country toward authoritarianism. They also say it could give Netanyahu a chance to evade conviction in his corruption trial.",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840451,Xi sets off for trip to Russia as Beijing’s role in the Ukraine War comes into focus,"After months of anticipation, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who just confirmed his third term, will finally begin his three-day trip to Moscow on March 20. Beijing has characterized the trip as ""a visit for peace"" that will aim to ""improve global governance"" and contribute to ""the development and progress of the world.”Xi is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in person while also holding a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia said the two leaders would talk about the further development of their partnership and both leaders are expected to sign important bilateral documents.Some observers say that China is trying to capitalize on the recent diplomatic credits that it received from mediating the deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which led to the two countries re-establishing diplomatic ties.""They want to push towards at least the beginning of a negotiation process between Russia and Ukraine,"" said Velina Tchakarova, a geopolitical expert based in Austria. ""That's why they accelerated the visit.""Tchakarova adds that China and Russia will try to use the trip to amplify the anti-Western and anti-US narratives while showcasing how strong the bond and bilateral relationship is. ""All of these are critical from Bejing's perspective as it intends to deepen relations with many countries that are critical of the US,"" she told DW.Over the last year, China has tried to present itself as neutral in the ongoing war in Ukraine, urging both Russia and Ukraine to start peace talks while calling on the abandonment of a ""Cold War mentality."" Even though Bejing outlined its position on the war through a 12-point document last month, many western countries remain skeptical about China's intention, as it continues to uphold its partnership with Moscow.The United States warned that China may consider supplying lethal weapons to Russia, but German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said earlier this month that Beijing had claimed that it wouldn't cross that line. And after China brokered the Iran-Saudi deal last week, some countries and analysts think China may play a similar role in the Ukraine war.However, Andrew Small, a senior fellow at German Marshall Fund (GMF), believes that while Beijing wants to present itself as a mediator, there are doubts about whether China would be willing to push any party in the ongoing conflict to pursue peace talks. ""China would have to put pressure on Russia but we haven't seen any indication of real willingness to do that,"" he told DW.Other analysts say China's efforts to frame itself as a mediator in global conflict are only true on the surface and the bigger intention is to ""drive wedges between the US and European countries."" ""While Beijing knows Washington's perception of China's stance on the war can't be changed, they think they could do something to change the perception of China in Europe,"" said Justyna Szczudlik, a China analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM).Even though Beijing tries to present itself as ""peaceful"" to certain countries, Szczudlik thinks the fact that China still hasn't publicly condemned Russia's war proves that they haven't changed their position on the war. ""Trying to convince Ukraine and Russia to enter peace talks without calling Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine is the best evidence that China can't be a mediator,"" she told DW.Despite skepticism from some Western countries, Ukraine still thinks China can play an important role in facilitating the peace process in the ongoing war. On the anniversary of the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Beijing to join a summit to discuss what Kyiv describes as a peace formula.Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang held a call with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on March 16, emphasizing that Beijing's stance on the war remains objective and fair and that it's committed to promoting peace and advancing negotiations. He added that China has been calling on the international community to create conditions for peace talks.Tchakarova said Kyiv understood China was one of the very few countries that could exercise influence on Russia and push both sides toward resuming peace talks. She thinks Ukraine can use Zelensky's potential call with Xi to understand Beijing's position on the war, receive any message from Moscow and talk about some pressing, non-military issues such as commodity prices and grain exports.""Concrete topics like grain export, exchange of prisoners of war, or ensuring a safe humanitarian corridor are all part of a peace plan, and China can present these things as successes,"" she told DW.However, some countries remain skeptical of China's true stance on the war, as it continues to align itself closely with Russia diplomatically and economically. When China's top diplomat Wang Yi visited Moscow last month, he described bilateral ties between Moscow and Beijing as ""rock solid."" Wang added that China would remain committed to its ""cooperative relationship"" with Russia, regardless of how the international situation changes.China also remains one of the biggest trading partners for Russia at a time when Moscow faces a huge amount of sanctions imposed by the US-led western bloc. Beijing is the biggest buyer of Russian oil while bilateral trade grew 34.3% in 2022, according to Chinese state media Global Times.Szczudlik from PISM argues that for Beijing and Moscow, it is important to make the authoritarian states stronger as they view the US-led western bloc as forming an encirclement around autocratic states like theirs. ""From the Chinese and Russian perspective, it is the survival of the authoritarian countries that's at stake,"" she told DW.Straddling between the need to engage Ukraine while upholding its partnership with Russia, Small from GMF describes Xi's trip to Moscow as ""extremely delicate.""""This trip needs to be carefully handled, as there is still a perception that Beijing continues to double down on its relationship with Russia,"" he said.Amid China's efforts to present itself as a potential mediator for the Ukraine war, Beijing has also increased its diplomatic charm offensive in recent months, organizing a series of summits with leaders from Belarus, Iran and Saudi Arabia while attempting to repair relationships with western countries like Australia and Germany.Small from GMF told DW that these moves are China's attempts to consolidate its own block. ""A lot of this is block-building as much as it's peace-building,"" he told DW, adding that China is trying to ensure it has a group of allies in the ongoing struggle and competition with the United States.Other experts add that Beijing will also try to increase its global visibility through the role it plays in the ongoing Ukraine war. ""The war is a stepping stone for China to obtain bigger credibility internationally,"" said Una Cerenkova, head of the China Studies Center at Riga Stradins University. ""If China wants to uphold its credibility, Xi needs to talk to Zelensky sooner or later.""Despite some hope that China may help facilitate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, experts cautioned against being too optimistic about the prospect of Beijing being a ""benign peace actor.""""China still sees Russia as the most important partner and that's not going to change,"" said Small from GMF.""The West should keep an eye on a much-riskier scenario, which is what forms of China's support to Russia will continue to deepen. The question is whether this will create the preconditions for China to make weapons transfers to [Russia] in the future. The reasons to be concerned about where the China-Russia relationship is headed remain,"" he concluded.Edited by: Andreas Illmer",2023/3/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840452,Kazakhstan's ruling party poised to win early election,"Early parliamentary elections are held in Kazakhstan on Sunday. Polling stations in the Central Asian country, which has two time zones, are scheduled to close at 8 p.m. (1400 or 1500 GMT) on Sunday.President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced the early vote as part of a ""modernization"" drive introduced months after protests against fuel prices erupted in January last year. The demonstrations were heavily repressed and 238 people died, according to the official toll.Despite receiving Moscow's backing during the 2022 unrest, Tokayev has refused to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine or recognize its annexation of some Ukrainian territories.At the same time, Astana is trying to maintain good relationships with both Moscow, its neighbour and major trading partner, and the West, which seeks to isolate Russia.In the run-up to the elections, Tokayev initiated several reforms and promised a process of democratization. As a result, all 98 members of Kazakhstan's lower house of parliament are now directly elected.International election observers have praised some of the innovations, such as the lowering of the threshold for entering parliament from 7% to 5%, the admission of non-party candidates, and a 30 percent quota  women, young people and people with disabilities.But they have also criticized a lack of press freedom and freedom of speech. However, for the first time in almost two decades, several opposition figures are running as independents, a move which may allow some government critics to win a limited number of seats.Although he formally became president in 2019, Tokayev had remained in the shadow of his predecessor and former patron Nursultan Nazarbayev until January 2022, when the two fell out in the midst of violent unrest in the country.Tokayev sidelined Nazarbayev, after suppressing the protests and had a number of his associates removed from senior positions in the public sector, some of whom later faced corruption charges. Tokayev was reelected in November 2022.While Tokayev has reshuffled the government, the lower house of parliament, which was elected when Nazarbayev still had sweeping powers, was not due for election until 2026, so the Kazahk president called a snap vote.Unlike Nazarbayev, Tokayev has chosen not to lead the ruling Nur Otan party, rebranded Amanat, but polls show it is likely to retain a comfortable parliamentary majority and form the core of his support base in the legislature, especially in the absence of strong opposition parties on the ballot.dh/jcg (dpa, Reuters, AFP)",2023/3/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840453,Ukraine updates: Putin visits occupied city of Mariupol,"Russian President Vladimir Putin paid an unannounced visit to the occupied Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, the Kremlin announced on Sunday. It was his first visit to Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine's Donbas region.After his arrival in a helicopter, he visited several locations in the city that Russian forces leveled to the ground and spoke with local residents, according to state news media.The visit comes after Putin visited Crimea to mark the ninth anniversary of the Black Sea peninsula's annexation from Ukraine, a move most of the world has condemned as illegal.Russian media reported that Putin also met in Rostov with the top commander of his military operation in Ukraine, including Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, at the Rostov-on-Don command post in southern Russia.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year. The fighting over Mariupol, in the Donetsk region, began in February and raged until Russia took the city's last defenders captive in May.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Saturday, March 18:In the beginning of March, authorities in the Russian-controlled part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast published a decree that declared occupied Melitopol as the oblast capital, the British Ministry of Defence said in its daily update.The Russian-installed head of the oblast, Evgeniy Balitskiy, said that this was a temporary measure until the city of Zaporizhzhia was controlled by Russia, according to an update.Zaporizhzhia is one of the four oblasts President Putin claimed to have annexed as part of the Russian Federation on 30 September 2022.However, Russia has never occupied Zaporizhzhia city, a major industrial centre of 700,000 people, which is approximately 35 kilometers from the current front line.The quiet declaration of an alternative capital is likely tacit acknowledgement within the Russian system that its forces are highly unlikely to seize previously planned major objectives in the near future, the British ministry concluded.The Czech Republic has mastered the largest immigration influx in its history — of Ukrainian refugees — to the advantage of the business sector. Many Ukrainians have legal jobs, despite nationalist narratives.dh,ar/jcg (dpa, AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/3/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840454,"In Chicago mayor's race, 2 hopefuls reflect Democrats' split","CHICAGO (AP) — Before they were rivals to be Chicago’s next mayor, Paul Vallas and Brandon Johnson both worked in education, though their career paths — like their views on the city's future — were very different.Vallas was CEO of Chicago Public Schools, appointed by then-Mayor Richard M. Daley after Illinois lawmakers in the 1990s gave control of the troubled district to City Hall. Vallas came to be known as a turnaround expert in Chicago and in other U.S. school districts, supporting charter schools and voucher programs.Johnson taught middle and high schoolers before becoming an organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union, mobilizing thousands during a historic 2012 strike and in actions since that focused on strengthening public schools and the communities around them.It is just one example, but a significant one, of the contrasts between the two men now vying to lead the heavily Democratic city.Johnson is a progressive county commissioner who last month advanced to an April 4 runoff thanks to heavy support from the teachers union and who is now endorsed by progressive U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Vallas, who finished first out of nine candidates in the February vote, is a more moderate Democrat who was endorsed by the Chicago police union and has focused strongly on reducing crime. Among his supporters are prominent members of the business community.Both men defeated Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who tried positioning herself between the two as a middle-of-the-road Democrat. She was the first incumbent to lose reelection in roughly 40 years.The April contest reflects a broader tension for Democrats nationwide, pitting the candidates and the people and groups supporting them against each other in an increasingly bitter five-week campaign that already has cost millions of dollars. So far, some of the party’s leaders — from President Joe Biden to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and the state’s two U.S. senators — are opting not to endorse either candidate, possibly seeing political risk in picking a side.For voters in Chicago, the two candidates offer clear distinctions on issues from education to crime and taxes, as well as very different biographies that have shaped their political lives.Johnson, 46, is Black. The son of a minister, he grew up one of 10 kids in a family he says struggled to pay bills, sometimes having to run a power cord into their home from a neighbor's house to have electricity. An older brother died homeless and addicted.Now a married father of three, Johnson lives in one of Chicago's most violent neighborhoods and says he has to drive his children to another part of the city to attend a school that offers orchestra.He speaks of Chicago as a “tale of two cities,” where some people — largely in minority neighborhoods that have seen decades of disinvestment — fight to get by, while others have great wealth and live in areas where with grocery stores, libraries and parks.U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, who had strong support from Latino voters as he finished fourth in February, cited Johnson's ability to unite people of color as the congressman announced his former rival last week.Vallas, 69, is white. He was the only non-Black or Hispanic candidate in the first round, when he was the top vote-getter with 33% to Johnson's 22%.The grandson of Greek immigrants, Vallas worked in his family restaurant growing up and later was a state legislator and Chicago budget director. He stresses that he comes from a family of public servants, including veterans, teachers and police officers. Two of Vallas’ sons were police officers, though one left the force to become a firefighter, he says. Vallas has run for office unsuccessfully several times, including for governor in 2002 and Chicago mayor in 2019, when he finished toward the bottom of the pack.Vallas says he is running to be mayor “for all of Chicago,” and that the fundamental first step is to make the country's third-largest city safer — including by hiring hundreds more police officers — and rebuilding trust between the police department and residents.He has criticized Johnson as supporting a movement to “defund” the police, which activists across the United States called for after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in 2020.Johnson says he would not cut the number of police officers in the department. But as a county commissioner, he sponsored a symbolic resolution to redirect money from law enforcement to social services, such as mental health care. In a 2020 interview, Johnson said defunding was not just a slogan but an “actual political goal.”Asked about the comment during a debate this month, Johnson distanced himself, saying, “I said it was a political goal, I never said it was mine.”Johnson has attacked Vallas as a Republican in disguise, noting that Vallas has made comments about being more of a Republican than a Democrat and accepted the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. The group recently hosted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, considered a top GOP candidate for president in 2024, though Vallas issued a statement rebuking the Republican.Vallas' support for abortion rights also has been called into question. Illinois is one of the few places in the central U.S. where abortion is legal, which has made the state, and Chicago, a destination for people seeking the procedure.On a conservative talk show in 2009, Vallas said he is opposed to abortion, a comment his campaign says was taken out of context. During a recent debate he said it’s “nonsense” that he opposes reproductive rights. Vallas explained he is Greek Orthodox, a religion that opposes abortion, but that he personally does not — a stance similar to top Democrats who are Catholic.“I have the same position as Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden,” Vallas said.Education policy is another dividing line.Chicago Public Schools canceled classes for five days in January 2022 after union members refused to return to in-person classes due to concerns about COVID-19 safety measures. Vallas said Johnson was partly responsible for that and other closures that shut down “one of the poorest school systems in the country, with devastating consequences,” including an increase in crime.Johnson has criticized Vallas' leadership of schools in Chicago and in subsequent jobs he held in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, in Philadelphia and Connecticut. Vallas' administration punished low-performing schools, including by firing staff in Chicago schools with poor test scores, and under his leadership, many New Orleans schools became independently run charter schools.Vallas questioned how Johnson would be able to lead the city independently from the Chicago Teachers Union, which has bankrolled much of his campaign. Johnson said that if he is elected mayor, he will no longer be a member of the union, but he will work collaboratively with them.Vallas' endorsement by the Fraternal Order of Police has drawn criticism from Johnson, who notes the union's leader voiced support for the Jan. 6 insurrectionists. Vallas says he has not taken any money from the union and will not be beholden to the group if elected.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840455,Syria's Assad in UAE to mark ongoing thaw in relations,"BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian President Bashar Assad arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, his first visit to the wealthy Gulf country since the devastating earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria last month.Assad, who arrived with his wife, Asma, and a delegation of Syrian officials, was received by UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, according to a statement from Assad’s office.Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement on Twitter that the two “held constructive talks aimed at developing relations between our two countries.”The visit marks a continuation in the ongoing thaw of relations between Syria and other Arab countries, more than a decade after the 22-member Arab League suspended Damascus' membership over Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters and later on civilians during the war.International sympathy following the quake appears to have sped up the regional rapprochement that had been brewing for years. Before the tragedy, the UAE had already reestablished ties with Damascus. Assad’s first visit to the UAE since the 2011 outbreak of the Syrian civil war was last year, followed by another visit in January of this year.After the earthquake, the UAE’s foreign minister visited Damascus, and the Gulf country sent dozens of aid shipments to Syria.Damascus hopes that the regional reconciliation will unlock long-awaited funds to rebuild the battered country. However, analysts said it is unlikely to happen on any large scale for now.One key barrier: Syria has not implemented U.N. Security Council resolution 2254 adopted in December 2015 as a road map to peace in Syria. Acceptance of the road map is a key demand of the U.S and the European Union for normalizing relations with Damascus.The World Bank said Sunday that Syria’s real gross domestic product is expected to contract by 5.5% in 2023 following the earthquake, with physical damages estimated at $3.7 billion and economic losses at $1.5 billion, bringing the total estimated impact to $5.2 billion. That's on top of the preexisting damages from 12 years of war.“Economic growth may contract further if reconstruction progress is slower than expected, given limited public resources, weak private investment, and limited humanitarian assistance reaching the affected areas,” the Bank said in a statement.",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840458,"Higher cancer rates found in military pilots, ground crews","WASHINGTON (AP) — A Pentagon study has found high rates of cancer among military pilots and for the first time has shown that ground crews who fuel, maintain and launch those aircraft are also getting sick.The data had long been sought by retired military aviators who have raised alarms for years about the number of air and ground crew members they knew who had cancer. They were told that earlier military studies had found they were not at greater risk than the general U.S. population.In its yearlong study of almost 900,000 service members who flew on or worked on military aircraft between 1992 and 2017, the Pentagon found that air crew members had an 87% higher rate of melanoma and a 39% higher rate of thyroid cancer, while men had a 16% higher rate of prostate cancer and women a 16% higher rate of breast cancer. Overall, the air crews had a 24% higher rate of cancer of all types.The study showed ground crews had a 19% higher rate of brain and nervous system cancers, a 15% higher rate of thyroid cancer and a 9% higher rate of kidney or renal cancers, while women had a 7% higher rate of breast cancer. The overall rate for cancers of all types was 3% higher.There was some good news reported as well. Both ground and air crews had far lower rates of lung cancer, and air crews also had lower rates of bladder and colon cancers.The data compared the service members with the general U.S. population after adjusting for age, sex and race.The Pentagon said the new study was one of the largest and most comprehensive to date. An earlier study had looked at just Air Force pilots and had found some higher rates of cancer, while this one looked across all services and at both air and ground crews. Even with the wider approach, the Pentagon cautioned that the actual number of cancer cases was likely to be even higher because of gaps in the data, which it said it would work to remedy.The study “proves that it’s well past time for leaders and policy makers to move from skepticism to belief and active assistance,” said retired Air Force Col. Vince Alcazar, a member of the Red River Valley Fighter Pilots Association, which had lobbied the Pentagon and Congress for help. Alcazar serves on the association’s medical issues committee.The study was required by Congress in the 2021 defense bill. Now, because higher rates were found, the Pentagon must conduct an even bigger review to try to understand why the crews are getting sick.Isolating potential causes is difficult, and the Pentagon was careful to note that this study “does not imply that military service in air crew or ground crew occupations causes cancer, because there are multiple potential confounding factors that could not be controlled for in this analysis,” such as family histories, smoking or alcohol use.But aviation crews have long asked for the Pentagon to look closely at some of the environmental factors they are exposed to, such as jet fuels and solvents used to clean and maintain jet parts, sensors and their power sources in aircraft nose cones, and the massive radar systems on the decks of the ships they land on.When Navy Capt. Jim Seaman would come home from a deployment aboard an aircraft carrier, his gear would reek of jet fuel, his widow Betty Seaman said. The A-6 Intruder pilot died in 2018 at age 61 of lung cancer. Betty Seaman still has his gear stored and it still smells of fuel, “which I love,” she said.She and others wonder if there's a link. She said crews would talk about how even the ship's water systems would smell of fuel.She said she and others have mixed feelings about finally seeing in data what they have suspected for years about the aviation cancers. But “it has the potential to do a lot of good as far as early communication, early detection,"" she said.The study found that when crew members were diagnosed with cancer, they were more likely to survive than members of the general population, which the study suggested was because they were diagnosed earlier due to regular required medical checkups and were more likely to be in better health because of their military fitness requirements.The Pentagon acknowledged that the study had gaps that likely led to an undercount of cancer cases.The military heath system database used in the study did not have reliable cancer data until 1990, so it may not have included pilots who flew early-generation jets in the prior decades.The study also did not include cancer data from the Department of Veterans Affairs or state cancer registries, which means it did not capture cases from former crew members who got sick after leaving the military medical system.“It is important to note that study results may have differed had additional older former service members been included,” it said.To remedy that, the Pentagon is now going to pull data from those registries to add to the total count, the study said.The second phase of the study will try to isolate causes. The 2021 bill requires the Defense Department not only to identify “the carcinogenic toxicants or hazardous materials associated with military flight operations,” but also determine the type of aircraft and locations where diagnosed crews served.After her husband got sick, Betty Seaman asked him if he would have chosen differently, knowing his service might be linked to his cancer.“I flat-out asked Jim. And he, without hesitation, said, ‘I would have still done it.’”",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840478,Nations approve key UN science report on climate change,"BERLIN (AP) — Governments gave their blessing on Sunday to a major new U.N. report on climate change, after approval was held up by a battle between rich and developing countries over emissions targets and financial aid to vulnerable nations.The report by hundreds of the world’s top scientists was supposed to be approved by government delegations on Friday at the end of a weeklong meeting in the Swiss town of Interlaken.The closing gavel was repeatedly pushed back as officials from big nations such as China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, the United States and the European Union haggled through the weekend over the wording of key phrases in the text.The report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change caps a series that digests vast amounts of research on global warming compiled since the Paris climate accord was agreed in 2015.A summary of the report was approved early Sunday but agreement on the main text dragged on for several more hours, with some observers fearing it might need to be postponed.The U.N. plans to publish the report at a news conference early Monday afternoon.The unusual process of having countries sign off on a scientific report is intended to ensure that governments accept its findings as authoritative advice on which to base their actions.At the start of the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called on delegates to provide “ cold, hard facts ” to drive home the message that there's little time left for the world to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial times.While average global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 Celsius since the 19th century, Guterrres insisted that the 1.5-degree target limit remains possible ""with rapid and deep emissions reductions across all sectors of the global economy.”Observers said the IPCC meetings have increasingly become politicized as the stakes for curbing global warming increase, mirroring the annual U.N. climate talks that usually take place at the end of the year.Among the thorniest issues at the current meeting were how to define which nations count as vulnerable developing countries, making them eligible for cash from a “loss and damage” fund agreed on at the last U.N. climate talks in Egypt. Delegates have also battled over figures stating how much greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by over the coming years, and how to include artificial or natural carbon removal efforts in the equations.As the country that has released the biggest amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since industrialization, the United States has pushed back strongly against the notion of historic responsibility for climate change.___A previous version of this story corrected an erroneous reference to the United Nations, when it should have been the United States, in the third paragraph.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840479,How to shop for new insurance if you lose Medicaid coverage,"Medicaid coverage will end for millions of Americans in the coming months, and it will push many into unfamiliar territory: the health insurance marketplace.States will start cutting people from the government-funded plans when they no longer qualify based on income, a process that has been paused since shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic hit.The timing of these cuts will vary. But all states have insurance markets where people who lose Medicaid can buy new coverage with help from subsidies. Some states will even connect shoppers with a potential new plan.Shopping for affordable insurance that covers regular doctors and prescriptions can be daunting, especially in marketplaces that offer dozens of choices and subsidies to help pay for them. Experts say it helps to start this search with a plan. Here’s a deeper look at the process.WHAT’S HAPPENING TO MEDICAID?Nearly 85 million people are covered by government-funded Medicaid, which focuses on people with low incomes.At the start of the pandemic, the federal government prohibited states from kicking people off Medicaid if they were no longer eligible. That ban ends this spring, and many people on Medicaid will be introduced to this so-called redetermination process for the first time.States are already verifying eligibility. Some, like Arizona, Arkansas and Idaho are expected to start ending coverage for ineligible people in April. Most states will be doing that in May, June and July.Federal officials estimate that more than 8 million people will lose eligibility and leave Medicaid mainly because their incomes have changed.WHERE TO GET NEW COVERAGEState-based health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act are the only places where people can buy individual insurance with help from an income-based subsidy. They can be found through the federal government’s healthcare.gov website.Shoppers also can find coverage sold outside these marketplaces, but it may be risky. For instance, short-term plans can exclude coverage of certain things like a medical condition someone had before signing up.INCOME-BASED SUBSIDIESThe cost of any new plan should be one of the first things people consider. Shoppers can get income-based subsidies to help pay monthly premiums of plans they buy on the state-based marketplaces. Those subsidies were enhanced during the pandemic.People often don’t realize they can get this help, said Jeremy Smith, director of West Virginia’s health insurance navigator program, which helps shoppers find coverage.“A very large percentage of people can qualify for a plan starting at $0 per month,” he said.COVERAGE DIFFERENCESIndividual insurance differs from Medicaid in several ways. Some marketplace plans come with a big deductible that people must pay before most coverage starts.Shoppers should understand deductibles and other payments they will need to make before committing to a plan, Smith noted.Individual insurance also groups hospitals and doctors in networks. The insurance may cover much less of the bill for care received outside those networks. Shoppers should learn how any regular doctors and medications are covered before enrolling in a new plan.Individual insurance also can give people more care choices. Many doctors don’t accept Medicaid, and states may pay for only a limited amount of prescriptions.“It is possible that people will have better access to certain services in the marketplace,” said Jennifer Tolbert, a Medicaid expert at the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation.IMPORTANT STEPS IF YOU'RE ON MEDICAIDMake sure your state program has your current contact information, including a mailing address plus email and cellphone. They will send notifications if they need more information or if someone no longer qualifies for Medicaid.“Everyone should do that before April,” said said Joshua Brooker, an independent broker based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. “It’s going to make a smoother transition.”Start shopping for new insurance before Medicaid ends. Shoppers should allow plenty of time to sort through options.The goal should be to have new insurance that starts the day after Medicaid ends. That would cut down on temporary coverage losses for regular doctors or important medicines.Once shoppers register to shop in the insurance marketplace, they have 60 days to find a plan.GETTING HELPSeeking assistance may be a good idea, especially for people who need help figuring out their income for the coming year. That's needed to calculate subsidies.There are several ways people can get help.States will transfer the names and contact information of those who no longer qualify for Medicaid to their marketplaces. They also will send a letter to Medicaid beneficiaries telling them how to connect to the marketplace, said Kate McEvoy, executive director of the nonprofit National Association of Medicaid Directors.Some states will go further. California’s marketplace, Covered California, will enroll people in a qualified health plan and send them the information. Those people then must confirm enrollment and pay the first premium to remain covered.State marketplaces have navigators like Smith who can help people sort through options and understand potential plans. The government-funded navigators are free to use but they cannot recommend any specific choices.Federally qualified health centers also have counselors who can help people apply.Independent brokers also help people sort through options. They will get a fee that usually comes out of the premium you wind up paying.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840480,Starc leads Australia's demolition of India to level series,"VISAKHAPATNAM, India (AP) — Mitchell Starc led an Australian fast-bowling demolition of India as the visitors won the second ODI by 10 wickets to level the three-match series on Sunday.Starc took 5-53 in eight overs, his ninth ODI five-wicket haul, as India was bowled out for 117 runs in 26 overs. Sean Abbott took 3-23 in six overs while Nathan Ellis picked up 2-13 in five.In reply, openers Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh smacked Indian bowling to all parts of the ground as Australia won in a canter.It scored 121 runs in 11 overs to completely dominate the game, with Marsh hitting 66 not out off 36 balls.It was India’s heaviest ODI defeat in terms of balls remaining as Australia won with 39 overs (234 balls) to spare. The three-match series is now level 1-1, after India won the first ODI in Mumbai by five wickets.Put in to bat in bowling friendly conditions, India made a poor start. Shubman Gill was out caught for a duck in Starc’s first over.Rohit Sharma (13) and Virat Kohli added 29 runs for the second wicket, the most for an Indian pair on the day before the collapse began in earnest.Starc had Sharma caught at slip in the fifth over, and then trapped Suryakumar Yadav lbw for a golden duck.He also trapped Lokesh Rahul for nine runs leaving India down to 48-4. In the next over, Abbott removed Hardik Pandya for one run with the score reading 49-5 in 9.2 overs.Kohli top-scored with 31 runs off 35 balls and added 22 runs with Ravindra Jadeja, who scored 16 off 39 balls.That slowed the fall of wickets as India crossed the 50-run mark. However, any chance of an Indian revival was negated when Ellis trapped Kohli lbw in the 16th over.Jadeja added another 20 runs with Axar Patel to edge closer to the 100-run mark, before falling to Ellis.Abbott helped mop up the tail, while Starc returned to complete his fiver, bowling Mohammed Siraj for a duck.In between, Patel smacked two sixes to help India past 100, albeit that didn’t spare the hosts' embarrassment. He scored 29 not out off 29 balls, including a four and two sixes even as India was bowled out for its lowest total against Australia at home. Its previous lowest score was 148 at Vadodara in 2007.It was Starc’s ninth five-wicket haul in 109 ODI innings, the joint-most for an Australia bowler along with Brett Lee (217 innings). He is also joint-third with Shahid Afridi (Pakistan) on the all-time five-for list, with only Pakistan’s Waqar Younis (13) and Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan (10) ahead of him.He was named player of the match for his efforts.“My rhythm has been good of late. I bowled a little fuller than other guys. Both the pitches in this series have helped seamers. My role is to attack the stumps and bring every form of dismissal into play,” he said.In reply, Australia wasted little time in finishing things off. It raced to the finish line in just 11 overs as India gave up any hope of a fight back.Marsh continued his Mumbai form, smashing six sixes and six fours. He reached his half-century off 28 balls.At the other end, Head hit 10 fours to reach 50 off 29 balls, finishing unbeaten on 51 runs off 30 balls.Their 100-run stand came off only 53 balls as the Sunday crowd was forced to endure a lop-sided game resulting in a dominant Australian win.The third ODI will be played in Chennai on Wednesday. ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/19,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840484,"Republican bills push cash bail, subvert Democratic changes","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Just two days before he drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee, killing six people and injuring more than 60, Darrell Brooks Jr. had posted bail for charges of domestic violence.He had been accused of using his SUV to run over the mother of his child, and a pretrial assessment found Brooks was at high risk of reoffending. But a court official set that bail at a mere $1,000 cash at the request of prosecutors, who later called their recommendation a mistake. For the parade killings, Brooks was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Brooks quickly became the poster child for a Republican-backed push to enact tougher bail policies. The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature is asking voters to ratify a constitutional amendment that would make it harder for violent criminals to get out of jail on bail.GOP lawmakers in other states also are scrambling to make it harder for defendants to get out of jail before trial after branding themselves as tough on crime in the 2022 midterm elections. Their efforts have led to a fierce fight with Democrats over public safety and the rights of criminal defendants.Recent Democratic overhaul measures in states such as Illinois and New York have sought to eliminate cash bail and lessen pretrial detention on the premise they do more harm than good, especially to marginalized groups.But Republican lawmakers in at least 14 states have introduced some 20 bills so far this year to do just the opposite. Their proposals include increasing the number of non-bailable offenses, requiring more people to pay cash bail and encouraging or requiring judges to consider a defendant’s criminal record when setting bail.Criminal justice experts and advocacy groups warn the Republican-backed measures aren’t supported by research and could worsen crime rates and disparities between rich and poor. Bail is meant to ensure a defendant returns to court and isn't supposed to be a punishment, since the defendant hasn't yet been convicted.“Cash bail is not a benefit to defendants or to public safety,” said Shima Baradaran Baughman, a law professor at the University of Utah who studies bail.“When people are detained before trial even for a few days, they are dramatically more likely to reoffend later,” Baughman said. “In other words, it is much safer to the public to release most people before trial than to detain them.”Defendants jailed before trial are much more likely to plead guilty to charges — often accepting deals that sentence them to time already served that end their detainment, researchers from Harvard, Stanford and Princeton found in a 2018 study. The same study found higher unemployment rates for pretrial detainees after they're released. It’s not uncommon for defendants who can’t make bail to lose their jobs and even their homes while in jail awaiting trial.While Republicans seeking to widen the use of bail acknowledge people are legally presumed innocent before trial, some say they believe most defendants are ultimately guilty and that society would be safer if more are locked up.Georgia Sen. Randy Robertson, a longtime sheriff’s deputy and former state president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said he is “extremely confident” that most arrestees are guilty.In February, the GOP-led Georgia state Senate passed a Robertson proposal that would add 53 offenses to a current list of just seven charges that always require cash or property bail. The new offenses include passing a bad check, which can be a misdemeanor or a felony, and such misdemeanors as reckless driving or fighting in public. Robertson argues that victims feel the justice system doesn’t care about them when suspects are released without cash bail.The measure requires three-time felons to post cash or property bail, as well as those with felony convictions in the past seven years. It also says any defendant can't be released without posting bail unless they appear before a judge.The measures in Georgia, Wisconsin and elsewhere worry Insha Rahman, vice president of advocacy and partnerships at the Vera Institute for Justice. “When you are setting money bail on all kinds of offenses and judges can’t release people, you are absolutely treading on presumption of innocence,” she said.Rahman, a former public defender who helped design bail laws in New York and other states, said the best research supports ending cash bail and offering personalized release conditions for most defendants. People who pose a “clear and immediate” threat to public safety are the exception, she said, and should be detained until trial.“All money bail does is privilege the amount of money someone has in their pocket, not public safety,"" Rahman said.Wisconsin Republican Sen. Van Wanggard, a former police officer who sponsored the constitutional amendment that gained traction after the Waukesha parade killings, said he doesn't believe imposing cash bail on more people or requiring higher bail violates the presumption of innocence.“If someone is a repetitive criminal, I surely would rather have that individual locked up than out committing another crime,” Wanggaard said.If ratified by Wisconsin voters on April 4, the amendment would let judges setting bail consider the criminal history of someone accused of a violent crime. Wisconsin judges currently can only set bail as a means to ensure someone returns to court. The measure also would require judges to publicly lay out their reasoning for the bail amounts they set.Opponents criticize as overbroad the expanded list of crimes under the amendment, including watching a dog fight, violating a court order against contacting criminal gang members and negligently leaving a firearm where a child gains access to it.Ohio voters passed a similar amendment in November, requiring judges to consider a suspect’s threat to public safety when setting bail. Bills in Indiana and Missouri would likewise give judges more latitude to consider public safety and criminal histories.In New York, bail has been a polarizing issue since majority Democrats passed a 2019 law abolishing pretrial incarceration for most nonviolent offenses. Many prosecutors, police officials, Republicans and even some moderate Democrats argued the changes threatened public safety.Republican candidates running against crime saw big gains in New York City's suburbs in 2022. And Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, under pressure from voters, has said she wants to revisit bail laws this year to give judges more leeway when setting bail.Democratic bail changes in Illinois ran into roadblocks when the state Supreme Court halted a new law that would have eliminated cash bail beginning Jan. 1. Prosecutors and sheriffs from 64 counties had sued, challenging the measure. The Supreme Court heard arguments on the lawsuit last week.Baughman, the Utah law professor, said the Illinois law would likely both release more people before trial and improve public safety.“We are the only country in the world that forces defendants to pay money to obtain a constitutional right of release before trial,” she said. “Poor defendants and people of color are most harmed when cash bail becomes the norm in a jurisdiction.”___Associated Press writer Jeff Amy contributed from Atlanta and writer Michael Hill contributed from Albany, New York.___Harm Venhuizen is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840493,Vandals attack French politician's office over pensions row,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron pledged Sunday to protect lawmakers facing threats for supporting his push to raise the retirement age, amid sustained strikes and protests over the pension bill ahead of high-stakes votes in parliament Monday.Protesters vandalized the office of the president of the conservative Republican party overnight, in an apparent threat to get his party to block Macron’s pension reform.Eric Ciotti tweeted a photo of his office in the French Riviera city of Nice with shattered windows after a paving stone was thrown at it. The vandals also scrawled the words “the motion or the stone” — in reference to two no-confidence motions to be voted on Monday in the lower house of parliament.Other officials have also reported vandalism or intimidation attempts in recent days for their support for the retirement bill.In response, Macron called the speakers of both houses of parliament to affirm his support for all legislators and said the government was mobilized to “put everything in place to protect them,” the president's office said Sunday night.Macron also reiterated his wish for the bill to “reach the end of its democratic path in a context of respect for everyone.”After weeks of mass protests and punishing strikes, Macron last week ordered Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne to invoke a special constitutional power to push the bill through by skirting a vote in the lower chamber of parliament. In response, opposition lawmakers filed no-confidence motions against her Cabinet.Ciotti had announced his party would not vote for either of the two motions of censure — meaning there would not be enough votes to stop the law from coming into force.Reacting to the vandals, Ciotti tweeted: “I will never give in to the new disciples of terror.”Getting a no-confidence motion to pass will be challenging — none has succeeded since 1962, and Macron’s centrist alliance still has the most seats in the National Assembly. A minority of conservatives could stray from the Republicans party line, but it remains to be seen whether they’re willing to bring down Macron’s government.Garbage collection in Paris remained disrupted in some neighborhoods Sunday by a protracted sanitation workers' strike. A few hundred people demonstrated outside the Les Halles shopping center in Paris before police dispersed them. Earlier Sunday, dozens of union activists marched through a shopping mall in the Paris suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois.Macron argues the pension overhaul is needed to keep the system afloat as the population ages.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840494,Pakistani police file terrorism charges against ex-PM Khan,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Police in the Pakistani capital filed charges Sunday against former Prime Minister Imran Khan, 17 of his aides and scores of supporters, accusing them of terrorism and several other offenses after the ousted premier's followers clashed with security forces in Islamabad the previous day.For hours on Saturday, Khan's followers clashed with police outside a court where the former prime minister was to appear in a graft case. Riot police wielded batons and fired tear gas while Khan's supporters threw fire bombs and hurled rocks at the officers.More than 50 officers were injured and a police checkpoint, several cars and motorcycles were torched. Police said 59 of Khan's supporters were arrested during the violence.Khan never actually appeared inside the court to face charges that he had sold state gifts received while in office and concealed assets.Besides Khan, the case filed Sunday also accuses former and current lawmakers, former ministers, a former National Assembly speaker and scores of Khan's supporters. The charges include terrorism, obstructing police officers in carrying out their tasks, attacks on police, wounding officers and threatening their lives.The developments are the latest involving increasing violence surrounding the 70-year-old Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. Since then, the former cricket star turned Islamist politician has claimed — without offering evidence — that his ouster was illegal and a conspiracy by the government of his successor, Shahbaz Sharif, and Washington. Both Sharif and the United States have denied the allegations.Also on Saturday, violence erupted again outside Khan's home in the eastern city of Lahore, where officers and Khan's supporters had clashed for two straight days in a standoff earlier last week, after police arrived in the upscale neighborhood to arrest Khan.Amid tear gas and clashes, police stormed Khan’s residence, and later said they arrested 61 suspects and seized petrol bombs, weapons and ammunition. Khan was not at home, having traveled to Islamabad for the court appearance. After he failed to appear in court, the judge postponed that hearing until March 30.In a recorded video message broadcast Sunday, Khan blamed police for his failure to appear in court on Saturday, saying he never left his vehicle as the police were lobbing tear gas at his convoy and supporters.Without offering anything to back his claim, Khan said his opponents are bent on either putting him in jail or killing him, and denounced the raid on his home in Lahore as “shameful tactics, conspiracies and plans.”Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah accused Khan of “creating all the drama just to avoid” the courts.",2023/3/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840495,Serbian president criticizes ICC arrest warrant for Putin,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Issuing an international arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin will have negative consequences and will only prolong the war in Ukraine, Serbia’s president said Sunday.The International Criminal Court issued the warrant for the Russian leader on Friday, accusing him of war crimes. The ICC accused him of bearing personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine during Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor that started almost 13 months ago.But Serbian populist President Aleksandar Vucic, who had in the past boasted about his personal relation with the Russian leader, criticized the court’s decision.“I think issuing an arrest warrant for Putin, not to go into legal matters, will have bad political consequences and it says that there is a great reluctance to talk about peace (and) about truce” in Ukraine, Vucic told reporters in Belgrade.“My question is now that you have accused him of the biggest war crimes, who are you going to talk to now?” Vucic said.“Do you really think that it is possible to defeat Russia in a month, three months or a year?” he asked, adding: “There is no doubt that the goal of those who did this is to make it difficult for Putin to communicate, so that everyone who talks to him is aware that he is accused of war crimes.”Asked if Putin would be arrested if he comes to Serbia, Vucic said that it is “a pointless question, because it is clear that as long as the conflict (in Ukraine) continues, Putin has nowhere to go.”Although Serbia is seeking European Union membership, it has maintained close ties to Russia and is the only European state that has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow.Vucic, a strong opponent of international war crimes courts, was a ranking official of an ultranationalist party whose leader Vojislav Seselj and several other members ended up in the international war crimes court on trials for crimes they committed during the wars in the 1990s.In the late 1990s, Vucic was information minister in the government of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic during the war in Kosovo where Serb troops were accused of various war crimes committed against Kosovo Albanian separatists.Milosevic was arrested in Serbia on war crime charges in 2001.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840496,GOP donor faces trial on charges of sex trafficking minors,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A formerly well-connected Republican donor, accused of plying petite, vulnerable teenage girls with cash, liquor and gifts, goes on trial Tuesday on federal charges of sex trafficking minors.Anton “Tony” Lazzaro is charged with seven counts involving “commercial sex acts"" with five minors ages 15 and 16 in 2020, when he was 30 years old. His indictment touched off a political firestorm that led to the downfall of Jennifer Carnahan as chair of the Republican Party of Minnesota.His co-defendant, Gisela Castro Medina, who formerly led the College Republicans chapter at the University of St. Thomas, pleaded guilty to two counts last year. She is cooperating with prosecutors and will testify against him. She faces sentencing in August.Lazzaro denies the sex-trafficking allegations. He says the government targeted him for political reasons and because of his wealth.Prosecutors say it's simply a sex-trafficking case. They have not signaled any intent to call political figures as witnesses, nor has the defense. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz has already rejected Lazzaro's claims of selective prosecution.But Lazzaro insists he's innocent and that the charges are politically motivated.“Mr. Lazzaro believes he is being targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice for his political activities,"" spokeswoman Stacy Bettison said in a statement to The Associated Press. ""The unusual application of the federal sex trafficking statute to the facts in Mr. Lazzaro’s case supports his beliefs. He is not alone in his view that the U.S. Department of Justice is politicizing prosecutions. Many other individuals, including many members of Congress and most recently the Senate Judiciary Committee, have recently raised legitimate and credible concerns that Attorney General (Merrick) Garland is politicizing the department by aggressively investigating Republicans and conservative activists, like Mr. Lazzaro.”Carnahan is the widow of U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn, who died of kidney cancer in February 2022. She denied knowing of any wrongdoing by Lazzaro before the charges were unsealed in August 2021, and she condemned his alleged crimes. But his arrest fueled outrage among party activists. Allegations surfaced that she created a toxic work environment and abused nondisclosure agreements to silence her critics. She resigned a week later.Carnahan and Lazzaro became friends when she ran unsuccessfully for a legislative seat in 2016. He backed her bid to become party chair in 2017 and attended her 2018 wedding to Hagedorn. They hosted a podcast together for a few months.Lazzaro also helped run the campaign of Republican Lacy Johnson, who failed to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota, in 2020. Pictures on Lazzaro's social media accounts showed him with prominent Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence. He founded a political action committee called Big Tent Republicans, which advocated for a more inclusive party.Lazzaro gave more than $270,000 to Republican campaigns and political committees over the years, including $42,000 to the state party organization and $31,000 to Hagedorn's campaign. Several recipients quickly donated those contributions to charity after the charges became public, including U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, of Minnesota, who received $15,600 but suffered no repercussions. Emmer became majority whip in January.Prosecutors alleged in their trial brief earlier this month that Lazzaro conspired with Castro Medina and others to recruit 15- and 16-year-old girls to have sex with him in exchange for cash and valuable items. They met in May 2020 on a “sugar daddy” website when she was 18 years old and finishing high school, prosecutors wrote.According to the brief, Lazzaro had “a stated sexual preference for young, tiny girls” and liked them ""broken” and vulnerable — but without tattoos. Prosecutors say he paid Castro Medina “well over $50,000,” including money for her tuition, her off-campus apartment and her Mini Cooper.He often sent cars to take the girls to his luxury penthouse condo at the Hotel Ivy in downtown Minneapolis, prosecutors said.“Once the girls Castro Medina recruited arrived at Lazzaro’s apartment, a similar pattern ensued,"" the brief alleges. ""Lazzaro would brag about his wealth and connections. He would give the girls — small and young — hard liquor. Lazzaro would take out stacks of cash and offer the girls precise sums of money to perform certain sex acts with him, and with each other. $100 to kiss. $400 for sex. And so forth. He would send them home with cash, vapes, alcohol, Plan B, cell phones, and other items of value.” Plan B is a form of emergency birth control.Lazzaro is also the target of a lawsuit by one alleged victim who claims he offered $1,000 in hush money to her and her parents and asked them to sign a nondisclosure agreement.The charges against Lazzaro, who has been jailed since his arrest and has been denied bail, carry mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years with a maximum potential of life in prison.The sources of Lazzaro's wealth are murky. Defense filings have called him “an up-and-coming real estate owner and entrepreneur."" Items seized from him included a 2010 Ferrari and more than $371,000 in cash. The government put his net worth in a bond report at more than $2 million but said its calculations didn't include his “extensive” but hard-to-trace cryptocurrency holdings. It noted that the search yielded multiple types of foreign currency, plus precious metals worth more than $500,000.",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840503,Curious shifts in Taiwan's political landscape,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s national elections are ten months away, and primaries for candidates will start happening in the weeks to come, while major parties should have their tickets finalized by some time in June.However, there are some curious political shifts taking place that defy conventional wisdom. For example, it is generally assumed younger voters support the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) and former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) are poaching voters almost exclusively from the light-blue Kuomintang (KMT) support base.Four polls have come out in just nine days on the upcoming presidential race. All of them tested support in a hypothetical three-way race for Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) of the Kuomintang (KMT), and Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP).Lai and Ko are already declared to be running for president, so some of the polls included other options for the KMT candidate including Terry Gou (郭台銘) and Eric Chu (朱立倫). Two-way matchups with Ko not in the race were also included.The first was a poll released on March 10 by Taiwan’s Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) with Gallup. It was the only one to include assumed vice presidential candidates.It matched Lai with Vice Premier Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦) and together they got 36.45% of the vote, followed by the rather unlikely though not impossible combination of Terry Gou and Ko Wen-je snagging 23.59% and pulling up the rear was a Hou Yu-ih and Eric Chu combo at 18.23%.I think all three of those vice presidential picks are not the most likely ones, so the poll is not necessarily very useful, but I included it because it is interesting.Next out was a poll carried out on March 13-14 by Z.Media (震傳媒), which is reportedly affiliated with the KMT. According to the poll, Lai was favored by 39.3% of voters, followed by Hou's 27.8% and former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je's (柯文哲) 18.2%.There were some warning signs for the KMT in this poll, only 65% of pan-blue poll respondents saying they would cast their vote for Hou, which is really low. Hou even lost to Lai in New Taipei, the city he is mayor of.Then we get to the My-Formosa poll conducted on March 17-18. It has Lai with a slight lead at 33.7%, with Hou at 32.2% and Ko and 20.9%.Helpfully, My-Formosa provides graphics showing the results from previous polls, and this showed that Hou gained over 10% support between October and December of last year, putting him ahead of Lai for the first time, probably propelled by the KMT’s landslide victory in last November’s local elections. However, this latest poll saw him shed 7.7%, putting him only about three or four points higher than he had been polling up to last October.Interestingly, Ko’s trajectory was a partial mirror opposite of Hou, losing nearly 6% of his support between October and December last year, but bounced up 8.2% to breach 20% for the first time for his highest over showing.The final poll is from Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF) and is dated March 21, which is quite remarkable considering that this column is being written on March 19 and I’m looking right at it. Unlike the other three, this one has Hou ahead at 32.4%, Lai at 27.7%, and Ko at 19.5%.Curiously, this poll shows a counter-trend to the other three, with Hou gaining 1% since January to move ahead of Lai, Lai losing a surprising 6.3% to drop into second place and Ko dropping 2.8%. However, when compared to December, it comes closer to the My-Formosa poll, showing Hou having lost 6.3%, Lai having lost 1.3% and Ko up 1.7%.One question I’ve been pondering is where is the support for Ko and the TPP actually coming from? The assumption has been from light blue and independent voters.Since no pollster asks where Ko or TPP voters would go if they did not have either as an option, I compared the polling for the three-way matchups with the two-way matchups that leave off Ko to see where his voters go.In the Z.Media poll, his 18.2% is split with 12.3% going to Hou and 5.1% or 28% going to Lai. In the My-Formosa poll, Ko’s 20.9% went to Hou at 14.7% and 6.5% or 31% to Lai.In the temporally-challenged TPOF poll, his 19.5% is divided up with 15% going to Hou and 5% or 25.6% to Lai. In all three cases, I used the comparison with Hou rather than Chu or Gou because Hou is the party’s strongest potential candidate, has a bland personality and has the highest broad appeal with the public, whereas the other two have personalities that polarize public opinion and people may not support them for those reasons rather than party or ideology.I should caution that this demonstrates which other people Ko’s votes would go to and probably does not 100% correlate to political parties, but both Hou and Lai are bland avatars of their parties and do not provoke a lot of animosity, plus Taiwan voters tend to vote along partisan lines more often than that. It is highly suggestive, if not definitive proof, that some support for Ko and perhaps the TPP is coming from pan-green leaning independents and possibly light greens.If those numbers are ballpark correct, it would suggest that the numbers are between one-quarter and one-third. Though it has always been known that Ko has some pan-green support (especially back in 2014 during the Taipei mayoral race), but this suggests it is a bit higher than the general narrative would have it.In the My-Formosa poll, detailed breakdowns of the data are posted allowing for more detailed analysis, and in age demographics there are some numbers that overturn the standard assumptions. Interestingly, though, if you followed the campaigns of TPP-backed independent Vivian Huang (黃珊珊) in the last Taipei mayoral race and TPP candidate Ann Kao (高虹安) in the Hsinchu mayoral race, then you will not actually be surprised.There is a common pattern between those two races and Ko, and that is they are dominantly popular in the 20-29 demographic, strong in the 30-39 demographic, but as age rises their popularity falls off a cliff. Among 20-29 year-olds, Ko dominates with 44.8% support, with Hou in second at 22.8%, and coming in last Lai only got 21.9%.In the 30-39 demographic, Ko also leads with 33.7%, Lai comes in a closer second at 30.7%, and Hou garners 26.8%. Among 40-49 year-olds, Lai pulls ahead with 34.3%, but Ko plunges to last at only 20%.It is only in the 50-59 demographic that Hou leads, with 44.4%, Lai at 28.6% and Ko at 13.6%. Lai dominates the 60-69 and 70+ demographics with well over 40%, Hou is in the mid-30s and Ko gets only 10.3% and a shocking 2.8%, respectively.So much for the common assumption that the youth will support the DPP like in previous elections. That no doubt explains the extensive outreach Lai has been conducting with youth “KOL” (key opinion leaders) recently.There are several possible reasons why the 20-29 age group is so strikingly different than even the 30-39 demographic. One appears to be that they are simply fed up with the two existing main parties, finding them out of touch, divisive, stale, old or some combination of those factors.Clearly, they want something different, which is why they backed Vivian Huang and Ann Kao so strongly, and Ko Wen-je now. Another factor may be that most of them were children during the Sunflower movement, which led to a significant move by young people at the time into the pan-green camp.Having missed that movement, they also missed many of the reasons why younger people at the time became so pan-green. That movement focused people’s minds on Taiwanese identity, Taiwan sovereignty and the threat posed by China.Ko’s talk of “two sides of the Strait are one family” and other moves many consider more pro-China does not appear to be causing alarm bells to ring in the way that it does with older voters.",2023/3/19,1516,Opinion

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840517,Adam Sandler gets Mark Twain prize surrounded by celeb pals,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Adam Sandler placed his hand on the bronze bust of Mark Twain and speculated that it “one day might be the weapon used to bludgeon me in my sleep.""A host of comedic and entertainment royalty gathered at Washington’s Kennedy Center as Sandler was presented with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.Presenters including Drew Barrymore, Conan O’Brien, Chris Rock, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Buscemi, Dana Carvey, and Luis Guzmán gave testimonials to Sandler's creative longevity, while poking occasional fun at his uneven movie output and tendency to cast all his friends in his movies.Sandler's longtime writing and production partner Tim Herlihy joked that the pair were responsible for “31 motion pictures with a combined Rotten Tomatoes score of 59.”Buscemi, known largely for dramatic and often violent roles, portrayed a string of comedic characters in Sandler movies.“He takes his comedy very seriously. I laugh hard at everything I do with him,” he said.Buscemi also singled out Sandler's musical comedy, including “The Chanukah Song,"" which became a multiplatinum hit. “His comedy songs alone deserve this reward,” he said.Judd Apatow, Sandler's roommate during their early days in Los Angeles, recalled a young Sandler's boundless confidence and obvious talent.“The moment you met him, you knew Adam was going to be a big star,” Apatow said. “And so did Adam.”To highlight Sandler's seemingly limitless comedic energy, Apatow played an old video he recorded of a young Sandler prank-calling a local deli in his spare time to try out different comedic voices.At the end of the night, Sandler, who's from Manchester, New Hampshire, paid tribute to his parents and siblings for arming him with “that weird irrational confidence thing that I guess I still have.”Sandler, 56, first came to national attention as a cast member on “Saturday Night Live.” After being fired from the cast following a five-year stint, Sandler launched a wildly successful movie career that has spanned more than 30 films, grossing over $3 billion worldwide.Sandler's top hits include “Happy Gilmore,” “The Wedding Singer” and “You Don't Mess with the Zohan.” Although primarily known for slapstick comedy and overgrown man-child characters, he has excelled in multiple dramatic roles in films such as ""Punch Drunk Love"" and “Uncut Gems.”Guzman, who co-starred in “Punch Drunk Love,” admitted he originally thought Sandler was “out of his depth” in a dramatic role scripted by auteur director Paul Thomas Anderson. But he came away impressed and praised Sandler's “total commitment to something that was so far our of his element.”Other comedians who received the lifetime achievement award include inaugural honoree Richard Pryor in 1998, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chapelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, saw his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault.The comedy institution ""SNL"" has provided more than its share of the 24 Mark Twain recipients. Sandler is the seventh cast member to receive the prize, joining Bill Murray, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, Billy Crystal, Eddie Murphy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Show creator and producer Lorne Michaels won in 2004.The ceremony will be broadcast nationally on CNN on March 26.___This story was first published on March 19, 2023. It was updated on March 20, 2023, to correct the names of two previous recipients of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. They are Will Ferrell, not Will Farrell, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, not Julia Louise-Dreyfus.",2023/3/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840519,Scottish independence at crossroads in testy SNP leader race,"LONDON (AP) — The Scottish National Party is finding Nicola Sturgeon a hard act to follow.Scotland’s governing party is holding an acrimonious contest to replace Sturgeon, a leader who came to dominate Scottish politics, but hit an impasse in her fight for independence from the United Kingdom, and divided the party with a transgender rights law.Sturgeon, 52, announced her resignation in February after eight years as party leader and first minster of Scotland’s semi-autonomous government. Three members of the Scottish parliament are running to replace her: Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, 32; Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, 37; and 49-year-old lawmaker Ash Regan. The winner of a vote by SNP members will be announced on March 27.The campaign has cracked open fissures within the party over political strategy, social issues and Sturgeon’s legacy.Critics say a clique around the former first minister wields too much power in the SNP. Those rivals scored a victory when party chief executive Peter Murrell — Sturgeon’s 58-year-old husband — resigned on Saturday over a kerfuffle about the party’s declining membership.The SNP had publicly denied a newspaper report that its membership had fallen from more than 100,000 to just over 70,000 in the past year, before admitting it was true. Murrell accepted responsibility and quit, saying that “while there was no intent to mislead, I accept that this has been the outcome.”Regan welcomed Murrell’s departure, saying it was “unacceptable to have the husband of the party leader as the CEO.” Forbes said that the party grassroots felt disempowered because “decisions within the SNP have been taken by too few people.”Sturgeon’s resignation has unleashed a battle for the direction of the SNP, which currently holds 64 of the 129 seats in the Scottish parliament and governs in coalition with the much smaller Greens.In bad-tempered television debates, Regan and Forbes have attacked Yousaf — a Sturgeon ally widely regarded as the front-runner — as a continuity candidate in a party that badly needs change.“Right now, we are at a crossroads,” Forbes told the BBC in an interview broadcast Sunday, arguing that the Scottish government needs to do more to bolster an economy weakened by Russia's war in Ukraine, COVID-19 and Brexit. “We need to get serious about what’s worked and what’s not worked.”Forbes' message appeals to some party members, who think that the SNP under Sturgeon spent too much time focusing on divisive social issues rather that the economy and independence. Sturgeon’s departure was hastened by a backlash over legislation she championed to make it easier for people in Scotland to legally change their gender.The gender recognition bill has been hailed as a landmark piece of legislation by transgender rights activists, but faced opposition from some SNP members who said it ignored the need to protect single-sex spaces for women, such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers.Forbes and Regan both oppose the legislation, which has been passed by the Scottish parliament but blocked by the U.K. government. Yousaf supports it, and warns the party could swing to the right if led by Forbes, a socially conservative Christian who is considered his main rival.Forbes, who belongs to the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, has been criticized for saying that her faith would have prevented her from voting in favor of allowing same-sex couples to wed. She wasn't yet a lawmaker when the Scottish Parliament legalized gay marriage in 2014.The leadership contest has sent the SNP’s poll ratings plunging — to the delight of the Labour Party and the Conservatives, which hope to gain seats in Scotland during the next U.K.-wide election, due by the end of 2024.The testy race also reflects frustrations within a party that, after 16 years in power in Edinburgh, has yet to achieve its main ambition: independence.Scottish people voted to remain in the U.K. in a 2014 referendum that was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision. The SNP wants a new vote, but the central government has refused to authorize one, and the U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that Scotland can’t hold one without London’s consent.Regan wants to sweep those obstacles aside by treating the next election in Scotland as a “trigger point” for independence, effectively daring the U.K. government not to recognize Scotland’s democratic choice to secede.Forbes and Yousaf are more cautious. Forbes called for more effort to win over voters who back remaining in the U.K., while Yousaf says he wants to build a “settled, sustained” majority for independence. Polls currently suggest Scottish voters are split about evenly on the issue.Leading Scottish historian Tom Devine said that with independence receding as an immediate prospect, many voters had more urgent concerns — and that poses a risk for the SNP.“The perception is that the mainstream of Scottish public opinion is concerned chiefly with the problems of the (health system), educational standards, transport infrastructure and the wider economy,” he told Scotland’s Herald newspaper. ""Are parts of the electorate now beginning to feel sidelined and concluding that the SNP government has failed to deliver on these vital matters?”",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840527,Montenegro votes in crucial presidential election,"Voters in Montenegro cast ballots on Sunday in a presidential election marred by political turmoil and uncertainty over whether the tiny Balkan NATO member state will go ahead with its bid to join the EU or seek to improve ties with Serbia and Russia.Polling stations opened at 7 am local time (0600 UTC) and will close at 8 pm (1900 UTC). First unofficial results by pollsters, based on a sample of the electorate, are expected about two hours later.Analysts predict that Montenegro's presidential election will produce no clear winner and that incumbent Milo Djukanovic will face one of several challengers in a runoff election two weeks from now.Djukanovic's opponents include a leader of the staunchly pro-Serbia and pro-Russia Popular Front party, Andrija Mandic, economist Jakov Milatovic of the newly-formed Europe Now group and former parliament speaker Aleksa Becic.Observers say Milatovic, who served in the government elected after the 2020 parliamentary vote but later split from the ruling coalition, may stand the best chance of making it into the runoff against Djukanovic.Djukanovic has held top political posts in the country for 33 years. He and and his Democratic Party of Socialists led Montenegro to independence from Serbia in 2006, and defied Russia to join NATO in 2017. However, an alliance dominated by parties seeking closer ties with Serbia and Russia ousted DPS from power in 2020.Sunday's vote comes amid a year-long political crisis marked by no-confidence votes in two separate governments and a row between lawmakers and Djukanovic over the president's refusal to name a new prime minister.On Thursday Djukanovic dissolved the parliament and scheduled snap elections for June 11. A victory in the presidential election would bolster the chances of the winner's party in the parliamentary vote.Over the years, Montenegro has been divided between those who identify as Montenegrins and those who see themselves as Serbs and opposed the country's 2006 independence from a former union with neighbouring and much larger Serbia.Following the invasion of Ukraine last year, Montenegro joined EU sanctions against Russia. The Kremlin has placed Montenegro on its list of unfriendly states.dh/jcg (AP, Reuters)",2023/3/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840528,‘Shazam! Fury of the Gods’ stumbles with $30.5 million debut,"“ Shazam! Fury of the Gods ” felt the fury of the marketplace in its theatrical debut this weekend. The New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. superhero movie opened to a disappointing $30.5 million from 4,071 theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.The “Shazam!” sequel fell short of its modest expectations ($35 million) as well as the first film in the series ($53.5 million in April 2019), and earned a place on the very low end of modern DC comics movie launches, between “Birds of Prey” ($33 million in February 2020) and “The Suicide Squad” ($26.2 million in August 2021), both of which were R-rated.Directed by David F. Sandberg, “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” brought back Zachary Levi, Asher Angel, Jack Dylan Grazer, Adam Brody and Djimon Hounsou, and added Helen Mirren, Rachel Zegler and Lucy Liu. Critics, many of whom found the first film charming, were largely underwhelmed by this outing. It currently holds a 53% Rotten Tomatoes critic score.Audiences were more positive about the sequel, giving it a B+ CinemaScore overall. Younger crowds were even more favorable.“This movie clearly was lighter than we thought it would be,” said Jeff Goldstein, the head of domestic distribution for Warner Bros. “We know there’s a rolling spring break over the next few weeks when kids are available, which is who it's targeted towards. We’re hopeful that we can get a big multiple.”“Shazam! Fury of the Gods” cost a reported $125 million to produce, not factoring in marketing and promotion costs. Internationally, it grossed $35 million from 77 overseas markets including China, bringing its total earnings to $65.5 million.The DC shop at Warner Bros. has been going through a major recalibration for the past several months, with new bosses in James Gunn and Peter Safran forging a path ahead for the DC Universe that will officially kick off with a new “Superman” in 2025. “Shazam! 2” was one of several holdovers of the old regime, which includes “The Flash” coming in June and a new “Aquaman” in December.“Part of our company’s total overhaul of DC with Peter Safran and James Gunn is to reset it for the future,” Goldstein said. “It's all about the future for us.”For Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore, there's a silver lining in that Warner Bros. and DC have “another No. 1 under their belt.”“They’re trying to readjust and realign the brand,” Dergarabedian said. “You don’t change the trajectory for a brand as big as DC without it taking some time. This is a work in progress and this is one step in that journey.”Second place went to “Scream IV” in its second weekend in theaters. The horror pic, distributed by Paramount, fell 61% from its debut and added $17.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $76 million.In its third weekend, “Creed III” grossed an additional $15.4 million to land in the No. 3 spot. The film, directed by and starring Michael B. Jordan has now earned $127.7 million in North America. “65” and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" rounded out the top five with $5.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively.Following its Oscar sweep last Sunday, A24 added over 1,000 screens for an encore “ Everything Everywhere All At Once ” run, where it earned an additional $1.2 million. “The Whale,” for which Brendan Fraser won best actor, played on 509 screens and made $145,230.“What audiences are enjoying right now is a diversity of content,” Dergarabedian said. “Overall, it’s shaping up to be a strong month with ‘ Creed III ’ and ‘ Scream VI ’ getting franchise best debuts. We may see the same with 'John Wick 4'.”Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, with Wednesday through Sunday in parentheses. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods,” $30.5 million. 2. “Scream VI,” $17.5 million. 3. “Creed III,” $15.4 million. 4. “65,” $5.8 million. 5. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” $4.1 million. 6. “Cocaine Bear,” $3.9 million. 7. “Jesus Revolution,” $3.5 million. 8. “Champions,” $3 million. 9. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $1.9 million. 10. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” $1.5 million.___Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840529,Niinistö: Sweden security OK if Finland joins NATO first,"HELSINKI (AP) — Sweden won't be in a vulnerable security situation even if Finland joins NATO first, the Finnish president said Sunday, as both Nordic membership candidates negotiate bilateral military pacts with the United States.""It is possible that Finland joins NATO before Sweden,” Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said in interview published by the Swedish public broadcaster SVT on Sunday. “Should we have refused Turkey’s offer to ratify? That sounds a bit crazy. It would have been a terribly difficult situation if we had said ‘no’ to Ankara.”Niinistö referred to his Friday visit to Ankara where Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that his government would move forward with ratifying Finland’s NATO application, paving the way for the country to join the military bloc, but wouldn't ratify Sweden's bid before disputes between Ankara and Stockholm are solved.Both Finland and Sweden applied to become NATO members 10 months ago in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, abandoning decades of nonalignment.NATO requires the unanimous approval of its 30 existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary are the only countries that haven't yet ratified the Nordic duo’s bids.Should Sweden’s NATO membership talks with Turkey drag on for a long time, many Swedish security policy experts agree it would put Stockholm in a vulnerable military position in the Baltic Sea region.Niinistö said that Finland, Sweden and Denmark are currently in separate talks with the United States on security matters in an attempt to reach a bilateral military pact similar to what Norway has concluded with Washington before.“I think that is a big change, almost bigger than NATO membership,” Niinistö said of the ongoing talks with the U.S. when asked what happens to Sweden's security if talks to join NATO drag on. “It means a lot if we (Nordic countries) all have a direct and a quite similar (military) agreement with the United States.”Since announcing their intention to join NATO in May 2022, Finland and Sweden pledged to enter the Western military alliance jointly at the same time.Niinistö told SVT that the Nordic neighbors were determined to enter NATO “hand in hand as long as it is in our hands, but the ratification of Finnish NATO membership is in the hands of Turkey and Hungary.”",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840530,"Israel, Palestinians aim to curb violence as holiday nears","CAIRO (AP) — Israel and the Palestinians pledged Sunday at a meeting in Egypt to take steps to lower tensions ahead of a sensitive holiday season — including a partial freeze on Israeli settlement activity and an agreement to work together to “curb and counter violence.”But a Palestinian shooting attack that wounded two Israelis in the occupied West Bank underscored the tough work that lies ahead as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan approaches this week.The Israeli and Palestinian delegations met for the second time in less than a month, shepherded by regional allies Egypt and Jordan, as well as the United States, to end a year-long spasm of violence. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and more than 40 Israelis or foreigners have been killed in Palestinian attacks during that time.Following Sunday's summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, a joint communique said the sides had reaffirmed a commitment to de-escalate and prevent further violence.These include pledges to stop unilateral actions, it said. Israel pledged to stop discussion of new settlement construction for four months, and to stop plans to legalize unauthorized settlement outposts for six months.“The two sides agreed to establish a mechanism to curb and counter violence, incitement and inflammatory states and actions,” the communique said. The sides would report on progress at a follow-up meeting in Egypt next month, it added.There were no additional comments from Israel or the Palestinians. The agreement marked a breakthrough, in words at least, but implementing the pledges could be a challenge.A similar meeting in Jordan late last month ended with pledges to de-escalate tensions. But the meeting was quickly derailed when a new burst of violence erupted on the same day. A Palestinian gunman shot and killed two Israelis in the occupied West Bank and Jewish settlers in response rampaged in the Palestinian town of Hawara, destroying property and leading to the death of one Palestinian.As Sunday's talks were going on, a Palestinian gunman opened fire at an Israeli vehicle in Hawara again, seriously wounding an Israeli man, medics said. The man's wife was treated for shock. The Israeli military released a photo of the car showing the windshield riddled with bullet holes.The Israeli military said the wounded man and Israeli troops opened fire and hit the assailant. The man was later arrested, the army said. His condition was not immediately known.Hawara lies on a busy road in the northern part of the West Bank that is used by Israeli residents of nearby Jewish settlements. Many settlers carry guns.The Israeli pledges were largely symbolic. Israel recently approved the construction of thousands of new settlement homes, and there were no immediate plans to approve additional construction. Still, mere talk of slowing settlement activity could risk a backlash in Israel's new coalition government, which is dominated by settler leaders and supporters.Bloodshed has been surging since the meeting in Jordan. Sunday's shooting, along with the killing of an Islamic Jihad militant in neighboring Syria, added to the tensions. The militant group, which is active in the northern West Bank, accused Israel of assassinating the commander. Israel had no comment.In Gaza, the Hamas militant group, which opposes Israel's existence, praised Sunday's shooting as a “natural response” to Israeli military raids and said the meeting in Egypt would not stop it. But it did not claim responsibility for the attack.Mediators want to ease tensions ahead of Ramadan, which start this week and which will coincide next month with the weeklong Jewish holiday of Passover.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no mention of Sunday's summit in his weekly Cabinet meeting. Later, he called the Israeli man who was shot a “wounded hero.”“Anyone trying to harm the citizens of Israel will pay the price,” Netanyahu said.Palestinian official Hussein al-Sheikh tweeted that the meeting in Egypt was meant to “demand an end to this continuous Israeli aggression against us.”The upcoming period is sensitive because large numbers of Jewish and Muslim faithful pour into Jerusalem's Old City, the emotional heart of the conflict and a flashpoint for violence, increasing friction points.Large numbers of Jews are also expected to visit a key Jerusalem holy site, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount — an act the Palestinians view as a provocation.Under longstanding arrangements, Jews are allowed to visit the site but not pray there. But in recent years, the number of visitors has grown, with some quietly praying. Such scenes have raised fears among Palestinians that Israel is trying to alter the status quo.Clashes at the site in 2021 helped trigger an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip.Israeli police said it was wrapping up preparations in Jerusalem to “enable the freedom of worship” for all faiths during Ramadan and Passover “while maintaining security, law and public order.” It said hundreds of police offices were being deployed, with a focus on Jerusalem's Old City.While the latest violence began under the previous Israeli government, it has intensified in the first two months of the new government, headed by Netanyahu and his coalition — the country's most right-wing administration ever.The government is dominated by hard-line settlement supporters. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister who oversees the police, was once relegated to the fringes of Israeli politics, with past convictions for incitement to violence and support of a Jewish terror group. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Hawara to be “erased” after last month's settler rampage, apologizing after an international outcry.The violence is one of the worst rounds between Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in years.Following a spate of Palestinian attacks against Israelis last spring, Israel launched near-nightly raids in the West Bank against what it says are militant networks. But the raids have not slowed the violence.So far this year, 85 Palestinians have been killed, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Fourteen people in Israel, all but one of them civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks.Israel says most of those killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions and people not involved in the confrontations have also been killed.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for their future independent state.___Federman reported from Jerusalem.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840544,Kazakhs vote in newly competitive parliamentary election,"ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) — Voters in Kazakhstan on Sunday went to the polls to choose lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, which is being reconfigured in the wake of deadly unrest that gripped the resource-rich Central Asian nation a year ago.Although the electoral field was unusually large with two newly registered parties and hundreds of individual candidates joining the race, turnout appeared relatively unenthusiastic — about 54% of eligible voter cast ballots, according the national elections commission.The early election came on the fourth anniversary of the resignation of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had led Kazakhstan since independence following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and who had established immense influence.His successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, was widely expected to continue Nazarbayev’s authoritarian course and even renamed the capital as Nur-Sultan in his predecessor’s honor.But the country’s political landscape changed markedly after a wave of violence in January 2022, when provincial protests initially sparked by a fuel price hike engulfed other cities, notably the commercial capital, Almaty, and became overtly political as demonstrators shouted “Old man out!” in reference to the now 82-year-old Nazarbayev.More than 220 people, mostly protesters, died as police harshly put down the unrest. Amid the violence, Tokayev removed Nazarbayev from his powerful post as head of the national security council. He restored the capital’s previous name of Astana, and the parliament repealed a law granting Nazarbayev and his family immunity from prosecution.Tokayev also initiated reforms to strengthen the parliament, reduce presidential powers and limit the presidency to a single seven-year term. Under the reforms, a third of the lower house of parliament’s 98 seats will be chosen in single-mandate races rather than by party list.The ruling Amanat party holds the overwhelming majority of seats in the current parliament and the rest belongs to parties that are largely loyal to Amanat.Although opinion surveys indicate that Amanat will remain the largest party in the new parliament, the likely final balance is unclear. More than 400 candidates, most of them self-nominated, competed in the single-mandate races, and the national elections commission authorized two additional parties to enter the proportional contest.“We can only hope that these elections will contribute to the further consolidation of society, of democracy, and that the idea of a new and fair Kazakhstan will develop with the population really participating in this,” Austrian Martin Sajdik, a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's elections observation mission, said Sunday.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840545,New law allows anti-abortion monument at Arkansas Capitol,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has signed a new law that will allow a monument near the state Capitol marking the number of abortions performed in Arkansas before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.Sanders' office said Friday night that the Republican governor signed the bill that will allow the creation of a privately funded “monument to the unborn” on the Capitol grounds. The bill, approved by lawmakers last week, requires the secretary of state to permit and arrange the placement of the monument.It also requires the Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission to oversee the selection of the artist and the design of the monument, with input from anti-abortion groups.A law Arkansas approved in 2019 banning nearly all abortions took effect last year when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 1973 Roe decision. Arkansas’ ban only allows abortions to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency.Tennessee lawmakers approved legislation in 2018 allowing a similar privately funded monument on its Capitol grounds. The monument has not yet been installed.Arkansas' proposal faced opposition from some anti-abortion Republicans who said it was counterproductive, and Democrats who said the monument proposal was divisive.Other monuments on the state Capitol grounds include a sculpture of the nine Black students who integrated Little Rock Central High School. A Ten Commandments monument was installed on the Capitol grounds in 2018.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840546,Osimhen and Kvaratskhelia carrying Napoli to new heights,"ROME (AP) — Victor Osimhen combines the characteristics of a classic No. 9 with the talents of a modern striker.Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s dribbling wizardry and passing abilities befuddle defenders in Italy and beyond.Individually, Osimhen and Kvaratskhelia are devastating enough. Together, they are leading Napoli to new heights game after game.The latest demonstration came when Osimhen scored a brace of headers and Kvaratskhelia earned and converted a penalty and set up two goals in Napoli’s 4-0 win at Torino in Serie A on Sunday.The victory left the runaway leader 19 points ahead of second-place Lazio, which beat Roma 1-0 in a derby, and a step closer to Napoli’s first Serie A title since Diego Maradona led the club to its only two Italian league championships back in 1987 and 1990.“Once again when I talked to the team before the game I had the feeling that there could be a sense of fulfillment, and once again they responded by showing that they’re made of different stuff, that they know how to handle the Napoli shirt,"" coach Luciano Spalletti said. ""There’s a Neopolitan saying that goes, ‘Whoever is hungry doesn’t feel sleepy,’ and that fits perfectly.”Osimhen started it off midway through the first half when he leaped above the defense to redirect in a corner with a towering header.After a couple of key saves from Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret — who is also quietly having a standout season — Kvaratskhelia doubled the advantage with a penalty.But that was just the warmup.The main act was Napoli’s third goal, a full team move with Kvaratskhelia providing a backheel flick to Mathias Olivera, who floated in a cross for Osimhen to head in at the far post.“Napoli isn’t just (Osimhen and Kvaratskhelia). You’ve got to expand the discussion to the entire squad,” Spalletti said. “The third goal wasn’t just about Kvaratskhelia’s backheel pass, Olivera’s cross and Osimhen’s header. Before that (Napoli captain Giovanni) Di Lorenzo cut inside to create the conditions for the play to develop on the other side.”Osimhen became the first player to score two headed braces in the same Serie A season since former Italy striker Alberto Gilardino accomplished the feat in 2009-10 with Fiorentina.Osimhen has a league-best 21 goals in 27 matches, while Kvaratskhelia has 12 goals and 10 assists — the first player with such production in their first season in Europe’s big five leagues since Diego scored 13 and provided 13 assists for Werder Bremen 16 years ago.Kvaratskhelia also set up Tanguy Ndombole’s first Serie A goal midway through the second half.Osimhen also scored twice when Napoli beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 on Wednesday to secure a 5-0 aggregate victory and reach the Champions League quarterfinals.JUVENTUS WINS AT INTERInter Milan dropped to third place following a 1-0 loss at home to Juventus, which is approaching the European spots despite a 15-point penalty for false accounting.Filip Kostic scored with a long, angled shot to finish off a counterattack early on at the San Siro.ROME DERBYMattia Zaccagni scored for Lazio midway through the second half with a precise shot after Roma was reduced to 10 men in the first half when Roger Ibanez picked up his second yellow card for a foul on Sergej Milinkovic-Savic.Roma thought it had equalized two minutes after Zaccagni’s goal following a free kick but the score was waved off by the VAR for offside.Before kickoff, fans clashed with police outside the Stadio Olimpico.Having also beaten Roma 1-0 in November, it marked the first time that Lazio won both season league derbies in 11 years.Also, Fiorentina moved into the top half of the table by beating Lecce 1-0 with an own-goal from Antonino Gallo and Sampdoria defeated Hellas Verona 3-1 with a brace from Manolo Gabbiadini in a matchup of two teams in the drop zone.___Andrew Dampf is at https://twitter.com/AndrewDampf ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

The player was to have his hand looked at by team doctors Sunday.“It appears it could be a while,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said Sunday morning after Altuve returned to camp in West Palm Beach, Florida, according to a Houston Chronicle report.It's the second major injury in the World Baseball Classic, coming three days after New York Mets All-Star closer Edwin Díaz sustained a season-ending knee injury during the postgame celebration of Puerto Rico’s 5-2 win over the Dominican Republic.Altuve left Saturday's game against the United States in the fifth inning after being hit on the right hand by a Daniel Bard fastball. The Americans won 9-7 to reach the tournament’s semifinals. Altuve did not answer questions from media after Saturday’s game, saying only in Spanish: “All is good.”Altuve is an eight-time All-Star, three-time batting champion and 2017 AL MVP.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840548,Cowboys acquire WR Cooks from Texans for 2 late-round picks,"FRISCO, Texas (AP) — The Dallas Cowboys acquired receiver Brandin Cooks in a trade with the Houston Texans on Sunday, adding a speedy veteran to play alongside CeeDee Lamb.Houston gets a fifth-round pick this year and a 2024 sixth-rounder in a deal reminiscent of a year ago when Dallas sent No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper to Cleveland for two late-round picks.The difference in the trades is the Texans will pay $6 million of Cooks' $18 million salary. The Browns absorbed the entire $20 million owed to Cooper.It's the fifth time Cooks has been traded, including a swap the day after he was taken 20th overall by Arizona in 2014. New Orleans acquired him for the 27th overall pick and a third-rounder that year.Cooks later went to New England, the Los Angeles Rams and the Texans in trades.The 29-year-old Cooks has six 1,000-yard seasons in nine years, with career highs of 1,204 yards with the Rams in 2018 and nine touchdowns with the Saints in 2015. He has 8,616 yards and 49 TDs.The Cowboys waited until late in the 2022 season to put a speedy veteran alongside Lamb when they signed free agent T.Y. Hilton. Dallas is coming off consecutive 12-5 playoff seasons.Lamb, who turns 24 next month, had career highs of 1,359 yards and nine touchdowns last season. The 2020 first-round pick had 10 100-yard games in his first three seasons, second in club history to Pro Football Hall of Famer Bob Hayes, who had 13.Besides Lamb and Cooks, the Cowboys are hoping for a bounce-back season from Michael Gallup now that he's more than a year removed from an ACL injury.The 27-year-old Gallup sustained the injury in the 16th game of 2021 and missed the first three games last season before finishing with 39 catches for a career-low 424 yards.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840550,UK aims to send migrants to Rwanda in months if courts agree,"KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Britain’s government said Sunday that it could start deporting asylum-seekers to Rwanda in the next few months — but only if U.K. courts rule that the controversial policy is legal.The Home Office said it was aiming to start flights “before the summer,” as Home Secretary Suella Braverman visited the east African country to reinforce the Conservative government’s commitment to the plan.In the Rwandan capital, Kigali, she met with President Paul Kagame and Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta, visited accommodation intended to house deportees from the U.K. and laid a brick at another housing development for migrants. The project is expected to build more than 1,000 houses.""I have thoroughly enjoyed seeing firsthand the rich opportunities this country can provide to relocated people through our partnership,” Braverman said.Biruta said Rwanda would offer migrants “the opportunity to build new lives in a safe, secure place through accommodation, education and vocational training.”Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo told reporters the country is ready to receive thousands of migrants from the U.K., saying she doesn’t consider living in Rwanda “a punishment.” She said Rwanda is determined to make the agreement a success.The U.K. and Rwanda struck a deal almost a year ago under which some migrants who arrive in the U.K. in small boats would be flown to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be processed. Those granted asylum would stay in Rwanda rather than return to Britain.The U.K. government argues the policy will smash the business model of people-smuggling gangs and deter migrants from taking risky journeys across the English Channel.More than 45,000 people arrived in Britain by boat in 2022, compared with 8,500 in 2020.But the 140 million-pound ($170 million) plan is mired in legal challenges, and no one has yet been sent to Rwanda. In December, the High Court ruled the policy was legal, but a group of asylum-seekers from countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria has been granted permission to appeal.Human rights groups cite Rwanda’s poor human rights record, and argue it's inhumane to send people more than 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) to a country they don’t want to live in.The government also has drafted legislation barring anyone who arrives in the U.K. in small boats or by other unauthorized means from applying for asylum. If passed by Parliament, the Illegal Migration Bill would compel the government to detain all such arrivals and deport them to their homeland or a ""safe third country” such as Rwanda.The U.N. refugee agency says the law breaches U.K. commitments under the international refugee convention.Braverman faces criticism for inviting only selected media on her taxpayer-funded trip to Rwanda. Journalists from right-leaning outlets including The Times and The Telegraph newspapers and television channel GB News were invited, while the BBC and the left-leaning Guardian newspaper weren’t. ___Follow AP’s coverage of global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration___Jill Lawless reported from London.",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840552,No diving: Leverkusen beats Bayern 2-1 to leave Dortmund top,"BERLIN (AP) — Amine Adli was twice booked for diving, twice excused, and Bayer Leverkusen scored twice from the resulting penalties to upset Bayern Munich 2-1.Bayern's third defeat of the season left Borussia Dortmund top of the Bundesliga on Sunday.Referee Tobias Stieler had VAR to thank — twice — after getting it wrong initially both times. He apologized to Adli on each occasion after consulting replays which showed the French player had, in fact, been fouled first by Benjamin Pavard, then Dayot Upamecano.“It was the perfect example today of great collaboration with the video assistant,"" Stieler said. ""He gets a lot of complaints and is always very harshly criticized. Today it was a lifesaver for the game.”Exequiel Palacios scored both penalties to end Bayern’s four-game winning run across all competitions and leave Dortmund one point clear with nine rounds remaining.“It was a very important game for us. We knew that before the game but were unable to show it on the field over the 90 minutes, and we'll need to ask ourselves why,” Bayern forward Thomas Müller said.Bayern next hosts Dortmund on April 1.“Now we want to get through the international break without any injuries,” Müller said. ”And then of course straight afterward we have a real cracker against Dortmund in our home stadium. We imagined ourselves in a different position going into it.""Bayern had to rely on goalkeeper Yann Sommer to deny Kerem Demirbay, then Alphonso Davies to clear from the lurking Jeremie Frimpong in the early stages.Joshua Kimmich scored with Bayern’s first attack in the 22nd. A deflection took the ball past the helpless Lukáš Hrádecký in the Leverkusen goal.Pavard then conceded the first penalty. Stieler initially booked Adli for diving, then changed his mind after seeing replays showing how Pavard caught his compatriot’s boot with his studs. Adli actually lost his boot and flung it to the ground in frustration after being booked. But Stieler subsequently withdrew the yellow card.Palacios made no mistake from the spot to equalize in the 55th.The same situation repeated after Stieler again booked Adli for diving in the 70th. Again Palacios scored.“In the end both teams were happy because the right decision was made and that’s what counts,” Stieler said.The win was Xabi Alonso's first as Leverkusen coach over his former club.“I'm very happy, satisfied and proud,” said the Spanish coach who referred to Leverkusen's busy schedule after its 2-0 win over Ferencvaros in the Europa League on Thursday.UNION AGAIN IMPRESSESFormer Germany midfielder Sami Khedira watched as his brother Rani Khedira led Union Berlin to third place with a 2-0 win over visiting Eintracht Frankfurt.Rani Khedira was captain in place of the absent Christopher Trimmel and he broke the deadlock in the 53rd minute with the final say in a goalmouth scramble after a corner. His older brother, who last played for city rival Hertha Berlin before retiring in 2021, held up his mobile phone amid the celebrations.Union forward Sheraldo Becker had a fine strike ruled out for offside before substitute Kevin Behrens sealed the win after a long kick from Union goalkeeper Frederik Rönnow in the 75th. Behrens shot through the legs of Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp for his fifth Bundesliga goal of the season.It stretched Union’s unbeaten run at home in the league to 18 games including last season and lifted the team two points clear of Freiburg, held 1-1 by Mainz in Sunday's late game.ONISIWO'S LATE STRIKEKarim Onisiwo scored in the sixth minute of injury time to salvage a point for Mainz against Freiburg, which looked to be heading for a win thanks to the quick-thinking Ritsu Doan, who capitalized on a defensive mix-up to score in the 55th.Onisiwo came on as a substitute five minutes later and had the final say when Ludovic Ajorque set him up to equalize from close range.It stretched both sides' unbeaten league runs to six games.Freiburg moved fourth, a point ahead of Leipzig, which lost to Bochum on Saturday.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840553,UBS agrees to buy Credit Suisse for over $2 billion — report,"Switzerland's largest bank, UBS, has agreed to pay over $2 billion for Credit Suisse in a deal struck on Sunday, according to business publication The Financial Times. The paper cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter.Government and banking officials had been locked in urgent talks to rescue the embattled lender, which was given a $54 billion (€50 billion) lifeline by the country's central bank this week.Switzerland's government had announced that a press conference would take place on Sunday evening at the Bundeshaus in Bern, but did not say when.Earlier there were reports that UBS had offered to buy the bank for up to $1 billion, but Credit Suisse had reportedly pushed back against the offer.Swiss media and Reuters news agency also reported that UBS was also seeking $6 billion in guarantees from the Swiss government as part of a possible purchase of its rival, citing a person with knowledge of the talks. The guarantees would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges.The Financial Times said UBS would pay 0.50 Swiss francs (around $0.54 or €0.50) per Credit Suisse share, well below the closing price of 1.86 francs on Friday. That would make the bank's value by market capitalization around $7 billion, while as recently as a year ago Credit Suisse was valued at roughly $25 billion by shareholders.The publication reported that Swiss authorities were planning to change laws so a shareholder vote for the transaction could be bypassed, with investors highly unlikely to be satisfied with the compensation.The aim for such a move would be to guarantee the transaction would be completed before markets open on Monday, at which point the stock could in theory renew its freefall.kb/msh (Reuters, AFP)",2023/3/19,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840568,UBS to buy Credit Suisse for nearly $3.25B to calm turmoil,"GENEVA (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,"" said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. ""An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”Switzerland's executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020.“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,"" said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council ""regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank's size in the coming months and years.The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.___Associated Press Writers Frank Jordans and Emily Schultheis in Berlin, Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Chris Rugaber in Washington, Ken Sweet in New York and David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840569,Man United into FA Cup semifinals; Arsenal extends EPL lead,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — It was all set up for a famous FA Cup upset as Fulham led treble-chasing Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.But in the space of seven chaotic second-half minutes, the visitors were reduced to nine players, had their manager sent off and conceded twice.It was a meltdown of epic proportions and United capitalized on it in ruthless fashion to advance to the semifinals with a 3-1 win that keeps its three-pronged trophy pursuit on track.There is also the prospect of a mouthwatering FA Cup final against Manchester City after the rivals were kept apart in the draw for the last four.Thoughts of an all-Manchester showdown at Wembley on June 3, however, looked in serious doubt after Aleksandar Mitrovic fired Fulham ahead in the 50th minute of the quarterfinal match.That was before the game was turned upside down as Fulham’s players and manager Marco Silva lost control.Emotions boiled over after Willian blocked Jadon Sancho’s goal-bound shot in the 70th and VAR instructed referee Chris Kavanagh to review the incident on the touchline monitor.Before the official could even make a decision, he had shown a red card to Silva for remonstrating furiously in the dugout.Replays showed Willian had clearly used his hand and was sent off as a result. That sparked outrage from Mitrovic, who angrily approached Kavanagh and was also shown red.All three dismissals came over a period of 40 seconds.“Even if I haven’t done something special, I have to control myself,” Silva said afterward. “I didn’t say anything special to the ref, he didn’t listen and showed me the red card. It is a moment to control my emotions. The game was decided in the moment.”All that was left was for Bruno Fernandes to dispatch his penalty and even the score in the 75th.Two minutes later Marcel Sabitzer put United in front and nine-man Fulham was on its way out.Fernandes scored a second to make it 3-1 in the sixth minute of stoppage time and set up a Wembley semifinal game against Brighton.Manager Erik ten Hag has already led United to victory in the League Cup this season and his team is also into the quarterfinals of the Europa League where it faces Sevilla.“One thing is important — don’t think too far ahead,” Ten Hag said. “Go from game to game.“We see the progress in the team, but this team has a strong character, strong belief, strong determination to win games. Today was an example of it. When you have difficult period in a game, stay in the game and turn the game.”MITROVIC FACES BANMitrovic will receive at least an automatic three-game ban for his sending off, which had echoes of an infamous incident involving Paulo di Canio from 1998.The then Sheffield Wednesday striker was banned for 11 games after shoving referee Paul Alcock to the ground during a match.“I saw the image and I spoke with Mitro, it is a moment for him to control the emotions,” Silva said. “He pushed the referee, but I did not see that in so bad, bad way like you are saying to me. But I hope the people who are going to decide (do so) with fairness.”ARSENAL MARCHES ONKnocked out of Europe on Thursday, Arsenal’s sights are now solely fixed on winning the Premier League title for the first time in 19 years.And that elusive prize edged closer as a 4-1 win against Crystal Palace moved Mikel Arteta’s team eight points clear at the top of the table.There was no sign of a hangover after the penalty shootout loss to Sporting Lisbon in the Europa League as Arsenal underlined its title credentials.Gabriel Martinelli, who missed the decisive spot kick in that match, quickly put that disappointment behind him by opening the scoring against Palace.“There is always the question,” Arsenal manager Arteta said. “But I asked him yesterday how he was and he said: ‘I want to be in the team.’“We were really determined and focused and left Thursday in the past.""Arsenal still has to play second-place Manchester City and Liverpool before the end of the season. But the London club is in impressive form having won six in a row in the league.Bukayo Saka provided the pass for Martinelli and became the first player in the league to reach double figures for goals and assists this season. He then went on to score two more himself.Granit Xhaka got Arsenal’s other goal, while Jeffrey Schlupp scored for Palace, who fired manager Patrick Vieira this week.DOYLE RULED OUTManchester City prospect Tommy Doyle fired Sheffield United into the FA Cup semifinals and then learned he will have to miss out on the biggest game of his young career.The 21-year-old midfielder is on loan at Sheffield and due to competition rules is ineligible to play against his parent club after the Blades were drawn against Man City in the next round.It means Doyle will be a spectator for the match at Wembley, when Premier League champions City will be favorites to advance to the final.Doyle struck in the first minute of second-half stoppage time as Sheffield beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 in a thrilling quarterfinal clash between the two second-tier sides.Blackburn had twice taken the lead through Ben Brereton and Sammie Szmodics.Sam Gallagher's own-goal and Oliver McBurnie evened the score on each occasion before Doyle's late winner.But he barely had time to enjoy his celebrations before learning Sheffield had been drawn against City.FAIRY TALE ENDSGrimsby's FA Cup fairy tale is over after the fourth-tier team was routed 5-0 by Premier League Brighton.Grimsby was the lowest-ranked team left in the competition and had reached the quarters for the first time since 1939, having knocked out top-flight Southampton in the last round.But there was no danger of another upset against Brighton, which scored four goals in the second half at Amex Stadium.Deniz Undav fired the home side in front after just six minutes. Evan Ferguson scored twice after the break, with Solly March and Kaoru Mitoma completing the rout.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840570,"California to seek beds for mental health, drug treatment","SAN DIEGO (AP) — California voters would decide whether to fund a major expansion of housing and treatment for residents suffering from mental illness and addiction, under the latest proposal by Gov. Gavin Newsom to address the state's homelessness crisis.Newsom announced Sunday that he will ask allies in the Democratic-controlled Legislature for a measure on the 2024 ballot to authorize funding to build residential facilities where up to 12,000 people a year could live and be treated. The plan is the latest by the governor who took office in 2019 vowing to own the issue of homelessness in a state where an estimated 171,000 were unhoused last year.The governor called the plan the next step in how California expands services for unhoused people, especially those with psychological and substance use disorders.“We have to address and come to grips with the reality of mental health in this state and our nation. The question is, what can we do more and do better?” Newsom said at a news conference.California, home to nearly 40 million people, has nearly one-third of the nation’s homeless population, and their numbers are growing much faster than in other states, according to an analysis of federal data by the Public Policy Institute of California. Tent encampments have popped up on sidewalks and under freeway overpasses, and people in clear mental health crisis are a common sight on city streets.The initiative would be partially funded by general obligation bonds that would raise between $3 billion and $5 billion to go toward construction of “campus-style” facilities along with smaller homes and long-term residential settings, Newsom said.In addition, it would overhaul California's Mental Health Services Act, an initiative approved by voters in 2004 that charges a 1% tax on incomes greater than $1 million to fund mental health services. Some lawmakers complained that money from the initiative bypassed those who needed it the most, and Newsom's office said the new version would improve oversight for counties.""Modernizing it will lead to $1 billion every year for housing, treating substance abuse disorders, and more,"" said a statement from the governor's office.The California State Association of Counties, representing all 58 counties in California, said in a statement Sunday that it would work with the governor and lawmakers to establish “clear responsibilities, accountability and funding for all levels of government” to address the homelessness problem.State Sen. Susan Talamantes Eggman, D-Stockton, will introduce the measure, which would also earmark money to house more than 10,000 homeless veterans across the state, according to the statement.Newsom unveiled details of the plan during a stop Sunday afternoon in San Diego. The governor is in the midst of a five-day statewide tour that he's using to highlight his major policy goals. The tour replaced a traditional State of the State address.On Thursday, Newsom announced a plan to spend about $30 million to build 1,200 small homes across the state to help house people living on the streets. The homes can be assembled quickly and cost a fraction of what it takes to build permanent housing. Federal courts have ruled cities can’t clear homeless encampments if there are no shelter beds available.Newsom will travel Monday to Imperial County to discuss how California is poised to become a global leader in electric vehicles and clean energy, his office said.The governor's swing through California comes amid challenging times for the state. After several flush years in Sacramento, California has an estimated $22.5 billion deficit, with state revenues falling as the stock market slows.Recent polling shows half of California voters believe the heavily Democratic state is headed in the wrong direction, including a majority of independents. And after years of growth, the state’s population has been dropping as people look elsewhere for more affordable homes and a better quality of life.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840571,Search on for Florida boaters missing in lake near Legoland,"WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) — Authorities searched Sunday for two boaters who were missing and believed drowned in an accident on a central Florida lake near the Legoland theme park.Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference that the two men had jumped into Lake Eloise to save a third person from their group, a woman, who was struggling in the water. The men became separated from the boat and have not been seen since Saturday evening.The third person, 38-year-old Velcky Velazques, was rescued by sheriff's deputies who had been summoned when a 10-year-old girl on the boat dialed 911 on a cellphone. That child and an 8-year-old girl remained on the boat as it drifted and were rescued safely by the deputies, who had commandeered a fishing boat whose owner cooperated in the effort, Judd said.The lake, adjacent to Legoland in Winter Haven, was rough on Saturday with 20 mph (32 kph) winds and some whitecaps, Judd said. He added that the weather issues were compounded by inexperience on the part of the boaters, who had rented the vessel for an outing that day.The problems began when the Velazques jumped into the water with an anchor, the sheriff said.“She's just very inexperienced, so she thinks you're supposed to get into the water, put the anchor in and then tie it to the boat,” Judd said.The missing men were identified as Orlando Ortiz, 32, who is Velazques's boyfriend, and Jeffrey Marrero, 34, who is the father of the two girls. Judd said the search will continue using sonar and underwater drones until they are found.“We don't allow anyone's loved one to stay in the lake. We will find them,” Judd said.Winter Haven is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Tampa.Legoland put out a statement Saturday saying the incident “is not connected with us in any way.” It added that a boardwalk at its hotel was being used by officials as a command center.“Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this difficult time,” the statement said.",2023/3/20,,World

Mitrovic was shown another red card for his reaction which saw the outraged player angrily approach the referee.Mitrovic will receive at least an automatic three-game ban for his sending off.Bruno Fernandes scored from the spot in the 75th minute and Marcel Sabitzer put United 2-1 ahead in the 77th against nine-man Fulham.Fernandes scored a second in stoppage time to make it 3-1 to United.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

(AP) — Sean Miller has unselfish Xavier back in the Sweet 16.Jack Nunge scored 18 points, Adam Kunkel added 15 on five first-half 3-pointers, and No. 3 seed Xavier beat 11th-seeded Pittsburgh 84-73 on Sunday to advance to the NCAA Tournament's second week for the first time since 2017.Colby Jones had 10 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists, and Souley Boum and Jerome Hunter each chipped in with 14 points as all five Xavier starters scored in double digits.Xavier entered the game leading the country in assists per game (19.2) and had 17 on 19 baskets in the first half to build a 48-34 lead at the break. The Musketeers finished with 22 assists.The victory came exactly one year after Miller agreed to return as Xavier's coach.He had coached the Musketeers from 2004-09, helping them reach the Sweet 16 twice and the Elite Eight once before leaving for Arizona. This will be Miller's first regional semifinal appearance since 2018 with the Wildcats.Miller said he never doubted he could still win, but gave the credit to his players.“I have an amazing group to work with,” Miller said. “There’s a lot of coaches that could win with this team, and I recognize that. My hope is that we have more in us, that we’re able to have a great week and make what we already feel good about even better.”Xavier (27-9) moves on to play No. 2 seed Texas on Friday in the Midwest Region semifinals in Kansas City, Missouri.Blake Hinson scored 18 points and Jamarius Burton had 16 for Pitt (24-12).It was the second straight game Nunge came up big for Xavier. The 7-foot center had a critical blocked shot in the closing seconds of the Musketeers' 72-67 first-round win over 14th-seeded Kennesaw State.“I’ve been dreaming about this moment ever since I started watching basketball,” Nunge said. “When you are in school, you are thrilled when your teachers let you turn on the game and not have to focus on class. And so March Madness is a special time of year. It’s the best tournament in the world.”Nunge set the tone early, dominating the paint with eight points in the first 10 minutes while Jones knocked down two 3s as the Musketeers bolted to a 28-18 lead.The Musketeers blew the game open with a 12-2 run behind Kunkel, who made two 3s and threw an alley-oop dunk to Nunge. Kunkel followed with his fifth 3 of the first half to give Xavier a 19-point lead with 1:26 left.“We really rode the wave of Adam Kunkel,” Miller said. “He was 5 for 5 from the 3-point line. We really shared the ball and played at our pace throughout the game. We talked a lot about that before the game.”Pitt did not get closer than eight points in the second half even after Nunge fouled out with 3:18 remaining.After holding No. 6 seed Iowa State to 41 points on Friday, Pitt allowed Xavier to score 42 in the first 15 minutes.“Iowa State was not as good of an offensive team as Xavier,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “Xavier has been an elite offensive team all year. They were moving with great pace. They made seven 3s in the first half. The ball had energy. ... We couldn’t disrupt their rhythm.”FEDERIKO OUTIt didn’t help Pitt's cause that big man Federiko Federiko played less than a minute because of a knee problem that also kept him out of the Panthers' First Four win over Mississippi State. Capel said he noticed Federiko running with a limp and immediately removed him so he wouldn’t risk further injury. Federiko spent the rest of the game on a stationary bike, often grimacing in pain.BIG PICTUREPitt: The Panthers won their first two NCAA Tournament games since 2014 before bowing out. “It sucks right now,” Pitt guard Nelly Cummings said. “It stings we just lost, but when you have a little bit of time to reflect, we accomplished a lot of things, so I think the bond that we have is definitely a reason for that.”Xavier: After needing to come back from 13 down in the second half to beat Kennesaw State, the Musketeers left no doubt about this one, coming out focused and ready to play.UP NEXTXavier will face a Longhorns team that has won six straight games.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840574,Perez holds off Verstappen's charge to win Saudi Arabian GP,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Sergio Perez won the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and Max Verstappen drove from 15th to second to give Red Bull a 1-2 finish Sunday in what is shaping up to be a runaway season for the reigning Formula One champions.And there have only been two races so far.“Nice job guys an excellent result for the team,” said Perez, who finished about 5 seconds ahead of Verstappen.Through the first two races of the season it has been two Red Bull wins, two 1-2 finishes, and an air of desperation from everyone else on the grid.Verstappen is chasing a third straight title and isn’t worried if it goes down to a straight fight between him and Perez.“The best one will finish in front,” the Dutchman said.Perez feels he's yet to peak.“I’m not sure it’s my best weekend with the team, Melbourne will be even better,” he said, looking ahead to the next race in Australia on April 2.Fernando Alonso finished third for the second consecutive race for his 100th career podium. He celebrated with the Red Bull drivers, but he was later handed a 10-second penalty for what the FIA said was incorrectly serving an earlier penalty and that dropped him to fourth.The podium finish was then handed to George Russell of Mercedes, who called the penalty on Alonso “harsh.” But Aston Martin appealed and hours after the race conclusion the penalty was reversed and Alonso's 100th career podium was reinstated.""Having reviewed the new evidence, we concluded that there was no clear agreement, as was suggested to the Stewards previously, that could be relied upon,"" the FIA said. “In the circumstances, we considered that our original decision to impose a penalty on Car 14 needed to be reversed and we did so accordingly.”But even as the Spaniard enjoys a renaissance with his new Aston Martin team, Alonso has acknowledged he had little chance at beating Red Bull.Verstappen won a record 15 races last season and a second consecutive F1 title, and Perez added another two victories as the 17 total wins in 23 races easily gave Red Bull the constructors title. There have been no signs of an offseason drop in performance and Russell, who did the post-race news conference as the third-place finisher but was then dropped to fourth after Alonso's penalty was reversed, predicted after the season-opener that Red Bull would win every race this season.Lewis Hamilton finished fifth as Mercedes went fourth and fifth just three days after the seven-time F1 champion said the team needed three other organizations not to finish a race for Mercedes to have a shot to win.“We are not where we want to be but we will get there,” Hamilton told his team.The show on Sunday was Verstappen, who overcame a mechanical problem in qualifying that forced him to start 15th and quickly worked his way up the grid. The Dutchman set the fastest lap of the race on the final lap to retain his hold atop the F1 points standings.“Great recovery, Max, that was a really good drive at the end,” Red Bull boss Christian Horner radioed Verstappen.Verstappen felt the late push was worth the risk.“I gave it a go at the end and luckily it worked out,"" he said.Red Bull has now finished 1-2 in three consecutive races dating to last year’s finale.It was the fifth career win for Perez, who started from the pole for the second consecutive year at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit. He was briefly leading the championship standings until Verstappen slipped ahead by logging the fastest lap.“Let’s keep it up, let’s keep pushing,” said the Mexican.Perez started on pole with Alonso on the front row alongside him and Alonso jumped out to a quick lead, but was promptly penalized for being in the improper starting position. He thought he served the five-second penalty, but the race stewards docked him another 10 seconds post podium celebration.Russell said “common sense needs to be applied,” and Alonso was annoyed with governing body FIA.“I think it's more of a FIA poor show today more than disappointment for ourselves,"" Alonso told broadcaster Sky as he awaited results of the Aston Martin appeal. “You can’t apply the penalty 35 laps after the pit stop. They had enough time to inform us.”Perez soon regained the lead while Verstappen and Charles Leclerc — starting from 12th because of a 10-place grid penalty — chewed up the cars ahead of them.When both Ferrari's pitted for new tires, Verstappen was in fourth.The 6.2-kilometer (3.8-mile) circuit beside the Red Sea is the quickest street track in F1 with average speeds exceeding 250 kmh (160 mph), which suited Verstappen. It took him only a few seconds to pass Russell and Alonso didn't last long, either, making it a Red Bull shootout.Perez held firm.Ferrari had another race to forget, with Carlos Sainz Jr. placing sixth ahead of Charles Leclerc in seventh. At least Leclerc finished, after retiring in Bahrain, but he wasn’t happy.“Being behind like this is really (expletive), I don’t know what to do,” Leclerc said as he trundled behind traffic.Frenchmen Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly were eighth and ninth for Alpine with Haas driver Kevin Magnussen in 10th.Alonso’s teammate Lance Stroll retired on Lap 18, leading to a safety car restart that suited Verstappen.Alex Albon retired his Williams and his teammate Logan Sargeant, the rookie American driver, started last and finished 16th. McLaren struggled again with Oscar Piastri 15th and Lando Norris down in 17th.“Tough race after an unlucky start with damage to both cars on the opening lap. Made it too difficult to turn things around. But we tried hard,"" McLaren boss Zak Brown tweeted. “Time to get our season back on track in Australia.”___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

His only previous time in a U.S. ballpark had been in the same stadium, to record a commercial for Amazon.“He is one of the pitchers that Japan is proud of,” Japan manager Hideki Kuriyama said through a translator. “This year and then next year is going to be a very critical year for him.”Given the success of Shohei Ohtani, Sasaki is likely to be coveted by U.S. teams if and when he is posted by Chiba. Ohtani signed with the Los Angeles Angels at age 23 ahead of the 2018 season and emerged as one of MLB’s greatest talents.“I think something will become clear when I’m going to shift over,” Sasaki said through a translator.He's also spoken with Ohtani about the transition to MLB, about “what team or what type of environment in the major leagues can provide.”Sasaski arrived with the Japanese team at 4:30 a.m. EDT Friday after a 7,469-mile charter flight and is adjusting to a 13-hour time difference.“I think I slept well on the plane, so I just don’t feel much jet lag on this trip,” he said.Selected first in Japan's 2019 draft, Sasaki made his Chiba debut in May 2021 and gained widespread attention with his startling starts in 2022. He tied the Japanese big-league record with 19 strikeouts in his perfect game, setting a mark with 13 Ks in a row. After throwing a 105-pitch complete game in Japan’s first perfect game since 1994, he was removed after 102 pitches and 14 strikeouts in his next start.Pitching with Statcast tracking in the WBC, 21 of his pitches where over 100 mph in his group stage start against the Czech Republic at the Tokyo Dome on March 11, topping out at 101.9 mph. Sasaki induced 22 swings and misses among 66 pitches, throwing 36 sinkers, 28 cutters and two splitters. He got the win as Japan romped 10-2, allowing an unearned run and two hits over 3 2/3 innings while striking out eight and walking two.Mexico figures be a tougher test with a lineup that includes Randy Arozarena, Rowdy Tellez, Isaac Paredes and Joey Meneses.""101 and 102 miles per hour plays anywhere,"" Gil said. “And then he has great secondary pitches, as well.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

Kalimuendo was under contract with PSG until 2024 but spent the last two seasons on loan at Lens.Rennes, which had already prevailed in the corresponding fixture in Brittany two months ago, made the most of PSG's passivity and relied on goalkeeper Steve Mandanda's decisive saves to produce a clean sheet. Karl Toko Ekambi scored Rennes' first goal.PSG looked slow and lethargic, relying in vain on the skills of Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi.Mbappe had two good chances to break the deadlock in the first half but the France star was denied twice.Mandanda stopped Mbappe's chipped effort in the 26th minute. The former France 'keeper then blocked Mbappe's shot from Messi's deep pass with a superb reflex save in the 40th.Rennes waited patiently and took its chance at the stroke of halftime when Benjamin Bourigeaud picked out Toko Ekambi behind the defense. The Cameroon forward controlled the ball with a delicate touch and beat Gianluigi Donnarumma with an angled shot.PSG players were whistled off the field by some fans, and things got worse when they returned from the locker room.Kalimuendo made it 2-0 in the 48th after PSG clumsily gave the ball away in midfield. He did not celebrate his goal.PSG pressed harder as it tried to pull one back but made too many technical mistakes and was vulnerable to counterattacks, with Rennes having the best chances after the interval.Mandanda was decisive again 10 minutes from time to firmly parry away Marco Verratti's shot that looked bound for the goal.PSG is out of the Champions League and the French Cup, meaning it has just the league title left to focus on. Chasing a European spot, Rennes moved up to fifth place in the standings.MARSEILLE IN THE HUNTSecond-place Marseille's hard-fought victory in the Champagne town marked its eighth straight away win.Marseille forward Alexis Sanchez scored twice against Reims, including a superb curled free kick, after Folarin Balogun put the hosts in the driving seat.Reims pushed hard for an equalizer in the second half and Marseille goalkeeper Pau Lopez made several decisive saves to keep his team ahead. Marseille was lucky not to concede again as the hosts hit the woodwork twice.BEN YEDDER HITS 80 MARKWissam Ben Yedder scored his 80th career league goal for Monaco in a 2-0 win at 10-man Ajaccio as the Principality side got back to winning ways in the top flight.It was Ben Yedder's 17th league goal this season. The France striker put the hosts ahead in the 26th minute before Krepin Diatta sealed Monaco's win with seven minutes left.Ajaccio was forced to play with 10 players for most of the second half after Cyrille Bayala was sent off for a reckless tackle on Caio Henrique in the 51st minute.Fourth-place Monaco had picked up only one point from its previous three matches.Ben Yedder became the third player in Monaco's history to score 80 league goals for the club after Delio Onnis (157) and Lucien Cossou (97).He scored from a rebound from close range following a free kick from Henrique. Monaco was then in control against a poor Ajaccio side that was punished by Diatta on the counter and remained in the relegation zone.WAHI'S DOUBLEMontpellier's revival under coach Michel Der Zakarian continued as the Mediterranean club came from behind to beat Clermont 2-1 and moved to 11th place.Montpellier is now unbeaten in six matches, including five wins, since Der Zakarian returned in February.Montpellier had a chance to take the lead in the 13th minute but Stephy Mavididi hit the post. Saïf-Eddine Khaoui then gave Clermont the lead before the up-and-coming Wahi turned things round, first with a header then a precise shot. Wahi has 12 league goals, his best tally over a single season.NICE STAYS UNBEATENSeventh-place Nice extended its 11-game unbeaten run but was held to a 1-1 draw by Lorient.Bamo Meite scored the first goal of his professional career to give the visitors the lead before Gaetan Laborde put the teams level.OTHER RESULTSStrasbourg beat Auxerre 2-0 to end a three-game winless run and Brest drew 2-2 at Troyes.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840578,Pope Benedict XVI's aide acknowledges criticism over memoir,"ROME (AP) — The longtime secretary to Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged Sunday that his tell-all memoir, published in the days after Benedict’s death, had been criticized for casting Pope Francis in an unfavorable light, but insisted that some of the polemics were more about anti-Benedict prejudice than anything else.In some of his first public comments since Benedict’s Dec. 31 death, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein said he remained loyal to Francis and that he was still waiting for the pontiff to give him a new job.Gaenswein’s future has been the subject of much speculation following Benedict’s death and the publication of “Nothing But the Truth: My Life Beside Pope Benedict XVI.” In the memoir, Gaenswein charted his nearly 30 years working with Benedict, but also settled old scores, revealed palace intrigues and detailed some of the bad blood that accrued during the decade in which Benedict lived as a retired pope alongside Francis.Published during the emotional period around Benedict’s Jan. 5 funeral, the book came to encapsulate the conservative criticism that has been directed at Francis and his more progressive bent by people nostalgic for Benedict’s doctrinaire papacy.Speaking to Sky TG24 Sunday after celebrating Mass at a Rome-area church, Gaenswein acknowledged his book had raised eyebrows both for its content and the timing of its publication.“There are and will be criticisms,” he said. “And I have to live with the criticisms.”He said that he welcomed well-founded criticism.“If the criticisms aren’t well-founded, but are criticisms from (anti-Benedict) prejudice or other unfounded motives, I have to accept them, but I cannot take them seriously. True criticism I accept and I learn from,” he said.He spoke to Sky at Santa Maria Consolatrice, which was the titular church of Benedict when he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. After the Mass, a plaque honoring the late pope was unveiled.In an interview with The Associated Press on Jan. 24, Francis responded to Gaenswein's critiques, and those of other conservatives, by saying they were natural after 10 years and proved that the prelates felt free to speak.",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840583,Bayern Munich pay penalty at Leverkusen ahead of Klassiker,"Bayern Munich are used to first. But a second penalty, given at the second viewing, left them second best on Sunday and second in the table after a deserved loss to Bayer Leverkusen.After Borussia Dortmund’s convincing win on Saturday, Bayern needed victory to get back to the summit ahead of the international break and the meeting with BVB that follows it. But they didn’t look like they knew it. The home side surged forward in the early stages, with Jeremie Frimpong constantly challenging fellow speedster Alphonso Davies down Bayern’s left.But while Leverkusen made nothing of their opportunities, Bayern took full advantage of their first. Leon Goretzka laid back to offer Joshua Kimmich a clear sight of goal from just inside the box. Kimmich’s low drive was on target but only really became deadly courtesy of a flick of the boot from Leverkusen defender Odilon Kossounou. One shot, one goal, 1-0.Nevertheless, Julian Nagelsmann had seen enough to make a triple substitution at the break. But it wasn’t enough to rouse Bayern from their sluggishness and they were finally punished by their hosts after 55 minutes. After being booked by the referee for diving in the box, Amine Adli threw his boot to the ground. Seconds later, it became clear why as replays for the VAR showed that Benjamin Pavard had trodden on said footwear in the penalty box. Exequiel Palacios rolled home the penalty and restored parity.One of those haltime substitutes, Jamal Musiala, showed bursts of threat but still the champions labored. And still Leverkusen came. Adil again got free, again went down, again was booked and, once again the decision was rightly overturned after a VAR review. Again, Palacios lashed past Sommer.Despite a late flurry of efforts, Nagelsmann and his team will have two weeks to mull over a third Bundesliga loss of the season. Dortmund, Bayern's next visitors on April 1, have lost six. But by the only metric that really matters, points, Dortmund now lead. Extend that one point to four next time out and Bayern might just snap out of it. Or, maybe not.",2023/3/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840584,Miami Beach sets spring break curfew after 2 fatal shootings,"MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Miami Beach officials imposed a curfew beginning Sunday night during spring break after two fatal shootings and rowdy, chaotic crowds that police have had difficulty controlling.The city said in a news release the curfew would be from 11:59 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday, with an additional curfew likely to be put in place Thursday through next Monday, March 27. The curfew mainly affects South Beach, the most popular party location for spring breakers.The release said the two separate shootings Friday night and early Sunday that left two people dead and “excessively large and unruly crowds” led to the decision. The city commission plans a meeting Monday to discuss potential further restrictions next week.Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said in a video message posted Sunday that the crowds and presence of numerous firearms has “created a peril that cannot go unchecked” despite massive police presence and many city-sponsored activities meant to keep people busy.“We don't ask for spring break in our city. We don't want spring break in our city. It's too rowdy, it's too much disorder and it's too difficult to police,” Gelber said.The latest shooting happened about 3:30 a.m. Sunday on Ocean Drive in South Beach, according to Miami Beach police. A male was shot and died later at a hospital, and officers chased down a suspect on foot, police said on Twitter. Their identities were not released, nor were any possible charges.In the Friday night shooting, one male victim was killed and another seriously injured, sending crowds scrambling in fear from restaurants and clubs into the streets as gunshots rang out. Police detained one person at the scene and found four firearms, but no other details have been made available.Under the curfew, people must leave businesses before midnight, although hotels can operate later only in service to their guests. The city release said restaurants can stay open only for delivery and the curfew won't apply to residents, people going to and from work, emergency services and hotel guests. Some roads will be closed off and arriving hotel guests may have to show proof of their reservations.Last year, the city imposed a midnight curfew following two shootings, also on Ocean Drive. The year before that, there were about 1,000 arrests and dozens of guns confiscated during a rowdy spring break that led Miami Beach officials to take steps aimed at calming the situation.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840585,DA leading Trump case says rhetoric won't intimidate office,"NEW YORK (AP) — Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is standing firm against Donald Trump’s increasingly hostile rhetoric, telling his staff that the office won’t be intimidated or deterred as it nears a decision on charging the former president.Bragg sent an internal memo late Saturday hours after Trump unleashed a three-part, all-caps social media post in which he said he could be arrested in the coming days, criticized the district attorney and encouraged his supporters to protest and “TAKE OUR NATION BACK!”Bragg, whose office has been calling witnesses to a grand jury investigating hush money paid on Trump’s behalf during his 2016 campaign, did not mention the Republican by name, but made it clear that’s who he was writing about. The memo came as law enforcement officials in New York City are making security preparations for the possibility Trump is charged and appears in court in Manhattan.“We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York,” Bragg wrote, referring to “press attention and public comments” regarding an ongoing investigation by his office.As Bragg sought to assuage concerns about potential threats, posts about protests began popping up online, including a rally on Monday against Bragg organized by the New York Young Republican Club.Law enforcement officials in New York are also closely monitoring online chatter warning of protests and violence if Trump is arrested, four law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. The threats that law enforcement agents are tracking vary in specificity and credibility, the officials said. Mainly posted online and in chat groups, the messages have included calls for armed protesters to block law enforcement officers and attempt to stop any potential arrest, the officials said.The law enforcement officials are also discussing a multitude of security plans for lower Manhattan in the event Trump is indicted. Those plans — which the officials described as preliminary — include the potential for closing down several streets around the Manhattan criminal courthouse and blocking streets with large trucks, similar to security protocols in place for major events and parades in New York.The officials could not discuss details of the security plans publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Bragg, a Democrat, inherited the yearslong Trump investigation when he took office in January 2022 and quickly faced criticism — not from Trump, but from holdover prosecutors for backing away from his predecessor’s plans to charge the former president with business-related fraud.Bragg rebounded with convictions for Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, and his longtime finance chief for an unrelated tax fraud scheme before pivoting to what he’s called the probe’s “next chapter” — bringing fresh scrutiny to the hush money payments, which have been the subject of repeated federal and state-level inquiries over the last six years.Now, as that probe nears its denouement, Bragg is seeking to reassure his 1,600 employees in the face of increasing hostility from Trump and his supporters.In his memo Saturday night, he wrote that the office is working with court officers and New York City police to ensure they are safe and that “any specific or credible threats against the office” are investigated.The memo and Trump’s earlier social media postings underscored the contrast in styles between Bragg and Trump — two native New Yorkers, but from different eras, neighborhoods and backgrounds, and with exceedingly disparate personas.Bragg, an old-school lawyer who prefers to let the work speak for itself, has declined to comment publicly about the status of the hush-money investigation or Trump’s bombastic missives. His office has also declined comment.There has been no public announcement of a time frame for a decision on charging Trump and at least one additional witness is expected to testify, likely Monday, further indicating that no vote to indict has yet been taken.In a post Sunday, Trump lambasted Bragg — Manhattan’s first Black district attorney — as a “Racist in Reverse,"" and accused him, without evidence, of taking orders from the Justice Department and being a pawn for billionaire Democratic donor George Soros, who supported Bragg’s campaign through the Color Of Change PAC.Bragg, 49, came into office 15 months ago amid what he calls a “perfect storm” of rising crime and political pressure, along with internal strife he was facing over the direction of the Trump investigation.A Harvard-educated former federal prosecutor, chief deputy state attorney general and civil rights lawyer, Bragg came equipped with legal and management credentials, but not much experience navigating New York City politics.His courtroom bona fides include prosecuting a rogue FBI agent and overseeing lawsuits against Trump while a high-ranking official at the state attorney general’s office. His life experience includes growing up in Harlem during the 1980s crack cocaine epidemic and being held at gunpoint six times — three times by police.But shortly after taking office, Republicans and some centrist Democrats were labeling Bragg soft on crime for a “Day One” memo he sent to staff outlining his philosophy on prosecuting — or not prosecuting — certain offenses. Among other things, it said the DA would no longer prosecute some low-level misdemeanor crimes, including subway fare evasion and marijuana possession.Former U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican, campaigned for governor last year partly on a promise to remove the independently elected Bragg from office. The vitriol against Bragg became so rancid — and sometimes racist — friends worried for his safety.The New York Post put Bragg on its front page 13 times in his first year in office, including five times in his first month, with derisive headlines like “Happy 2022, Criminals!” and “‘Justice’ Gone Mad.”It became routine for a Post photographer to pepper Bragg with questions when he arrived at the D.A.’s office each morning, when he often ignored. The truth was: while some types of crime increased in Manhattan in 2022, compared to the previous year, there were fewer murders and shootings.Inside the district attorney’s office, Bragg faced dissent over the direction of the Trump investigation — grievances aired anew last month in a book by a former prosecutor, Mark Pomerantz.In 2021, Bragg’s predecessor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., authorized Pomerantz and another top deputy, Carey Dunne, to seek an indictment on charges that Trump exaggerated the worth of his assets in financial statements he gave to lenders. Vance left office before the case was finished, leaving the decision about charges to Bragg.Bragg decided not to proceed immediately, citing concerns about the strength of the case. In a recent statement, he said: “Pomerantz’s plane wasn’t ready for takeoff.”The delay prompted Pomerantz and Dunne to resign, leading to some speculation that Bragg had given up on pursuing a case against Trump.Bragg refuted that in a rare public statement last April, writing: “In the long and proud tradition of white-collar prosecutions at the Manhattan D.A.’s Office, we are investigating thoroughly and following the facts without fear or favor.”___Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Michael Balsamo in Washington contributed to this report.___Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/.",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840587,Villanova star Siegrist insists she's undecided on WNBA,"VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) — Maddy Siegrist had her shooting style compared to Larry Bird and she has set or is closing in on so many Villanova records that the Guinness Book should just keep her statistics.She's been projected as a WNBA lottery pick and former Wildcats star and current New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson even suggested an immediate jersey retirement after her last game.All that, and Siegrist still finds ways to let her teammates shine. Bella Runyan and Kaitlyn Orihel each hit three 3s in their first March Madness win. Christina Dalce grabbed 16 rebounds.Any advice to the rest of the bracket on how to slow the team President Joe Biden picked to win it all?“Stay at the hotel,” Cleveland State coach Chris Kielsmeier cracked.Siegrist and the Wildcats already gave the Vikings an early checkout of the NCAA Tournament and they'll try and bounce out Florida Gulf Coast on Monday night.With a win against the Eagles (33-3) at the Pavilion, in front of another expected raucous home crowd, the Wildcats (29-6) would set a team record for wins in a season and reach the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2003.But is it really a Pavilion farewell for Siegrist?The four-year star, 2023 first-team AP All-American and two-time Big East Player of the Year has — as do all athletes whose 2020-2021 season was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic — an extra year of eligibility. Throw in some NIL money and maybe it's worth it for Siegrist to run it back with the Wildcats.Eh, probably not.ESPN has Siegrist as the No. 4 pick of the WNBA draft to the Washington Mystics and CBS Sports projected her as a slam dunk first-round pick. The WNBA draft is April 10.“I wish it was an easy decision either way,” Siegrist said Sunday. “When the time comes to make that, hopefully it’s in a few weeks, a lot more games. I’ll have to sit down with my parents and really think about it. Either way, I’m so grateful for all the opportunities Villanova has given me in the past bunch of years.”Coach Denise Dillon insisted no decision on Siegrist's basketball future has been made.“Maddy is staying focused in as taking this team as far as we can go,” she said. “When she steps on the floor, her full attention is to Villanova basketball. I guess that conversation will be had at some point in April.”Siegrist is sure to give the Eagles fits, The Eagles beat fifth-seeded Washington State on Saturday and have won more games as a 12 seed (three) than any other team in tournament history. Entering this season, 12 seeds were 29-112.FGCU coach Karl Smesko has led the program to 13 straight 25-win seasons but has never won a second-round NCAA Tournament game. FGCU held the Cougars to 39% shooting from the floor and 27% from 3-point range.They'll need a similar stout effort to stave off Siegrist and the Wildcats.“We know that nobody's really been able to hold her under 20 points all season,” Smesko said. “We just are hoping to make it so she's not as efficient as she usually is. If we can just have her make tough shots, which she is more than capable of doing, just not give her any easy points, that's in our game plan. We understand we can't just have one person. We need to guard her as a team.”The Eagles averaged 78.1 points entering the tournament and are ready for a slugfest. Consider, FGCU has five players who have scored 1,000 career points on the roster. Siegrist became the fifth women's player to score 1,000 in a season.Just add her gaudy numbers to what already constitutes a fantastic sports season on the often dreary Philly sceneThe Phillies are coming off another World Series appearance, and another defeat, this time to the Astros, and the Eagles lost the Super Bowl to Kansas City. The Sixers are soaring in the Eastern Conference with Joel Embiid and James Harden and the Union played for the Major League Soccer title.But it's been a downer in college hoops. Villanova lost an NIT game a year after it reached the Final Four and none of the other five Division I teams qualified for March Madness. This was the first year since 1977 that Philadelphia did not have a men's team in the tourney. Villanova was the only women's Philly team to make the tournament.“Just being the only team, I think that’s special because then everyone’s looking at us, they’re all rooting for us. It’s special to play for,” guard Brooke Mullin said.That puts more eyes around town on the Wildcats. Move over Embiid, Siegrist photos made the back page on Friday of the Philadelphia Daily News (“WILDCAT FORMATION”) and the front page of the Philadelphia Inquirer (“Pride of Villanova”).“What other team is there to root for? We’re here and we’re successful, so it’s really special,” guard Maddie Burke said.The Wildcats just hope they're not done making headlines.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840588,Swayman stops 26 shots in Bruins' 7-0 rout of Sabres,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Goalie Jeremy Swayman and the league-leading Boston Bruins had unfinished business to address before entertaining thoughts of finally going home following a week on the road.In a five-game trip that began with losses in Detroit and Chicago to mark Boston’s first two-game skid of the season, the Bruins closed with three straight wins, capped by a 7-0 rout of the reeling Buffalo Sabres on Sunday.Captain Patrice Bergeron set the tone by scoring 15 seconds into the game. The Bruins scored three times on their first seven shots. David Pastrnak matched a career-high by scoring his team-leading 48th goal. And Swayman made 26 saves to post his second straight shutout, which he celebrated by taking a bite out of a chicken wing offered to him by fellow goalie Linus Ullmark.“Love that guy,” Swayman said of Ullmark, before addressing how important it was for the Bruins to regain their groove.“I think the biggest thing is just staying in the moment, learning from our mistakes and taking the positives from games that we don’t like,” Swayman said. “So the last couple of games have been a really big positive for our team.”Swayman, who was coming off a 36-save outing in a 3-0 win at Winnipeg on Thursday, blanked the NHL’s third-best offense. He now has four shutouts on the season, all coming in the span of 13 starts dating to a 6-0 win over Philadelphia on Jan. 16.Jake DeBrusk had a goal and three assists while Garnet Hathaway and Hampus Lindholm also scored.Boston continued its domination over its Atlantic Division rival by improving to 19-1-1 in its past 21 meetings, and 9-0-1 in the past 10 since a 6-4 loss at Buffalo on April 23, 2021. The Bruins have now outscored the Sabres by a combined 14-1 in their past two outings following a 7-1 win at Boston on March 2.The Sabres dropped to 2-7-2 in their past 11 as part of a swoon that began immediately after they won five of six to move into eighth-place in the Eastern Conference standings. Buffalo squandered yet another opportunity to gain ground after opening the day sitting 11th, and six points behind the eighth-place Pittsburgh Penguins.Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen stopped 19 shots in dropping to 0-3-2 in his past five, a stretch in which he’s allowed 21 goals.The difference in how the playoff-tested Bruins played compared to the Sabres — in the midst of an NHL-worst 11-season playoff drought — was apparent to Buffalo coach Don Granato.“They make their breaks and they’re ready for their breaks and they get them early in the game,” Granato said. “So you fall behind, you start chasing the game against a team that’s feeling their swagger like they are, and it’s a little more challenging.”Boston bookended a three-goal first period with a three-goal third in which Charlie Coyle and defenseman Charlie McAvoy closed the scoring.The Bruins won their 26th road game to match a franchise record set in 1971-72. Boston’s 53 wins through 69 games match the team’s fourth-highest total, and are four short of the franchise record set during a 78-game season in 1970-71.“This was a big game. And to head back home after a long trip and to play like that and get the result is huge for us,” McAvoy said. “When we play the right way, our skill can take over once our work ethic and compete go first.”SCRATCHEDBruins C David Krejci was scratched due to what coach Jim Montgomery referred to as “soreness,” while D Dmitry Orlov was given the day off with Boston playing on consecutive days.UP NEXTBruins: Host the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday.Sabres: Host the Nashville Predators on Tuesday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840600,"Tar Heels, Buckeyes seek better showings, and another 'W'","Style points matter less than outcomes in the women's NCAA Tournament, North Carolina coach Courtney Banghart said, and what matters most is getting the chance to be better in another game.Banghart's sixth-seeded Tar Heels beat St. John's 61-59 on Saturday and will face third-seeded Ohio State in the second round on Monday. The Buckeyes themselves got past a slow start and beat James Madison 80-66.“Survive to live another day,” Banghart said Sunday.North Carolina (22-10) won after a go-ahead three-point play by Deja Kelly with 2 seconds left. But the Heels gave the Red Storm a chance when Danielle Patterson was fouled on a 3-point shot. She missed the first two free throws (though made the third), depriving her team of moving on.“We were hoping we would play better, I think, so I think there was a chance for us as a group to regroup and say, you know, winning in ... November, you care what it looks like,"" Banghart said. ""In March, you don’t.”Getting the first win out of the way, even if they didn't play their best, does provide a level of comfort, Tar Heels guard Eva Hodgson said.“To be able to weather that I think is really important for our team,” she said of the Tar Heels, who led most of the way until the final quarter.The Buckeyes (26-7) trailed by as many as 16 against the Dukes and only grabbed the lead midway through the third quarter. Ohio State Coach Kevin McGuff said the team needs to find ways to get their offense going sooner.“We didn’t make any shots early yesterday so we have to make sure we are, one, executing at a high level on the offensive end, and two, getting some balance in our offense where we’re not settling for threes,” he said. “Usually, if we’re not getting balance, we’re settling for 3s. So we have to try to get to the rim, maybe get to the free-throw line, just to generate some offense early to allow us to get in an offensive rhythm.”No strangers to comebacks, the Buckeyes would prefer not to keep challenging themselves with uphill climbs. A home crowd was a bonus Saturday, but a 4 p.m. EDT Monday game might not draw as well.“Definitely work on trying not to dig ourselves a hole or be in a deficit every single game,” Taylor Thierry, who scored 15 against James Madison, said. “That’s not going to work against every single team. That’s just something we are working on and try to play our best game and try to execute things as best as possible.”Thierry also said things will only get more urgent: “This is a crazy month. There’s upsets. So we are just going to approach every game like it’s going to be our last, so I think we just have to go in with that mindset and we’ll be pretty good.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840601,"Colorado, Duke show offensive upgrades in March Madness","DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Colorado and Duke rode their defense to strong regular seasons.Now they’re picking up more confidence at the offensive end, coming off splendid shooting performances going into their NCAA Tournament second-round matchup Monday night.“We know it’s crunch time, and I think everybody is really locked in and just focusing on their shots,” Duke guard Celeste Taylor said.The third-seeded Blue Devils (26-6) broke away from offensive doldrums in a first-round rout of Iona on Saturday night. Sixth-seeded Colorado (24-8) sank a season-best 13 shots from 3-point range against Middle Tennessee.It's been five years since Duke has advanced to the Sweet 16, and even longer for Colorado — 20 years. The winner heads to the Seattle 4 Region.The Buffaloes, who rate third defensively among Pac-12 teams, have become comfortable in Duke’s Cameron Indoor Stadium.“Before this past game, we were talking about this gym being a shooter’s gym,” Colorado guard Kindyll Wetta said. “And Jaylyn (Sherrod) came up to me during one of the timeouts and was like, ‘It’s a shooter’s gym.’”The Buffaloes were held to less than 50 points twice in their last five games before rolling past Middle Tennessee, 82-60.Duke coach Kara Lawson said her team needs to be consistent “in our defensive discipline possession after possession after possession” and “try to make things difficult knowing that they have a number of players that can make hard shots.”Duke had three consecutive games without reaching the 45-point mark, capped by a season-low total in a 58-37 Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament semifinal loss to Virginia Tech. And the Blue Devils have won seven games without scoring 60 points.Shooting 58.5% from the field in the 89-49 blowout of Iona was an welcome upgrade.“Obviously it boosted our confidence with that (offense),” Duke guard Reigan Richardson said.Duke has held opponents to 50 or fewer points 17 times, which is more than half of the games its played this season. So naturally, the Blue Devils place an emphasis on defense.“I like offense a lot, believe it or not,” Lawson said. “You may watch us play some games and not think I like offense, but I do. But as much as I like offense, I like winning more.”THE ROAD AHEADColorado has been to the Sweet 16 six times, but the Buffaloes have never won a second-round game away from home.Duke has been a frequent host for the tournament’s opening week, though has lost two of its last three second-round home games, falling to DePaul in 2014 and to Oregon in 2017. Those defeats came as No. 2 seed. Duke has never dropped a second-round game while holding a No. 3 seed.“This is a game to go to the Sweet 16,” Lawson said. “This is a severe cut. This might be the most severe cut in the tournament when you think about it. Like going from 32 to 16. Like there’s not any pretenders in the Sweet 16.”HOME TERRITORYFifth-year Colorado guard Tayanna Jones is in her third season with the Buffaloes since transferring from Georgetown. She’s from Smithfield, North Carolina, about an hour’s drive from Duke’s campus.“It was a long ways from home for her to come to Colorado, but I think we just sort of made a good connection,” Buffaloes coach JR Payne said. “Really special to be here in her neck of the woods with her family just down the road.”Jones, a starting guard, scored eight points in the Middle Tennessee game for her second-highest point production since before Christmas.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840603,March Madness rematch: Louisville vs Texas for Sweet 16,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas and Louisville already met once this season, back in a November tournament in the breezy Bahamas.The Cardinals got the better of the Longhorns that day when both were ranked in the Top 10 and penciling in expectations for deep runs in the NCAA Tournament.After a long season with ups and downs for both, they meet again Monday night on the Longhorns' home court with a lot more at stake: a trip the Sweet 16. And it promises to be one of the most physical games of the tournament.""Both teams have that aggression in them,” Texas point guard Rori Harmon said. “Its part of their culture, that’s how we both play.””Fourth-seeded Texas (26-9) has advanced to the Elite Eight each of the past two seasons. Fifth-seeded Louisville (24-11) has reached the Elite Eight or Final Four in each of the last four tournaments.Louisville players say they know the first meeting between the teams, which the Cardinals won 71-63, is is now mostly meaningless. For starters, the Longhorns were missing Harmon, the Big 12 defensive player of the year and the spark plug for everything they do on both ends of the court.Harmon missed the first five games of the season with a toe injury and Texas lost three in a row without her. Everything she does for the Longhorns was on full display in their first-round win over East Carolina when she had eight assists in the first half alone.Texas shooting guard Shaylee Gonzales, a transfer from BYU, handled the point the first time Longhorns and Cardinals met. She's much happier now roaming the wings for open 3-pointers“We were all new, we had never really played with each other,"" Gonzales said. ""Obviously super glad that she's back because I was super stressed to be thrown into that position.”Louisville's starting backcourt of Hailey Van Lith and Mykasa Robinson will be challenged by Harmon's elite quickness, but Van Lith seemed to relish the matchup.“Rori changes their team a little bit in the fact she has elite court vision,” Van Lith said. “Wearing her out in the backcourt, full court defense is going to be big for us.""Van Lith took over the fourth quarter in the first round against Drake, scoring 13 points over the final four minutes to rescue the Cardinals from their first opening-round loss since 2006.She and Robinson will have some big bodies to contend with under the basket against Texas. The Longhorns are the biggest team in the Big 12 and throw those bodies at the basket all game.Even with that size, Texas coach Vic Schaefer said he'll push his post players to be ready for a fight.“We've got the biggest team in the Big 12, and so even in the NCAA Tournament, we've got to take advantage of that,” Schaefer said. “We cannot be bullied. So I’ve challenged our kids to not let that happen. You’ve got to fight back. You just do.”DEFENSE DOMINATESTexas is 22-0 this season when the Longhorns hold opponents under 60 points. The Longhorns held East Carolina under 10 points in the final three quarters. The Pirates didn't score a field goal in the fourth.Louisville forced 14 turnovers in the first half against Drake, turning them into 14 critical points in a game that went down to the final possession.“They can turn turnovers into layups in a hurry. Both of us will put a premium on taking care of the ball,” Schaefer said.HOME COURTMost of Louisville's recent success in the NCAA Tournament has started on the Cardinals' home court. Except for the pandemic tournament of 2021 that was played entirely in Texas, Louisville had hosted the first two rounds in the previous six seasons.Walz is unfazed about playing on Texas' home court Monday.“It's definitely a home court advantage and that’s what they’ve earned. We’ve been fortunate enough to be able to do it,” Walz said. “It should be a great environment. And that’s what you want. I’d rather come out and play in from of 8,000 than in front of 300. And our kids want that as well ... I hope it's a packed house.""___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840604,Matt Boldy hat trick paces Minnesota past Washington 5-3,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Matt Boldy recorded his second career hat trick and the Minnesota Wild rebounded to beat Washington 5-3 on Sunday.Minnesota, which had its 14-game point-streak end Saturday against Boston, is within one point of Dallas for the Central Division lead and two points up on Colorado for second with a dozen games to play.Ryan Reaves and Brandon Duhaime also scored, and Marc-Andre Fleury made 33 saves for Minnesota, improving to 7-0-0 in his last seven starts.“Sometimes when you go on a streak like that and then you lose one it’s easy sometimes to slump. It was important to make sure that we didn’t,” Reaves said.Alex Ovechkin scored twice on the power play and Dylan Strome once for Washington, which is 2-4-1 in its past seven games. The Capitals trail Pittsburgh by five points for the final wild card spot with 11 games remaining. Charlie Lindgren stopped 35 shots.The trio of Boldy, Marcus Johansson and Joel Eriksson Ek has set the tone for Minnesota in the five games since Kirill Kaprizov was injured. Boldy has five goals and four assists, Johansson has two goals and five assists and Eriksson Ek has a goal and four assists.Yet coach Dean Evason said for team success it has to be, and has been, more than about those three players.“I would take it as the team has stepped up, right? Not just a few guys. Everybody. Everybody has. I don’t think they sat in there and said guys we have to score now. They’ve always tried to score, but with his absence they all know that there’s a little extra push that’s needed to be had.”Boldy completed his hat trick on a breakaway with 6:02 to play, and 85 seconds after Ovechkin got the Capitals within 4-2. Boldy’s other three-goal game was Feb. 14, 2022.Less than a minute into the game, Boldy slammed home a loose puck from a Johansson shot after T.J. Oshie whiffed on a clearing attempt. Four crisp, textbook-like passes between the trio made it 2-0 via a Boldy one-timer from low in the right circle less than four minutes later.“Some games are just like that. It follows you,” Boldy said. “Linemates are playing awesome. First one, just a great play by Jojo, who lays it right there.""Then the 3-on-2 one everyone gets a touch, just snapping it around. Then the third one I get a breakaway. So it’s a lot of credit to those guys.”It’s the third time in four games Washington trailed by two after an opening period.“You take away the first five minutes of the last five games. I feel like we’ve got more goals than the other team,” Strome said. In that quintet, the latest first goal allowed by the Capitals is 5:18.From his power-play home atop the left circle, Ovechkin lasered a shot past Fleury early in the second and scored from about the same place in the third. He has 27 goals in 45 games against Fleury, his most against a single goaltender.Ovechkin has recorded a point in every game in Minnesota since Oct. 12, 2006, and his 0.90 goals per game against the Wild — 19 goals in 21 games — is the highest rate he has recorded against an opponent.With 39 goals, his next tally will mark his 13th season with at least 40 goals, breaking a tie with Wayne Gretzky for most in league history.Washington forward Evgeny Kuznetsov left the game hunched over early in the third period after getting crushed by Matt Dumba. Oshie and Dumba then dropped the gloves.“I don’t like the hit, a player’s vulnerable like that takes a pop to his head,” said Washington coach Peter Laviolette. He had no update on Kuznetsov.BOUNTIFUL BOLDYBoldy has 22 goals this season, joining Marian Gaborik as the only players in Wild history to score at least 20 goals in a season before age 22. Gaborik had 30 in 2001-02 and 2002-03. Now at 51 points, Boldy also joins Gaborik (67 in 2001-02, 65 in 2002-03) and Pierre-Marc Bouchard (59 in 2005-06) as the only Wild skaters to get at least 50 points in a season before age 22.UP NEXTCapitals: Host Columbus on Tuesday.Wild: At New Jersey on Tuesday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840605,Toledo seeks 1st Sweet 16 in March Madness against Lady Vols,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The 12th-seeded Toledo Rockets know they're on the verge of program history — a win away from the first Sweet 16 for the Mid-American Conference Tournament champ.Toledo junior guard Khera Goss said she's dreamed of this opportunity since she was a little girl.“Growing up in a basketball family, this is something that I’ve been surrounded by, so the fact that it’s our turn to be able to experience it and live it out is something that I can’t even put into words,” Goss said Sunday.Thanks to a crash course in women's basketball history this week, they also fully understand the challenge Monday night when they play No. 4 seed Tennessee. They'll be on the court named for the late coach Pat Summitt, under rafters filled with her eight national championship banners.Toledo coach Tricia Cullop, who during a recruiting trip accidentally took Summitt's rental car keys before realizing the BMW was not hers, called the Lady Vols a formidable opponent.But the Rockets (29-4) want their own history by reaching the Sweet 16 in the Seattle 3 Region, and also want to extend their record streak to 18 straight wins.“We’re not just here to be here,” Cullop said. “We’re looking forward to the challenge. We’re going to give it our best shot, you know, and see what happens.”Tennessee coach Kellie Harper, who helped win three of the Lady Vols' title banners between 1996 and 1998, has played and coached enough in March to know that every team still in it deserves to be here.She also sees Toledo as a team deserving a much better seed, having knocked off then-No. 14 Michigan in December before beating No. 5 seed Iowa State 80-73 in the first round. Harper called Toledo disciplined, tough and very smart on defense.“Where they might not ... have the size of some opponents, they’re able to make up for that with how they play,” Harper said. “So we know this is a very good basketball team. We’re in for a big battle.”Her Lady Vols (24-11) want to add a new chapter to their vaunted tradition after routing Saint Louis 95-50 on Saturday.This program ended its Sweet 16 drought a year ago by edging a No. 12 seed in Belmont with a late 3. Winning Monday night would mean Tennessee's first back-to-back trips to the Sweet 16 since 2015-16 and the 36th overall for the only program to play in all 41 NCAA Tournaments.Tennessee junior Tess Darby said that would be really special.“You come to the University of Tennessee, and you’re supposed to be in those games,” Darby said.Tennessee lost center Tamari Key to blood clots in December. Marta Suarez stepped away from this season for personal reasons. Jessie Rennie tore an ACL last summer. The Lady Vols also played the nation's toughest schedule, losing eight to ranked teams — twice to No. 1 South Carolina.Darby said this is a far different team than the one that started the season.They also have guard Jordan Horston, who missed this tournament a year ago with an elbow injury, and Mississippi State transfer Rickea Jackson playing in the first NCAA Tournament of her career.“We’re just really prepared I feel like, and it’s just given us that boost of confidence that we can compete with anyone,” Darby said.Toledo's biggest challenge will be dealing with Tennessee's decided height disadvantage. Forward Jessica Cook (6-foot-2) is one three Rockets who are 6 feet or taller. Tennessee's only starter under 6 feet? Point guard Jordan Walker, at 5-8.“If we went out and played one-on-one they would win every time,” Cullop said. “But the good thing is we get to play five-on-five.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840606,Source: Lawyer invited to testify before Trump grand jury,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer who previously advised Michael Cohen, the key government witness in the hush money payment investigation into Donald Trump, has been invited to appear Monday before a Manhattan grand jury that is considering potential charges against the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter.Robert Costello had advised Cohen before the two had a falling out, and is prepared to offer testimony to the grand jury attacking the credibility of Cohen's statements, according to the person, who insisted on anonymity to discuss secret legal proceedings.Costello had contacted a lawyer for Trump saying that he had information that contradicted Cohen’s current statements and that could be exculpatory for Trump, the person said. The lawyer brought it to the attention of the district attorney’s office, which last week subpoenaed Costello’s law firm for records and invited him to provide testimony on Monday afternoon.The Manhattan district attorney’s office declined to comment on Sunday. Prosecutors have not said when they expect to conclude their work or when or if Trump might be charged. The former president claimed in a post on Saturday that he would be arrested on Tuesday, though people close to him later said that he had been given no updates from prosecutors.The New York Times first reported on Costello's expected appearance before the grand jury.Cohen is a former lawyer and fixer for Trump who has been a key witness in District Attorney Alvin Bragg's investigation, meeting regularly with prosecutors and appearing before the grand jury earlier this month.Cohen served prison time after pleading guilty in 2018 to federal charges, including campaign finance violations, for arranging the payouts to porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal to keep them from going public. Trump has denied the affairs.Costello is a veteran New York lawyer who has represented Trump allies including his adviser Steve Bannon and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Costello's connection to Cohen was highlighted in the report of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated links between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign as well as efforts to obstruct the probe.According to the Mueller report, Cohen began speaking with Costello in April 2018, days after the FBI raided Cohen's home, hotel room and office. Amid public speculation about whether Cohen would begin cooperating with investigators, Costello emailed Cohen to reassure him that he had had a “Very Very Positive” conversation with Giuliani and that “you have friends in high places.”Cohen has waived his attorney-client privilege with Costello, which would allow Costello to describe their conversations, the person said.___Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840608,"Indiana, Miami preparing for Holmes' return in March Madness","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Top-seeded Indiana needs All-America center Mackenzie Holmes to carry a heavy burden — if the team intends to fulfill its championship hopes.It appears the Big Ten's defensive player of the year will be back Monday night.One day after watching her teammates roll past Ohio Valley Conference Tournament champion Tennessee Tech, Holmes made it through most of Sunday's practice and appeared ready to go for the Hoosiers' second-round women's NCAA Tournament game against ninth-seeded Miami.“She's more than ready to be in the lineup (Monday) and see playing time,"" coach Teri Moren said. “Whether that will be limited, probably, but we're prepared for that.”Getting any minutes from Holmes would be a huge boost for the Hoosiers (28-3). She did not play in Saturday's 30-point rout of the much-smaller Golden Eagles.That decision gave Holmes extra time to recover from a sore knee, an injury Moren said dated to Holmes' prep career in Maine. Holmes said she aggravated the injury at the Big Ten Tournament.But after seeing the Hurricanes (20-12) use their physical style and harassing full-court pressure to rally from a 17-point halftime deficit and beat Oklahoma State, the Hoosiers know the return of the 6-foot-3 Holmes would be helpful as they seek to reach their third straight Sweet 16 and what they hope will be their first Final Four.How crucial is Holmes to Indiana's success?She averages 22.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and 1.9 blocks, all team highs; ranks second nationally with a 68.8% field goal percentage; and helps space the floor for Indiana's perimeter shooters. Against Miami, she could become a dangerous outlet against the press.The combination led Indiana to its first Big Ten regular-season conference crown in 40 years, a school-record No. 2 ranking in the final AP Top 25 poll, first and second-round home games for the second straight year and the first No. 1 seed in school history.“They’re a really prolific scoring team,"" Miami coach Katie Meier said. “Almost 18 assists a game, which for us is — that threatens us. The fact their team shares the ball that much and can get that many assists in a game, it's very difficult to defend, no matter what your defensive style is.”The Hurricanes (20-12) have seen all this before, though.Meier, guard Haley Cavinder and forward Lola Pendande believe the Hoosiers are similar to Atlantic Coast Conference foe Virginia Tech, which Miami beat on its home court in January before losing to the Hokies in the ACC Tournament.The Hurricanes have been in this situation previously, advancing through last season's eight-nine game before losing 49-33 in the second round at eventual national champion and No. 1 seed South Carolina. The Hurricanes want to use some of those lessons to their advantage in front of what's expected to be another raucous Assembly Hall crowd topping 12,000.Even after spending so much energy in Saturday's comeback, Meier and Miami's players dismissed any notion they'd be fatigued in their biggest game of the season.“I think we got a little taste of that at the ACC Tournament, understanding this is how March goes,” Cavinder said. “We definitely feel good and are prepared and focused on Indiana.”The Hoosiers must also find ways to adapt, given Holmes' limitations.Lilly Meister, who had seven points and three blocks in her first career start, and Alyssa Geary are still likely to play more minutes than usual. With Holmes having played just three games since Feb. 20, Moren also figures her best player may need some time to knock off the rust.That means players like four-time all-conference guard Grace Berger and Indiana's 3-point shooters may need to play bigger roles to beat the kind of pressure that proved so costly in the team's most recent loss, against Ohio State in the conference tourney.“During their comeback, they amped up the pressure a little bit and it kind of gave me flashbacks to Ohio State when we were up big and kind of let up,” guard Sydney Parrish said. “But we've been preparing for presses like them and kind of more athletic and higher pressuring teams like them, so I think we'll handle it great.”Especially if Holmes can provide that big presence in the post.“We have goals for this tournament and as much as we can protect Mac and allow her to take some reps off, we're trying to take advantage of that,"" Moren said. “She draws a lot of attention in the low block, but she's become a great facilitator for us. She's our leading scorer, so she's a threat and she does things on the outside when she's on the inside, so having her back will be big.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840610,"Officials abducted, jihadists repelled in Nigeria vote","ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Security forces repelled an attack by Islamic extremists on a coalition center in northeastern Nigeria and several election officials elsewhere were kidnapped as results trickled in Sunday from the gubernatorial vote.Meanwhile, the incumbent governor in the battleground state of Lagos appeared to have secured reelection, though results from more than two-thirds of the states were still being counted.Festus Okoye, a spokesman for Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission, said Sunday it had received reports of violence and was reviewing them. Nigeria's election laws grant the electoral body the power to void the outcome of an election in certain circumstances.“Some of our staff were abducted, some were harassed, some were intimidated, some were hospitalized and in one case killed,” Okoye said.Twenty-eight of Nigeria’s 36 states held elections for new governors on Saturday while state lawmakers were also elected for nearly 1,000 constituencies. Nigeria's constitution grants governors both enormous powers and immunity from any form of prosecution while in office, making them very influential both in their states and at the federal level.Saturday's elections were held as the political opposition continues to reject the recent victory of President-elect Bola Tinubu, who belongs to the ruling All Progressives Congress party.In the northeastern Borno state, Islamic State-backed extremist rebels attempted to disrupt the collation of results on Sunday but were repelled by security forces who killed many of them, local officials and residents said.Babangida Ajiri, head of a local security outfit collaborating with the military, said at least 40 of the rebels were killed with their arms recovered.“They wanted to surround the village, but the troops engaged professionally and thwarted their mission,” said Ajiri. “It was during the early morning search that we discovered most of the bodies of the killed terrorists.”The ruling All Progressives Congress’ Babajide Sanwo-Olu had won 19 of the 20 council areas in Lagos state, defeating Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the Labour Party. He immediately rejected the outcome, alleging that their supporters were intimidated and that the result was manipulated.Lagos was a battleground state in the election: It is home to Nigeria's commercial capital and it was also lost by the president-elect's party during the February election. The city of Lagos contributes more than 20% of Nigeria’s gross domestic product and has a 2023 budget of $3.8 billion, more than that of some African nations.Nearly 90 million voters were registered to vote in the election but observers reported a very low turnout, perhaps even lower than in the February elections. The 26.7% voter participation last month was the lowest in Nigerian history.Observer groups however said the election was marred by violence in many states. There were several reports of ballot papers being snatched, thugs disrupting voting and voters being prevented from voting for candidates of their choice, forcing the electoral body to postpone voting in a few locations until Sunday.___Umar reported from Maiduguri, Nigeria.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840611,"Nowell, late 3s lift Kansas State past Kentucky in NCAAs","GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Markquis Nowell never lost faith, not when Kansas State had hardly anyone left on the roster for a new coach nor when the Wildcats were picked last in the Big 12.“He always believed,"" coach Jerome Tang said, “And he helped me believe.”And that led Kansas State to this decidedly hard-to-believe moment: headed for New York's Madison Square Garden, ticket in hand for the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16.Nowell scored 23 of his 27 points after halftime, and Kansas State overcame a horrid start from outside by hitting a couple of clutch 3-pointers while topping Kentucky 75-69 in Sunday's second round.Tang has gone from having just two players on the roster to having a matching number of NCAA wins — sending the Wildcats (25-9) to their first Sweet 16 since 2018.“Dudes,” Tang said. “We got dudes. That's what it takes. I mean, people get all caught up in the coaching and all of that stuff. It's dudes.”Kansas State faces No. 7 seed Michigan State in the East Region semifinals on Thursday.Kansas State missed its first 13 3-pointers and sat at 2 for 17 when the outside shots started falling. Nowell buried a step-back 3 against Cason Wallace to pull within 60-59, soon followed by Ismael Massoud from the right wing for a 64-62 edge with 2:21 left.Keyontae Johnson added another from that side near the Kansas State bench, making it 67-62 with 1:23 left and creating a jolt with the kind of margin that felt massive considering nearly all of the second half had been played within four points.The 5-foot-8 Nowell, a third-team Associated Press All-American, played a fearless floor game. He was part of two memorable plays before halftime: a behind-the-back transition pass to Johnson for a dunk, and then a look-away alley-oop to Nae'Qwan Tomlin on the baseline to end the half.He hit three 3s, the first over Kentucky's Oscar Tshiebwe after the 0-for-13 start and another with his left foot on the “March Madness” midcourt logo.Tshiebwe had 25 points and 18 rebounds for sixth-seeded Kentucky (22-12), which led by eight early in the second half. But the Wildcats never could stretch that lead nor make their own big outside shots (4 for 20).“Tough way to end,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said. “We had some guys really fight like crazy and then had a couple of guys offensively not play their game the way they played all year. But that stuff happens in this tournament.”Kansas State's path isn't nearly so common.Tang left Baylor after a long stint on Scott Drew’s staff to take over a program that last went to the tournament in 2019 and had three straight losing seasons.Yet after a summer of transfer-portal work, the Wildcats thrived right away. And Tang's bets paid off in a number of ways Sunday.There was Johnson, who transferred from Florida after collapsing in a game in December 2020 and hadn't played since.There was Virginia Tech transfer big man David N'Guessan, who played multiple late possessions with his right heel out of his shoe — yet still had the tipout offensive rebound that led to Johnson's 3.And there was Massoud, who transferred from Wake Forest before Tang's arrival and joined Nowell in sticking around this year. He made his huge 3 about 30 minutes from his first college campus.“Ish stepped up, Keyontae stepped up, David stepped up,"" Nowell said. ""We all stepped up in those moments and we live for those moments.”For the other set of Wildcats, it marked another earlier-than-hoped-for exit from March Madness.Tshiebwe had 25 rebounds i n the first-round win against Providence for the most in any tournament game since 1977, and the two-time AP All-American was again a force inside. Wallace had 15 of his 21 points after halftime, including multiple times when the freshman used his 6-4 frame against Nowell inside.But No. 2 scorer Antonio Reeves (14.6 points) managed five points on 1-for-15 shooting, including 1-for-10 on 3s. The only make came with 8 seconds left.When it was over, KSU players hugged each other at midcourt, with guard Desi Sills — another transfer, fittingly — talking animatedly to nearby cameras as he walked around the court.Later, after most had left the court, Johnson was still hanging around behind the bench to sign autographs. And Tomlin squeezed in one more pass for high-fives of his own before running off with a triumphant point to a cross-court pocket of KSU fans.BIG PICTUREKentucky: The past year of wild emotional swings started with a devastating first-round exit at the hands of 15-seed Saint Peter’s. Calipari had been pushing his team to play loose and free entering this tournament. Still, it wasn't enough to get Kentucky back to the second weekend for the first time since an Elite Eight run in 2019, ending what Jacob Toppin called “a roller coaster for sure” of a year.Kansas State: Nowell likes March. He went for 17 points and 14 assists in Friday's first-round win against Montana State. And as Kansas State outscored Kentucky 19-9 down the stretch, Nowell had 11 and went 8 for 8 at the line.FLAT TIREN'Guessan, a 6-9 forward, played 74 seconds with his heel coming out of his right shoe before he was finally able to fix it during a late stoppage.“I thought the referees were going to do something after like three possessions,” N'Guessan said. “I was still wiggling around with one shoe on.""___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840612,"UConn, Baylor meet 2 years after close March Madness clash","STORRS, Conn. (AP) — Baylor supporters still insist there was a foul or two that should have been called on the final possession of the Bears' 2021 women's NCAA Tournament regional final against UConn. Husky fans will tell you it was just great defense.Two years after the Huskies beat the Bears 69-67 in the San Antonio bubble, the programs will meet again, this time in a second-round game on the Huskies' home court.Just four players who were were on the court for the 2021 game are expected to play Monday night — UConn's Aaliyah Edwards and Aubrey Griffin and Baylor's Caitlin Bickle and Sarah Andrews.Baylor also has a new coach in Nicki Collen, who took over after Kim Mulkey left for LSU.For both teams, the rivalry remains. Andrews acknowledged she will be playing, in part, for her former teammates.“It’s always gonna be a fun game playing against UConn,” she said. “There’s just moments that people live for to play on the stage like this. So you know, we’re gonna have fun go out there and fight hard.”Baylor (20-12) will be looking for its 16th trip to the Sweet 16 and 13th in 14 years.UConn (30-5) hopes to advance to the regional semifinals for a 29th straight year on the way to a potential 15th straight Final Four appearance and 12th national title.The Huskies and the Bears have met nine times and this will be their third in the postseason. UConn has won five of those games, but Baylor has taken the last three.But not in 2021.UConn led 68-67 with 3.5 seconds left when Baylor's DiJonai Carrington drove left and went up for a short jumper just outside the lane. Edwards and Olivia Nelson-Ododa both challenged the shot and both made contact. But no foul was called and the Huskies held on.“If I remember correctly about that particular game, there were a lot of fouls in that game,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “Some were called, some were not. Whether that one was a foul or not, I don’t know.”Neither Bickle nor Edwards wanted to revisit the subject.“My feelings from that game — we won it,” Edwards said. “So I think that’s really what I take from that game. You know, we’re into 2023. Now we’re moving on to something better.”In her four postseason games, the third-team All-American has averaged 21.5 points and 11.7 rebounds, with seven blocked shots.""I think that I’ve just grown basketball-wise and just as a person, you know, realizing that I need to just be competitive and to be really dominant for my teammates and for my coaches. Every game that’s in different ways,” Edwards said. “It’s not just about putting up numbers or anything.”The Huskies face a Baylor team that rallied from an early 18-point deficit on Saturday night to beat 10th-seeded Alabama 78-74.UConn guard Nika Muhl said the Huskies were paying attention and don’t plan to let their foot off the gas on Monday, especially after allowing several teams to come back from big deficits earlier this season.“So just having that in mind and never backing down, not even in the fourth quarter or if we’re up 20, it doesn’t matter,"" she said.Collen hopes it doesn't come to that.“You can’t spot UConn 10 points, let alone 18,” she said. “We know that. That’s no disrespect to Alabama because I thought they were fantastic. But this is UConn’s home court. You already feel like when you play on someone else’s home court, you got to be 10 points better than them.”SHE SAID ITBaylor is staying at a hotel near Bradley International Airport, about 45 minutes from the rural UConn campus in Eastern Connecticut.“I think one of the most impressive things that Geno did here was ever get someone to come here, which sounds horrible,” Collen said. “But when you know that they have to fly into Hartford for an official visit, and then they have to make that drive. And I told (assistant coach Tony Greene), I said, ‘Well, they can put shades in the limo and, like, talk about the 13 (actually 11) championships now.’ No one’s looking out the window at the woods anymore. So I think what’s so impressive is kind of the beginning here, why they became good.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840613,Biden calls Israel's Netanyahu with judicial plan 'concern',"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden spoke Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express ""concern” over his government’s planned overhaul of the country’s judicial system that has sparked widespread protests across Israel and to encourage compromise.The White House said Biden reiterated U.S. concerns about the measure to roll back the judiciary’s insulation from the country’s political system, in a call a senior administration official described as “candid and constructive.” There was no immediate indication that Netanyahu was shying away from the action, after rejecting a compromise last week offered by the country’s figurehead president.The official, who requested anonymity to discuss the leaders' private call, said that Biden spoke to Netanyahu “as a friend of Israel in the hopes that there can be a compromise formula found.”The White House in statement added that Biden “underscored his belief that democratic values have always been, and must remain, a hallmark of the U.S.-Israel relationship, that democratic societies are strengthened by genuine checks and balances, and that fundamental changes should be pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support.”“The President offered support for efforts underway to forge a compromise on proposed judicial reforms consistent with those core principles,” the statement said.Netanyahu told Biden that Israel will “remain, a strong and vibrant democracy,” according to the prime minister's office.Netanyahu said Sunday the legal changes would be carried out responsibly while protecting the basic rights of all Israelis. His government — the country’s most right-wing ever — says the overhaul is meant to correct an imbalance that has given the courts too much power and prevented lawmakers from carrying out the voting public’s will.Critics say it will upend Israel’s delicate system of checks and balances and slide the country toward authoritarianism. Opponents of the measure have carried out disruptive protests, and has even embroiled the country's military, after more than 700 elite officers from the Air Force, special forces, and Mossad said they would stop volunteering for duty.The conversation followed a Sunday meeting in Egypt between Israeli and Palestinian officials in which they pledged to take steps to lower tensions ahead of a sensitive holiday season. Administration officials praised the outcome of the summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. A joint communique said the sides had reaffirmed a commitment to de-escalate and prevent further violence.Biden in the call ""reinforced the need for all sides to take urgent, collaborative steps to enhance security coordination, condemn all acts of terrorism, and maintain the viability of a two-state solution,” according to the White House.The Israeli and Palestinian delegations met for the second time in less than a month, shepherded by regional allies Egypt and Jordan, as well as the United States, to end a yearlong spasm of violence.More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and more than 40 Israelis or foreigners have been killed in Palestinian attacks during that time. These include pledges to stop unilateral actions, it said. Israel pledged to stop discussion of new settlement construction for four months, and to stop plans to legalize unauthorized settlement outposts for six months.“The two sides agreed to establish a mechanism to curb and counter violence, incitement and inflammatory states and actions,” the communique said. The sides would report on progress at a follow-up meeting in Egypt next month, it added.The Biden administration remains concerned about a repeat of the nightly clashes and other violent incidents between Palestinians and Israelis in Jerusalem during Ramadan two years ago. Clashes at the Temple Mount in 2021 helped trigger an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip.Under longstanding arrangements, Jews are allowed to visit the site but not pray there. But in recent years, the number of visitors has grown, with some quietly praying. Such scenes have raised fears among Palestinians that Israel is trying to alter the status quo.___Madhani reported from Washington.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840614,Altuve could be out for a while; Nimmo has hopes for opener,"The Houston Astros will be without 2017 AL MVP Jose Altuve for “a while” with a broken right thumb after he was hit by a pitch playing for Venezuela during World Baseball Classic.The eight-time All-Star follows Mets All-Star closer Edwin Díaz to the injured list because of injuries during the WBC. Utilityman Mauricio Dubon, who batted .208 games last season, is expected to move into the Astros’ lineup to replace Altuve at second base.“It appears it could be a while,” Astros manager Dusty Baker told reporters Sunday at spring training in West Palm Beach, Florida, where Altuve returned to have the thumb looked at.CLEANING UP FOR JAPANMasataka Yoshida’s performance while batting fourth for Japan in the World Baseball Classic may have earned him the cleanup spot in the Red Sox lineup.Red Sox manager Alex Cora said before the game against the Phillies in Clearwater, Florida, on Sunday that he is zeroing in on plans for the heart of his lineup with Xander Bogaerts and J.D. Martinez gone.Yoshida is batting .400 with one homer and 10 RBIs for Japan, which will face Mexico in the semifinals on Monday night. He only appeared in two games for Boston this spring before heading to the WBC.Cora said he is planning to bat Rafael Devers second and Justin Turner third.The Red Sox are also looking for left-handed options for the bullpen to replace Joely Rodríguez, who is expected to start the season on the 15-day injured list because of an apparent injury to a muscle on his right side.Cora said the best internal options are Ryan Sherriff, who has a 3.65 ERA in 44 innings over four seasons, and Oddanier Mosqueda, who was 5-3 with a 4.30 ERA in Double-A last year.GOOD NEWS FOR METSMets outfielder DJ Stewart talked himself into another at-bat against the Cardinals on Sunday after bench coach Eric Chavez tried to tell him he was coming out after three hits in his first three plate appearances.Stewart came up again in the seventh inning and hit a home run, completing the cycle.“I was supposed to be done,” he said during a dugout interview on the Mets broadcast. “I wanted that last one for sure.”Stewart tripled in the first, singled in the third and doubled in the fifth before hitting a two-run homer in the seventh. Official cycle records for spring training are hard to come by, but Stewart said it was the first time he had ever accomplished the feat at any level.The Mets got more good news on Sunday when leadoff hitter Brandon Nimmo said he hoped to be ready for opening day. With closer Edwin Díaz already out — likely for the season — with a right knee injury, Nimmo gave the team another scare on Friday when he slid awkwardly while trying to break up a double play at second base.He stayed down for a few moments before limping off the field with medical personnel. But Nimmo said on Sunday that there was no structural damage and he is still hoping to be ready for the March 30 opener against the Marlins.“I was relieved that it wasn’t more serious,” he said. “Just how awkward the play was, catching that cleat, a lot of things could have gone wrong. I’m fortunate we dodged a bullet.”Nimmo batted .274 with a .367 on-base percentage and 102 runs scored last season.PROFFER TO PROFARThe Colorado Rockies have agreed to terms on a one-year deal with free-agent outfielder Jurickson Profar, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press on Sunday.Profar will get $7.75 million in the deal. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the contract was pending a physical.The former Rangers, Athletics and Padres outfielder batted .231 for the Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic this spring.He hit .243 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs for San Diego last season and opted out of the final year of his three-year, $21 million contract with the Padres.___AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

Denver shot 62.5% in the first half and led comfortably most of the game while playing for the second straight afternoon.“Obviously we were 1-5 in our last six, not playing up to our abilities, so just to get the win is the thing I’m most proud of,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.He was disappointed that the Nuggets let a 20-point lead after three quarters get cut to 100-93 with 3:44 to play. Porter answered with one of his five 3-pointers, and the Nuggets got the lead back up to 14 before the Nets had a couple more late baskets.Mikal Bridges scored 23 points and Nic Claxton had 19 for the Nets, who have lost three straight as they try to hold onto a top-six seed and a guaranteed postseason spot in the Eastern Conference.They pulled out a 122-120 victory in Denver a week earlier, but the Western Conference leaders made sure there would be no repeat.Murray knocked down consecutive 3-pointers to finish a 10-0 run that pushed a three-point lead to 25-12 and his final basket of the first quarter made it 33-21. He was 4 for 4 behind the arc in the period.The Nets had a good burst to trim it to 42-38 in the second, but Jokic followed with two straight baskets, Porter and Murray combined for Denver’s final 12 points and it was 63-48 at the break.“Came out strong, came out aggressively and we did a good job for the most part of holding the lead and just keeping them at bay,” Murray said.The Nets got the deficit down to 12 late in the third quarter before Jokic powered his way to the final eight points of the period, making it 91-71.The lead reached 98-76 before the Nets stormed back with a 17-2 spurt, and they could have gotten even closer before some late missed jumpers.“There were some opportunities. We had good looks to shave the lead a little bit, just didn’t go in for us tonight,” coach Jacque Vaughn said.TIP-INSNuggets: Bruce Brown, who spent the previous two seasons with the Nets, was cheered after a video tribute following the first quarter. ... Zeke Nnaji, who didn't play in the 16 games after spraining his right shoulder, had four points and five rebounds in his first appearance since Feb. 5.Nets: Cameron Johnson scored 14 points but was 1 for 6 behind the arc. ... Seth Curry made four 3-pointers and scored 12 points.TOO MUCH TIME AT HOMEThe Nuggets were spending Sunday night in New York before continuing their road trip in Washington, giving them four nights in the city, which Malone — a New York native — said he hated.“Talk about a death trap,” Malone said.Malone told his players that when he was a Knicks assistant, they would feast on teams who stayed out too late in the city the night before a day game. So with Denver playing back-to-back afternoon games in the city, starting with a loss to the Knicks on Saturday, he hoped the players would save their fun until Sunday night.“But back-to-back matinee games in New York is a cruel and unusual punishment by the league,” he added.UP NEXTNuggets: At Washington on Wednesday.Nets: Host Cleveland on Tuesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

Keyontae Johnson followed with another 3 with 1:23 left to put Kansas State ahead by five.The 5-foot-8 Nowell, a third-team Associated Press All-American, played a fearless floor game while making 7 of 14 shots and 10 of 11 free throws.Oscar Tshiebwe had 25 points and 18 rebounds for sixth-seeded Kentucky (22-12), which shot 55% after halftime and led by eight early in the second half.MICHIGAN STATE 69, MARQUETTE 60COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Tyson Walker scored 23 points and No. 7 seed Michigan State beat second-seeded Marquette, sending coach Tom Izzo’s squad back to the Sweet 16 for the first time in four years.Joey Hauser — a Marquette transfer — had 14 points and A.J.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840630,"Key date set in Sudan government transition, official says","KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) — Sudan’s military leaders and pro-democracy forces vowed to begin establishing a new civilian-led transitional government on April 11, a spokesperson representing both parties said Sunday.Speaking at a news conference broadcasted by Sudan's state-run SUNA news agency, Khalid Omar said a finalized political settlement, first agreed upon last December, would be inked on April 1st. A new transitional constitution would be signed days later, he said.Sudan has been plunged into chaos after a military coup, led by the country's top Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, removed a Western-backed government in October 2021, upending its short-lived transition to democracy. The takeover came more than two years after a popular uprising forced the removal of Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019.‘’We will start forming the institutions of the transitional authorities on the coming April 11th,'' Omar said.Pressure is mounting on Sudan’s various political forces to implement the promises of December’s deals. Several of the country's thorniest political issues, including security sector reform and transitional justice, remain unresolved.An 11-person committee comprised of nine pro-democracy leaders, one from the army and another from the country’s large paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, has been tasked with tying up the final agreement, Omar said.Since December, progress and consensus-building have been slow. Major political players, from former rebel leaders to grassroots pro-democracy networks, remain opposed to the deal despite numerous internationally brokered efforts to draw them in.‘’It was expected that some of the non-signatories to the framework agreement would join this meeting,'' said Omar.A restoration of Sudan's democratic transition would likely see a new wave of cash flood the African country. Since the coup, international aid has dried up and bread and fuel shortages, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, have become routine, plunging Sudan’s already inflation-riddled economy into further turmoil.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840631,"Logano passes Keselowski on last lap, gives Ford Atlanta win","HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) — Joey Logano and Brad Keselowski gave Atlanta and NASCAR a rare clean last-lap battle.For a change there were no late wreck.No overtime.Just a clean finish between hard racers.Logano dominated early and then passed Keselowski on the final lap to win NASCAR's race at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Sunday and end the early season domination of Chevrolet and Hendrick Motorsports.Logano won the pole and led a strong showing of three straight Team Penske drivers in qualifying, but Keselowski looked like the Ford driver to beat late in the race. Keselowski had help from Corey LaJoie, but Logano got a push from Christopher Bell that proved decisive on the final lap.“It was lane versus lane, that’s what it was, inside versus outside,” Logano said, adding it was natural to expect that conflict would inevitably lead to contact.“Yeah, because it happens just about every time,” Logano said of Cup drivers propensity to wreck late in races.Bell finished third in a Toyota and LaJoie finished a career-best fourth in a Chevrolet.“The first win of the season always feels better,” said Logano, the reigning Cup champion, who led 141 of the 260 laps.Logano's win ended a streak of four consecutive victories by Chevrolet to open the NASCAR Cup season, including back-to-back wins by William Byron of Hendrick.Pushed by his Team Penske teammates Ryan Blaney and Austin Cindric, Logano passed Keselowski to regain the lead with 34 laps to go. Keselowski regained the lead to setup the last-lap drama.“The bottom row came with a huge run,” said Keselowski. “I don’t know how and I thought I had it blocked and Joey just kept shaking and his car didn’t stall out. I couldn’t get the push down the back. We were right there. I’m glad a Ford won. It was a heck of a battle.”It was Logano's first win at the track he calls his second home. Logano is from Middletown, Connecticut. He calls NASCAR's facility in Loudon, New Hampshire his home track, but Logano’s family moved to Georgia when he was a child. He competed in Legends races at Atlanta Motor Speedway as a child who dreamed of driving on the big track.“We’ve been so close so many times here and to finally get a win here means so much,” he said.After no cautions during the second stage, the competition — and crashes — picked up late in the race.Kevin Harvick, who won in Atlanta in 2001, 2018 and 2020, was leading late when he lost control while being pushed by Ross Chastain. Replays indicated Chastain's Chevrolet didn't hit Harvick's Ford, but Harvick's spin caused a major crash.“I think he was just so close to me he caught me right in the corner,” Harvick said of Chastain. “The way he came from right to left took the car away from me.”Another wreck involving the leaders followed 20 laps later when Aric Almirola blew a tire, causing a spin that also took out Kyle Larson and Daniel Suarez.Hendrick Motorsports' four drivers had fill-in crew chiefs following the largest combined fine on one team in series history for modifying air-deflecting pieces last weekend at Phoenix Raceway. Hendrick was issued a combined $400,000 in fines along with four-race suspensions for the crew chiefs.ELLIOTT PLANS JULY HOMECOMINGChase Elliott, the Georgia native who won last summer's race at his home track, continues to recover in Colorado from a broken tibia suffered while snowboarding month.Elliott posted regrets on his Twitter account for being unable to participate in Sunday's race: “This is gonna be a tough one today not being in atl for obvious reasons, but I can’t wait to see everyone down there in July!”When Hendrick Motorsports tweeted to Elliott “Not the same without you here,” Elliott replied with hopes he would return “hopefully sooner than later my friends.”NEW, LONGER PIT ROADThe pit road entry has been moved to the start of turn 3 from the previous entry point at turn 4. That makes pit road much longer, about half the length of the 1.54-mile track. The longer pit road was designed to give drivers more time to decelerate instead of having to slow down while still on the track, creating possible wrecks.Blaney was penalized for speeding off pit road in stage 2.HOT-LANTAChilly weather forced fans and drivers to bundle up. The temperature for the start of the race was 45 degrees, with wind adding to the chill. Harvick, wearing a hood, and other drivers complained about the cold weather while standing on the track and waiting for the race to begin.ODDS AND ENDSAtlanta Motor Speedway announced a multi-year contract extension with Quaker State for its July 9 race. Quaker State also will be the primary sponsor for Daniel Suarez's car in Atlanta's summer race as well as in Richmond on April 2. ... Tyler Reddick started 16th and finished fifth after pre-race concerns he was sick and might not be able to compete in his Toyota. Reddick was excused from the pre-race drivers' meeting. John Hunter Nemechek, who finished eighth in Saturday night's Xfinity race, was available to fill in if Reddick couldn't complete the race.UP NEXTThe NASCAR Cup series moves to Austin, Texas and the Circuit of the Americas next Sunday.

I’m not shocked,” Murray said. “(Devin) and Keldon put in a lot of work. Those are two young guys who really want to get better and be better. For me, trying to stay a competitor when we are playing and not more of a fan. But it’s still like a while to see them. And like they said, they are thankful for me showing them the way, always being there for them, whether I was there or where I am at today.”The victory was the largest second-half comeback for San Antonio under Gregg Popovich and tied the second-largest comeback in his 27 seasons as head coach.“A tale of two cities this week,” Popovich said. “The competitiveness and physicality was great. I think they scored 35 (in the second half).

The Spurs held the Hawks to 20 points in the third while outscoring them by 19 in the quarter.“Everybody played big today,” Vassell said. “We just kept the faith that we were going to come back and we did.”San Antonio shot 58% from the field in the second half while outscoring Atlanta 65-35.WELCOME BACKMurray received a warm reception after the team honored their former point guard with a video highlighting his six seasons with the Spurs.“I felt like it was what it should be,” Murray said. “At the end of the day, showed nothing but love, both sides, from myself, the fans, the organization. And for me, I was just excited to be back here in the city, play basketball, try to get a win.”While the trade occurred June 30, 2022, Murray said Sunday’s game was the first time he was able to truly close his chapter with the Spurs.“There were a lot of emotions coming in, but more excited than emotions,” Murray said. “I am not a guy that really cries. I believe it was closure for sure. We played them at home not too long ago, but that is really different coming to San Antonio and actually playing. It was great to see a bunch of people I didn’t see back in Atlanta and also the fans. I am forever thankful and grateful.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840633,"Barcelona rallies to top Madrid, move closer to league title","MADRID (AP) — Closer than ever to the title, Barcelona finished the last Spanish league “clasico” of the season by celebrating on the field at Camp Nou. Real Madrid was left complaining about the refereeing after seeing its chances of retaining the title all but end.Barcelona took a major step toward winning its first league title since 2019 after coming from behind to beat Madrid 2-1 on Sunday, with Franck Kessié scoring in stoppage time to give the Catalan club the home victory and a 12-point lead over second-place Madrid with 12 matches to go.Barcelona’s players huddled and celebrated in front of its jubilant fans after the final whistle.Barcelona was saved by the VAR for the second consecutive game, as Madrid had a potential go-ahead goal by Marco Asensio called back in the 81st minute because of offside. Last week, it edged Athletic Bilbao when an 87th-minute equalizer by Athletic forward Iñaki Williams was disallowed by video review.“We are still not sure that it was an offside,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said about Asensio's goal. “It didn't look to be 100% an offside. We will go back to Madrid with that doubt.”Barcelona coach Xavi disagreed.“It was clearly offside, I'm surprised by Ancelotti's comments,” he said. “It's either offside or it isn't. There is no debate. The result was fair.”Barcelona went into the match still facing criticism over its payments of several millions of dollars over several years to the former vice president of the country’s refereeing committee. Prosecutors have formally accused Barcelona of alleged corruption, fraudulent management and falsification of documentation. Madrid is among the clubs siding against Barcelona in the legal proceedings, as is the Spanish government, the league and the soccer federation. Barcelona has consistently denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest, saying it paid for technical reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games.Madrid needed a win to give itself a realistic chance of catching Barcelona and defending its title.“We’ll keep fighting,” Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said. “But we have to be honest, it’s a four-game advantage. It’s not impossible but its going to be difficult.”Barcelona won eight league titles in 11 seasons through 2019. It finished second to Madrid in 2020, then third — behind Madrid and champion Atletico Madrid — in 2021, and second to Madrid again last season without Lionel Messi. It is seeking its 27th league title, which would leave it eight behind Madrid.Barcelona was in control for much of the match on Sunday, creating most of the significant chances.But the visitors opened the scoring in the ninth minute with a fortunate own-goal by Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo, who redirected the ball into the net with a header after a cross by Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior from the left side of the area.Sergi Roberto equalized after picking up a loose ball inside the area in the 45th, and Kessié netted the winner from the middle of the box after a late breakaway as Madrid made a final push for the victory.Madrid thought it had gone ahead when Asensio found the net from near the penalty spot after a pass by Dani Carvajal, but video review determined the goal couldn't count because of offside in a tight call.It was the second match between the rivals in less than three weeks. Barcelona won 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on March 3 in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals. The return leg at Camp Nou is on April 5.Madrid won the first league “clasico” 3-1 at the Bernabéu.Barcelona was without playmaker Pedri and forward Ousmane Dembélé because of injuries, while Madrid’s only absence was defender David Alaba, also because of an injury.Barcelona players wore the logo of international singer Rosalía instead of Spotify’s brand as part of its strategic agreement with the music streaming service. Rosalía was selected as she celebrates the one-year release of her hit album “Motomami.”OTHER RESULTSTakefusa Kubo scored as Real Sociedad beat last-place Elche 2-0 to end its winless streak and regain sole possession of fourth place.Ander Barrenetxea also scored in the second half for Sociedad, which hadn’t won in six games in all competitions, including four straight in the league. It was coming off elimination against Roma in the Europa League on Thursday.The win gave the Basque Country club a three-point gap over fifth-place Real Betis in the fight for the Champions League places.Playmaker David Silva led Sociedad over Elche, which has won only two of its last 11 league games. It sits 14 points from safety.Betis ended its four-game winless streak in all competitions with Borja Iglesias scoring a second-half goal in a 1-0 victory over midtable Mallorca at home. Betis had been eliminated by Manchester United in the Europa League.Villarreal, another Spanish club that failed to advance in European competition after losing to Anderlecht, rebounded in the Spanish league with a 3-0 win at Osasuna.Villarreal stayed in sixth place, four points behind Betis and seven from Sociedad.Getafe left the relegation zone with a 2-0 home win over Sevilla, which stayed two points from the danger area. Sevilla has won only one of its last five league games, but was the only Spanish team to advance in the Europa League after eliminating Fenerbahce on Thursday.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840634,"Moore delivers surprise, tops Spieth, Schenk at Innisbrook","PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) — Taylor Moore was never really the star attraction Sunday at the Valspar Championship until he had finished hitting all the right shots and posed with the trophy for his first PGA Tour title that sends him to the Masters.Adam Schenk and Jordan Spieth provided enough compelling theater for so much of the day, locked in a battle on the back nine of the Copperhead course at Innisbrook.When it was over, all they shared was misfortune.Moore surged into the mix with a 9-iron to 5 feet for birdie on the 15th hole and a 25-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole, followed by two tough pars for a 4-under 67.That turned out to be a winner when Spieth hit his tee shot into the water on the 16th and Schenk, going for his first PGA Tour victory, hit a drive on the final hole that settled next to a large pine tree. He made bogey and finished one shot behind.Moore, who grew up outside Oklahoma City, was on the practice range anticipating a playoff when he realized he had won at 10-under 274.“I might have been under the radar to some people watching, but I felt like I was in the golf tournament from the time I teed off today and was just excited to control what I could control and get it done,” Moore said.The victory sends him to the Masters in three weeks, a welcome addition to his schedule.Spieth was tied for the lead when he sent his tee shot into the water on the 16th and managed to stay in the game by getting up-and-down from 163 yards to salvage bogey. On the par-3 17th, which yielded only two birdies all day, Spieth hit 4-iron to 6 feet — only to miss the birdie putt.Tommy Fleetwood was part of a three-way tie early on the back nine until he took bogey on the par-5 14th. Spieth didn't realize anyone else was in the mix.“I thought it was me and Adam. I thought it was down to us two,” Spieth said. “I was thinking it was Tommy one back of us with a few holes to go and so I thought we could still kind of control it from the last group. Then I saw 10 (under) was posted walking off 16 green.”The real heartbreak belonged to Schenk, whose wife flew down to Florida for the final round a month before she is due with their first child. Schenk holed a 70-foot birdie putt on the 12th hole. He made tough par saves on the 16th and 17th holes to stay tied.On the 18th, however, he pulled his tee shot to the left. It was roughly the same line as Moore had hit his tee shot earlier, only Schenk's ball rolled through the gallery and stopped next to a pine tree.“Wish I could have lightly hit somebody and stayed where I had a chance to get to the green, but it did not, and I didn’t deserve it,” Schenk said.His only shot was hitting an inverted gap wedge left-handed, and it was a dandy, shooting across the fairway into the rough. His third shot came up just short of a ridge and rolled onto the fringe 40 feet away. The par putt to force a playoff hit the hole, but had too much pace and hopped out.Schenk, playing for the 10th consecutive week so he can take time off when his son is born, closed with a 70.“It stinks to get so close,"" he said.Spieth missed a par putt on the 18th that was worth FedEx Cup points and money, signed for a 70 and tied for third with Fleetwood.No one was paying all that much attention to Moore until the 29-year-old who played at Arkansas started hitting one quality shot after another. He stuffed his approach to 2 feet on No. 12 for a birdie. He effectively won the tournament with a great swing with a 9-iron on the 15th and his big putt on the next hole.Moore got up-and-down for par with a long bunker shot on the 17th, and he two-putted from about 70 feet just off the green at the 18th.The victory for Moore was worth $1,458,000 and moved him to No. 9 in the FedEx Cup standings. Along with the Masters, he gets in the PGA Championship. He moved from No. 103 to just inside the top 50 in the world.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

(AP) — Carlos Alcaraz defeated Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 6-2 on Sunday to win the BNP Paribas Open title and regain the world's No. 1 ranking.The 19-year-old Spaniard will move from second to first in the ATP Tour rankings on Monday, displacing Novak Djokovic. The Serb withdrew from Indian Wells before the tournament began when he couldn't gain entry to the U.S. because he's unvaccinated for COVID-19.“For me, it’s a dream come true again,” Alcaraz said. “Obviously being in front of such great players like Novak, it’s an amazing feeling.”""I would say this has been the perfect tournament,” he said.In the women's final, Elena Rybakina beat Aryna Sabalenka 7-6 (11), 6-4 and handed the world’s second-ranked player just her second loss this year.Last year, Alcaraz became the youngest man to reach No. 1 in ATP history after his title at the U.S. Open.He achieved another mark in the third round at Indian Wells. That's when Alcaraz notched his 100th career match victory, the second-quickest player behind John McEnroe to do so.Alcaraz also became the first man to win the tournament without dropping a set since Roger Federer in 2017 and the youngest man to win the title in the desert.“I really trust in every shot that I hit,” he said. “If I miss, I don’t mind.”Alcaraz hit 19 winners and had 10 unforced errors while keeping Medvedev off-balance with a steady array of serve-and-volley and drop shots. The teenager never faced a break point while opening leads of 3-0 in the first set and 4-0 in the second.“What I improve a lot is to don’t take the pressure, just to play relaxed,” Alcaraz said. “That’s why I show a great level, because I feel like I have no pressure. I enjoy. I’m playing relaxed.”Medvedev's 19-match winning streak ended. It went back to his title run in Rotterdam in February. He then won tournaments in Doha and Dubai.“I want to congratulate you for the work you have done in the last few months,” Alcaraz told his opponent. ""Winning three titles in a row and reaching the finals here is an amazing achievement.”Alcaraz and Rybakina earned $1,262,220 each for their wins.Rybakina carried the momentum from her straight-set semifinal upset of top-ranked Iga Swiatek into the final and beat Sabalenka for the first time in five career meetings.For the first time in their budding rivalry, the match didn't go three sets. Sabalenka went the distance to beat Rybakina in the Australian Open final in January. In that match, Sabalenka fired 17 aces and rallied from a set down to win her first Grand Slam title.This time, the 10th-seeded Rybakina had seven aces and No. 2 seed Sabalenka committed 10 double faults. Sabalenka won just 11 of 35 second-serve points.“I would say that I was super disappointed with my serve, so I was back to old habits,” she said. “I was like a little bit overreacting on things, and I wasn’t there in the first two games in the second set.”Rybakina broke for leads of 2-0 and 5-2 in the second set before Sabalenka closed to 5-4. But Rybakina served out the victory in just over two hours.“This tiebreak was really epic, I would say, with all these double faults and nerves,” Rybakina said. “In the end, it was just focusing on every point and try to fight till the end.”Rybakina improved her match record to 16-4 this year; Sabalenka fell to 17-2.“This tough loss will motivate me more because I don’t like to lose in the finals,” Sabalenka said. “This is the worst.”During the victory ceremony, Rybakina, the current Wimbledon champion, told the crowd it was the first time she'd beaten Sabalenka.Sabalenka stepped forward, took the mic and said, “I will make sure it was the last one.”Then she smiled.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,136,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840637,CAR: Several killed in attack on Chinese mine,"Gunmen stormed a Chinese-operated gold mine in the Central African Republic on Sunday, killing nine Chinese nationals, authorities said.""We have counted nine bodies and two wounded,"" the mayor of the nearby town of Bambari, Abel Matchipata, told Agence France-Presse.He said the victims were Chinese workers at a site run by the Gold Coast Group.The assault on the Chimbolo gold mine began around 5 a.m. local time (0400 GMT) when the gunmen overpowered the site's guards and opened fire, said Matchipata.The mining site's launch had taken place just days earlier, he added.The attack came just days after gunmen kidnapped three Chinese nationals in the country's west near the border with Cameroon.The abductions prompted CAR President Faustin Archange Touadera to plan a trip to China in a bid to reassure investors.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's attack.But suspicion fell on the Coalition of Patriots for Change, or CPC, which is active in the area and regularly launches attacks on the country's armed forces.The alliance of rebel groups is aligned with former President Francois Bozize, who was ousted by Muslim-dominated armed groups in 2013.Anselme Bangue, who supports the current president's administration, called the attack on Chinese businessmen an act of ""indescribable cowardice.""""The CPC has not only slowed down the country's economic momentum but is now attacking the foundation of development. This is unacceptable,"" Bangue said.However, CPC military spokesman Mamadou Koura said those allegations were false.He claimed, without providing evidence, that Russian mercenaries had planned the attack ""with the goal of scaring Chinese who have been present long before the Russians settled in this part of the country.""The shadowy Russian mercenary group was hired by Touadera to provide security and military training but has been accused by United Nations observers of committing human rights abuses including massacres.Despite its vast mineral wealth of gold and diamonds, the Central African Republic remains one of the poorest countries in the world.Dozens of rebel groups have operated with impunity over the past decade, thwarting mining exploration by foreign companies.Many of the mines now operating in the country are Chinese-run and have faced security challenges.In 2020, two Chinese nationals died when local residents led an uprising against a Chinese-operated mine in Sosso Nakombo.And in 2018, three Chinese citizens were killed by angry community members after a local leader died in a boating accident while accompanying Chinese miners to a site.mm/jsi (AFP, AP)",2023/3/19,206,

He was standing on the sideline opposite the Huskies' bench when he grabbed his lower back and slowly went down to the court at MVP Arena.Saint Mary's trainers attended to him and he gingerly walked off the court with people supporting him. He went directly to the locker room and returned to the Gaels' bench in the second half but it was clear he was unable to play. He could not stand up straight and gingerly lowered himself when sitting.“His back just kind of slipped out of place,” Saint Mary's coach Randy Bennett said. ""It’s not the first time it’s happened. He’d done well all season, and he was really starting to play his best basketball. It’s just one of those deals. He didn’t get hit or anything. He just — I don’t know.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840639,"Cuban baseball team draws ire, support in Little Havana","MIAMI (AP) — Jose Vilela fled Cuba for the United States when he was 14 years old after spending six months in a concentration camp. Like many of his compatriots, he settled in Miami's Cuban neighborhood, Little Havana.Vilela, now 68, paced Sunday afternoon outside loanDepot Park, the Miami Marlins' home stadium, where the Cuban national baseball team later lost to the United States 14-2 in the World Baseball Classic semifinals.For prideful expats eager to separate sports from politics, the country's first ever baseball game in Miami was cause for celebration.But for Vilela and hundreds of others, it was reason to protest the political oppression they escaped.Vilela stalked the stadium Sunday, yelling outside for anyone associated with the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who embraced Soviet-style communism, to leave the community. That included many Cuban players who are technically government employees.“We don’t want them here,"" Vilela said. ""None. People that work for the Castro family. We don’t want them. They can go any place they want. Go to New York. Go to California. Not Miami. I hope this is the last time they come here.”Three protestors were escorted out of the ballpark after running onto the field during the game.In the sixth inning, a demonstrator waved a flag that said “Libertad Para Los Presos Cubanos Del 11 de Julio, which means “Freedom for the Cuban Prisoners of July 11” — referring to the day thousands of Cubans took to the streets in the island in 2021 to protest shortages of goods, power blackouts and economic hardship. Hundreds of people who participated are in prison. Saturday, the crowd erupted in “¡Libertad!” chants as that protestor exited the field.All day, there had been a heavier police presence outside the ballpark than for previous games in the tournament. About 15 Miami police officers rode around on bicycles.Yosvel Gonzalez was born in Cuba and wore an orange and teal jersey of the late Cuban-born Marlins pitcher José Fernández, who died in a boating accident in 2016. Gonzalez said he expected the environment during the game to be tense, but he’s rooting for Team Cuba.“I love this country because they gave me freedom and political asylum when I got here,"" he said of the United States. ""But my land is my land. I don’t care which government is in power.”Fan reactions during the game were mixed. Some yelled “¡Libertad!” throughout. Some cheered when the Cuban baseball team scored in the first and fifth innings. “USA” chants broke out often.Players and managers have tried to keep the focus on the sport itself.“We’re just here for baseball, for the sport,” Cuba manager Armando Johnson said after the game, adding that the team did not pay attention to the demonstrators. “That’s what I do ... I’m not a police officer.”When asked if he as a Cuban is bothered that many Cubans don't identify with the team, Johnson reiterated that he was focused on his job.“It feels bad, but I don’t judge,” he said. “Like I said, everyone has his or her way of thinking. We are on the field and we come here just to play baseball and the sport. That’s what we wanted to do here.”There are reminders throughout the community in Little Havana of Cuba's government.Bull Bar, a shuttered spot in walking distance from the ballpark, was once a popular bar during Miami Hurricanes football games. It has a large poster on its wall that says “Freedom for Cuba” with a picture of a boot stomping on the island. Vendors were on street corners near the bar as early as 10 a.m. Sunday to sell apparel for both Team USA and Team Cuba.Many shirts displayed the words “Patria y Vida,” meaning “homeland and life,"" in opposition of Castro's rallying cry “homeland or death.”“Their claim is that we’re all Cuban, and that’s not true,"" said Marilyn Almaguer, who fled the island in 1996 as sympathizers of the government threw eggs and rocks at her. ""With that government there, we cannot be all Cubans.”While soccer is largely the most popular sport in Latin America, baseball dominates in Cuba.The island has a rich pool of baseball talent and history of success in the sport. Cuba's baseball team won Olympic gold medals in 1992, 1996 and 2004, but mass defections by players have limited the islands’ ability to remain competitive on the international stage. The Cuban baseball team failed to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.High-performing athletes on the island earn a salary from the government to train and compete, but Cuba has prohibited professional sports in the island since the Cuban revolution 60 years ago.Longtime sanctions by the U.S. make it largely impossible for Cubans to play professionally for an American team without defecting. Meanwhile, Cuba historically has not allowed Cuban players who defected on their national team rosters.The United States for the first time is letting Cuban-born MLB stars play for their homeland in the WBC, making this a rare mixed roster of current Cuban players and defectors. Chicago White Sox third baseman Yoán Moncada and White Sox center fielder Luis Roberts were met with some boos during pregame player introductions.“The biggest lack of respect to this country that has opened up its doors for us,” Almaguer said of the MLB players. ""They claim to be fleeing a dictatorship, and this country gave them an opportunity. Gave them everything, and now they want to play for the same team that suppressed them. They’re laughing at the United States by doing that.”Not all Cuban-born MLB players chose to take advantage of the change of policy.Randy Arozarena, outfielder for the Tampa Bay Rays, was born and raised in Cuba but chose to represent Mexico, where he lived in his early 20s, in the tournament.“To me, Mexico is special,” Arozarena said, “since when I left Cuba, Mexico is a country that received me with arms open.”Alfredo Despaigne, Team Cuba’s captain, said having fans cheering against the team won’t be a bother.“That’s natural in baseball,” he said. “ It doesn’t affect us. I played for nine years in Japan and we had fans supporting our team and others supporting other teams. So everyone is free to feel and to think whatever they want. It won’t affect us.”Ramon Saul Sanchez, an organizer of Sunday's protests, said he is not against the Cuban baseball players. Sanchez, 68, has been separated from his family since moving to the Little Havana area 55 years ago.“We all want to support the Cuban baseball team,"" Sanchez said. ""Right now, it's more complex because it's also playing the U.S. baseball team as well. And we have our heart divided between the two countries. But there is the most important issue here that we know that behind this game is not simple sports, but a lot of politics.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

(AP) — A skier was killed in an avalanche on Sunday outside a Colorado ski resort boundary, just a day after authorities recovered the body of another avalanche victim, authorities said.Three skiers were caught in Sunday's large avalanche in the Maroon bowl area outside of the Aspen Highlands resort near Aspen, the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office said.Two of the skiers managed to escape. Further details about the victim were not immediately available.On Saturday, Colorado authorities recovered the body of skier Joel Shute, 36, of Glenwood Springs, after he and two others were caught in a large backcountry avalanche southwest of Marble in western Colorado.Shute had been missing since Friday evening, when the avalanche swept 2,400 feet (730 meters) down a mountainside as the were backcountry touring.The avalanche was two to three feet (up to nearly 1 meter) deep where it began and up to 500 feet (150 meters) wide, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center said. Rescue teams found the victim's body buried in avalanche debris, the center said.A skier and snowboarder who were with Shute survived. The snowboarder hiked out to get help and rescue teams evacuated the injured skier by helicopter. Both were taken to the hospital, the Gunnison County Sheriff’s office said.Recent storms have raised avalanche risks.Nineteen people have been killed across the U.S. by avalanches so far this winter, including nine fatalities in Colorado. Avalanches in the winter of 2020-2021 killed 37 people nationwide, which was the most recorded by the avalanche center in records going back to 1950.Members of Shute’s family said he was aware of avalanche dangers but was devoted to skiing. The victim’s mother, Lisa Gerstner, said he spent lots of time traveling and used his pilot’s license to fly his father and friends for work trips and recreation.“Skiing was Joel’s life,” brother Aaron Shute told KDVR-TV. “It was his passion and what he wanted to do with his life,",2023/3/20,,World

Oklahoma City has missed the playoffs the past two years, but a postseason slot is within reach. The players said the crowd at the Paycom Center shared their sense of urgency.“We had a home-court advantage for sure,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “They were energetic. They were their usual selves. It was a big game tonight, and it felt like it.”Gilgeous-Alexander made 12 of 24 field goals and 16 of 19 free throws. He made all 11 of his free throws in the second half after not shooting any in the second quarter.“I just thought he didn’t have his normal jugular-type mentality on his drives (in the second quarter),"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""And he got back to that in the second half and really put pressure on them. That gets the fouls going.”Luguentz Dort added 20 points for the Thunder, who trailed by 15 in the first half.“The key to that type of win is just staying alive long enough for when the game turns,” Daigneault said.Devin Booker scored 46 points and Chris Paul added 14 points and 13 assists for the Suns.Phoenix led 69-57 at halftime behind 16 points from Booker. The Suns shot 52.2% from the field before the break. Gilgeous-Alexander had 21 points in the first half to keep the Thunder in it.Gilgeous-Alexander stole the ball in the closing seconds of the third quarter and scored a layup while being fouled with 0.4 seconds remaining. He made the free throw to cut Phoenix's lead to 96-90 at the end of the period.“The tough turnover at the end of the third ... it turned into an and-one, and the momentum just shifted,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said.

(AP) — Faith Masonius scored more than usual at a time when Maryland was struggling.She also gave a star teammate a pep talk that was apparently pretty effective.""I was just missing layups, and even Faith was like, 'Come on Diamond, you’ve got to make that,'” said Diamond Miller, the Terrapins' second-team All-American. “It was just like, ‘I do got to make that.’”Miller made all six of her field goal attempts in the third, scoring 13 of her 24 points that quarter to help second-seeded Maryland to a 77-64 victory over seventh-seeded Arizona in the second around of the women's NCAA Tournament on Sunday night.The Terrapins (27-6) advance to the Sweet 16 for a third straight year and the 11th time under coach Brenda Frese. Maryland trailed by a point after two quarters but ran past the Wildcats (22-10) in the second half.Shyanne Sellers scored 15 points and Masonius gave the Terps a lift with 12.Frese was coaching against her alma mater. She played at Arizona and graduated in 1993.The Wildcats gave Maryland a tough battle for 20 minutes but couldn't keep up offensively. Arizona was up 33-32 at the break but went almost half the third quarter without scoring. After being held to four points in the first half, Miller had five on one trip down the court — a layup while being fouled, followed by a 3-pointer after Arizona was unable to rebound her missed free throw. That put Maryland ahead 39-33.“Looked like she was probably challenged at halftime and she came out and just was on fire,” Arizona coach Adia Barnes said. “Really hard for us to guard. I think that we kind of allowed her to get out in transition and had a lot of isolation moments. We know she loves to go left and she started going right and scored. She was hard to stop.”By the time the quarter was over it was 61-42. The Terrapins shot 11 of 14 from the field in the third.Maryland advances to face third-seeded Notre Dame in the regional semifinals Saturday. The Terps beat the Irish 74-72 at Notre Dame on Dec. 1 on a buzzer-beater by Miller.Cate Reese led Arizona with 19 points.“I think we got a little maybe too comfortable, I don’t know,” Reese said. “We just in that moment starting out in the third quarter, we just didn’t want it more and they took it to us and we just kind of fell back on our heels I feel like.”BIG PICTUREArizona: The Wildcats exited in the second round for a second straight season after reaching the national title game in 2021.Maryland: The 6-foot-1 Masonius gave Maryland an encouraging performance, finishing two points shy of her season high. Her ability around the basket could be important for a team without a great deal of size.“Faith just emptied the tank and you saw that with the defensive effort she had to put on Reese, the toughness that displayed and then all of the sudden, at times we’re running her in the press break to bring the ball up to run our offense,” Frese said. “You saw she was exhausted. Like that’s what it looks like when you empty the tank and leave it all out there and why she is the winner that she is.”BRIGHT SPOTSArizona had one fewer turnover (18) than Maryland, and the Wildcats finished with a 22-18 edge in fast break points. Not an easy task against the Terps' pressure.FOUL TROUBLESellers was limited to 11:34 in the first half, having picked up two fouls.“I was really itching to get back on the floor,” Sellers said. “Every time B walked past, I’m going, ‘I won’t foul.'""UP NEXTMiller scored 31 points in that December game against Notre Dame.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840643,Michigan State outlasts Marquette; Izzo back to Sweet 16,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Tom Izzo leaned on star guard and native New Yorker Tyson Walker to get Michigan State to Madison Square Garden for the Sweet 16.Walker, a fourth-year player who grew up in Westbury on Long Island, delivered against Marquette in March Madness on Sunday night, scoring 23 points and punctuating Michigan State's 69-60 victory with a steal and his first ever collegiate dunk late in the game.And Walker wants to make sure his 68-year-old, Hall of Fame coach has a quintessential Big Apple experience.“It means everything,"" said Walker, who played two years at Northeastern before transferring to Michigan State. ""Just growing up, seeing everything, playing at the Garden. Just to make those shots, look over see my dad, see how excited he was. That means everything. And I just owe Coach some pizza now. And a cab ride.”Joey Hauser — a Marquette transfer — had 14 points and A.J. Hoggard had 13 as seventh-seeded Michigan State (21-12) took over in the last three minutes. The Spartans advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first time in four years and will play third-seeded Kansas State in the East Region semifinals on Thursday.“I’ve been in Elite Eight games; I’ve been in the Final Four — that was as intense and tough a game as I’ve been in my career,” Izzo said. “And a lot of credit goes to Marquette and (coach) Shaka (Smart) and how they played, too.”Izzo reached his 15th regional semifinal and won his record 16th March Madness game with a lower-seeded team — one more than Syracuse's Jim Boeheim, who retired after this season.This one was particularly meaningful. Izzo became the face of a grieving school where three students were killed in a campus shooting on Feb. 13.“It's been a long year,” an emotional Izzo said in a courtside interview. “I'm just happy for our guys.”Olivier-Maxence Prosper led second-seeded Marquette (29-7) with 16 points and Kam Jones had 14 points, including three 3-pointers, for the Big East champions.Michigan State led by as many as 12 in the first half, but Ben Gold and Prosper made back-to-back 3-pointers to help the Golden Eagles close within 33-28 at halftime.Prosper hit two more 3s in the first minute of the second half to give Marquette its first lead of the day. Michigan State grabbed back the lead with an 8-0 run and didn’t relinquish it.Back-to-back baskets in the paint by Hoggard and then Walker, both times as the shot clock expired, gave the Spartans a 60-55 lead with 2:20 left. Mady Sissoko then blocked shots on consecutive Marquette possessions, and Walker had a steal followed by a game-sealing dunk with 39 seconds left.Marquette's nine-game winning streak ended, concluding a season in which the Golden Eagles exceeded expectations under coach Smart, who has referred to Izzo as a mentor.Michigan State, meanwhile, finished fourth in the Big Ten but appears to be improving at the right time.“We’ve still got some dancing to do,"" Izzo said. ""And we’re going to New York. I couldn’t be more excited for Tyson and even A.J., being a Philly guy.“After watching the tournament, it doesn’t matter who we play, when we play, where we play, or how, it’s going to be a hell of a game. And I’m looking forward to it.”BIG PICTUREMarquette: Coming off their first Big East Tournament title, the Golden Eagles dominated Vermont in the first round of March Madness, but Michigan State was a much tougher opponent. The Golden Eagles committed 11 of their 16 turnovers in the second half, and those giveaways led to 19 Spartans points.“I thought (Michigan State) played with great aggressiveness, particularly early in the game and at the very end of the game,” Smart said. “And those two the stretches were the difference in the outcome of the game.”Michigan State: The Spartans came out of their shooting funk after the halfway point of the second half and pulled away. They made 15 of their 17 free throws after halftime.KOLEK HURTINGTyler Kolek, the Big East Player of the Year, injured his thumb when he caught it on the jersey of a Vermont player in the opening round Friday night.He finished that game with eight points. He wasn't much of a factor against Michigan State, either, scoring seven points, losing six turnovers and committing four fouls.Kolek insisted the thumb “wasn’t an issue at all.”“Just trying to be out there for my team and command the game. And I didn’t do that today,” he said.UP NEXTMichigan State's next opponent, Kansas State, is making its first Sweet 16 appearance since 2018 and first under coach Jerome Tang.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840644,North Korea: Latest missile simulated nuclear counterattack,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday it simulated a nuclear attack on South Korea with a ballistic missile launch over the weekend that was its fifth missile demonstration this month to protest the largest joint military exercises in years between the U.S. and South Korea.The North’s leader Kim Jong Un instructed his military to hold more drills to sharpen the war readiness of his nuclear forces in the face of “aggression” by his enemies, state media reported.The South Korean and Japanese militaries detected the short-range missile being launched Sunday into waters off the North's eastern coast, which reportedly came less than an hour before the U.S. flew long-range B-1B bombers for training with South Korean warplanes. The North characterizes the U.S.-South Korea exercises as a rehearsal to invade, though the allies insist they are defensive in nature. Some experts say the North uses the exercises as a pretext to advance its weapons programs.Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said the missile, which flew about 800 kilometers (500 miles), was tipped with a mock nuclear warhead. It described the test as successful, saying that the device detonated as intended 800 meters (yards) above water at a spot that simulated an unspecified “major enemy target,” supposedly reaffirming the reliability of the weapon’s nuclear explosion control devices and warhead detonators.The report said the launch was the final step of a two-day drill that also involved nuclear command and control exercises and training military units to switch more quickly into nuclear counterattack posture, properly handle nuclear weapons systems and execute attack plans.The exercise was also a “stronger warning” to the United States and South Korea, who are “undisguised in their explicit attempt to unleash a war” against the North, KCNA said.Photos published by state media showed Kim walking through a forest with his daughter and senior military officials and a missile the North described as a tactical nuclear weapon system soaring from the woods spewing flames and smoke.Saying that his enemies are getting “ever more pronounced in their moves for aggression,” Kim laid out unspecified “strategic tasks” for further developing his nuclear forces and improving their war readiness, KCNA said. This indicated that the North could up the ante in its weapons demonstrations in coming weeks or months.Jeon Ha Gyu, spokesperson of South Korea’s Defense Ministry, said it’s clear North Korea with its ramped-up testing activity is making “considerable progress” in nuclear weapons technology. He did not provide a specific assessment about the North’s claim about the successful warhead detonation.North Korean photos indicated the latest launch was of a solid-fuel missile apparently modeled after Russia’s Iskander mobile ballistic system that the North has been testing since 2019. The missiles are built to travel at low altitudes and be maneuverable in flight, which theoretically improve their chances of evading South Korean missile defenses.While these missiles have been mostly fired from wheeled vehicles, North Korea has also tested them or their variants from railcars, a submarine and a platform inside a reservoir. Photos of the latest test suggested the missile was possibly fired from a silo dug into the ground, highlighting the North’s efforts to diversify its launch options and make it harder for opponents to identify and counter them.South Korea’s military said the launch took place at a mountainous northwestern region near Tongchangri, which hosts a site where the North conducted long-range rocket and satellite launches in previous years.North Korea likely has dozens of nuclear warheads, but there are differing assessments on how far the North has advanced in miniaturizing and engineering those weapons so that they could fit on the newer weapons it tested in recent years.While the North after six nuclear tests may be able to place simple nuclear warheads on some of its older systems, like Scuds or Rodong missiles, it will likely require further technology upgrades and nuclear tests to build warheads that can be installed on its more advanced tactical systems, according to Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute.Sunday’s short-range launch was the North’s fifth missile event this month and the third since the U.S. and South Korean militaries began joint exercises on March 13. The allies' drills, which are to continue through Thursday, include computer simulations and their biggest springtime field exercise since 2018.The North so far in 2023 has fired around 20 missiles over nine different launch events. They included short-range missiles fired from land, cruise missiles launched from a submarine, and two different intercontinental ballistic missiles fired an airport near Pyongyang as it tries to demonstrate a dual ability to conduct nuclear attacks on South Korea and the U.S. mainland.The latest ICBM test last Thursday preceded a summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who agreed to resume security dialogues and take other steps to improve their oft-strained relations in the face of North Korean threats.North Korea already is coming off a record year in testing activity, with more than 70 missiles fired in 2022, as Kim accelerates his weapons development aimed at forcing the United States to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power and negotiating badly needed sanctions relief from a position of strength.In response to the most recent ICBM launch, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency open meeting Monday morning at the request of the United States, United Kingdom, Albania, Ecuador, France and Malta. Security Council resolutions have long banned North Korean ballistic missile activity, but permanent council members Russia and China have thwarted punishment or further sanctions in recent years.The U.N. Security Council held an informal meeting Friday at which the U.S., its allies and human rights experts shone a spotlight on what they described as the dire rights situation in North Korea. China and Russia denounced the meeting as a politicized move.North Korea’s U.N. Mission called the meeting about “our non-existent 'human rights issue’” unlawful. It also said the U.S. held Friday’s meeting “while staging the aggressive joint military exercise which poses a grave threat to our national security.”___Associated Press writer Edith M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840662,Global central banks open daily dollar taps to help banks,"FRANKFURT/WASHINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - Top central banks, faced with the risk of a fast-moving loss of confidence in the stability of the financial system, moved on Sunday to bolster the flow of cash around the world.
In coordination with central banks elsewhere, the U.S. Federal Reserve offered daily currency swaps to ensure banks in Canada, Britain, Japan, Switzerland and the euro zone would have the dollars needed to operate.
The change announced Sunday is a modest expansion of an existing program in which the Fed each week pays dollars to other major central banks in exchange for local currency. By doing so, the Fed, in effect offers low-risk short-term loans that ensure the world's major economies have adequate supply of the global reserve currency to meet local demands.
But the coordinated action on Sunday still struck a symbolic chord, echoing steps taken to offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It was perhaps even more analogous to efforts undergird the system after the U.S. housing market collapsed and stoked a global financial crisis and U.S. recession from 2007 to 2009.
The daily swaps, beginning Monday and extending until at least the end of April, will ""serve as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses,"" the Fed said in a statement.
The central bank swap lines have shown little sign of crisis so far, with foreign central banks holding outstanding swaps with the Fed for only $472 million as of March 15, versus $446 billion at the beginning of the pandemic and a peak of $583 billion in 2008.
But trouble among U.S. midsized lenders as well as the announcement Sunday of an emergency rescue of Swiss giant Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) have raised concerns about a looming and possibly contractionary credit crunch. Such a crisis could arise if the public lost faith in banks or banks lost faith in each other and started to limit their exposure to new loans.
The trouble at Credit Suisse in particular - one of the world's largest financial institutions - sent shock waves through global markets last week, raising fears of a new financial crisis and threatening to derail central bankers' efforts to tackle high inflation.
Credit Suisse found itself in dire need of liquidity last week until it was thrown a lifeline by its own central bank.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840663,Eichel's hat trick leads Golden Knights past Columbus 7-2,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Vegas Golden Knights needed to respond to a five-goal loss just three nights earlier, and Jack Eichel made sure they did it emphatically.Eichel scored three goals Sunday, and the Golden Knights used a four-goal second period take control and beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 7-2.This was Eichel’s fourth career hat trick and second this season. The last one for Eichel, who leads Vegas with 26 goals, was Nov. 10 when he returned to Buffalo to face his former teammates.Phil Kessel and Pavel Dorofeyev each had a goal and an assist, and Paul Cotter and Zach Whitecloud also scored for the Golden Knights, and Alex Pietrangelo had a career-high four assists. Dorofeyev has five points in four games since being called up from the AHL.Jiri Patera, called up March 9, made 35 stops in just his second career start to move to 2-0.“I think one good thing is the contributions throughout the lineup,"" Eichel said. “We’ve had five goalies now play for us, and I think all of them have done a great job. So I think different guys are stepping up and playing well, and that's what you need.”Patera's counterpart, Daniil Tarasov, was pulled with 3:03 left in the second period after giving up five goals on 28 shots, including four goals in a 4:22 span that broke open a 1-1 game. He was replaced by Michael Hutchinson, who was traded by Vegas to Columbus as part of the deal for goalie Jonathan Quick.Kirill Marchenko and Liam Foudy scored the Blue Jackets' goals, and Patrik Laine had two assists.Columbus coach Brad Larsen was not on the bench because of a death in the family, the team announced. Associate coach Pascal Vincent was in charge.“In the second period, we had our chances,” Vincent said. ""They took advantage of their chances, and their goalie was pretty good. That's the difference between a good team and a team in our position right now. We need to be able to sustain that pace for 60 minutes.”The Knights responded to Thursday's 7-2 loss to Calgary by winning for the fifth time in six games and eighth time in the past 10. They lead the Western Conference with 92 points, two more than Pacific Division rival Los Angeles.Columbus has 49 points, the fewest in the NHL, and the Blue Jackets are 1-6-1 in their past eight games.“You can’t lose to a team that’s in the bottom of the standings,"" said Knights forward Reilly Smith, who extended his career-high points streak to eight games with a first-period assist. ""I think we did a good job, especially the tail end of the second period getting pucks in the net. I think we’re pretty fortunate with some of the bounces, but they go a long way when you’re able to push a team down and kind of take away their confidence like that.”KNIGHTS GOALIES NEAR RETURNSPatera is likely to be sent back down to the AHL affiliate in Henderson with two injured goalies joining the Knights on their upcoming road trip. Logan Thompson has been out since Feb. 9 and Laurent Brossoit since Feb. 27, each with a lower-body injury. Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said he will evaluate the goalie situation, which also includes Quick, over the final 12 regular-season games.“We don’t have enough room enough to get everyone what they want,” Cassidy said. “'They’re going to have to be open minded with us knowing that there’s a limited amount of time. I don’t want to say we have to be done by this date. Let’s get in the playoffs first. Once we do that, can see who our projected starter is. I still think we're a little bit away from that.”NOTESShould Vegas play another Eastern Conference team this season, it will be in the Stanley Cup Final. The Knights won a franchise-high 22 games against the East, going 22-8-2. ... This was the Knights' ninth sweep this season, a franchise best. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840664,Moore wins Valspar; Els wins Champs to deny Langer record,"PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) — Taylor Moore delivered the clutch shots to move into contention, closed with a 4-under 67 and won the Valspar Championship on Sunday when he avoided the mistakes that cost Jordan Spieth and Adam Schenk.In only his second year on the PGA Tour, the 29-year-old who grew up outside Oklahoma City is now headed to the Masters next month.Spieth was tied for the lead when he sent his tee shot into the water on the 16th and managed to stay in the game by getting up-and-down from 163 yards to salvage bogey. On the par-3 17th, which yielded only two birdies all day, Spieth hit 4-iron to 6 feet — only to miss the birdie putt.The real heartbreak belonged to Schenk, whose wife flew down to Florida for the final round a month before she is due with their first child. Schenk holed a 70-foot birdie putt on the 12th hole. He made tough par saves on the 16th and 17th holes to stay tied.On the 18th, however, he pulled his tee shot to the left. It was roughly the same line as Moore had hit his tee shot earlier, only Schenk’s ball rolled through the gallery and stopped next to a pine tree.His only shot was hitting an inverted gap wedge left-handed, and it was a dandy, shooting across the fairway into the rough. His third shot came up just short of a ridge and rolled onto the fringe 40 feet away. The par putt to force a playoff hit the hole, but had too much pace and hopped out.Schenk, playing for the 10th consecutive week so he can take time off when his son is born, closed with a 70 and finished one shot behind. Spieth three-putted for bogey on the 18th and tied for third with Tommy Fleetwood (70).LIV GOLFMARANA, Ariz. (AP) — Danny Lee birdied his final two holes for a 2-under 69 and then won LIV Golf Tucson on the second hole of a four-man playoff on Sunday by making a 25-foot birdie putt from off the 18th green for his first win in nearly eight years.It was the second playoff in LIV Golf since the Saudi-funded series began last year. Dustin Johnson won the playoff outside Boston last year.Lee finished at 9-under 275 and got into the playoff with Carlos Ortiz (65), Brendan Steele (70) and Louis Oosthuizen (70). Oosthuizen bogeyed the par-5 17th to fall one behind, only to birdie the 18th to join the playoff.Ortiz was eliminated after the first extra hole when he went long off the 18th green, chipped to 6 feet and missed the par putt.Going back to the 18th hole, Lee's approach from the fairway missed the green to the right, leaving him a tough spot with the pin all the way to the right side of the green.Oosthuizen and Steele both missed long birdie putts. Lee chose to use putter, even though he was some 10 feet off the green. He gave it a rap and it was going fast when it rattled against the pin and disappeared for the winner.Ortiz led the Fireballs to the team victory, winning handily over the 4Aces with Lee’s Ironheads team coming in third.PGA TOUR CHAMPIONSNEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Ernie Els rallied from a five-shot deficit and closed with a 6-under 65 to win the Hoag Classic and deny Bernhard Langer a chance at setting the career victory mark on the PGA Tour Champions.Langer has 45 career wins on the over-50 tour, tied for the most with Hale Irwin. The 65-year-old German began the final round with a one-shot lead and picked up an early birdie. He was still tied for the lead when he made two bogeys on the back nine, and failed to make birdie on the par 5s.Langer finished with a 2-over 73 and tied for seventh, three shots behind. He is in the field next week in Rancho Mirage, California, where he gets another shot at the record.Els won for the first time since October 2020, and the Hall of Famer never had a win quite like this. He had been practicing with the “saw” putting grip at home in Florida last week, but wasn’t sure about whether to try it in a tournament. He changed in the middle of the tournament, and then after missing a few, went back to a cross-handed grip. Either way, he was making enough putts to become a winner again.His biggest challenge after he finished came from Steve Stricker and Doug Barron. Stricker, who leads the Charles Schwab Cup standings, made birdies on the 14th and 15th, but he missed chances coming in and his birdie on the 18th for a 67 left him one behind.Barron also finished one back after finishing with six straight pars for a 70.EUROPEAN TOUR AND SUNSHINE TOURST. FRANCIS BAY, South Africa (AP) — Matthew Baldwin claimed his maiden title on the European tour Sunday by closing with a 4-under 68 for a seven-shot victory at the SDC Championship in South Africa.Baldwin finished at 18-under 270. His first victory came 11 years after he first earned a European tour card. The Englishman had to put his career on hold in 2015 because of illness and lost his card the following year. His comeback to the tour was then delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.Adri Arnaus of Spain had a 67 to finish alone in second at the tournament co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour.Baldwin was tied for the lead overnight with Norway’s Kristian Krogh Johannessen, although both still had five holes to play in their third rounds because of delays caused by high wind.While Baldwin finished off his third round with three more birdies, Johannessen dropped a shot and couldn’t make that up in the final round, where his four birdies were canceled out by four bogeys to finish with a 72 and a tie for third.___OTHER TOURSGabriela Ruffels of Australia closed with a 4-under 68 for a two-shot victory over Kathleen Scavo in the Carlisle Arizona Women's Golf Classic on the Epson Tour. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840665,"Sanogo, UConn pull away from Saint Mary's, into Sweet 16","ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — UConn decided to return to its roots five years ago, hiring a former Big East guard as coach and then a couple years later returning to the conference where it became a national power.Now the Huskies are back in the Sweet 16, looking like the beasts of the Big East again.Adama Sanogo scored 24 points and Jordan Hawkins delivered from the 3-point line in the second half as UConn pulled away from Saint Mary's for a 70-55 win on Sunday that put the Huskies in the Sweet 16 for the first time in nine years.No. 4 seed UConn (27-8) advanced to the West Regional in Las Vegas on Thursday. Next up is eighth-seeded Arkansas, which knocked off No. 1 seed Kansas.For the second straight game, the Huskies buried an opponent after playing a close first half. UConn outscored Iona and Saint Mary's by a combined 86-49 in the second half in Albany this weekend.“Eventually our depth, elite rebounding, top-20 defense, top-five offense, with the depth, I think we’re able to break some teams,” said UConn coach Dan Hurley, a former Seton Hall guard from New Jersey who was hired in 2018.The Huskies last played in the second weekend of the tournament in 2014, when they won the most recent — and most surprising — of four national titles in a 15-year span. The first three of those titles came as a member of the Big East under coach Jim Calhoun, and all went through the West Region.That last championship run came as a member of the American Athletic Conference, the league birthed from the Big East’s football-basketball breakup in 2013.UConn went with the football schools and played seven years in the AAC, where its football program floundered while its vaunted men’s basketball team slipped into irrelevance.With Hurley in charge, it has risen again, taking another step after being one-and-done in the NCAA Tournament the past two years at a place that never lost its lofty standards.“I think in the first and even second round of tournaments, it’s more of a burden to play at UConn than it is an advantage,” Hurley said of the pressure.These Huskies were up to the challenge.Sanogo followed his 29-point game in the Huskies' NCAA tourney opener with another powerful and efficient performance in the paint. The 245-pound junior was 11 for 16 from the floor and grabbed eight rebounds, dominating a big-man matchup with Mitchell Saxen (six points, three rebounds and four fouls).Saint Mary's (27-8) of the West Coast Conference failed to get out of the first weekend of the tournament for the second straight season as a No. 5 seed.Aidan Mahaney and Logan Johnson each scored nine for the Gaels, who played the final 25 minutes without third-leading scorer Alex Ducas. The senior left with a back injury, coach Randy Bennett said.“It’s not all on that. But it did affect our offensive efficiency, and I feel terrible for him,"" Bennett said.UConn used a 14-2 spurt, highlighted by a 3 from Hawkins with 11:28 left in the second half, to go up 51-40.Hawkins had been scoreless to that point, but he added another 3 coming off a screen moments later to make it 56-45, and the “Let's Go Huskies!” chants started to reverberate throughout MVP Arena.“It felt great hitting those shots,” Hawkins said. “Finally found a rhythm.”Hawkins wasn't done, making back-to-back 3s to make it 62-47 with 6:38 left. He finished with 12 points.Meanwhile, the Huskies defense was clamping down on the Gaels, who were held under 60 points for just the fourth time this season.“We started to turn the ball over a little bit more, which led to them hitting some shots in transition, which really opened up the game for them,” Johnson said.BIG PICTURESaint Mary’s: The Gaels, who have become Gonzaga's closest rival in the WCC, have reached the Sweet 16 just once in program history in 2010.“People always say, ‘Hey, get to the next level,'” said Bennett, who is in his 22nd season as Gaels coach. “We’ve been a five seed the last two years, and both years we've run into a really good team. Last year was UCLA.”UConn: The Huskies go nine deep, which allows Hurley to keep his players fresh. Sanogo scored 53 points in 51 minutes in two games, with 7-foot-2 Donovan Clingan providing 25 solid minutes off the bench.“We have so many guys we can go to,” said Andre Jackson, who was playing close to his hometown of Amsterdam.UP NEXTUConn: The Huskies are 3-1 all-time against Arkansas.___March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840666,Experienced Sooners face young Bruins in second round Monday,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Oklahoma and UCLA on paper seems to be the quintessential matchup of experience versus youth. The Sooners have three players with at least 1,500-point career points while the Bruins have five freshmen who play pivotal roles.Sooners coach Jennie Baranczyk isn't falling for that storyline though going into Monday's NCAA Tournament second-round matchup at Pauley Pavilion.“I don’t know if you can actually count UCLA’s freshmen as freshmen, so let’s be real from a standpoint -- I mean, they are so talented,"" Baranczyk said after Sunday's practice. “We are not going into this game saying, ‘We have experience and therefore, we are just going to show up and the experience takes care of itself.’ You’ve got to work, and it’s March and anybody can do anything.”The Sooners (26-6), who advanced with a 85-63 victory over Portland, are led by Madi Williams and Taylor Robertson, who both have over 2,000 points. The pair have scored at least 15 points in the same game 25 times since the start of last season, with Oklahoma going 23-2.Robertson, who is averaging 11.6 points per game, scored 14 points in the win over Portland. She is also the NCAA's career leader in 3-pointers with 537 after going 3 for 3 beyond the arc on Saturday.Williams leads the team in scoring at 15.4 points per game and was an AP All-America honorable mention selection. She needs seven rebounds to become the third player in school history with 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.Those aren't the only two players UCLA will have to worry about. Ana Llanusa (11.7 points per game) and Skylar Vann (11.5) make the Sooners one of seven schools nationally to have four players average at least 11.5 points per game.Oklahoma also comes into the game second in the nation in offense, averaging 84.5 points per game. It has won all 22 games when reaching 80 points.“We talked a lot about defending the first seven seconds of the shot clock because they are just so good. It’s remarkable how quickly they attack in transition and how well they find shooters out,” UCLA coach Cori Close said. “They have got a lot of weapons who know how to stretch the floor, who are versatile. So I’m worried about a lot of things in terms of stopping them.”UCLA's heralded freshman class, which was ranked tops in the country by many recruiting services, has found its stride late in the season.Guard Kiki Rice — who had 15 points in Saturday's 67-45 win over Sacramento State — is averaging 11.8 points this season, but 14.7 in the past six games. Gabriela Jaquez, Londynn Jones and Lina Sontag are also providing quality minutes off the bench.The Bruins though will look to senior Charisma Osborne to help get them to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2019. Osborne leads the team in scoring at 15.3 points per game and is coming off a 11-point, 12-rebound, five-assist game in the first round.“They are very, very crafty. Although Osborne can score at all the different levels and she’s very quick and she’s physical on the inside, she just gets everybody around her better,” Baranczyk said. “They provide so many challenges from a defensive standpoint, and at the same time, I think they do an incredible job on their defense, too.”It will be the first meeting between UCLA and Oklahoma since November 2013. They faced each other in the second round of the tournament in 2013, with the Sooners winning 85-72.The winner will face top-ranked and unbeaten South Carolina on Saturday in a Greenville 1 Regional semifinal.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World

The Heat host the Nets on Saturday.“This is going to be our March Madness and April Madness,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “The opportunity is right in front of us, and that's all you can ask for at this part of the season. We are going to have to fight for it - that's what this is all about.”Herro’s 3-pointer gave the Heat a 101-98 lead with 3:20 left. After he and Jimmy Butler hit jumpers, Herro made another 3-pointer to put Miami up 108-98.“Tyler lives for those moments,” Spoelstra said. “He has the clutch gene - he really does - and we know he will knock down some really tough shots when we need them.”Butler had 26 points and 10 assists and Bam Adebayo added 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Heat, who won for the third time in four games. Miami lost 113-99 in Chicago on Saturday.“We definitely let one slip away yesterday, so we knew we had to get one back today,” Adebayo said. “I've been saying this all season, but we have to build on this - we have to buy into playing this way every night.”James Wiseman led the Pistons with 22 points and 13 rebounds. Killian Hayes put up 13 points and 11 assists. Detroit has lost 14 of its last 15 games.“Our execution wasn't there down the stretch,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “James played a hell of a game, but our transition defense is still tough. We're getting there, but we're not there yet.”Detroit's Jalen Duren and Miami's Kevin Love left the game in the third quarter after banging heads under the basket. Love received four stitches and could have returned, but Duren was being evaluated for a brain injury after feeling “woozy.”Detroit put up a 34-point third quarter, led by 12 points and five rebounds from Wiseman, and took an 81-74 lead on Eugene Omoruyi's buzzer-beating 3-point play.“When I'm not getting touches, I know I have to find other ways to help us win,” Wiseman said. “That means rebounding and defense.”TIP INSHeat: After losing to the Pistons by 20 points at home on Dec. 6, Miami made its first appearance of the season in Detroit. They return on April 4.Pistons: The Little Caesars Arena scoreboard displayed the score backward for the first quarter. When the period ended, the fans cheered after being informed the Pistons were leading 29-26, not Miami.PISTONS STILL TRYING TO GO BIGMarvin Bagley III returned after missing three games with ankle soreness and scored 14 points in 30 minutes. However, he and Duren combined for only four rebounds in 39 minutes as the Pistons continue to work on getting them into two-big lineups with Wiseman.“It's tough for our bigs to get into the habit of matching up on the perimeter,” said Casey, who has said the team needs to dominate the boards when the big lineup is on the floor.HEAT GET BENCH SPARKSKyle Lowry and Caleb Martin combined for 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for Miami's second unit. Lowry was a plus-28 in 25 minutes while Martin was a plus-25 in 31 minutes.“Caleb was really inspiring tonight - he made some shots and he anchored our defense at some key moments,” Spoelstra said. “Kyle just has a huge impact on winning games, because he's so active on both ends of the floor.”UP NEXTHeat: Host the New York Knicks on Wednesday.Pistons: Visit the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/20,,World

Thielen caught 70 passes last season for 716 yards and six touchdowns while paired with All-Pro wide receiver Justin Jefferson.According to a person familiar with the situation, Thielen received a three-year deal. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the terms of the contract have not been released.The Panthers were in need of adding experience in the wide receiver room after trading D.J. Moore to the Chicago Bears as part of a deal that also included giving up two first-round picks and two second-round picks to move up to the No. 1 overall spot in the NFL draft.Thielen, who has been selected to two Pro Bowls, immediately becomes the most experienced wide receiver on the Panthers roster.Last week the Panthers also agreed to terms with running back Miles Sanders, tight end Hayden Hurst and quarterback Andy Dalton, giving the offense experience at the skill positions.The Panthers are expected to use the No. 1 pick on a quarterback.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840678,Asia stocks steady as Credit Suisse buyout brings relief,"SINGAPORE, March 20 (Reuters) - Asian stocks steadied and U.S futures rose on Monday in relief at a weekend rescue deal for Credit Suisse and a concerted effort from central banks to shore up the mood, though trade was tense and volatile as contagion fears stalked financial shares.
S&P 500 futures rose 0.7% in bumpy trade and bonds fell as investors reckoned less immediate fears of financial instability reduced the likelihood of rate cuts later this year.
Beaten-down bank shares bounced 1% in Tokyo (.IBNKS.T), while the broader Nikkei (.N225) fell 0.2%. Financials (.AXFJ) in Australia fell 0.8% and the ASX 200 (.AXJO) fell 0.5%.
In a little over a week, the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank - which has roiled confidence in the banking system - has brought a globally systemic lender to its knees.
Over the weekend, UBS said it will buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion francs ($3.2 billion) and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses, in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities.
Central banks including the Fed, the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan pledged to deepen support for liquidity, by increasing the frequency of seven-day dollar-swap operations from weekly to daily.
""The best we can say was there are certainly a lot of concerns about Credit Suisse contagion risk,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.
""The news overnight from Switzerland has helped,"" he said, though added that the central bank moves had also drawn attention to how deep troubles may run.
""It's the irony of good news reflecting how bad things are. It's great we're seeing this concerted effort from central banks, and it's positive, but it does also highlight how troubling the circumstances are and how worried central banks appear to be as well.""
The Asia day offered an encouraging start, with Japanese yen cross-currency swaps , a measure of non-U.S. investor demand for dollars, shrinking to minus 35 basis points or half their levels last week, in another sign of respite in market funding conditions.
Still, at least two major banks in Europe are examining scenarios of contagion in the region's banking sector and are looking to the Fed and the ECB for stronger signals of support, two senior executives close to the discussions told Reuters.
Concern remains elevated, too, about regional banks in the United States. On Sunday First Republic (FRC.N) had its credit rating pushed deeper into junk status by S&P Global and elsewhere efforts to raise capital are hitting difficulties.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose 9 bps to 3.49% in Asia and 2-year yields rose 13 bps to 3.973%.
Interest rate futures pricing implies about a 60% chance that the Fed hikes rates at its meeting later in the week, but has also priced in several rate cuts by the end of the year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840679,New York Community Bank to buy failed Signature Bank,"NEW YORK (AP) — New York Community Bank has agreed to buy a significant chunk of the failed Signature Bank in a $2.7 billion deal, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said late Sunday.The 40 branches of Signature Bank will become Flagstar Bank, starting Monday. Flagstar is one of New York Community Bank's subsidiaries. The deal will include the purchase of $38.4 billion in Signature Bank's assets, a little more than a third of Signature's total when the bank failed a week ago.The FDIC said $60 billion in Signature Bank's loans will remain in receivership and are expected to be sold off in time.Signature Bank was the second bank to fail in this banking crisis, roughly 48 hours after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Signature, based in New York, was a large commercial lender in the tristate area, but had in recent years gotten into cryptocurrencies as a potential growth business.After Silicon Valley Bank failed, depositors became nervous about Signature Bank's health due to its high amount of uninsured deposits as well as its exposure to crypto and other tech-focused lending. By the time it was closed by regulators, Signature was the third largest bank failure in U.S. history.The FDIC says it expects Signature Bank's failure to cost the deposit insurance fund $2.5 billion, but that figure may change as the regulator sells off assets. The deposit insurance fund is paid for by assessments on banks and taxpayers do not bear the direct cost when a bank fails.",2023/3/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840680,"Nembhard helps Creighton beat Baylor 85-76, on to Sweet 16","DENVER (AP) — The rims really aren’t bigger in Denver. It just felt that way to Ryan Nembhard.The sophomore guard had a career-high 30 points and No. 6 seed Creighton found its shooting touch to beat third-seeded Baylor 85-76 on Sunday night and earn a spot in the Sweet 16 for the second time in three seasons.With Baylor heavily focused on containing big man Ryan Kalkbrenner, Nembhard and the Bluejays went to work from outside. They shot 45.8% from 3-point range after a 3-for-20 showing in a first-round win over North Carolina State. They also went 22 of 22 from the free throw line, including 10 for 10 from Nembhard.“The rim felt a little bit bigger tonight,"" Nembhard said after a performance that included four 3-pointers. “Luckily, I made some shots.”The Bluejays (23-12) will meet 15th-seeded Princeton in Louisville, Kentucky, on Friday in the NCAA Tournament. Princeton reached the South Region semifinals with wins over Arizona and Missouri.“We definitely don’t care who we’re going against. We respect everybody,” Nembhard said. “At the end of the day, we think we’re just as good as anybody in the country.”LJ Cryer finished with 30 points for Baylor (23-11), which lost in the second round for the second consecutive year after winning the championship in 2021. Big 12 freshman of the year Keyonte George was held to seven points, well below his average of 15.6.George is projected as a potential lottery pick — should he decide to leave after this season.“Nobody likes losing, but our coaching staff is really proud of this group,"" Baylor coach Scott Drew said. “Disappointed we couldn’t keep playing, but proud of them.”Leading by double digits, the Bluejays extended the lead — and pumped up the crowd — on back-to-back 3-pointers from Francisco Farabello and Nembhard.The Bears cut it to 79-70 with around 3 minutes remaining, but turnovers kept them from getting any closer.“We weren’t able to get enough stops to pull off the game,” said Baylor senior Adam Flagler.Trey Alexander added 17 points for Creighton, with Arthur Kaluma scoring 11 and Kalkbrenner 10.Nembhard, whose brother, Andrew, plays for the Indiana Pacers, was 8 of 13 from the field. His previous high was 25 against Arkansas on Nov. 22.And to think, Creighton coach Greg McDermott wasn't even all that sure he was going to be able to recruit Nembhard to Omaha, Nebraska.McDermott figured Nembhard, a Canadian, might be headed to Florida, where Nembhard's brother played before going to Gonzaga.“I fell in love with him the first time I watched him play,” McDermott said. “His expression never changes. He has the type of demeanor that you want the rest of the team to look to because he’s never going to be rattled.”The Jays certainly march to his beat.“It’s always good to have a guy like him on the team who’s not only just a point guard, but he’s a leader and we look up to him — even though he’s shorter than all of us,” Kaluma cracked.McDermott couldn’t help but reflect on his 2014 squad that lost to Baylor 85-55 in their second game of the tournament.“Nine years ago, we lost to Baylor with a really special group,” McDermott said. “Tonight, we beat Baylor with a really special group.”ON THE MARKCreighton's perfect night at the line ties for the best free throw percentage (minimum of 15 attempts) in tournament history. It matches Fordham's mark on March 20, 1971, against South Carolina, according to research by an NCAA statistician.“We spend some time after practice shooting free throws, but there’s no secret sauce that you have,” McDermott said.BIG PICTURECreighton: Improved to 17-24 all-time in the tournament.Baylor: The Bears are 19-10 in the NCAA Tournament under coach Scott Drew.UP NEXTNot much recent between Creighton and Princeton.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840681,Pili helps Utah advance to Sweet 16 with win over Princeton,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Alissa Pili often had two or three opponents draped on her when she got the ball. No one was strong enough to stop Utah's All-American.Pili had 28 points and 10 rebounds to lead the second-seeded Utes to a 63-56 win over 10th-seeded Princeton 63-56 on Sunday night in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.“Coming into the game, the coaches told me they were going to key on me and so I just had to let the game come to me,” Pili said.But the Tigers didn’t ever let up. Near the end of the game after a hard foul, Pili squared up and stared down a defender.“Oh, it was expected. So I think just the main thing I tried to do was just keep my cool and … keep my head down and keep working,” said Pili, who wrestled and played tackle football as a youngster.Jenna Johnson added 15 points for the Utes, who made only one 3-pointer but still advanced to their first Sweet 16 since 2006.“They’re a great defensive team,” said Utah’s Kennady McQueen, who had nine points. “They made they made every possession hard.”Kaitlyn Chen scored 19 points, Grace Stone had 16 and Ellie Mitchell finished with 18 rebounds, including 10 on the offensive end, for Princeton (24-6).“We battled from minute 1 to minute 40,” Princeton coach Carla Berube said. “But the shots just didn’t fall tonight.""Down the stretch, offense came to a grinding halt. The teams combined to miss 15 consecutive field goal attempts at one point, but Utah (27-4) got to the free throw line to advance and face No. 3 seed LSU.“Hard work paid off, but we’re not done yet. I think we can make a run deeper into the tournament,” Pili said.The host Utes didn’t score a field goal in the final 6:24 but went 13-for-19 from the line in the fourth quarter to complete their season undefeated at the Huntsman Center.“It was a rockfight,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said. “We know we can score but you can’t always rely on that to win in these types of games.”After the game, Utah coach Lynne Roberts was surrounded by her team and did a short rendition of “The Griddy” to the delight of the partisan crowd of 8,663.“That’s our team in terms of keeping it light,” Roberts said. “Everybody does better when they don’t feel pressure.”Pili is known for her power but she showed her remarkable agility and marksmanship as well. After she had made a 3 in the second quarter, she drove past two defenders, took a knee to the thigh and threw in a shot while falling to the floor for a three-point play.The matchup highlighted a contrast in strengths. Utah’s No. 4-ranked offense (84.1 points per game) was pitted against Princeton’s sixth-ranked defense (52.8 ppg).The Tigers, who had won 16 in a row, forced the game to their style but just couldn’t find enough offense, shooting just 27.8%. Princeton has never advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament but lost in close games the past two seasons.“This team is really good because we do the dirty work. We do the work nobody else wants to do and I’m really proud of us for that because it always keeps us in basketball games,” Stone said.After a 2-for-14 stretch for Princeton, Chen made two jumpers in a 7-0 run to cut Utah’s lead to 44-42 late in the third quarter. In the first half, the Tigers’ swarming defense created 13 turnovers, five by Pili, to keep them within striking distance.Pili had 17 points at the break to help Utah to a 32-26 lead after Utah lost a 3-pointer that was ruled to come after the shot clock elapsed.Utah’s physicality inside was evident early as Pili and Johnson combined to go 6-for-6 in the first quarter and the Utes jumped to a 20-10 early lead. The Tigers went 5:26 without a field goal, but they relied on the defense to settle in as they have all season.“We’re always in it until that last buzzer sounds,” Mitchell said, her voice cracking.BIG PICTUREPrinceton: To win, the Tigers figured they’d need to slow the game and swarm the Utes. Princeton caused 20 turnovers but those miscues only led to 18 points on the other end.Utah: Pili and Johnson were powerhouses in the paint as Utah outscored Princeton 32-18 and that was enough to make up for the Utes’ lack of outside shooting. Utah made three fewer field goals but won on the strength of 28 of 37 from the line, while the Tigers were just 11-for-15.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/20,,World

The Rangers beat Pittsburgh 6-0 on Saturday night after also beating the Penguins on Thursday and Washington on Tuesday.The Rangers scored six times on their first eight shots, chasing Nashville starting goalie Kevin Lankinen after he gave up four goals on five shots. He was replaced by Juuse Saros.Miller became the first defenseman in franchise history with four points in a single period as the Rangers led 6-0 less than 14 minutes in. The avalanche of early goals tied the franchise record for most in the first period, most recently achieved on Dec. 15, 1999, in an 8-3 home win over Los Angeles.“That was pretty fun,'' Miller said. ”The puck was finding me.""Halak improved to 8-2-2 in his last 12 starts as the 37-year-old Slovak-born goalie secured his 53rd career shutout, third-most among active netminders behind Marc-Andre Fleury and Jonathan Quick.“It was a team effort from the drop of the puck until the end,'' Halak said. ”Last two games — yesterday and today — we did a really good job playing for 60 minutes and it paid off.""Halak, who has 294 career wins with seven NHL teams, was especially pleased with his first shutout as a Ranger. His family — including six-year-old son Nathan, who also is a goalie — were in attendance at Madison Square Garden.""It’s more special when they are in the stands,'' Halak said. “It feels great to get a win and more special to get a shutout. Our D, even though we had a big lead, they were blocking shots.”The Rangers became the sixth team in NHL history with back-to-back shutouts while scoring six or more goals. The Rangers had three-straight 6-0 shutouts from Feb. 4-10, 1973.“I thought our guys did an excellent job,'' Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said of his team's ability to stay focused with a six-goal lead after one period. ”They played the game the right way,″The Predators were coming off a deflating home overtime loss to Winnipeg on Saturday and were dealing with a raft of injuries to key players. Nashville was without captain and leading scorer Roman Josi — hurt against the Jets — plus defenseman Ryan McDonagh and top forwards Filip Forsberg and Ryan Johansen.Nashville trails the Jets by five points for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.“It's humbling to get beat 7-0,'' Predators coach John Hynes said. ”It something we can learn from and we will. Tonight wasn't good enough.""Chytil opened the scoring with his 20th goal at 2:37 — assisted by Miller and Halak — followed by Zibanejad’s team-leading 37th at 7:22. Motte scored his fifth goal 52 seconds later before Miller scored at 9:09 to make it 4-0, ending Lankinen's night.Panarin then added his 23rd goal at 10:01 — the fastest five goals to start a game in franchise history — before Miller scored again, his eighth of the season, with 6:24 remaining in the period.Panarin has points in nine of his last 11 games and leads the Rangers with 80 points overall. Zibanejad, who had a goal and two assists in Saturday’s rout of the Penguins, also assisted on Panarin’s goal and has nine points in his last four games and 28 points in his last 21 contests — including 15 goals.Kreider increased the lead to 7-0 at 9:02 of the second with his 32nd goal this season and the 261st of his career, moving the Rangers forward within one goal of Vic Hadfield for fifth-place on the Rangers' all-time list.NOTES: The Predators also scratched D Alexandre Carrier and forwards Rasmus Asplund and Juuso Parssinen. ...

I’m going to have good shooting nights, and I’m going to have not so good shooting nights, so it’s just about being aggressive and making sure that I’m trying to put us in the best position to succeed.”Jonas Valanciunas had 21 points and 11 rebounds, Trey Murphy III had 14 points and Herbert Jones scored 13 for the Pelicans, which shot 49%, including 13 of 31 on 3’s.New Orleans closed the gap to a half-game behind Utah for the final spot in the play in tournament with 11 games left.“We have to realize we got to play better,” Valanciunas said. “If we want to go to the postseason, we have to play better. Right now, it’s as simple as that. We have to win some games.”The Pelicans outscored Houston 52-34 in the paint.“We are a team that attacks the paint normally,” New Orleans coach Willie Green said. “It was more on the defensive end, not allowing them to attack the paint on us.”After blowing a 15-point fourth quarter lead on Friday night in a 114-112 loss to the Rockets, Green said experience helped prevent something similar from happening on Sunday night.“We just went through it a couple nights before, and I looked at our guys in the huddle and said ‘We have an opportunity to win the game, but we got to go do it,’” Green said. “We got to take care of the ball; we got to get good looks; we have to get stops. To their credit, they went out and did it.”Jalen Green scored 40 points, his fourth game scoring at least 40 points this season, Kevin Porter Jr. added 25 and Tari Eason had 10 points for Houston, which saw its season-high three-game winning streak snapped.“We were just seeing what was available,” Jalen Green said. “For a minute, we got stagnant and weren’t really shifting the defense over. Once we got back to that, running plays and shifting the defense, things started opening up a lot more.”The Rockets shot 41% and were 9 of 33 on 3-pointers. Houston has the worst record in the West at 18-53.New Orleans used an 18-6 spurt over the final minute of the first quarter and opening five minutes of the second quarter to open up a 51-34 lead on a 3-pointer by McCollum with 6:50 left in the first half.

LOUIS (AP) — Kasperi Kapanen, Nathan Walker and Jakub Vrana each scored to lead the St. Louis Blues to a 3-0 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday night.Rookie goalie and Winnipeg native Joel Hofer started in his first home appearance with St. Louis and stopped 33 shots in his fourth NHL start to help the Blues win for the fourth time in six games.""“There’s obviously a little more motivation there, but I though the team played really well in front of me,” Hofer said about playing the Jets. “Obviously limited them to a lot of outside chances and it was nice to get the win, especially against those guys.”He didn't get the shutout because he had to leave the ice for a skate repair in the second period. Thomas Greiss had a save while filling in.“It’s alright. I don’t really care about that,” Hofer said about the shutout. “I’m just obviously happy to be here and to get the win in front of the home crowd, it was great.” Hofer started in place of the suspended Jordan Binnington on Friday and had 33 saves in a 5-2 win against Washington — his first NHL game since Nov. 13, 2021. Hofer, called up from Springfield of the AHL under emergency conditions Thursday after Binnington was suspended, is now 3-1-0 in the NHL.“He’s not going down, but it’s great to see him play well,” Blues coach Craig Berube said. ""It’s great to see him get a shutout tonight. Good job by the team in front of him. He’s doing a good job and he’s playing well, so he knows he can do the job.”Connor Hellebuyck, starting for the second straight day, had 14 saves for the Jets, who have lost three of their last four games.“You want to win games,” Winnipeg's Nikolaj Ehlers said. ""It doesn’t mean you have to win them with six goals every night but you want to score enough to win games and we haven’t been doing that. So, we know what we need to do; it’s just a matter of going out there and doing it.”Winnipeg fell short of completing a season sweep of the Blues after having won the teams' first three meetings by a combined 13-4 margin.The Jets remain in the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference, four points ahead of Calgary.“We’re in eighth spot. You’d rather be in eighth spot than ninth,” coach Rick Bowness said. ""Now it’s up to us to stay there and hopefully push up a little higher.”From the side of the net, Kapanen redirected a pass from Nick Leddy past Hellebuyck at 4:04 of the first period, giving St. Louis a 1-0 lead. It was his fourth goal in 10 games with the Blues.Walker increased the lead to 2-0 with 9:26 left in the second. Justin Faulk skated in down the left wing when he made a backhanded pass to Walker, who one-timed the puck from the side of the net.Vrana wristed in a shot on a breakaway at 12 minutes of the third period after getting a pass from Kapanen. It was his fourth goal in four games.SERVING SUSPENSIONBinnington served the second of his two-game suspension Sunday. Binnington was suspended by the NHL’s Department of Player Safety for roughing and unsportsmanlike conduct against Minnesota forward Ryan Hartman in the second period of St. Louis' 8-5 loss on Wednesday.EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONPlay was halted at 4:55 of the second period when Hofer lost a skate blade while in net after making a save. After trying to replace it back, Hofer was forced to go back to the locker room for the repair. Greiss came in and made one save in 2:36 before Hofter returned.“I guess it fell out,” Hofer said. “I didn’t even see the play actually and how it happened.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840691,Former Taiwan president plans to visit China,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) plans to visit China for 12 days during the upcoming Tomb Sweeping Festival.Since stepping down, China has made numerous invitations to Ma. However, he has not been able to accept such offers due to an original three-year outbound travel ban that was extended for another two-years till 2019 by President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文). The COVID pandemic further delayed such a trip, per UP Media.Ma is now planning a Tomb Sweeping Day visit to China from March 27 to April 7, ostensibly to pay respects to his ancestors. He will not be going alone, leading a delegation of students from his foundation to visit historical sites and educational centers in Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha, Chongqing, Shanghai, and other cities.Ma, however, will avoid a trip to Beijing for a potential second ""Ma-Xi Meeting."" Any potential reaction to such a meeting could affect the upcoming 2024 presidential election for his Kuomintang party.The Ma Ying-jeou Foundation is expected to hold a press conference at National Taiwan University Alumni Hall at 9:00 a.m. Tuesday (March 21) to explain the itinerary for his first visit to China since he was president, per UP Media. On Sunday evening (March 19), Ma Ying-jeou Foundation Executive Director Xiao Xucen (蕭旭岑) confirmed that Ma will go to China to worship his ancestors, and will lead students from Taiwan to interact with Chinese students.After Ma stepped down as head of state, there have been multiple rumors that Ma may visit China to hold a second ""Ma-Xi Meeting."" President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) is also planning to transit through the U.S. at the end of March, where she will meet with with U.S House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California.Some believe Beijing is seeking to offset Tsai’s U.S. visit, by extending a warm welcome to Ma, who accepted the invitation under the premise of ancestor worship, according to UP Media.Ma’s trip is even worrying a few within his own KMT, as any false steps could hurt the party’s chances in the upcoming presidential election. Some within the party even believe it’s inappropriate to visit China before the election, potentially giving the U.S. the impression that the KMT is pro-China.As a result, Ma’s itinerary will be carefully planned and scrutinized, as no planned visits will include China’s top central officials such as Wang Huning (王滬寧), chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).",2023/3/20,2053,Politics
